Craven</i>, 2005 OK \r\n82, <i>supp. opinion on</i> <i>reh'g, </i>¶ 1 \r\n(internal citations omitted). We carefully consider the arguments of the \r\nCommission and find no merit warranting a grant of rehearing. The petition for \r\nrehearing of Appellee, Oklahoma Capitol Preservation Commission, is denied. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>DONE BY ORDER OF THE SUPREME COURT IN CONFERENCE THIS \r\n27th day of July 2015. </p>\r\n<p>/S/CHIEF JUSTICE</p>\r\n<p>Concur: Reif, C.J. (by separate writing), and Kauger, \r\nWatt, Winchester, Edmondson (by separate writing), Taylor (by separate writing \r\nwith whom Gurich, J. joins), and Gurich (by separate writing), J.J.</p>\r\n<p>Dissent: Combs, V.C.J. (by separate writing), and \r\nColbert, J. </p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p></p><b>\r\n</b><p>REIF, C.J., concurring specially to the denial of \r\nrehearing, </p>\r\n<p>¶1 For the most part, I concur to the denial of \r\nAppellee's petition for rehearing. Several reasons support such \r\naction.</p>\r\n<p>¶2 First, the per curiam opinion contains no \r\nmisstatement of fact or law. Furthermore, the per curiam opinion sets forth \r\nsettled law that is dispositive of the issue presented and correctly applies \r\nsuch law in deciding the issue. More particularly, the per curiam opinion \r\nproperly seeks the intent of Article 2, Section 5 in its text and the plain \r\nmeaning of its language. Because this intrinsic analysis revealed no ambiguity, \r\nresort to extrinsic aids is improper and unnecessary. </p>\r\n<p>¶3 As this Court has recently observed, \"Absent an \r\nambiguity, the intent of the framers and electorate is settled by the language \r\nof the provision itself and courts are not at liberty to search for its meaning \r\nbeyond the provision.\" <i>Fent v. Fallin,</i> 2014 OK \r\n105, ¶ 10, 345 P.3d 1113, 1116. The reason \r\nfor this rule is simple: \"Constitutional provisions are not made for parsing by \r\nlawyers, but for the instruction of the people and the representatives of \r\ngovernment, so that they may read and understand their rights and duties.\" \r\n<i>Id.</i>, ¶ 12, 345 P.3d at 1117.</p>\r\n<p>¶4 Interestingly, the Legislature has likewise shown \r\nthat it considers the language in Article 2, Section 5, to provide clear and \r\nunambiguous instruction for public officials. In 1981, the Legislature enacted \r\n53 \r\nO.S. § 20.10, now 53 O.S.2011, § \r\n1.18. This statute governs the expenditure of \r\nfunds by the Oklahoma Historical Society and provides, in pertinent part, that \r\n\"Funds shall not be applied, donated or used directly or indirectly for the use, \r\nbenefit or support of any sect, church, denomination or system of religion, or \r\nfor the use, benefit or support of any priest, preacher, minister, or other \r\nreligious teacher or dignitary, or sectarian institution as such.\" This \r\nstatutory language is virtually identical to the text of Article 2, Section 5. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>¶5 Finally, the narrow scope of the per curiam \r\nopinion is also consistent with the principle of judicial restraint. This \r\nprinciple dictates that if resolution of an issue effectively disposes of a \r\ncase, a court should resolve the case on that basis without reaching any other \r\nissues that might be presented. <i>Manning v. Upjohn Co.</i>, 862 F.2d 545, 547 \r\n(5th Cir. 1984). </p>\r\n<p>¶6 Even though these considerations support the \r\ndenial of rehearing, I would grant rehearing for the limited purpose of \r\naddressing the case of <i>Meyer v. Oklahoma City</i>, 1972 OK 46, 496 P.2d \r\n789. Although clearly distinguishable from \r\nthe case at hand, the <i>Meyer</i> case nonetheless provides helpful guidance in \r\ndeciding whether a particular use of public property is for the benefit of a \r\nsystem of religion. </p>\r\n<p>¶7 In <i>Meyer</i>, the taxpayer-plaintiff sought \r\nremoval of a 50' Latin Cross from City property located at the Oklahoma City \r\nFair Grounds. This Court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the taxpayer's \r\npetition, observing: \"The alleged commercial setting in which the cross now \r\nstands . . . obscures whatever suggestions may emanate from its silent form \r\n[and] vitiate[s] any use, benefit or support for any sect, church, denomination, \r\nsystem of religion or sectarian institution as such.\"<i> Id.</i>, ¶ 11, 496 P.2d \r\nat 792-3.</p>\r\n<p>¶8 This conclusion was grounded on two factors. \r\nFirst, this Court noted that \"The cross is in a distinctly secular environment \r\nin the midst of persons in pursuit of distinctly secular entertainment.\" \r\n<i>Id.</i>, 496 P.2d at 792. Secondly, this Court stressed that the cross did \r\nnot \"display, articulate or portray . . . any ideas that are alleged to pertain \r\nto any of the sectarian institutions or systems named in Article 2, § 5.\" \r\n<i>Id.</i></p>\r\n<p>¶9 The circumstances of the case at hand fail this \r\ntest. First, the State Capitol, unlike the Oklahoma City Fair Grounds,<b> </b>is \r\nnot a \"commercial setting\" nor \"a distinctly secular environment\" where persons \r\nare seeking \"distinctively secular entertainment.\" The State Capitol is the Seat \r\nof State Government where the business of the people is debated and transacted. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>¶10 Secondly, the Ten Commandments monument at issue \r\nin this case is nothing like the plain simple cross whose \"symbolic message\" was \r\nsaid to be \"evanescent\" or fleeting within the \"commercial setting\" of the fair \r\ngrounds. The Ten Commandments monument in this case <b>does explicitly</b> \r\n\"display\" and \"articulate\" ideas that directly pertain to the Judeo-Christian \r\nsystem of religion.</p>\r\n<p>¶11 The text of the Ten Commandments displayed on the \r\nmonument is an edited version of the text of the Ten Commandments appearing in \r\nthe King James Version of the Bible. Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21 \r\n(Authorized King James Version, Thomas Nelson Inc., 1999). While four of the \r\ncommandments displayed on the monument do have counterparts in Oklahoma \r\nstatutory law (proscriptions against killing, stealing, adultery and bearing \r\nfalse witness), these commandments are subsumed in a distinctly religious \r\ncontext that obscures whatever historical suggestions may emanate from them. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>¶12 The text of the Ten Commandments displayed \r\non the monument begins with the declaration \"I AM the LORD thy GOD.\" This \r\ndeclaration is followed by four directions for the worship of God. In addition, \r\nthe \"historical\" commandments are immediately preceded by a divine promise of \r\nlong life for honoring one's parents. They are immediately followed by divinely \r\nordained proscriptions against coveting things belonging to one's neighbor; a \r\nmatter of conscience, not general social order. This dominance of the explicit \r\nreligious message renders the monument \"operative in an effective way\" for the \r\nbenefit of the of the Judeo-Christian system of religion.<i> Meyer</i>, ¶ 11, \r\n496 P.2d at 792. As such, the monument's display on public property is properly \r\nenjoined. <i>Id.</i></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p></p><b>\r\n</b><p>Edmondson, J., Concurring in denial of \r\nrehearing.</p>\r\n<p>¶1 The Attorney General's historical argument is \r\nincorrect. The origin of Okla. Const. Art. 2 § 5 is with Thomas Jefferson and \r\nthe example set by the People of Virginia and not the 1876 Blaine Amendment. See \r\n<i>Connell v. Gray</i>, 1912 OK 607, 127 P. \r\n417, 420, where the Court discussed the \r\nconnection between Art. 2 § 5 and a 1786 Virginia statute. See also R. L. \r\nWilliams, <i>The Constitution of Oklahoma and Enabling Act: Annotated with \r\nReferences to the Constitution, Statutes and Decisions</i>, 1941, 2d ed., Art. 2 \r\n§ 5, citing in the annotation the opinion <i>Pfeiffer v. Board of Education of \r\nthe City of Detroit</i>, 118 Mich. 560, 77 N. W. 250, 251-252 (1898) and its \r\nexplanation of an 1835 provision of that state's constitution which was in turn \r\nbased upon the Virginia Constitution of 1830.</p>\r\n<p>¶2 Further, unlike the one at hand a monument on \r\npublic property communicating religious speech must also be capable of being \r\nreasonably construed to communicate a secular or nonreligious meaning as \r\ndetermined by its language and the setting it is placed. <i>Compare</i> \r\n<i>McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union of Ky.</i>, 545 U.S. 844, 125 S.Ct. 2722, 162 L.Ed.2d 729 (2005) (under contextual \r\nfacts, Ten Commandments monument must be removed) with <i>Van Orden v. \r\nPerry</i>, 545 U.S. \r\n677, 125 S.Ct. 2854, 162 L.Ed.2d 607 \r\n(2005) (under contextual facts, the Ten Commandments monument may stay). \r\n<i>Cf</i>. <i>Meyer v. City of Oklahoma City</i>, 1972 OK 45, \r\n496 P.2d 789, 792 (no violation, considering the \"silent\" and \"evanescent\" \r\n(ephemeral, vanishing, transitory) nature of the fairgrounds cross). </p>\r\n<p>¶3 Federal law is similar by allowing monuments with \r\nreligious speech when the monument also portrays a secular meaning. The United \r\nStates Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has recognized that \"The Ten \r\nCommandments have a secular significance that government may acknowledge . . . \r\n[and] we are unwilling to presume that the text of the Ten Commandments here \r\ncould not be constitutionally integrated into a governmental display that \r\nhighlights its secular significance.\" <i>Green v. Haskell County Bard of \r\nCommissioners</i>, 568 F.3d 784, 798 (10th Cir. 2009), <i>cert. denied sub \r\nnom</i>, <i>Haskell County Bd. of Com'rs v. Green</i>, \r\n559 U.S. \r\n970, 130 S.Ct. 1687, \r\n176 L.Ed.2d 180 (2010).</p>\r\n<p>¶4 We have no embracing historical and secular context here. \r\nThis isolated monument stating religious principles with religious symbols, \r\nwithout any other statements of secular historical relevance, and no proximate \r\npresentation with a common secular theme, compels my conclusion that it violates \r\nthe Oklahoma Constitution, Article 2 § 5.</p>\r\n<p>¶5 I concur in the denial of the petition for \r\nrehearing.</p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p></p><b>\r\n</b><p>Taylor, J., <b>with whom Gurich, \r\nJ. joins,</b> concurring in the denial of the petition for rehearing:</p>\r\n<p>¶1 I concur in the Court's order denying rehearing. I write \r\nseparately to address issues raised in the Oklahoma Capitol Preservation \r\nCommission's petition for rehearing, filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General, and \r\nissues which were not directly confronted in this Court's opinion. The \r\nCommission urges that (1) this Court's jurisprudence permits items which benefit \r\na system of religion to be placed on state property, (2) an analysis of the U.S. \r\nConstitution's Establishment Clause is relevant here and should be considered in \r\nthis case, and (3) the Ten Commandments have historical, legal, and secular \r\nsignificance which override any religious benefit. Finally, the Commission has \r\nconcern about the effect of this Court's decision on artworks housed in the \r\nState Capitol and on its grounds. I find nothing in the Commission's petition \r\nthat convinces me that this Court should grant rehearing.</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">I. Oklahoma's Jurisprudence</p>\r\n<p>¶2 As to the first of the Commission's arguments, this \r\nCourt's jurisprudence is based first and foremost on the United States and \r\nOklahoma constitutions. Okla. Const. art. I, § 1. The objective of construing \r\nthe Oklahoma Constitution is to give effect to the framers' intent, as well as \r\nthe people adopting it. <i>Shaw v. Grumbine</i>, 1929 OK 116, ¶ 30, \r\n278 P. 311, 315 (quoting <i>Lake Cnty. v. Rollins</i>, \r\n130 U.S. 662 (1889)). When a challenge is limited to the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution, we look first to its language, which if unambiguous, binds this \r\nCourt; and we \"are not at liberty to search for its meaning beyond the \r\ninstrument.\"<i> Id.</i> ¶ 0, 278 P. at \r\n311 (Syllabus by the Court No. 5); \r\n<i>Gurney v. Ferguson</i>, 1941 OK 397, ¶ 12, \r\n122 P.2d 1002, 1004 (quoting <i>Judd v. Bd. of Educ.</i>, 15 N.E.2d 576, 584 (N.Y. \r\n1938) (We cannot \"'circumvent [the constitution] because of private notions of \r\njustice or because of personal inclinations.'\")).<sup>1</sup></p>\r\n<p>¶3 Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution, titled \"Public money \r\nor property-Use for sectarian purposes,\" states:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, or \r\nused, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, \r\nchurch, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support \r\nof any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary, or \r\nsectarian institution as such.</p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>Because Article II, Section 5 is unambiguous as discussed in this Court's \r\nopinion, it was not error for this Court to rely solely on the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution as the basis for its decision. This provision unequivocally bars \r\nthe state from allowing its property to be used for a religious benefit. Okla. \r\nConst. art. II, § 5. Article II, Section 5 is a clear limitation on state \r\ngovernment spending and use of public property. It is a limitation on the \r\nstate's reach into its citizens' private lives.</p>\r\n<p>¶4 Although we need not search for extraneous support for our construction of \r\nArticle II, Section 5's meaning, it is reassuring that this Court's construction \r\nis consistent with the framers' intent. Albert H. Ellis, the Second Vice \r\nPresident of the Constitutional Convention, explained that Article II, Section 5 \r\nwas intended to be \"one of the safest of our safeguards.\" Albert H. Ellis, <i>A \r\nHistory of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Oklahoma</i> 134 \r\n(1923). Mr. Ellis clarified that the Convention wrote Article II, Section 5 \r\n\"knowing the history of the union of Church and State in Europe and in New \r\nEngland in Colonial days,\" and utilized the lessons learned in those situations. \r\n<i>Id</i>. </p>\r\n<p>¶5 Mr. Ellis further explained that Article II, Section 5 </p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>not only guards the citizens right to be free from taxation for the support \r\nof the church, but protects the rights of all denominations, however few the \r\nnumber of their respective adherents, by with-holding any incentive that might \r\nprompt any ecclesiastical body to participate in political struggles and by \r\nreason of their numbers exert an undue influence and become beneficiaries at the \r\nexpense of the public and a menace to weaker denominations and ultimately \r\ndestructive of rel[i]gious liberty.</p></dir></dir><i>\r\n</i><p>Id. It is also important to note that in his very complete discussion of \r\nArticle II, Section 5, Mr. Ellis never mentions the Blaine Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>¶6 The Oklahoma Constitutional Convention members started their proceedings \r\nwith a prayer and the invocation of God's guidance and prefaced the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution by invoking God's guidance, all this showing that they were \r\nreligious men who believed in God. Okla. Const. pmbl. However, they were also \r\nmen who advocated for the toleration of all religious beliefs and complete \r\nseparation of church and state by going further than the federal constitution. \r\nClosely following the preamble is Article I, Section 2 of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution, which is entitled \"Religious liberty-Polygamous or plural \r\nmarriages.\" Section 2 secures \"[p]erfect toleration of religious sentiment\" and \r\nprovides \"no inhabitant of the State shall ever be molested in person or \r\nproperty on account of his or her mode of religious worship . . . .\" Okla. \r\nConst. Art. I, § 2. Then only three sections later, the Constitutional \r\nConvention provided for public schools \"free from sectarian control.\" Okla. \r\nConst. art. I, § 5. Seven sections later, they prohibited the use of state \r\nproperty, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of religious \r\ngroup. Okla. Const. art. II, § 5. While the constitutional framers may have been \r\nmen of faith, they recognized the necessity of a complete separation of church \r\nand state and sought to prevent the ills that would befall a state if they \r\nfailed to provide for this complete separation in the Oklahoma Constitution.</p><sup>2</sup>\r\n<p>¶7 Applying Article II, Section 5, there is no question that the monument is \r\non state property. The Appellee set it on the plaza directly north of the \r\nOklahoma Capitol, which is part of the state capitol complex. The monument \r\nproclaims: \" I AM the LORD thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" \r\n<i>See </i>Appendix. The first part of the Ten Commandments concerns the \r\nreligious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding graven \r\nimages, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.\" \r\n<i>Stone v. Graham</i>, </p>449 U.S. 39, 41 (1980). Many Christians and Jews believe these to be the direct \r\nwords of God. <i>ACLU of Ky. v. McCreary Cnty.</i>,<i> </i>96 F.SupP.2d 679, 686 \r\n(E.D. Ky. 2000). The Ten Commandments are inseparable from religion, which has \r\nalways been their primary purpose. The placement of the Ten Commandments \r\nmonument on state property benefits the Judeo-Christian system of religion. The \r\nmonument's placement on state property, proclaiming bedrock principles of the \r\nJudeo-Christian religious system, supports and benefits a system of religion in \r\nviolation of Article II, Section 5; it must be removed. \r\n<p>¶8 The Commission's petition for rehearing, filed on behalf of the defendant, \r\nargues that this Court ignored the teachings of <i>Meyer v. Oklahoma City</i>, \r\n</p>1972 OK 45, 496 P.2d 789; <i>Town of Pryor v. Williamson</i>, 1959 OK 207, 347 P.2d 204; <i>Murrow Indian Orphans Home v. \r\nChilders</i>, 1946 OK 187, 171 P.2d 600; and<i> Connell v. Gray</i>, 1912 OK 607, 127 P. 417. However, none of these cases change \r\nArticle II, Section 5's plain language or our construction of it. \r\n<p>¶9 This Court first addressed Section 5 in <i>Connell v. Gray</i>, \r\n</p>1912 OK 607, 127 P. 417. A college student was denied admission into a public university because \r\nshe refused to pay a five-dollar term fee, half of which was put in trust to \r\ncover broken equipment and the other half going to, among other things, support \r\nof student-sectarian organizations like the Young Men's Christian Association \r\n(YMCA) and the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). <i>Id.</i> ¶ 1, \r\n127 P. at \r\n417. The Court \r\nheld that it is impermissible for the legislature or a state-run organization to \r\nfund or require payment for the YMCA and the YWCA because they promulgate \r\nsectarian principles. <i>Id.</i> Just as Article II, Section 5 bans the state \r\nfrom forcing its citizens to fund a religious organization, it bars the state \r\nfrom subjecting its citizens to an assault of religion in which they do not \r\nadhere.\r\n<p>¶10 Although the Commission ignores this Court's decision in <i>Gurney v. \r\nFurguson</i>, </p>1941 OK 397, 122 P.2d 1002, the next in this line of cases, any survey of our jurisprudence on the \r\nissue before us requires its consideration. The Court ruled legislation \r\nunconstitutional which compelled school district officials to use public school \r\nbuses to pick up and transport students who attended private or parochial \r\nschools. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 16, 122 P.2d at 1005. The Court concluded that the legislation authorized the use of public \r\nschool funds to support sectarian schools. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 9, 122 P.2d at 1004. The \r\nCourt ruled that any \"legislative enactment which has the effect of authorizing \r\nor requiring the use of public property or the expenditure of public school \r\nfunds in transporting pupils of a sectarian school to and from such school is \r\nviolative of section 5, article 2 of the Constitution of Oklahoma.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ \r\n0, 122 P.2d at \r\n1002 (Syllabus by \r\nthe Court No. 3). \r\n<p>¶11 In <i>Murrow Indian Orphans Home v. Childers</i>, </p>1946 OK 187, 171 P.2d 600, this Court again analyzed Article \r\nII, Section 5. A Baptist-affiliated home for Native American orphans contracted \r\nwith the state to provide care to children in exchange for payment. <i>Id.</i> ¶ \r\n2, 171 P.2d at 601. The Court analyzed this issue by contrasting the public \r\nmoney paid to the organization affiliated with a sectarian institution against \r\nthe consideration the state received by the organization housing Native American \r\norphans. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 5, 171 P.2d at 603. The Court ruled that the state \r\nreceived sufficient consideration in exchange for the public money given to the \r\norganization and that the state was not using public money \"for the use, \r\nbenefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, or system of religion.\" \r\n<i>Id.</i> ¶ 10, 171 P.2d at 603. \r\n<p>¶12 <i>Childers</i> has no application here. First, it is in a line of cases \r\ndealing with the expenditure of money to a sectarian organization. Second, there \r\nis not even a hint in this case that Oklahoma received any benefit for allowing \r\nthe use of state property for this monument.</p>\r\n<p>¶13 The Commission's reliance on <i>State ex rel. Town of Pryor v. \r\nWilliamson</i>, </p>1959 OK 207, 347 P.2d 204, is misplaced. This Court was confronted with the issue of whether \r\nArticle II, Section 5 barred the use of public funds for the construction of a \r\nnon-sectarian, non-denominational chapel built at a state-owned orphans home. As \r\nthe plaintiffs point out in their response to the petition to rehearing, \r\n<i>Pryor</i> is distinguishable because the chapel was eliminating a barrier to \r\nthe exercise of religion.\r\n<p>¶14 In <i>Meyer v. Oklahoma City</i>, </p>1972 OK 45, 496 P.2d 789, a taxpayer challenged a fifty-foot \r\nhigh Latin cross, which had been erected at the state fairgrounds on public \r\nproperty but paid for with private money. The City of Oklahoma City paid to \r\nlandscape the property and for lighting the cross. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 1, 496 P.2d at \r\n790. The Court noted that Article II, Section 5 was \"designed to prevent \r\nsectarian bodies from making raids upon the public treasury or from subjecting \r\npublic property to unauthorized sectarian uses.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 6, 496 P.2d at \r\n791. Central to the Court's analysis was the location of the cross, public \r\nproperty in a commercial setting--a \"distinctly secular environment in the midst \r\nof persons in pursuit of distinctly secular entertainment.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 11, 496 \r\nP.2d at 792. Improperly applying the federal Establishment Clause's analysis to \r\nArticle II, Section 5,<b> </b>and presuming the cross to be secular, the Court \r\nexamined the cross in light of the location, ruling that it \"cannot be said to \r\ndisplay, articulate or portray, except in a most evanescent form, any ideas that \r\nare alleged to pertain to any of the sectarian institutions or systems named in \r\nArt. 2, § 5.\" <i>Id.</i> \r\n<p>¶15 I find the <i>Meyer</i> opinion to be lacking in value. First, it relied \r\nin part on <i>Williamson</i>, </p>1959 OK 207, 347 P.2d 204, which is discredited. Second, it is \r\nabsent of analysis on and misstates the actual nature of the cross itself. \r\n<i>Id.</i> Third, by improperly applying the federal analysis to the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution, it created an unprecedented distinction in Article II, Section 5 \r\nby examining the nature of the public property (commercial, residential, or \r\ngovernmental). This distinction is nonexistent in and repugnant to the plain \r\nlanguage of the constitutional provision. <i>See id.</i> <i>Meyer </i>is an \r\nanomaly in our jurisprudence, and no other case adopts the distinction of the \r\nproperty's nature. This Court should place no weight on its holding or analysis, \r\nand I would explicitly overrule it.<sup>3</sup>\r\n<p>¶16 None of the cases cited by the Commission or other cases where this Court \r\nhas undertaken an analysis under Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution changes this Court's construction of the provision or holding that \r\nthe Ten Commandments Monument on the state capitol complex violates Article II, \r\nSection 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution.</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">Blaine Amendments</p>\r\n<p>¶17 Any reliance on Article II, Section 5 as a Blaine Amendment is misplaced. \r\nIt is apparent from a comparison of the Oklahoma Constitution and the Blaine \r\nAmendment that Article II, Section 5 is not taken from the Blaine Amendment. The \r\nBlaine Amendment was proposed by Congressman James Blaine as an amendment to the \r\nfederal constitution in the late 1870's in an attempt to boost his bid for the \r\npresidency. Steven K. Green, <i>The Blaine Amendment Reconsidered</i>, 36 Am. J. \r\nLegal Hist. 38, 38 (1992) [hereinafter <i>The Blaine Amendment</i>]. At the time \r\nthe Catholics wanted funding for their schools and, when denied, sought to ban \r\nthe practice of daily readings of the protestant King James Verison of the Bible \r\nin schools. <i>Id.</i> at 41, 44.</p>\r\n<p>¶18 The Blaine Amendment provides:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>1. No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or \r\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no religious test shall ever be \r\nrequired as qualification to any office or public trust under any State. No \r\npublic property and no public revenue of, nor any loan of credit by or under the \r\nauthority of, the United States, or any State, Territory, District, or municipal \r\ncorporation, shall be appropriated to or made or used for the support of any \r\nschool, educational or other institution under the control of any religious or \r\nanti-religious sect, organization, or denomination, or wherein the particular \r\ncreed or tenets of any religious or anti-religious sect, organization, or \r\ndenomination, shall be taught. And no such particular creed or tenets shall be \r\nread or taught in any school or institution supported in whole or in part by \r\nsuch revenue or loan of credit; and no such appropriation or loan of credit \r\nshall be made to any religious or anti-religious sect, organization, or \r\ndenomination, or to promote its interests or tenets. This article shall not be \r\nconstrued to prohibit the reading of the Bible in any school or institution; and \r\nit shall not have the effect to impair rights of property already vested. </p>\r\n<p>Sec. 2. Congress shall have power, by appropriate legislation, to provide for \r\nthe prevention and punishment of violations of this article. </p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>4 Cong. Rec. 5453 (1876).</p>\r\n<p>¶19 The first sentence of the Blaine Amendment imposed the Establishment \r\nClause's restrictions on states, as it was believed to only apply to the federal \r\ngovernment at the time. <i>The Blaine Amendment</i>, at 50-51. Oklahoma's \r\nestablishment clause restriction is found at Article I, Section 2 of the \r\nOklahoma Constitution. </p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>Perfect toleration of religious sentiment shall be secured, and no inhabitant \r\nof the State shall ever be molested in person or property on account of his or \r\nher mode of religious worship; and no religious test shall be required for the \r\nexercise of civil or political rights. . . .</p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>Okla. Const. art. I, § 2.</p><sup>4</sup> Aside from imposing the federal Establishment Clause's restriction on \r\nstates, the Blaine Amendment deals only with appropriations to benefit sectarian \r\neducational institutions. Oklahoma's provision dealing with appropriations for \r\nthe benefit of sectarian schools is found at Article I, Section 5, which \r\nprovides:\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>Provisions shall be made for the establishment and maintenance of a system of \r\npublic schools, which shall be open to all the children of the state and free \r\nfrom sectarian control . . . .</p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>Unlike Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution, the Blaine \r\nAmendment does not, except for educational institutions, address the use of \r\nstate property for the direct or indirect benefit of a religion or system of \r\nreligion. Because the Blaine Amendment does not contain a general prohibition on \r\nthe use of state property to benefit religion, Article II, Section 5 of the \r\nOklahoma Constitution cannot be seen as a Blaine Amendment. </p>\r\n<p>¶20 Article II, Section 5 makes no mention of schools, the Catholic Church, \r\nor the Blaine Amendment. Article II, Section 5 is a very simple, \r\nstraight-forward statement of our founders that no public money or public \r\nproperty shall be used to support religious activity. Article II, Section 5's \r\nsimple, very clear statement applies to everyone's religion equally. Our \r\nfounders considered it good public policy.</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">II. Federal Establishment Clause</p>\r\n<p>¶21 Although the issues are limited to the Oklahoma Constitution, I address \r\nthe federal Establishment Clause only because the Commission argues that it is \r\nappropriate. Oklahoma's establishment clause compared with the federal \r\nEstablishment Clause is far more specific in its limitations on state action. \r\nThe federal Establishment Clause provides, in part: \"Congress shall make no law \r\nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise \r\nthereof . . . .\" U.S. Const. amend. I. It is evident from the difference in \r\nlanguage used in Article II, Section 5 of Oklahoma Constitution and the federal \r\nEstablishment Clause that they require different analyses.</p>\r\n<p>¶22 While a violation of Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution \r\nmay also violate the federal Establishment Clause, a state can always restrict \r\nits government's powers beyond the limits imposed on state action by the federal \r\nconstitution. <i>Alva State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Dayton</i>, </p>1988 OK 44, ¶ 7, 755 P.2d 635, 638; <i>cf. Kelo v. City of New \r\nLondon</i>, 545 \r\nU.S. 469, 489 \r\n(2005) (\"We emphasize that nothing in our opinion precludes any State from \r\nplacing further restrictions on its exercise of the takings power.\"). The \r\nCommission fails to explain and fails to support its position with any authority \r\nto the contrary.\r\n<p>¶23 Interestingly, and wrongly in my opinion, the defendant and the \r\nLegislature heavily relied on <i>Van Orden v. Perry</i>, </p>545 U.S. 677 (2005), for the constitutionality of \r\nand framework for erecting the monument in the present case. On June 27, 2005, \r\nthe United States Supreme Court decided <i>Van Orden</i>, a plurality opinion,<sup>5</sup> and <i>McCreary County, Kentucky v. American \r\nCivil Liberties Union of Kentucky</i>, 545 U.S. 844 (2005), in which five Justices concurred in the \r\nSupreme Court's opinion. In my opinion, <i>McCreary</i> is analogous to the \r\npresent case, whereas <i>Van Orden</i> is not. These two United States Supreme \r\nCourt cases, like the case presently before us, involve placement of the Ten \r\nCommandments on government property.\r\n<p>¶24 There are several similarities between the monument on the Oklahoma state \r\ncapitol complex and the Ten Commandments display in <i>McCreary</i>. Both \r\noriginally stood segregated from any other historically significant monuments or \r\ndisplays. Both displays were initiated by the governing legislative body with a \r\nstated purpose of the display being of historical value but lacking any context \r\nto indicate an object beyond the religious nature of the text. Both were \r\ndisplayed only shortly before the legal attack seeking their removal and neither \r\nwere long-installed displays. The monument on the Oklahoma state capitol complex \r\nis more religious in nature than the Ten Commandments display in <i>McCreary \r\n</i>because the Oklahoma monument has the additional language, \"I AM the LORD \r\nthy God,\" which was not present in<i> McCreary</i>. </p>545 U.S. at 852, 855, 869. In contrast, the monument \r\nupheld as constitutional in <i>Van Orden</i> was in place forty years before it \r\nwas legally challenged.\r\n<p>¶25 Concurring in judgment, Justice Breyer cast the deciding vote in <i>Van \r\nOrden</i>. While the deciding factor for the four concurring Justices was the \r\nmonument's purpose, the deciding factor for Justice Breyer was the length of \r\ntime the Texas monument had been in place before being challenged. Justice \r\nBreyer found <i>Van Orden</i> to be a borderline case. My reading of Justice \r\nBreyer's opinion concurring in result leads me to the conclusion that had the \r\nlongevity factor been absent, as it is here and in <i>McCreary</i>, the Texas \r\nmonument would not have passed constitutional scrutiny under the Establishment \r\nClause. Further, while the Texas monument was identical in wording to the \r\nmonument here, the less sectarian language on the Kentucky display that was \r\nunconstitutional shows that wording alone is not the determining factor. </p>\r\n<p>¶26 If a federal analysis is needed in the future, this case is without \r\nquestion much more analogous to <i>McCreary</i> than <i>Van Orden</i>. Under a \r\nproper federal analysis, this monument would likely be held unconstitutional \r\nunder the First Amendment.</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">III. Ten Commandments' Historical Significance </p>\r\n<p>¶27 While agreeing that the Ten Commandments has historical significance, it \r\nis above all a religious symbol, and there is no basis to determine that the \r\nmonument is primarily historical. Article II, Section 5 does not provide an \r\nexception for a religious monument that may be of some historical value. Article \r\nII, Section 5 is clear; legislative intent, the nature of the placement of a \r\nreligious monument, its historical value, and whether a reasonable person would \r\nbe offended are irrelevant; and any reliance on these factors in applying \r\nArticle II, Section 5 is misplaced. The only question here is whether the \r\nmonument benefits a system of religion. The Ten Commandments is an iconic symbol \r\nof the Christian religion and is inherently religious. Further, with the initial \r\ninscription being \"I AM the LORD thy God,\" the monument needs no external \r\nreferences to know that it is primarily and foremostly religious. It is honored \r\nin the Judeo-Christian system of religion for its religious significance.</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>Twenty-five years ago in a case prompted by posting the Ten Commandments in \r\nKentucky's public schools, this Court recognized that the Commandments \"are \r\nundeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths\" and held that their \r\ndisplay in public classrooms violated the First Amendment's bar against \r\nestablishment of religion. <i>Stone</i> found a predominantly religious purpose \r\nin the government's posting of the Commandments, given their prominence as \"'an \r\ninstrument of religion . . . .'\"</p></dir></dir><i>\r\n</i><p>McCreary, </p>545 U.S. at 859 (internal citations omitted). Simply, the monument's placement on state \r\nproperty supports and benefits a system of religion in violation of Article II, \r\nSection 5.\r\n<p>¶28 Nonetheless, I would note that the historical value of the Ten \r\nCommandments is a recognition of the role they played in religion.</p><sup>6</sup> The Ten Commandments are an iconic historic \r\nreligious text from the Old Testament. However, the Ten Commandments are not \r\nmentioned in the Federalist Papers, the Declaration of Independence, the United \r\nStates Constitution, or the Bill of Rights. Paul Finkelman, <i>Ten Commandments \r\nMonuments and the First Amendment</i>, 22 Okla. Bar J. 1749 (Aug. 13, 2005),<i> \r\navailable at</i> \r\nhttp://www.okbar.org/members/BarJournal/archive2005/Augarchive05/obj7622ten.aspx. \r\nThere was no mention of the Ten Commandments in the debates at 1787 Philadelphia \r\nConstitutional Convention. <i>Id.</i> The United States Supreme Court has never \r\ncited the Ten Commandments as a source of law. <i>Id.</i> One cannot ignore the \r\nparamount religious nature of the Ten Commandments.<b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\r\n<p>¶29 The plaintiffs brought their challenge to the Ten Commandments monument's \r\nplacement on state property and the Capitol Preservation Commission's actions \r\nunder Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution. The monument is an \r\nicon of the Judeo-Christian system of religion and is now situated on state \r\nproperty. Its placement on state property benefits the Judeo-Christian system of \r\nreligion in violation of Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution. The \r\nquestions of whether artworks housed in the State Capitol or other alarmist \r\nextraneous issues raised violate Article II, Section 5 are not before this \r\nCourt. Article II, Section 5 applies to all religions equally by preventing the \r\nuse of public funds or property for any religious benefit. A conservative, \r\nstrict construction of the law leads to the conclusion that the Ten Commandments \r\nmonument's location on state property is a clear violation of a straightforward, \r\nunambigious provision of the Oklahoma Constitution. </p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">APPENDIX</p>\r\n<p><br><br></p>\r\n<p>Ten Commandments Monuments on the North Plaza of the Oklahoma State Capitol. \r\n</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">FOOTNOTES</p>\r\n<p><sup>1</sup> This axiom was expressed by Justice Scalia when he stated: \r\n\"Words have meaning.

In his Petition for Rehearing, the Attorney General reargues issues \r\npreviously presented and already <i>fully considered by this Court</i>. No \r\ngrounds exist for rehearing this case. <u>See</u> <u>Tomahawk Res., Inc. v. \r\nCraven</u>, 2005 OK 82, ¶ 1, 130 P.3d 222, 225-26 (Supp. Op. on Rhg.). </p>\r\n<p>¶2 Despite the fact that this Court decided the case solely on the basis of \r\nArt. II, § 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution,<sup>1</sup> on rehearing, the Attorney General continues to rely on <u>Van Orden v. \r\nPerry</u>, 545 \r\nU.S. 677 (2005), \r\narguing that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a nearly \r\nidentical Ten Commandments monument at the Texas State Capitol under the \r\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.<sup>2</sup> While the words and symbols on the monument at \r\nthe Oklahoma State Capitol are the same as the Texas monument, the similarities \r\nbetween the two cases stop there. The Attorney General fails to mention that the \r\nTen Commandments monument at the Texas State Capitol has been in place since \r\n1961 and was donated to the state as \"one of over a hundred largely identical \r\nmonoliths, and of over a thousand paper replicas, distributed to state and local \r\ngovernments throughout the Nation over the course of several decades\" by the \r\nFraternal Order of Eagles.<sup>3</sup> Additionally, the Ten Commandments monument at the Texas State Capitol \r\n\"sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers . . . \r\n[in a] setting [that] does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other \r\nreligious activity.\"<sup>4</sup> In contrast, the Ten Commandments monument at the Oklahoma State Capitol \r\n<u>was not</u> erected as part of the Fraternal Order of Eagles program of the \r\n1950s and 1960s, but was installed in <u>November of 2012</u> as a result of the \r\npassage of the Ten Commandments Monument Display Act by the Oklahoma Legislature \r\nand subsequent donations by private parties. The monument at the Oklahoma State \r\nCapitol sits alone on the north side of the Capitol, a location specifically \r\nselected as a \"serene, reflective setting\" and \"one which supports the \r\nreflective purpose for the individual\" in relation to the monument.<sup>5</sup> The monument at the Texas State Capitol went \r\nunchallenged for more than forty years; the monument at the Oklahoma State \r\nCapitol was challenged less than a year after it was installed. </p>\r\n<p>¶3 And although the Attorney General asks us to rely on the <u>Van Orden</u> \r\ncase, he does not mention <u>McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union \r\nof Kentucky</u>, 545 U.S. 844 (2005), which was decided the same day as <u>Van Orden</u>, wherein the \r\nU.S. Supreme Court struck down a Ten Commandments display at a Kentucky \r\ncourthouse.<sup>6</sup> In <u>McCreary</u>, the Ten \r\nCommandments display at the Kentucky courthouse was first installed in the \r\nsummer of 1999 and was challenged almost immediately in November of 1999. \r\nDistinguishing the Texas case from the Kentucky case, Justice Breyer wrote: </p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>This case also differs from <i>McCreary County</i>, <b>where the short (and \r\nstormy) history of the courthouse Commandments' displays demonstrates the \r\nsubstantially religious objectives of those who mounted them</b>, and the effect \r\nof this readily apparent objective upon those who view them. That history there \r\nindicates a governmental effort substantially to promote religion, not simply an \r\neffort primarily to reflect, historically, the secular impact of a religiously \r\ninspired document. And, in today's world, in a Nation of so many different \r\nreligious and comparable nonreligious fundamental beliefs, <b>a more \r\ncontemporary state effort to focus attention upon a religious text is certainly \r\nlikely to prove divisive in a way that this longstanding, pre-existing monument \r\n[in Texas] has not.</b><sup>7</sup> </p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>The same can be said in the case before us--almost immediately after the \r\nmonument's installation at the Oklahoma State Capitol, the storm began. Not only \r\nwas a lawsuit filed within months of the installation of the monument, but the \r\nOklahoma Capitol Preservation Commission was forced to put a moratorium on \r\nmonument requests because numerous groups either applied to have their own \r\nsymbols erected or threatened litigation.<sup>8</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶4 Whether or not the Ten Commandments monument at the Oklahoma State Capitol \r\npasses constitutional muster under the Establishment Clause of the First \r\nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution is <u>not</u> before this Court. But a host \r\nof federal courts have struck down similar Ten Commandments displays under the \r\nEstablishment Clause. In <u>Books v. City of Elkhart, Indiana</u>, 235 F.3d 292 \r\n(7th Cir. 2000), for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \r\nheld that a Ten Commandments monument at the municipal building in the City of \r\nElkhart erected in 1958 by the Fraternal Order of Eagles was unconstitutional \r\nunder the Establishment Clause. More recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \r\nTenth Circuit held that a Ten Commandments monument erected in 2005 at the \r\nHaskell County courthouse in Stigler, Oklahoma, was unconstitutional under the \r\nEstablishment Clause. <u>Green v. Haskell County Board of Com'rs</u>, 568 F.3d \r\n784 (10th Cir. 2009).<sup>9</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶5 It should also be noted that in this case the Legislature completely \r\nignored the role the Oklahoma Capitol Preservation Commission <i>is supposed to \r\nplay</i> in selecting works of art to be displayed at the Oklahoma State Capitol \r\nand the Governor's Mansion. <u>See</u> 74 O.S. § 4102. Section 4104 of Title 74 provides that the Commission shall \r\n\"[e]stablish standards for the acquisition and display of works of art for \r\npublic display in the Capitol and the Governor's Mansion and select such works. \r\nSuch works of art shall be directly related to the history and culture of the \r\nState of Oklahoma.\" Additionally, section 115:10-1-2 of the Oklahoma \r\nAdministrative Code provides: \"Any foundation, group or individual interested in \r\nfinancing and donating an appropriate work of art to the State for use in the \r\nCapitol or the Governor's Mansion shall submit a written request for approval of \r\na permanent display to the Commission.\"<sup>10</sup> At no point was a written request submitted to the Commission for \r\napproval, nor did the Commission affirmatively vote to authorize the placement \r\nof the Ten Commandments monument.<sup>11</sup> The Commission had no input with regard to the design of the monument,<sup>12</sup> and the only vote taken by the Commission with \r\nregard to the monument was its location on the Capitol grounds.<sup>13</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶6 Instead, the Legislature passed the Ten Commandments Monument Display Act, \r\nwhich was signed into law in May of 2009, and provides in part:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>The State Capitol Preservation Commission or designee is hereby authorized to \r\npermit and arrange for the placement on the State Capitol grounds of a suitable \r\nmonument displaying the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments monument shall \r\nuse the same words used on the monument at issue in <i>Van Orden v. Perry</i>, \r\nthat the United State Supreme Court ruled constitutional. This monument shall be \r\ndesigned, constructed, and placed on Capitol grounds by private entities at no \r\nexpense to the State of Oklahoma. The State Capitol Preservation Commission or \r\ndesignee is authorized to assist private entities in selecting a location for \r\nthe monument and arranging a suitable time for its placement.<sup>14</sup> </p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>The Act was sponsored by State Representative Mike Ritze of Broken Arrow, who \r\nis an \"[o]rdained Southern Baptist Deacon and Sunday School teacher.\"<sup>15</sup> Representative Ritze not only voted to approve \r\nthe Act, but after the passage of the Act, Representative Ritze <b>personally \r\ncontracted</b> with SI Memorials for the creation of the monument.<sup>16</sup> All work done on the monument itself was \r\nfinanced by Representative Ritze through private funds, and the monument \r\nspecifically, and prominently, states that it was \"presented to the people of \r\nOklahoma by Dr. Mike and Connie Ritze and children Amity, Heidi and Jamey\".<sup>17</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶7 As this Court held in its Per Curiam opinion, the plain language of Art. \r\nII, § 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution mandates the removal of the monument:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>§ 5. Public money or property - Use for sectarian purposes.</p>\r\n<p>No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, or \r\nused, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, \r\nchurch, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support \r\nof any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary, or \r\nsectarian institution as such.<sup>18</sup> </p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>Our Per Curiam opinion issued in this case, in my view, implicitly overruled \r\n<u>Meyer v. Oklahoma City</u>, 1972 OK 45, 496 P.2d 789, where this Court upheld the \r\ndisplaying of a fifty-foot cross at the state fairgrounds. I would explicitly \r\noverrule <u>Meyer</u> as that case was wrongly decided.<sup>19</sup> Regardless, <u>Meyer</u> is clearly \r\ndistinguishable from this case. In <u>Meyer</u>, the Court said: </p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>The cross is in a distinctly secular environment in the midst of persons in \r\npursuit of distinctly secular entertainment. Notwithstanding the alleged \r\nsectarian conceptions of the individuals who sponsored the installation of this \r\ncross, it cannot be said to display, articulate or portray, except in a most \r\nevanescent form, any ideas that are alleged to pertain to any of the sectarian \r\ninstitutions or systems named in Art. 2, § 5. The alleged commercial setting in \r\nwhich the cross now stands and the commercial atmosphere that obscures whatever \r\nsuggestions may emanate from its silent form, stultify its symbolism and vitiate \r\nany use, benefit or support for any sect, church, denomination, system of \r\nreligion or sectarian institution as such.<sup>20</sup></p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>¶8 In this case, the Ten Commandments monument is<b> permanently placed on \r\nthe grounds of our State Capitol--the heart of our state government and \"the \r\ncivic home of every one of the State's citizens.\"</b></p><sup>21</sup><b> </b>The fact that the \"monument 'is installed on \r\npublic property implies official recognition and reinforcement of its message. \r\nThat implication is especially strong when the sign stands in front of the seat \r\nof government itself.'\"<sup>22</sup> In fact, \"the seat of government 'is so plainly under government \r\nownership and control' that every display on its property is marked implicitly \r\nwith governmental approval.\"<sup>23</sup> \r\n<p>¶9 And the monument itself is not silent, but displays the following message: \r\n</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>the Ten Commandments<br>I AM the LORD thy God. <br>Thou shalt have no other \r\ngods before me. <br>Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images.<br>Thou \r\nshalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.<br>Remember the Sabbath \r\nday, to keep it holy.<br>Honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be \r\nlong upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.<br>Thou shalt not \r\nkill.<br>Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br>Thou shalt not steal.<br>Thou shalt \r\nnot bear false witness against thy neighbor.<br>Thou shalt not covet thy \r\nneighbor's house.<br>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his \r\nmanservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy \r\nneighbors.</p></dir></dir><sup>24</sup> \r\n<p>¶10 The legislative findings included in the Ten Commandments Display Act \r\nstate that the \"Ten Commandments are an important component of the foundation of \r\nthe laws and legal system of the United State of America and of the State of \r\nOklahoma.\"</p><sup>25</sup> But a self-serving declaration within \r\nthe statute stating that the purpose of the monument is secular is of no \r\nmeaning. <u>Stone</u>, 449 U.S. at 41. \r\n<p>¶11 \"Attempts to secularize what is unquestionably a sacred text defy \r\ncredibility and disserve people of faith.\"</p><sup>26</sup> The Ten Commandments are \"plainly religious in nature,\" and are \r\n\"undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths.\"<sup>27</sup> \"For many followers, the Commandments represent \r\nthe literal word of God as spoken to Moses and repeated to his followers after \r\ndescending from Mount Sinai.\"<sup>28</sup> The monument focuses \"not only on subjects that are the legitimate \r\nconcern of civil authorities, but also subjects that are beyond the ken of any \r\ngovernment and that address directly the relationship of the individual human \r\nbeing and God.\"<sup>29</sup> \"[T]he first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of \r\nbelievers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the \r\nLord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.\"<sup>30</sup> \r\n<p>¶12 But even the \"universally accepted prohibitions (as against murder, \r\ntheft, and the like)\" rest on \"the sanction of the divinity proclaimed at the \r\nbeginning of the text.\"</p><sup>31</sup> As the Court stated in <u>McCreary County</u>: \"This is not to deny that \r\nthe Commandments have had influence on civil or secular law; a major text of a \r\nmajority religion is bound to be felt. The point is simply that the original \r\ntext viewed in its entirety is unmistakably religious statement dealing with \r\nreligious obligations and with morality subject to religious sanction.\"<sup>32</sup> Stripping the Ten Commandments of their \r\nreligious significance and characterizing them as secular and a component of the \r\nfoundation of the laws of this State trivializes the sacred nature of the text \r\nand degrades those individuals who <u>truly</u> believe the Ten Commandments are \r\na covenant between God and His people. \r\n<p>¶13 The legislative authorization eschewing a religious meaning also includes \r\nSection C of the Ten Commandments Display Act, which simply cannot be ignored: \r\n</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>In the event that the legality or the constitutionality of the Ten \r\nCommandments monument is challenged in a court of law, the Oklahoma Attorney \r\nGeneral or Liberty Legal Institute is hereby authorized to prepare and present a \r\nlegal defense of the monument.</p></dir></dir><sup>33</sup> \r\n<p>Not only is the Liberty Legal Institute named specifically in the Act, but an \r\nattorney for the Liberty Legal Institute entered an appearance on behalf of the \r\nCommission in the District Court shortly after the Attorney General filed his \r\nAnswer in the case, and that same attorney also entered an appearance in this \r\ncase on appeal on behalf of the Commission. The Liberty Legal Institute</p><sup>34</sup> is based out of Plano, Texas, with its stated \r\nmission to \"defend and restore religious liberty across America--in our schools, \r\nfor our churches, inside the military, and throughout the public arena.\"<sup>35</sup> The \"Liberty Institute fights to restore \r\nreligious liberty pursuant to the principles of America's founders--that \r\nreligious freedom does not mean confining religious expression to church or \r\nhome, but that true religious liberty consists of recognizing individuals' \r\nGod-given right to follow their conscience and to live and act according to \r\ntheir faith in every area of life.\"<sup>36</sup> With regard to the Ten Commandments monuments, the Liberty Institute \r\nwebsite states:\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>Liberty Institute is committed to enforcing the law that allows Ten \r\nCommandments displays in every state across the nation.

The difference between the two versions \r\nis not merely semantic; rather, it is but one example of a deep theological \r\ndispute.\"<sup>42</sup> Displaying this particular version of \r\nthe Ten Commandments on the grounds of the State Capitol not only violates the \r\nOklahoma Constitution but also \"invariably places the State at the center of a \r\nserious sectarian dispute[.]\"<sup>43</sup> \r\n<p>¶15 The monument at the State Capitol also includes two Stars of David and \r\nthe \"Greek letters Chi and Rho as the familiar monogram of Christ,\"</p><sup>44</sup> representing respectively Judaism and \r\nChristianity and confining its approval only to the Judeo-Christian faiths. The \r\neagle clutching the American flag at the top of the monument then specifically \r\nlinks \"these two religions, and civil government.\"<sup>45</sup> \"When the government associates one set of \r\nreligious beliefs with the state and identifies nonadherents as outsiders, it \r\nencroaches upon the individual's decision about whether and how to worship.\"<sup>46</sup> \r\n<p>¶16 Finally, in spite of the court filings in this case, which conclude that \r\nArt. II, § 5, of the Oklahoma Constitution is a Blaine Amendment,</p><sup>47</sup> nothing in the recorded history of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitutional Convention, this Court's case law, or any other historical \r\nevidence supports this conclusion. In fact, all evidence is to the contrary. In \r\n1875, Republican presidential candidate and Congressman James Blaine proposed an \r\namendment to the U.S. Constitution, specifically targeting the funding of \r\nreligious schools with public money.<sup>48</sup> \"The Amendment came about at a time of heightened controversy over the \r\nreligious character of American public education and the public funding of \r\nprivate religious schooling, primarily Catholic parochial schools.\"<sup>49</sup> \r\n<p>¶17 After failing to secure the Republican nomination for President, \r\nCongressman Blaine abandoned the cause and did not vote on the amendment or take \r\npart in any of the debates surrounding the amendment.</p><sup>50</sup> The amendment passed the House of \r\nRepresentatives, but failed to receive the necessary approval from the Senate.<sup>51</sup> Congressman Blaine's quick abandonment of the \r\namendment has led some scholars to conclude that the \"modern-day emphasis placed \r\non the Blaine Amendment is misplaced,\"<sup>52</sup> and that the attempted passage of the Blaine Amendment shows \"our \r\nnation's continual willingness to use religious issues for political ends.\"<sup>53</sup> \r\n<p>¶18 Regardless, in 1889, a Republican-controlled Congress resurrected \r\nremnants of the failed Blaine Amendment in the Enabling Act of 1889, mandating \r\nthat \"four new states--Washington, Montana, North and South Dakota--include[] \r\nno-funding provisions in their constitutions\" to become states.</p><sup>54</sup> From there, a no-funding provision was added to \r\nOklahoma's Enabling Act in 1906, mandating \"[t]hat provisions shall be made for \r\nthe establishment and maintenance of a system of public schools, which shall be \r\nopen to all the children of said State and free from sectarian control . . . \r\n.\"<sup>55</sup> \r\n<p>¶19 The Oklahoma Constitutional Convention adopted the language of the \r\nEnabling Act verbatim into our Constitution in <b><u>Article I, § 5</u></b> of \r\nthe Oklahoma Constitution entitled \"Public schools,\" which states: \"Provisions \r\nshall be made for the establishment and maintenance of a system of public \r\nschools, which shall be open to all children of the state and free from \r\nsectarian control . . . .\"</p><sup>56</sup> Although the adoption of such language by the Oklahoma Constitutional \r\nConvention <u>could have</u> been based on the unabashedly biased attitude \r\ntoward Catholic parochial schools found in the failed Blaine Amendment, my \r\nreview of the debates and proceedings of the Convention does not reflect such \r\nattitudes.<sup>57</sup> <b>Nevertheless, what is clear is \r\nthat the broader mandates of <u>Art. II, § 5</u> cannot be found in the Enabling \r\nAct and concluding that Art. II, § 5 was the corollary to such language in the \r\nEnabling Act is error.</b><sup>58</sup> \r\n<p>¶20 As noted by R.L. Williams, a former Chief Justice of this Court and a \r\ndelegate to the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, Art. II, § 5 of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution traces its origins to the Massachusetts Bill of Rights of 1780 \r\npassed ninety-five years before the Blaine Amendment, the Michigan Constitution \r\nof 1835 passed some forty years before the Blaine Amendment, the Missouri \r\nConstitution of 1820 passed more than fifty years before the Blaine Amendment, \r\nand the New Jersey Constitution of 1776 passed almost 100 years before the \r\nBlaine Amendment.</p><sup>59</sup> \r\n<p>¶21 In <u>Connell v. Gray</u>, </p>1912 OK 607, 127 P. 417, the Oklahoma Supreme Court, which \r\nincluded three justices who participated in the Oklahoma Constitutional \r\nConvention<sup>60</sup> and which was decided just five years \r\nafter the ratification of our Constitution, similarly traced the origins of Art. \r\nII, § 5 to the Missouri Constitution and the Michigan Constitution, which were \r\n\"prototype[s]\" of \"[t]he first legislative act passed toward the separation of \r\nchurch and state . . . by Virginia in 1786, entitled 'An act for establishing \r\nreligious freedom,'\" and \"brought about by Thomas Jefferson.\"<sup>61</sup> The Virginia Act was later embodied in the \r\nVirginia Constitution of 1830, which predates the proposed Blaine Amendment by \r\nforty-five years. \r\n<p>¶22 Albert Ellis, the second Vice-President of the Oklahoma Constitutional \r\nConvention, wrote about Art. II, § 5 shortly after the ratification of the \r\nOklahoma Constitution:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>This section not only guards the citizens right to be free from taxation for \r\nthe support of the church, but protects the rights of all denominations, however \r\nfew the number of their respective adherents, by with-holding any incentive that \r\nmight prompt any ecclesiastical body to participate in political struggles and \r\nby reason of their numbers exert an undue influence and become beneficiaries at \r\nthe expense of the public and a menace to weaker denominations and ultimately \r\ndestructive of religious liberty.</p></dir></dir><sup>62</sup> \r\n<p>¶23 More recent annotations also make no mention of the failed Blaine \r\nAmendment in their discussions of Art. II, § 5: \"This provision relating to the \r\nchurch-state issue is much more explicit than that found in the U.S. \r\nConstitution.\"</p><sup>63</sup> A study of the Oklahoma Constitution by the League of Women Voters \r\nprovides: \"The Oklahoma Bill of Rights further details the separation of church \r\nand state by denying the use of state money or property for the benefit of any \r\nparticular religious sect or denomination.\"<sup>64</sup> \r\n<p>¶24 A comparison of the text of the failed Blaine Amendment and the text of \r\nArt. II, § 5 also reveals that Art. II, § 5 is broader than the Blaine Amendment \r\nand does not limit its application only to schools. Art. II, § 5 states: </p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, or \r\nused, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, \r\nchurch, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support \r\nof any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary, or \r\nsectarian institution as such.</p></dir></dir><sup>65</sup> \r\n<p>Whereas the failed Blaine Amendment provided:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion or \r\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any \r\nState for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund \r\ntherefore, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control \r\nof any religious sect, nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be \r\ndivided between religious sects or denominations.</p></dir></dir><sup>66</sup> <b>\r\n</b><p>Characterizing Art. II, § 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution as a Blaine \r\nAmendment completely ignores the intent of the founders of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution who purposely sought to ensure future generations of Oklahomans \r\nwould be free to practice religious freedom without fear of governmental \r\nintervention.</p><sup>67</sup><b> </b>\r\n<p>¶25 Justice O'Connor wrote in the <u>McCreary County</u> case:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>At a time when we see around the world the violent consequences of the \r\nassumption of religious authority by government, Americans may count themselves \r\nfortunate: Our regard for constitutional boundaries has protected us from \r\nsimilar travails, while allowing private religious exercise to flourish. The \r\nwell-known statement that '[w]e are a religious people,' has proved true. . . . \r\nThose who would renegotiate the boundaries between church and state must \r\ntherefore answer a difficult question: Why would we trade a system that has \r\nserved us so well for one that has served others so poorly?<sup>68</sup> </p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>The constitutional guarantees of separation of church and state in many state \r\nconstitutions \"reflect their origin in specific disputes about the relationship \r\nbetween church and state . . . and represent considered constitutional judgments \r\nabout contentious church-state issues.\"<sup>69</sup> Art. II, § 5 in our Constitution is no different. Mr. Ellis wrote: \"The \r\nConvention, knowing the history of the union of Church and State in Europe and \r\nin New England in Colonial days, profited by the lessons of the past and made it \r\nimpossible to appropriate or give to any church denomination or ecclesiastical \r\nservant or any religious institution, as such; the money or property of the \r\npublic.\"<sup>70</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶26 Mr. Ellis went on to state that Art. II, § 5 \"is one of the wisest \r\nprovisions of our organic law. If there should ever be a demand by any \r\necclesiastical body that any part or portion of the public funds or any public \r\nproperty, be diverted to the use or benefit of any church or denomination or any \r\nof its servants, or for the support of any religious institution, as such; this \r\nsection will be found to be one of the safest of our safeguards.\"<sup>71</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶27 This generation has the same obligation today as the Founders did in 1907 \r\nto protect the Constitution of our State, lest future generations review it in a \r\ncasual way. As one member <i>of the clergy</i> wrote in 1923: \"The People of \r\nthis State should see to it well that [Art. II, § 5] in the bill of rights is \r\nnever emasculated or nullified by any future convention, by one jot or title, \r\nbut left intact as one of the imperishable provisions of the organic law \r\nprotecting the people in their right against any encroachment by any \r\necclesiastical organization.\"<sup>72</sup> </p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">FOOTNOTES</p>\r\n<p><sup>1</sup> <u>Michigan v.

The Per Curiam opinion's strict reading of Okla. \r\nConst. art. 2, § 5 ignores the context-based analysis we used in <i>Meyer v. \r\nOklahoma City, </i>1972 OK 45, 496 P.2d 789, and does not overrule that opinion. \r\nThe Appellee's need for clarification is apparent.</p>\r\n<p>¶2 The framers of the Oklahoma Constitution, although having strong views \r\nbehind the creation of Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 did not believe its provisions \r\nprohibited government acknowledgement of religion. Indeed, the first words of \r\nthe Preamble to the Oklahoma Constitution state \"[i]nvoking the guidance of \r\nAlmighty God, in order to secure and perpetuate the blessing of liberty.\" This \r\nCourt has previously determined, \"[i]t is not the exposure to religious \r\ninfluence that is to be avoided; it is the adoption of sectarian principles or \r\nthe monetary support of one or several or all sects that the state must not do.\" \r\n<i>Murrow Indian Orphans Home v. Childers, </i>1946 OK 187, ¶7, 171 P.2d 600. I do not believe the intent or \r\neffect behind this Ten Commandments Monument (\"Monument\") was for the adoption \r\nof sectarian principles. My belief is based not only on our context-based \r\nanalysis in <i>Meyer</i><sup>3</sup><i> </i>but also on the standard the district court and the parties agreed \r\nwas proper to use in this analysis; one based on federal jurisprudence in \r\nEstablishment Clause cases.</p>\r\n<p>¶3 In its petition for rehearing, the Appellee asserts \r\nfederal Establishment Clause precedent is relevant to this case.<sup>4</sup> I agree. The long and evolved federal \r\njurisprudence concerning alleged unconstitutional monuments and displays is \r\ninformative and persuasive in determining the meaning of \"support\" a \"system of \r\nreligion\" in our own constitution.<sup>5</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶4 At the hearing on summary judgment the district court used an \"objective \r\nstandard\" in finding the Monument did not violate Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5.<sup>6</sup> The attorney for the Appellant believed at the \r\nhearing that this was the proper standard; however, he appears to have \r\ninterpreted the standard differently than the court.<sup>7</sup> This objective standard evaluates whether or not \r\na reasonable observer, aware of the history and context of the community in \r\nwhich the conduct occurs, would view the government action as having a principle \r\nor primary effect of advancing or endorsing religion, or as here, government \r\nsupport of a system(s) of religion. <i>See Bauchman for Bauchman v. West High \r\nSchool</i>, 132 F.3d 542, 551-52, 555 (10th Cir. 1997). This reasonable observer \r\nis an informed reasonable observer whose knowledge of the context surrounding \r\nthe alleged offending display goes outside just observing the display itself.<sup>8</sup> It is a legal standard akin to the reasonable \r\nperson standard in tort law<sup>9</sup> and does not require a court to review endless testimony of opinion from \r\nactual observers.<sup>10</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶5 In religious symbols cases, context is the touchstone. <i>Glassroth v. \r\nMoore</i>, 335 F.3d 1282, 1284 (11th Cir. 2003). This is the case not only in \r\nfederal Establishment Clause jurisprudence but also in our own jurisprudence. In \r\n<i>Meyer v. Oklahoma City</i>, 1972 OK 45, ¶11, 496 P.2d 789, a 50-foot Latin Cross which was \r\nplaced on city property and whose lighting was provided by the city was \r\nchallenged for violating Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5. This Court determined the \r\ncross did not violate Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 because the commercial setting \r\nand atmosphere of the Fair Grounds obscured any suggestions that might emanate \r\nfrom the cross' silent form and further \"stultify its symbolism and vitiate any \r\nuse, benefit or support for any sect, church, denomination, system of religion \r\nor sectarian institution . . . .\" Our holding in <i>Meyer</i> can best be \r\ninterpreted as holding in Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 cases the predominant context \r\nsurrounding the challenged government action is dispositive. This is similar to \r\nthe approach used in 2005 by Justice Breyer in determining the predominant \r\ncontext surrounding the Ten Commandments monument in <i>Van Orden v. Perry</i>, \r\n545 U.S. \r\n677 (2005). </p>\r\n<p>¶6 In <i>Van Orden</i>, the constitutionality of a Ten Commandments monument \r\non the Texas Capitol grounds was challenged as violating the Establishment \r\nClause of the United States Constitution. Justice Breyer wrote the controlling \r\nopinion for the Court.<sup>11</sup> Justice Breyer believed that even though the Ten Commandments had an \r\nundeniable religious message, focusing on its text alone could not conclusively \r\nresolve the case. <i>Id</i>. at 701. He determined in order to resolve what the \r\ntext of the message conveyed, the proper inquiry required the Court to \"examine \r\nhow the text is <i>used</i>\" by considering the context of the display. \r\n<i>Id</i>. He found the text of the Ten Commandments can also be used in a \r\nsecular way to convey a general moral message about proper social conduct or in \r\na historical way to show a relation between its standards and the law. The \r\nlatter he believed is why so many courthouses throughout the Nation, including \r\nthe Supreme Court, displayed the tablets in some form. He determined the \r\ncircumstances surrounding the monument's placement at the Texas Capitol and its \r\nphysical setting suggested the State intended its secular message to \r\npredominate. <i>Id</i>. </p>\r\n<p>¶7 Title 74 O.S. 2011, § \r\n4110 (HB 1330) \r\nproclaimed the Monument was not meant to be construed to favor any particular \r\nreligion or denomination over others and it was essentially just another \r\nmonument on the Capitol grounds.<sup>12</sup> In federal jurisprudence, the courts have deferred to the professed \r\ngovernment purpose unless the secular purpose is a sham or secondary to a \r\nreligious purpose.<sup>13</sup> Where a \"plausible secular purpose\" has been demonstrated, the courts \r\nwill give deference to the government's motives.<sup>14</sup> The record is also silent as to any contravening \r\nsectarian purpose behind the Monument's placement. </p>\r\n<p>¶8 The Appellants expressly stated they were not challenging the \r\nconstitutionality of HB 1330. The Appellants are challenging the actions of the \r\nAppellee. Under federal jurisprudence, \"whether the government has endorsed a \r\nparticular religious display depends in large part on the display's particular \r\nphysical setting.\" <i>O'Connor v. Washburn University</i>, 416 F.3d 1216, 1228 \r\n(10th Cir. 2005) (citing <i>Lynch v. Donnelly</i>, 465 U.S. 668, 671, 681-82, 685 (1984)). The \r\nAppellants asserted the Appellee's placement and positioning of the Monument \r\nputs it in a prominent position leading one to conclude it represents State \r\nsupport of a system(s) of religion. The question being, regardless of purpose or \r\nintent, was the placement and positioning of the Monument done in such a way \r\nthat an informed reasonable observer would conclude it represents State support \r\nof a system(s) of religion? It appears from the record that the Monument was \r\nplaced in possibly the most inconvenient and low-trafficked part of the Capitol \r\ngrounds imaginable. Its placement on the northeast side of the Capitol Building \r\nmakes it impossible to view from the main parking lot or any entrance to the \r\nbuilding. The main parking lot and main entrance are on the south side of the \r\nCapitol Building with the other two working entrances being on the east and west \r\nsides. Because of this placement, a person inside the Capitol Building should \r\nonly be able to see the Monument through some of the windows on the east side of \r\nthe north wing and the north side of the east wing. Next to the Monument is a \r\nshort stairway that leads to the north entrance of the Capitol and is the only \r\nentrance on that side of the building. However, this nearby north entrance has \r\nbeen closed for many years. The Monument sits at the top and to the east of the \r\nstairway. The closest route from the Capitol Building to the Monument requires \r\none to leave the east or west side doors and walk a quarter of the way around \r\nthe large building. Nor does its placement provide accommodation for meditation \r\nor other religious activity. I do not believe an informed reasonable observer \r\nseeing the Monument would find that its placement or positioning rises to the \r\nlevel of being sacred or is in any way more unique than the placement of any of \r\nthe many other monuments on the Capitol grounds including the few that reside on \r\nthe north side. </p>\r\n<p>¶9 Nor do I believe that the Monument's content leads an informed reasonable \r\nobserver to conclude it supports a system(s) of religion as asserted by the \r\nAppellants. The message on the Monument's face is not the full story. What a \r\nreasonable observer is aware of \"is not limited to the 'information gleaned \r\nsimply from viewing the challenged display.'\" <i>O'Connor v. Washburn \r\nUniversity</i>, 416 F.3d 1216, 1228 (citing <i>Wells v. City &amp; County of \r\nDenver</i>, 257 F.3d 1132, 1142-43 (10th Cir. 2001)). I agree with the reasoning \r\nof Justice Breyer in Van Orden, who found that the text of the Ten Commandments \r\nwas religious \"invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Deity,\" yet he determined that \r\nfact alone was not dispositive. <i>Van Orden v. Perry</i>, 545 U.S. 677, 700-701 (Breyer, J., concurring). \r\nOne must review the surrounding context. Here, the surrounding context also \r\ntakes into account the plausible secular historical/legal purpose of the \r\nLegislature. In addition, the Monument includes an inscription showing it was \r\nprivately donated. Such message further distances the State from the Monument in \r\nthe mind of a reasonable observer. <i>See Card v. City of Everett</i>, 520 F.3d \r\n1009, 1020 (9th Cir. 2008).</p>\r\n<p>¶10 The Appellants also asserted the fact that the Monument was not made part \r\nof a larger display or coordinated series of monuments only adds to the effect \r\nthat the State was adopting sectarian principles. I disagree. I do not find the \r\nspacing or density of monuments is indicative here of an adoption of sectarian \r\nprinciples. The monuments spread throughout the Oklahoma Capitol Complex appear \r\nnot to be part of any particular spacing scheme or planned density. As the court \r\nin <i>Card v. City of Everett</i>, 520 F.3d 1009, 1020 (9th Cir. 2008) determined in its context analysis, there is \r\nno \"quota system for monuments or a requirement for a particular density of \r\nmonuments in a given area.\" It should be noted that in Meyer there was only one \r\nmonument and it was found to be constitutional by this Court.</p>\r\n<p>¶11 Although initially raised on appeal in the Appellee's answer brief, on \r\nrehearing the parties did not brief the issue of whether Okla. Const. art. 2, § \r\n5 is a state Blaine Amendment; however, other Justices of this Court have \r\naddressed this issue. The Blaine Amendment was a failed 1870's proposed \r\namendment to the United States Constitution to bar aid to sectarian \r\ninstitutions. <i>Mitchell v. Helms</i>, 530 U.S. 793, 828 (2000). The proposed amendment \"arose at a \r\ntime of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and it was an open secret \r\nthat 'sectarian' was code for 'Catholic'. <i>Mitchell,</i> 530 U.S. at 828. This amendment would have applied \r\nalmost exclusively to Catholic parochial schools. <i>Id</i>. at 829. The \r\nAppellee had previously cited a 2003 law review article written by Mark E. \r\nDeForrest, for the purpose of demonstrating, after the Blaine Amendment's \r\nfailure, states adopted similar provisions in their own constitutions.<sup>15</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶12 The parties have not cited any decision of this Court where we have \r\nreferred to Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 as an Oklahoma version of the Blaine \r\nAmendment or construed it so narrowly to only apply to sectarian institutions, \r\nor in other words, parochial schools. On this issue I would agree with the other \r\nJustices of this Court that Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 is not Oklahoma's version \r\nof a Blaine Amendment. The breadth and scope of Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 differ \r\nsignificantly from the failed Blaine Amendment. </p>\r\n<p>¶13 In conclusion, I disagree with the Per Curiam opinion's overly narrow \r\ninterpretation of the language in Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5. Since statehood this \r\nCourt has interpreted our Constitution. I do not adopt the strict approach taken \r\nby other members of this Court in determining the meaning behind \"support\" of a \r\n\"system of religion\". Additionally, I would limit findings to the record before \r\nthe court on issues presented by the parties. I find the appropriate analysis of \r\nOkla. Const. art. 2 § 5 is a context-based analysis like that used by this Court \r\nin <i>Meyer</i> and found in federal jurisprudence. We should not lightly \r\nattribute unconstitutional motives to the government where we can discern a \r\nplausible secular purpose. I am of the opinion the facts of this case have more \r\nsimilarities to <i>Van Orden</i> than not. However, as Justice Breyer believed \r\nin <i>Van Orden</i>, I believe this case is a borderline case. A slight change \r\nin its facts could have tipped my view concerning the effect the Monument \r\nconveyed upon a reasonable observer. Today our State is composed of many \r\ndifferent religious beliefs and many persons of no religion. Wisdom, prudence \r\nand caution should be at the forefront when considering the placement of \r\ndisplays on government property. However, for the foregoing reasons, I dissent \r\nto the denial of the petition for rehearing.</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">FOOTNOTES</p>\r\n<p><sup>1</sup> I would also restyle the case and set out Donald Chabot as a \r\nplaintiff only and not as an appellant.

The monument was a gift from another Oklahoma citizen and was \r\nplaced on the Capitol grounds pursuant to a Legislative act that was signed by \r\nthe Governor. While conceding that no public funds were expended to acquire the \r\nmonument, complainants nonetheless maintain its placement on the Capitol grounds \r\nconstitutes the use of public property for the benefit of a system of religion. \r\nSuch governmental action is forbidden by Article 2, Section 5 of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution.</p>\r\n<p>¶2 The trial court ruled that the monument did not violate Article 2, Section \r\n5 and entered a summary judgment denying complainants' request for an \r\ninjunction. This Court reviews de novo the constitutional issue and the legal \r\nquestion resolved by the summary judgment. <i>Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. Okla. State \r\nBd. of Equalization</i>, 2009 OK 72, ¶ 10, 231 P.3d 638, 641. \r\nUpon de novo review, the trial court's ruling is reversed.</p>\r\n<p>¶3 In deciding whether the State's display of the monument in question \r\nviolates Article 2, Section 5, the intent of this provision must be ascertained. \r\n<i>Draper v. State</i>, 1980 OK 117, ¶ 8, 621 P.2d 1142, 1145. Such intent is \r\nfirst sought in the text of the provision.<i> Id.</i> Words of a constitutional \r\nprovision must be given their plain, natural and ordinary meaning. <i>Lepak v. \r\nMcClain</i>, 1992 OK \r\n166, ¶ 7, 844 \r\nP.2d 852, 854.</p>\r\n<p>¶4 The text of Article 2, Section 5 states:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>§ 5. Public money or property - Use for sectarian purposes.</p>\r\n    <p>No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, \r\n    or used, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any \r\n    sect, church, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, \r\n    or support of any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or \r\n    dignitary, or sectarian institution as such.</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p>The plain intent of Article 2, Section 5 is to ban State Government, its \r\nofficials, and its subdivisions from using public money or property for the \r\nbenefit of any religious purpose. Use of the words \"no,\" \"ever,\" and \"any\" \r\nreflects the broad and expansive reach of the ban. <i>See</i> <i>Coffee v. \r\nHenry</i>, 2010 OK \r\n4, ¶ 3, 240 \r\nP.3d 1056, 1057.</p>\r\n<p>¶5 To reinforce the broad, expansive effect of Article 2, Section 5, the \r\nframers specifically banned any uses \"indirectly\" benefitting religion. As this \r\nCourt has previously observed, the word \"indirectly\" signifies the doing, by an \r\nobscure, circuitous method, something which is prohibited from being done \r\ndirectly, and includes all methods of doing the thing prohibited, except the \r\ndirect means. <i>Haynes v. Caporal</i>, 1977 OK 166, ¶ 7, 571 P.2d 430, 433. \r\nProhibiting uses of public property that \"indirectly\" benefit a system of \r\nreligion was clearly done to protect the ban from circumvention based upon mere \r\nform and technical distinction.</p>\r\n<p>¶6 In authorizing its placement, the Legislature apparently believed that \r\nthere would be no legal impediment to placing the monument on the Capitol \r\ngrounds so long as (1) the text was the same as the text displayed on the Ten \r\nCommandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol, and (2) a \r\nnon-religious historic purpose was given for the placement of the monument. To \r\nbe sure, the United States Supreme Court case of <i>Van Orden v. Perry</i>, 545 \r\nU.S. 677 (2005), ruled that the Texas Ten Commandments monument did not violate \r\nthe Establishment Clause in the First Amendment to the United States \r\nConstitution. However, the issue in the case at hand is whether the Oklahoma Ten \r\nCommandments monument violates the Oklahoma Constitution, <i>not whether it \r\nviolates the Establishment Clause</i>. Our opinion rests solely on the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution with no regard for federal jurisprudence. <i>See</i> <i>Michigan v. \r\nLong</i>, 463 U.S. 1032, 1040-41 (1983). As concerns the \"historic purpose\" \r\njustification, the Ten Commandments are obviously religious in nature and are an \r\nintegral part of the Jewish and Christian faiths.</p>\r\n<p>¶7 Because the monument at issue operates for the use, benefit or support of \r\na sect or system of religion, it violates Article 2, Section 5 of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution and is enjoined and shall be removed.</p>\r\n<div class=\"de-action-clause\">\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>DISTRICT COURT'S JUDGMENT REVERSED; MATTER REMANDED FOR \r\n</b><br><b>FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION</b></p></div>\r\n<div class=\"de-vote\">\r\n<p>¶8 Reif, C.J., Kauger, Watt, Winchester, Edmondson, Taylor, Gurich, JJ., \r\nconcur.</p>\r\n<p>¶9 Combs, V.C.J., Colbert, J., dissent.</p></div></div>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tmp-citationizer\">\r\n\t<b><em>Citationizer<sup>©</sup> Summary of Documents Citing This Document</em></b><hr>\r\n\t<table>\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Cite</th>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Name</th>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Level</th>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t<tr><td>None Found.</td></tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n\t</table>\r\n\t<b><em>Citationizer: Table of Authority</em></b><hr>\r\n\t<table>\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Cite</th>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Name</th>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Level</th>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t<tr><td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Oklahoma Supreme Court Cases</strong></td></tr>\r\n<tr><td width=\"1%\"> </td><td width=\"25%\">Cite</td><td width=\"50%\">Name</td><td>Level</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\"> </td><td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\">1988 OK 44, 755 P.2d 635, 59 OBJ        1159, </td><td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">Alva State Bank and Trust Co. v.

We carefully consider the arguments of the \r\nCommission and find no merit warranting a grant of rehearing.

(by separate writing), and Kauger, \r\nWatt, Winchester, Edmondson (by separate writing), Taylor (by separate writing \r\nwith whom Gurich, J. joins), and Gurich (by separate writing), J.J.</p>\r\n<p>Dissent: Combs, V.C.J. (by separate writing), and \r\nColbert, J. </p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p></p><b>\r\n</b><p>REIF, C.J., concurring specially to the denial of \r\nrehearing, </p>\r\n<p>¶1 For the most part, I concur to the denial of \r\nAppellee's petition for rehearing. Several reasons support such \r\naction.</p>\r\n<p>¶2 First, the per curiam opinion contains no \r\nmisstatement of fact or law. Furthermore, the per curiam opinion sets forth \r\nsettled law that is dispositive of the issue presented and correctly applies \r\nsuch law in deciding the issue. More particularly, the per curiam opinion \r\nproperly seeks the intent of Article 2, Section 5 in its text and the plain \r\nmeaning of its language. Because this intrinsic analysis revealed no ambiguity, \r\nresort to extrinsic aids is improper and unnecessary. </p>\r\n<p>¶3 As this Court has recently observed, \"Absent an \r\nambiguity, the intent of the framers and electorate is settled by the language \r\nof the provision itself and courts are not at liberty to search for its meaning \r\nbeyond the provision.\" <i>Fent v. Fallin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2756744\"><a href=\"/opinion/2756744/fent-v-fallin/\"><span class=\"volume\">2014</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> \r\n<span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, ¶ 10, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1113</span></span>, 1116. The reason \r\nfor this rule is simple: \"Constitutional provisions are not made for parsing by \r\nlawyers, but for the instruction of the people and the representatives of \r\ngovernment, so that they may read and understand their rights and duties.\" \r\n<i>Id.</i>, ¶ 12, 345 P.3d at 1117.</p>\r\n<p>¶4 Interestingly, the Legislature has likewise shown \r\nthat it considers the language in Article 2, Section 5, to provide clear and \r\nunambiguous instruction for public officials. In 1981, the Legislature enacted \r\n53 \r\nO.S. § 20.10, now 53 O.S.2011, § \r\n1.18. This statute governs the expenditure of \r\nfunds by the Oklahoma Historical Society and provides, in pertinent part, that \r\n\"Funds shall not be applied, donated or used directly or indirectly for the use, \r\nbenefit or support of any sect, church, denomination or system of religion, or \r\nfor the use, benefit or support of any priest, preacher, minister, or other \r\nreligious teacher or dignitary, or sectarian institution as such.\" This \r\nstatutory language is virtually identical to the text of Article 2, Section 5. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>¶5 Finally, the narrow scope of the per curiam \r\nopinion is also consistent with the principle of judicial restraint. This \r\nprinciple dictates that if resolution of an issue effectively disposes of a \r\ncase, a court should resolve the case on that basis without reaching any other \r\nissues that might be presented. <i>Manning v. Upjohn Co.</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">545</span></span>, 547 \r\n(5th Cir. 1984). </p>\r\n<p>¶6 Even though these considerations support the \r\ndenial of rehearing, I would grant rehearing for the limited purpose of \r\naddressing the case of <i>Meyer v. Oklahoma City</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1170594\"><a href=\"/opinion/1170594/meyer-v-oklahoma-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> \r\n<span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span>. Although clearly distinguishable from \r\nthe case at hand, the <i>Meyer</i> case nonetheless provides helpful guidance in \r\ndeciding whether a particular use of public property is for the benefit of a \r\nsystem of religion. </p>\r\n<p>¶7 In <i>Meyer</i>, the taxpayer-plaintiff sought \r\nremoval of a 50' Latin Cross from City property located at the Oklahoma City \r\nFair Grounds. This Court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the taxpayer's \r\npetition, observing: \"The alleged commercial setting in which the cross now \r\nstands . . . obscures whatever suggestions may emanate from its silent form \r\n[and] vitiate[s] any use, benefit or support for any sect, church, denomination, \r\nsystem of religion or sectarian institution as such.\"<i> Id.</i>, ¶ 11, 496 P.2d \r\nat 792-3.</p>\r\n<p>¶8 This conclusion was grounded on two factors. \r\nFirst, this Court noted that \"The cross is in a distinctly secular environment \r\nin the midst of persons in pursuit of distinctly secular entertainment.\" \r\n<i>Id.</i>, 496 P.2d at 792. Secondly, this Court stressed that the cross did \r\nnot \"display, articulate or portray . . . any ideas that are alleged to pertain \r\nto any of the sectarian institutions or systems named in Article 2, § 5.\" \r\n<i>Id.</i></p>\r\n<p>¶9 The circumstances of the case at hand fail this \r\ntest. First, the State Capitol, unlike the Oklahoma City Fair Grounds,<b> </b>is \r\nnot a \"commercial setting\" nor \"a distinctly secular environment\" where persons \r\nare seeking \"distinctively secular entertainment.\" The State Capitol is the Seat \r\nof State Government where the business of the people is debated and transacted. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>¶10 Secondly, the Ten Commandments monument at issue \r\nin this case is nothing like the plain simple cross whose \"symbolic message\" was \r\nsaid to be \"evanescent\" or fleeting within the \"commercial setting\" of the fair \r\ngrounds. The Ten Commandments monument in this case <b>does explicitly</b> \r\n\"display\" and \"articulate\" ideas that directly pertain to the Judeo-Christian \r\nsystem of religion.</p>\r\n<p>¶11 The text of the Ten Commandments displayed on the \r\nmonument is an edited version of the text of the Ten Commandments appearing in \r\nthe King James Version of the Bible. Exodus 20:1-17 and Deuteronomy 5:6-21 \r\n(Authorized King James Version, Thomas Nelson Inc., 1999). While four of the \r\ncommandments displayed on the monument do have counterparts in Oklahoma \r\nstatutory law (proscriptions against killing, stealing, adultery and bearing \r\nfalse witness), these commandments are subsumed in a distinctly religious \r\ncontext that obscures whatever historical suggestions may emanate from them. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>¶12 The text of the Ten Commandments displayed \r\non the monument begins with the declaration \"I AM the LORD thy GOD.\" This \r\ndeclaration is followed by four directions for the worship of God. In addition, \r\nthe \"historical\" commandments are immediately preceded by a divine promise of \r\nlong life for honoring one's parents. They are immediately followed by divinely \r\nordained proscriptions against coveting things belonging to one's neighbor; a \r\nmatter of conscience, not general social order. This dominance of the explicit \r\nreligious message renders the monument \"operative in an effective way\" for the \r\nbenefit of the of the Judeo-Christian system of religion.<i> Meyer</i>, ¶ 11, \r\n496 P.2d at 792. As such, the monument's display on public property is properly \r\nenjoined. <i>Id.</i></p>\r\n<p align=\"center\"></p>\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n<p></p><b>\r\n</b><p>Edmondson, J., Concurring in denial of \r\nrehearing.</p>\r\n<p>¶1 The Attorney General's historical argument is \r\nincorrect. The origin of Okla. Const. Art. 2 § 5 is with Thomas Jefferson and \r\nthe example set by the People of Virginia and not the 1876 Blaine Amendment. See \r\n<i>Connell v. Gray</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3815608\"><a href=\"/opinion/4058143/connell-v-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> \r\n<span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>, 420, where the Court discussed the \r\nconnection between Art. 2 § 5 and a 1786 Virginia statute. See also R. L. \r\nWilliams, <i>The Constitution of Oklahoma and Enabling Act: Annotated with \r\nReferences to the Constitution, Statutes and Decisions</i>, 1941, 2d ed., Art. 2 \r\n§ 5, citing in the annotation the opinion <i>Pfeiffer v.

I write \r\nseparately to address issues raised in the Oklahoma Capitol Preservation \r\nCommission's petition for rehearing, filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General, and \r\nissues which were not directly confronted in this Court's opinion. The \r\nCommission urges that (1) this Court's jurisprudence permits items which benefit \r\na system of religion to be placed on state property, (2) an analysis of the U.S. \r\nConstitution's Establishment Clause is relevant here and should be considered in \r\nthis case, and (3) the Ten Commandments have historical, legal, and secular \r\nsignificance which override any religious benefit. Finally, the Commission has \r\nconcern about the effect of this Court's decision on artworks housed in the \r\nState Capitol and on its grounds.

This provision unequivocally bars \r\nthe state from allowing its property to be used for a religious benefit. Okla. \r\nConst. art. II, § 5. Article II, Section 5 is a clear limitation on state \r\ngovernment spending and use of public property. It is a limitation on the \r\nstate's reach into its citizens' private lives.</p>\r\n<p>¶4 Although we need not search for extraneous support for our construction of \r\nArticle II, Section 5's meaning, it is reassuring that this Court's construction \r\nis consistent with the framers' intent. Albert H. Ellis, the Second Vice \r\nPresident of the Constitutional Convention, explained that Article II, Section 5 \r\nwas intended to be \"one of the safest of our safeguards.\" Albert H. Ellis, <i>A \r\nHistory of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Oklahoma</i> 134 \r\n(1923). Mr. Ellis clarified that the Convention wrote Article II, Section 5 \r\n\"knowing the history of the union of Church and State in Europe and in New \r\nEngland in Colonial days,\" and utilized the lessons learned in those situations. \r\n<i>Id</i>. </p>\r\n<p>¶5 Mr. Ellis further explained that Article II, Section 5 </p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>not only guards the citizens right to be free from taxation for the support \r\nof the church, but protects the rights of all denominations, however few the \r\nnumber of their respective adherents, by with-holding any incentive that might \r\nprompt any ecclesiastical body to participate in political struggles and by \r\nreason of their numbers exert an undue influence and become beneficiaries at the \r\nexpense of the public and a menace to weaker denominations and ultimately \r\ndestructive of rel[i]gious liberty.</p></dir></dir><i>\r\n</i><p>Id. It is also important to note that in his very complete discussion of \r\nArticle II, Section 5, Mr. Ellis never mentions the Blaine Amendment.</p>\r\n<p>¶6 The Oklahoma Constitutional Convention members started their proceedings \r\nwith a prayer and the invocation of God's guidance and prefaced the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution by invoking God's guidance, all this showing that they were \r\nreligious men who believed in God. Okla. Const. pmbl. However, they were also \r\nmen who advocated for the toleration of all religious beliefs and complete \r\nseparation of church and state by going further than the federal constitution. \r\nClosely following the preamble is Article I, Section 2 of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution, which is entitled \"Religious liberty-Polygamous or plural \r\nmarriages.\" Section 2 secures \"[p]erfect toleration of religious sentiment\" and \r\nprovides \"no inhabitant of the State shall ever be molested in person or \r\nproperty on account of his or her mode of religious worship . . . .\" Okla. \r\nConst. Art. I, § 2. Then only three sections later, the Constitutional \r\nConvention provided for public schools \"free from sectarian control.\" Okla. \r\nConst. art. I, § 5. Seven sections later, they prohibited the use of state \r\nproperty, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of religious \r\ngroup. Okla. Const. art. II, § 5. While the constitutional framers may have been \r\nmen of faith, they recognized the necessity of a complete separation of church \r\nand state and sought to prevent the ills that would befall a state if they \r\nfailed to provide for this complete separation in the Oklahoma Constitution.</p><sup>2</sup>\r\n<p>¶7 Applying Article II, Section 5, there is no question that the monument is \r\non state property. The Appellee set it on the plaza directly north of the \r\nOklahoma Capitol, which is part of the state capitol complex. The monument \r\nproclaims: \" I AM the LORD thy God. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.\" \r\n<i>See </i>Appendix. The first part of the Ten Commandments concerns the \r\nreligious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding graven \r\nimages, not using the Lord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.\" \r\n<i>Stone v.

The Ten Commandments are inseparable from religion, which has \r\nalways been their primary purpose. The placement of the Ten Commandments \r\nmonument on state property benefits the Judeo-Christian system of religion. The \r\nmonument's placement on state property, proclaiming bedrock principles of the \r\nJudeo-Christian religious system, supports and benefits a system of religion in \r\nviolation of Article II, Section 5; it must be removed. \r\n<p>¶8 The Commission's petition for rehearing, filed on behalf of the defendant, \r\nargues that this Court ignored the teachings of <i>Meyer v.

However, none of these cases change \r\nArticle II, Section 5's plain language or our construction of it. \r\n<p>¶9 This Court first addressed Section 5 in <i>Connell v. Gray</i>, \r\n</p><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1912</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">607</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3815608\"><a href=\"/opinion/4058143/connell-v-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">417</span></a></span>. A college student was denied admission into a public university because \r\nshe refused to pay a five-dollar term fee, half of which was put in trust to \r\ncover broken equipment and the other half going to, among other things, support \r\nof student-sectarian organizations like the Young Men's Christian Association \r\n(YMCA) and the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA). <i>Id.</i> ¶ 1, \r\n127 P. at \r\n417. The Court \r\nheld that it is impermissible for the legislature or a state-run organization to \r\nfund or require payment for the YMCA and the YWCA because they promulgate \r\nsectarian principles. <i>Id.</i> Just as Article II, Section 5 bans the state \r\nfrom forcing its citizens to fund a religious organization, it bars the state \r\nfrom subjecting its citizens to an assault of religion in which they do not \r\nadhere.\r\n<p>¶10 Although the Commission ignores this Court's decision in <i>Gurney v. \r\nFurguson</i>, </p><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1941</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">397</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1002</span></span>, the next in this line of cases, any survey of our jurisprudence on the \r\nissue before us requires its consideration. The Court ruled legislation \r\nunconstitutional which compelled school district officials to use public school \r\nbuses to pick up and transport students who attended private or parochial \r\nschools. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 16, 122 P.2d at 1005. The Court concluded that the legislation authorized the use of public \r\nschool funds to support sectarian schools. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 9, 122 P.2d at 1004. The \r\nCourt ruled that any \"legislative enactment which has the effect of authorizing \r\nor requiring the use of public property or the expenditure of public school \r\nfunds in transporting pupils of a sectarian school to and from such school is \r\nviolative of section 5, article 2 of the Constitution of Oklahoma.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ \r\n0, 122 P.2d at \r\n1002 (Syllabus by \r\nthe Court No. 3). \r\n<p>¶11 In <i>Murrow Indian Orphans Home v.

A Baptist-affiliated home for Native American orphans contracted \r\nwith the state to provide care to children in exchange for payment. <i>Id.</i> ¶ \r\n2, 171 P.2d at 601. The Court analyzed this issue by contrasting the public \r\nmoney paid to the organization affiliated with a sectarian institution against \r\nthe consideration the state received by the organization housing Native American \r\norphans. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 5, 171 P.2d at 603. The Court ruled that the state \r\nreceived sufficient consideration in exchange for the public money given to the \r\norganization and that the state was not using public money \"for the use, \r\nbenefit, or support of any sect, church, denomination, or system of religion.\" \r\n<i>Id.</i> ¶ 10, 171 P.2d at 603. \r\n<p>¶12 <i>Childers</i> has no application here. First, it is in a line of cases \r\ndealing with the expenditure of money to a sectarian organization. Second, there \r\nis not even a hint in this case that Oklahoma received any benefit for allowing \r\nthe use of state property for this monument.</p>\r\n<p>¶13 The Commission's reliance on <i>State ex rel.

This Court was confronted with the issue of whether \r\nArticle II, Section 5 barred the use of public funds for the construction of a \r\nnon-sectarian, non-denominational chapel built at a state-owned orphans home. As \r\nthe plaintiffs point out in their response to the petition to rehearing, \r\n<i>Pryor</i> is distinguishable because the chapel was eliminating a barrier to \r\nthe exercise of religion.\r\n<p>¶14 In <i>Meyer v.

The City of Oklahoma City paid to \r\nlandscape the property and for lighting the cross. <i>Id.</i> ¶ 1, 496 P.2d at \r\n790. The Court noted that Article II, Section 5 was \"designed to prevent \r\nsectarian bodies from making raids upon the public treasury or from subjecting \r\npublic property to unauthorized sectarian uses.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 6, 496 P.2d at \r\n791. Central to the Court's analysis was the location of the cross, public \r\nproperty in a commercial setting--a \"distinctly secular environment in the midst \r\nof persons in pursuit of distinctly secular entertainment.\" <i>Id.</i> ¶ 11, 496 \r\nP.2d at 792. Improperly applying the federal Establishment Clause's analysis to \r\nArticle II, Section 5,<b> </b>and presuming the cross to be secular, the Court \r\nexamined the cross in light of the location, ruling that it \"cannot be said to \r\ndisplay, articulate or portray, except in a most evanescent form, any ideas that \r\nare alleged to pertain to any of the sectarian institutions or systems named in \r\nArt. 2, § 5.\" <i>Id.</i> \r\n<p>¶15 I find the <i>Meyer</i> opinion to be lacking in value. First, it relied \r\nin part on <i>Williamson</i>, </p><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1959</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">207</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2615416\"><a href=\"/opinion/2615416/state-v-williamson/\"><span class=\"volume\">347</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, which is discredited. Second, it is \r\nabsent of analysis on and misstates the actual nature of the cross itself. \r\n<i>Id.</i> Third, by improperly applying the federal analysis to the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution, it created an unprecedented distinction in Article II, Section 5 \r\nby examining the nature of the public property (commercial, residential, or \r\ngovernmental). This distinction is nonexistent in and repugnant to the plain \r\nlanguage of the constitutional provision. <i>See id.</i> <i>Meyer </i>is an \r\nanomaly in our jurisprudence, and no other case adopts the distinction of the \r\nproperty's nature. This Court should place no weight on its holding or analysis, \r\nand I would explicitly overrule it.<sup>3</sup>\r\n<p>¶16 None of the cases cited by the Commission or other cases where this Court \r\nhas undertaken an analysis under Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution changes this Court's construction of the provision or holding that \r\nthe Ten Commandments Monument on the state capitol complex violates Article II, \r\nSection 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution.</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">Blaine Amendments</p>\r\n<p>¶17 Any reliance on Article II, Section 5 as a Blaine Amendment is misplaced. \r\nIt is apparent from a comparison of the Oklahoma Constitution and the Blaine \r\nAmendment that Article II, Section 5 is not taken from the Blaine Amendment. The \r\nBlaine Amendment was proposed by Congressman James Blaine as an amendment to the \r\nfederal constitution in the late 1870's in an attempt to boost his bid for the \r\npresidency. Steven K. Green, <i>The Blaine Amendment Reconsidered</i>, 36 Am. J. \r\nLegal Hist. 38, 38 (1992) [hereinafter <i>The Blaine Amendment</i>]. At the time \r\nthe Catholics wanted funding for their schools and, when denied, sought to ban \r\nthe practice of daily readings of the protestant King James Verison of the Bible \r\nin schools. <i>Id.</i> at 41, 44.</p>\r\n<p>¶18 The Blaine Amendment provides:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>1. No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or \r\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no religious test shall ever be \r\nrequired as qualification to any office or public trust under any State. No \r\npublic property and no public revenue of, nor any loan of credit by or under the \r\nauthority of, the United States, or any State, Territory, District, or municipal \r\ncorporation, shall be appropriated to or made or used for the support of any \r\nschool, educational or other institution under the control of any religious or \r\nanti-religious sect, organization, or denomination, or wherein the particular \r\ncreed or tenets of any religious or anti-religious sect, organization, or \r\ndenomination, shall be taught. And no such particular creed or tenets shall be \r\nread or taught in any school or institution supported in whole or in part by \r\nsuch revenue or loan of credit; and no such appropriation or loan of credit \r\nshall be made to any religious or anti-religious sect, organization, or \r\ndenomination, or to promote its interests or tenets. This article shall not be \r\nconstrued to prohibit the reading of the Bible in any school or institution; and \r\nit shall not have the effect to impair rights of property already vested. </p>\r\n<p>Sec. 2. Congress shall have power, by appropriate legislation, to provide for \r\nthe prevention and punishment of violations of this article. </p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>4 Cong. Rec. 5453 (1876).</p>\r\n<p>¶19 The first sentence of the Blaine Amendment imposed the Establishment \r\nClause's restrictions on states, as it was believed to only apply to the federal \r\ngovernment at the time. <i>The Blaine Amendment</i>, at 50-51. Oklahoma's \r\nestablishment clause restriction is found at Article I, Section 2 of the \r\nOklahoma Constitution. </p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>Perfect toleration of religious sentiment shall be secured, and no inhabitant \r\nof the State shall ever be molested in person or property on account of his or \r\nher mode of religious worship; and no religious test shall be required for the \r\nexercise of civil or political rights. . . .</p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>Okla. Const. art. I, § 2.</p><sup>4</sup> Aside from imposing the federal Establishment Clause's restriction on \r\nstates, the Blaine Amendment deals only with appropriations to benefit sectarian \r\neducational institutions. Oklahoma's provision dealing with appropriations for \r\nthe benefit of sectarian schools is found at Article I, Section 5, which \r\nprovides:\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>Provisions shall be made for the establishment and maintenance of a system of \r\npublic schools, which shall be open to all the children of the state and free \r\nfrom sectarian control . . . .</p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>Unlike Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution, the Blaine \r\nAmendment does not, except for educational institutions, address the use of \r\nstate property for the direct or indirect benefit of a religion or system of \r\nreligion. Because the Blaine Amendment does not contain a general prohibition on \r\nthe use of state property to benefit religion, Article II, Section 5 of the \r\nOklahoma Constitution cannot be seen as a Blaine Amendment. </p>\r\n<p>¶20 Article II, Section 5 makes no mention of schools, the Catholic Church, \r\nor the Blaine Amendment. Article II, Section 5 is a very simple, \r\nstraight-forward statement of our founders that no public money or public \r\nproperty shall be used to support religious activity. Article II, Section 5's \r\nsimple, very clear statement applies to everyone's religion equally. Our \r\nfounders considered it good public policy.</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">II. Federal Establishment Clause</p>\r\n<p>¶21 Although the issues are limited to the Oklahoma Constitution, I address \r\nthe federal Establishment Clause only because the Commission argues that it is \r\nappropriate. Oklahoma's establishment clause compared with the federal \r\nEstablishment Clause is far more specific in its limitations on state action. \r\nThe federal Establishment Clause provides, in part: \"Congress shall make no law \r\nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise \r\nthereof . . . .\" U.S. Const. amend. I. It is evident from the difference in \r\nlanguage used in Article II, Section 5 of Oklahoma Constitution and the federal \r\nEstablishment Clause that they require different analyses.</p>\r\n<p>¶22 While a violation of Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution \r\nmay also violate the federal Establishment Clause, a state can always restrict \r\nits government's powers beyond the limits imposed on state action by the federal \r\nconstitution. <i>Alva State Bank &amp; Trust Co. v.

The \r\nCommission fails to explain and fails to support its position with any authority \r\nto the contrary.\r\n<p>¶23 Interestingly, and wrongly in my opinion, the defendant and the \r\nLegislature heavily relied on <i>Van Orden v. Perry</i>, </p><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799990\"><a href=\"/opinion/799990/van-orden-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span> (2005), for the constitutionality of \r\nand framework for erecting the monument in the present case. On June 27, 2005, \r\nthe United States Supreme Court decided <i>Van Orden</i>, a plurality opinion,<sup>5</sup> and <i>McCreary County, Kentucky v. American \r\nCivil Liberties Union of Kentucky</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799993\"><a href=\"/opinion/799993/mccreary-county-v-american-civil-liberties-union-of-ky/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span> (2005), in which five Justices concurred in the \r\nSupreme Court's opinion. In my opinion, <i>McCreary</i> is analogous to the \r\npresent case, whereas <i>Van Orden</i> is not. These two United States Supreme \r\nCourt cases, like the case presently before us, involve placement of the Ten \r\nCommandments on government property.\r\n<p>¶24 There are several similarities between the monument on the Oklahoma state \r\ncapitol complex and the Ten Commandments display in <i>McCreary</i>. Both \r\noriginally stood segregated from any other historically significant monuments or \r\ndisplays. Both displays were initiated by the governing legislative body with a \r\nstated purpose of the display being of historical value but lacking any context \r\nto indicate an object beyond the religious nature of the text. Both were \r\ndisplayed only shortly before the legal attack seeking their removal and neither \r\nwere long-installed displays. The monument on the Oklahoma state capitol complex \r\nis more religious in nature than the Ten Commandments display in <i>McCreary \r\n</i>because the Oklahoma monument has the additional language, \"I AM the LORD \r\nthy God,\" which was not present in<i> McCreary</i>. </p>545 U.S. at 852, 855, 869. In contrast, the monument \r\nupheld as constitutional in <i>Van Orden</i> was in place forty years before it \r\nwas legally challenged.\r\n<p>¶25 Concurring in judgment, Justice Breyer cast the deciding vote in <i>Van \r\nOrden</i>. While the deciding factor for the four concurring Justices was the \r\nmonument's purpose, the deciding factor for Justice Breyer was the length of \r\ntime the Texas monument had been in place before being challenged. Justice \r\nBreyer found <i>Van Orden</i> to be a borderline case. My reading of Justice \r\nBreyer's opinion concurring in result leads me to the conclusion that had the \r\nlongevity factor been absent, as it is here and in <i>McCreary</i>, the Texas \r\nmonument would not have passed constitutional scrutiny under the Establishment \r\nClause. Further, while the Texas monument was identical in wording to the \r\nmonument here, the less sectarian language on the Kentucky display that was \r\nunconstitutional shows that wording alone is not the determining factor. </p>\r\n<p>¶26 If a federal analysis is needed in the future, this case is without \r\nquestion much more analogous to <i>McCreary</i> than <i>Van Orden</i>. Under a \r\nproper federal analysis, this monument would likely be held unconstitutional \r\nunder the First Amendment.</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">III. Ten Commandments' Historical Significance </p>\r\n<p>¶27 While agreeing that the Ten Commandments has historical significance, it \r\nis above all a religious symbol, and there is no basis to determine that the \r\nmonument is primarily historical. Article II, Section 5 does not provide an \r\nexception for a religious monument that may be of some historical value. Article \r\nII, Section 5 is clear; legislative intent, the nature of the placement of a \r\nreligious monument, its historical value, and whether a reasonable person would \r\nbe offended are irrelevant; and any reliance on these factors in applying \r\nArticle II, Section 5 is misplaced. The only question here is whether the \r\nmonument benefits a system of religion. The Ten Commandments is an iconic symbol \r\nof the Christian religion and is inherently religious. Further, with the initial \r\ninscription being \"I AM the LORD thy God,\" the monument needs no external \r\nreferences to know that it is primarily and foremostly religious. It is honored \r\nin the Judeo-Christian system of religion for its religious significance.</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>Twenty-five years ago in a case prompted by posting the Ten Commandments in \r\nKentucky's public schools, this Court recognized that the Commandments \"are \r\nundeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths\" and held that their \r\ndisplay in public classrooms violated the First Amendment's bar against \r\nestablishment of religion. <i>Stone</i> found a predominantly religious purpose \r\nin the government's posting of the Commandments, given their prominence as \"'an \r\ninstrument of religion . . . .'\"</p></dir></dir><i>\r\n</i><p>McCreary, </p>545 U.S. at 859 (internal citations omitted). Simply, the monument's placement on state \r\nproperty supports and benefits a system of religion in violation of Article II, \r\nSection 5.\r\n<p>¶28 Nonetheless, I would note that the historical value of the Ten \r\nCommandments is a recognition of the role they played in religion.</p><sup>6</sup> The Ten Commandments are an iconic historic \r\nreligious text from the Old Testament. However, the Ten Commandments are not \r\nmentioned in the Federalist Papers, the Declaration of Independence, the United \r\nStates Constitution, or the Bill of Rights. Paul Finkelman, <i>Ten Commandments \r\nMonuments and the First Amendment</i>, 22 Okla.

CONCLUSION</p>\r\n<p>¶29 The plaintiffs brought their challenge to the Ten Commandments monument's \r\nplacement on state property and the Capitol Preservation Commission's actions \r\nunder Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution. The monument is an \r\nicon of the Judeo-Christian system of religion and is now situated on state \r\nproperty. Its placement on state property benefits the Judeo-Christian system of \r\nreligion in violation of Article II, Section 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution. The \r\nquestions of whether artworks housed in the State Capitol or other alarmist \r\nextraneous issues raised violate Article II, Section 5 are not before this \r\nCourt. Article II, Section 5 applies to all religions equally by preventing the \r\nuse of public funds or property for any religious benefit. A conservative, \r\nstrict construction of the law leads to the conclusion that the Ten Commandments \r\nmonument's location on state property is a clear violation of a straightforward, \r\nunambigious provision of the Oklahoma Constitution. </p>\r\n<p align=\"center\">APPENDIX</p>\r\n<p><br><br></p>\r\n<p>Ten Commandments Monuments on the North Plaza of the Oklahoma State Capitol. \r\n</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">FOOTNOTES</p>\r\n<p><sup>1</sup> This axiom was expressed by Justice Scalia when he stated: \r\n\"Words have meaning.

II, § 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution,<sup>1</sup> on rehearing, the Attorney General continues to rely on <u>Van Orden v. \r\nPerry</u>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799990\"><a href=\"/opinion/799990/van-orden-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> \r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span> (2005), \r\narguing that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a nearly \r\nidentical Ten Commandments monument at the Texas State Capitol under the \r\nEstablishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.<sup>2</sup> While the words and symbols on the monument at \r\nthe Oklahoma State Capitol are the same as the Texas monument, the similarities \r\nbetween the two cases stop there. The Attorney General fails to mention that the \r\nTen Commandments monument at the Texas State Capitol has been in place since \r\n1961 and was donated to the state as \"one of over a hundred largely identical \r\nmonoliths, and of over a thousand paper replicas, distributed to state and local \r\ngovernments throughout the Nation over the course of several decades\" by the \r\nFraternal Order of Eagles.<sup>3</sup> Additionally, the Ten Commandments monument at the Texas State Capitol \r\n\"sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers . . . \r\n[in a] setting [that] does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other \r\nreligious activity.\"<sup>4</sup> In contrast, the Ten Commandments monument at the Oklahoma State Capitol \r\n<u>was not</u> erected as part of the Fraternal Order of Eagles program of the \r\n1950s and 1960s, but was installed in <u>November of 2012</u> as a result of the \r\npassage of the Ten Commandments Monument Display Act by the Oklahoma Legislature \r\nand subsequent donations by private parties. The monument at the Oklahoma State \r\nCapitol sits alone on the north side of the Capitol, a location specifically \r\nselected as a \"serene, reflective setting\" and \"one which supports the \r\nreflective purpose for the individual\" in relation to the monument.<sup>5</sup> The monument at the Texas State Capitol went \r\nunchallenged for more than forty years; the monument at the Oklahoma State \r\nCapitol was challenged less than a year after it was installed. </p>\r\n<p>¶3 And although the Attorney General asks us to rely on the <u>Van Orden</u> \r\ncase, he does not mention <u>McCreary County v. American Civil Liberties Union \r\nof Kentucky</u>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799993\"><a href=\"/opinion/799993/mccreary-county-v-american-civil-liberties-union-of-ky/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">844</span></a></span> (2005), which was decided the same day as <u>Van Orden</u>, wherein the \r\nU.S. Supreme Court struck down a Ten Commandments display at a Kentucky \r\ncourthouse.<sup>6</sup> In <u>McCreary</u>, the Ten \r\nCommandments display at the Kentucky courthouse was first installed in the \r\nsummer of 1999 and was challenged almost immediately in November of 1999. \r\nDistinguishing the Texas case from the Kentucky case, Justice Breyer wrote: </p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>This case also differs from <i>McCreary County</i>, <b>where the short (and \r\nstormy) history of the courthouse Commandments' displays demonstrates the \r\nsubstantially religious objectives of those who mounted them</b>, and the effect \r\nof this readily apparent objective upon those who view them. That history there \r\nindicates a governmental effort substantially to promote religion, not simply an \r\neffort primarily to reflect, historically, the secular impact of a religiously \r\ninspired document. And, in today's world, in a Nation of so many different \r\nreligious and comparable nonreligious fundamental beliefs, <b>a more \r\ncontemporary state effort to focus attention upon a religious text is certainly \r\nlikely to prove divisive in a way that this longstanding, pre-existing monument \r\n[in Texas] has not.</b><sup>7</sup> </p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>The same can be said in the case before us--almost immediately after the \r\nmonument's installation at the Oklahoma State Capitol, the storm began. Not only \r\nwas a lawsuit filed within months of the installation of the monument, but the \r\nOklahoma Capitol Preservation Commission was forced to put a moratorium on \r\nmonument requests because numerous groups either applied to have their own \r\nsymbols erected or threatened litigation.<sup>8</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶4 Whether or not the Ten Commandments monument at the Oklahoma State Capitol \r\npasses constitutional muster under the Establishment Clause of the First \r\nAmendment to the U.S. Constitution is <u>not</u> before this Court. But a host \r\nof federal courts have struck down similar Ten Commandments displays under the \r\nEstablishment Clause. In <u>Books v. City of Elkhart, Indiana</u>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771474\"><a href=\"/opinion/771474/william-a-books-and-michael-suetkamp-v-city-of-elkhart-indiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span> \r\n(7th Cir. 2000), for example, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit \r\nheld that a Ten Commandments monument at the municipal building in the City of \r\nElkhart erected in 1958 by the Fraternal Order of Eagles was unconstitutional \r\nunder the Establishment Clause. More recently, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \r\nTenth Circuit held that a Ten Commandments monument erected in 2005 at the \r\nHaskell County courthouse in Stigler, Oklahoma, was unconstitutional under the \r\nEstablishment Clause. <u>Green v. Haskell County Board of Com'rs</u>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1460037\"><a href=\"/opinion/1460037/green-v-haskell-county-board-of-comrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">568</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> \r\n<span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span> (10th Cir. 2009).<sup>9</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶5 It should also be noted that in this case the Legislature completely \r\nignored the role the Oklahoma Capitol Preservation Commission <i>is supposed to \r\nplay</i> in selecting works of art to be displayed at the Oklahoma State Capitol \r\nand the Governor's Mansion. <u>See</u> 74 O.S. § 4102. Section 4104 of Title 74 provides that the Commission shall \r\n\"[e]stablish standards for the acquisition and display of works of art for \r\npublic display in the Capitol and the Governor's Mansion and select such works. \r\nSuch works of art shall be directly related to the history and culture of the \r\nState of Oklahoma.\" Additionally, section 115:10-1-2 of the Oklahoma \r\nAdministrative Code provides: \"Any foundation, group or individual interested in \r\nfinancing and donating an appropriate work of art to the State for use in the \r\nCapitol or the Governor's Mansion shall submit a written request for approval of \r\na permanent display to the Commission.\"<sup>10</sup> At no point was a written request submitted to the Commission for \r\napproval, nor did the Commission affirmatively vote to authorize the placement \r\nof the Ten Commandments monument.<sup>11</sup> The Commission had no input with regard to the design of the monument,<sup>12</sup> and the only vote taken by the Commission with \r\nregard to the monument was its location on the Capitol grounds.<sup>13</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶6 Instead, the Legislature passed the Ten Commandments Monument Display Act, \r\nwhich was signed into law in May of 2009, and provides in part:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>The State Capitol Preservation Commission or designee is hereby authorized to \r\npermit and arrange for the placement on the State Capitol grounds of a suitable \r\nmonument displaying the Ten Commandments. The Ten Commandments monument shall \r\nuse the same words used on the monument at issue in <i>Van Orden v. Perry</i>, \r\nthat the United State Supreme Court ruled constitutional. This monument shall be \r\ndesigned, constructed, and placed on Capitol grounds by private entities at no \r\nexpense to the State of Oklahoma. The State Capitol Preservation Commission or \r\ndesignee is authorized to assist private entities in selecting a location for \r\nthe monument and arranging a suitable time for its placement.<sup>14</sup> </p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>The Act was sponsored by State Representative Mike Ritze of Broken Arrow, who \r\nis an \"[o]rdained Southern Baptist Deacon and Sunday School teacher.\"<sup>15</sup> Representative Ritze not only voted to approve \r\nthe Act, but after the passage of the Act, Representative Ritze <b>personally \r\ncontracted</b> with SI Memorials for the creation of the monument.<sup>16</sup> All work done on the monument itself was \r\nfinanced by Representative Ritze through private funds, and the monument \r\nspecifically, and prominently, states that it was \"presented to the people of \r\nOklahoma by Dr. Mike and Connie Ritze and children Amity, Heidi and Jamey\".<sup>17</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶7 As this Court held in its Per Curiam opinion, the plain language of Art. \r\nII, § 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution mandates the removal of the monument:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>§ 5. Public money or property - Use for sectarian purposes.</p>\r\n<p>No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, or \r\nused, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, \r\nchurch, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support \r\nof any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary, or \r\nsectarian institution as such.<sup>18</sup> </p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>Our Per Curiam opinion issued in this case, in my view, implicitly overruled \r\n<u>Meyer v. Oklahoma City</u>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1170594\"><a href=\"/opinion/1170594/meyer-v-oklahoma-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span>, where this Court upheld the \r\ndisplaying of a fifty-foot cross at the state fairgrounds. I would explicitly \r\noverrule <u>Meyer</u> as that case was wrongly decided.<sup>19</sup> Regardless, <u>Meyer</u> is clearly \r\ndistinguishable from this case. In <u>Meyer</u>, the Court said: </p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>The cross is in a distinctly secular environment in the midst of persons in \r\npursuit of distinctly secular entertainment. Notwithstanding the alleged \r\nsectarian conceptions of the individuals who sponsored the installation of this \r\ncross, it cannot be said to display, articulate or portray, except in a most \r\nevanescent form, any ideas that are alleged to pertain to any of the sectarian \r\ninstitutions or systems named in Art. 2, § 5. The alleged commercial setting in \r\nwhich the cross now stands and the commercial atmosphere that obscures whatever \r\nsuggestions may emanate from its silent form, stultify its symbolism and vitiate \r\nany use, benefit or support for any sect, church, denomination, system of \r\nreligion or sectarian institution as such.<sup>20</sup></p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>¶8 In this case, the Ten Commandments monument is<b> permanently placed on \r\nthe grounds of our State Capitol--the heart of our state government and \"the \r\ncivic home of every one of the State's citizens.\"</b></p><sup>21</sup><b> </b>The fact that the \"monument 'is installed on \r\npublic property implies official recognition and reinforcement of its message. \r\nThat implication is especially strong when the sign stands in front of the seat \r\nof government itself.'\"<sup>22</sup> In fact, \"the seat of government 'is so plainly under government \r\nownership and control' that every display on its property is marked implicitly \r\nwith governmental approval.\"<sup>23</sup> \r\n<p>¶9 And the monument itself is not silent, but displays the following message: \r\n</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>the Ten Commandments<br>I AM the LORD thy God. <br>Thou shalt have no other \r\ngods before me. <br>Thou shalt not make to thyself any graven images.<br>Thou \r\nshalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.<br>Remember the Sabbath \r\nday, to keep it holy.<br>Honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be \r\nlong upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.<br>Thou shalt not \r\nkill.<br>Thou shalt not commit adultery.<br>Thou shalt not steal.<br>Thou shalt \r\nnot bear false witness against thy neighbor.<br>Thou shalt not covet thy \r\nneighbor's house.<br>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife, nor his \r\nmanservant, nor his maidservant, nor his cattle, nor anything that is thy \r\nneighbors.</p></dir></dir><sup>24</sup> \r\n<p>¶10 The legislative findings included in the Ten Commandments Display Act \r\nstate that the \"Ten Commandments are an important component of the foundation of \r\nthe laws and legal system of the United State of America and of the State of \r\nOklahoma.\"</p><sup>25</sup> But a self-serving declaration within \r\nthe statute stating that the purpose of the monument is secular is of no \r\nmeaning. <u>Stone</u>, 449 U.S. at 41. \r\n<p>¶11 \"Attempts to secularize what is unquestionably a sacred text defy \r\ncredibility and disserve people of faith.\"</p><sup>26</sup> The Ten Commandments are \"plainly religious in nature,\" and are \r\n\"undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths.\"<sup>27</sup> \"For many followers, the Commandments represent \r\nthe literal word of God as spoken to Moses and repeated to his followers after \r\ndescending from Mount Sinai.\"<sup>28</sup> The monument focuses \"not only on subjects that are the legitimate \r\nconcern of civil authorities, but also subjects that are beyond the ken of any \r\ngovernment and that address directly the relationship of the individual human \r\nbeing and God.\"<sup>29</sup> \"[T]he first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of \r\nbelievers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the \r\nLord's name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.\"<sup>30</sup> \r\n<p>¶12 But even the \"universally accepted prohibitions (as against murder, \r\ntheft, and the like)\" rest on \"the sanction of the divinity proclaimed at the \r\nbeginning of the text.\"</p><sup>31</sup> As the Court stated in <u>McCreary County</u>: \"This is not to deny that \r\nthe Commandments have had influence on civil or secular law; a major text of a \r\nmajority religion is bound to be felt. The point is simply that the original \r\ntext viewed in its entirety is unmistakably religious statement dealing with \r\nreligious obligations and with morality subject to religious sanction.\"<sup>32</sup> Stripping the Ten Commandments of their \r\nreligious significance and characterizing them as secular and a component of the \r\nfoundation of the laws of this State trivializes the sacred nature of the text \r\nand degrades those individuals who <u>truly</u> believe the Ten Commandments are \r\na covenant between God and His people. \r\n<p>¶13 The legislative authorization eschewing a religious meaning also includes \r\nSection C of the Ten Commandments Display Act, which simply cannot be ignored: \r\n</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>In the event that the legality or the constitutionality of the Ten \r\nCommandments monument is challenged in a court of law, the Oklahoma Attorney \r\nGeneral or Liberty Legal Institute is hereby authorized to prepare and present a \r\nlegal defense of the monument.</p></dir></dir><sup>33</sup> \r\n<p>Not only is the Liberty Legal Institute named specifically in the Act, but an \r\nattorney for the Liberty Legal Institute entered an appearance on behalf of the \r\nCommission in the District Court shortly after the Attorney General filed his \r\nAnswer in the case, and that same attorney also entered an appearance in this \r\ncase on appeal on behalf of the Commission. The Liberty Legal Institute</p><sup>34</sup> is based out of Plano, Texas, with its stated \r\nmission to \"defend and restore religious liberty across America--in our schools, \r\nfor our churches, inside the military, and throughout the public arena.\"<sup>35</sup> The \"Liberty Institute fights to restore \r\nreligious liberty pursuant to the principles of America's founders--that \r\nreligious freedom does not mean confining religious expression to church or \r\nhome, but that true religious liberty consists of recognizing individuals' \r\nGod-given right to follow their conscience and to live and act according to \r\ntheir faith in every area of life.\"<sup>36</sup> With regard to the Ten Commandments monuments, the Liberty Institute \r\nwebsite states:\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>Liberty Institute is committed to enforcing the law that allows Ten \r\nCommandments displays in every state across the nation.

The difference between the two versions \r\nis not merely semantic; rather, it is but one example of a deep theological \r\ndispute.\"<sup>42</sup> Displaying this particular version of \r\nthe Ten Commandments on the grounds of the State Capitol not only violates the \r\nOklahoma Constitution but also \"invariably places the State at the center of a \r\nserious sectarian dispute[.]\"<sup>43</sup> \r\n<p>¶15 The monument at the State Capitol also includes two Stars of David and \r\nthe \"Greek letters Chi and Rho as the familiar monogram of Christ,\"</p><sup>44</sup> representing respectively Judaism and \r\nChristianity and confining its approval only to the Judeo-Christian faiths. The \r\neagle clutching the American flag at the top of the monument then specifically \r\nlinks \"these two religions, and civil government.\"<sup>45</sup> \"When the government associates one set of \r\nreligious beliefs with the state and identifies nonadherents as outsiders, it \r\nencroaches upon the individual's decision about whether and how to worship.\"<sup>46</sup> \r\n<p>¶16 Finally, in spite of the court filings in this case, which conclude that \r\nArt. II, § 5, of the Oklahoma Constitution is a Blaine Amendment,</p><sup>47</sup> nothing in the recorded history of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitutional Convention, this Court's case law, or any other historical \r\nevidence supports this conclusion. In fact, all evidence is to the contrary. In \r\n1875, Republican presidential candidate and Congressman James Blaine proposed an \r\namendment to the U.S. Constitution, specifically targeting the funding of \r\nreligious schools with public money.<sup>48</sup> \"The Amendment came about at a time of heightened controversy over the \r\nreligious character of American public education and the public funding of \r\nprivate religious schooling, primarily Catholic parochial schools.\"<sup>49</sup> \r\n<p>¶17 After failing to secure the Republican nomination for President, \r\nCongressman Blaine abandoned the cause and did not vote on the amendment or take \r\npart in any of the debates surrounding the amendment.</p><sup>50</sup> The amendment passed the House of \r\nRepresentatives, but failed to receive the necessary approval from the Senate.<sup>51</sup> Congressman Blaine's quick abandonment of the \r\namendment has led some scholars to conclude that the \"modern-day emphasis placed \r\non the Blaine Amendment is misplaced,\"<sup>52</sup> and that the attempted passage of the Blaine Amendment shows \"our \r\nnation's continual willingness to use religious issues for political ends.\"<sup>53</sup> \r\n<p>¶18 Regardless, in 1889, a Republican-controlled Congress resurrected \r\nremnants of the failed Blaine Amendment in the Enabling Act of 1889, mandating \r\nthat \"four new states--Washington, Montana, North and South Dakota--include[] \r\nno-funding provisions in their constitutions\" to become states.</p><sup>54</sup> From there, a no-funding provision was added to \r\nOklahoma's Enabling Act in 1906, mandating \"[t]hat provisions shall be made for \r\nthe establishment and maintenance of a system of public schools, which shall be \r\nopen to all the children of said State and free from sectarian control . . . \r\n.\"<sup>55</sup> \r\n<p>¶19 The Oklahoma Constitutional Convention adopted the language of the \r\nEnabling Act verbatim into our Constitution in <b><u>Article I, § 5</u></b> of \r\nthe Oklahoma Constitution entitled \"Public schools,\" which states: \"Provisions \r\nshall be made for the establishment and maintenance of a system of public \r\nschools, which shall be open to all children of the state and free from \r\nsectarian control . . . .\"</p><sup>56</sup> Although the adoption of such language by the Oklahoma Constitutional \r\nConvention <u>could have</u> been based on the unabashedly biased attitude \r\ntoward Catholic parochial schools found in the failed Blaine Amendment, my \r\nreview of the debates and proceedings of the Convention does not reflect such \r\nattitudes.<sup>57</sup> <b>Nevertheless, what is clear is \r\nthat the broader mandates of <u>Art. II, § 5</u> cannot be found in the Enabling \r\nAct and concluding that Art. II, § 5 was the corollary to such language in the \r\nEnabling Act is error.</b><sup>58</sup> \r\n<p>¶20 As noted by R.L. Williams, a former Chief Justice of this Court and a \r\ndelegate to the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, Art. II, § 5 of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution traces its origins to the Massachusetts Bill of Rights of 1780 \r\npassed ninety-five years before the Blaine Amendment, the Michigan Constitution \r\nof 1835 passed some forty years before the Blaine Amendment, the Missouri \r\nConstitution of 1820 passed more than fifty years before the Blaine Amendment, \r\nand the New Jersey Constitution of 1776 passed almost 100 years before the \r\nBlaine Amendment.</p><sup>59</sup> \r\n<p>¶21 In <u>Connell v.

II, § 5 shortly after the ratification of the \r\nOklahoma Constitution:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>This section not only guards the citizens right to be free from taxation for \r\nthe support of the church, but protects the rights of all denominations, however \r\nfew the number of their respective adherents, by with-holding any incentive that \r\nmight prompt any ecclesiastical body to participate in political struggles and \r\nby reason of their numbers exert an undue influence and become beneficiaries at \r\nthe expense of the public and a menace to weaker denominations and ultimately \r\ndestructive of religious liberty.</p></dir></dir><sup>62</sup> \r\n<p>¶23 More recent annotations also make no mention of the failed Blaine \r\nAmendment in their discussions of Art. II, § 5: \"This provision relating to the \r\nchurch-state issue is much more explicit than that found in the U.S. \r\nConstitution.\"</p><sup>63</sup> A study of the Oklahoma Constitution by the League of Women Voters \r\nprovides: \"The Oklahoma Bill of Rights further details the separation of church \r\nand state by denying the use of state money or property for the benefit of any \r\nparticular religious sect or denomination.\"<sup>64</sup> \r\n<p>¶24 A comparison of the text of the failed Blaine Amendment and the text of \r\nArt. II, § 5 also reveals that Art. II, § 5 is broader than the Blaine Amendment \r\nand does not limit its application only to schools. Art. II, § 5 states: </p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, or \r\nused, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any sect, \r\nchurch, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, or support \r\nof any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or dignitary, or \r\nsectarian institution as such.</p></dir></dir><sup>65</sup> \r\n<p>Whereas the failed Blaine Amendment provided:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion or \r\nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any \r\nState for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund \r\ntherefore, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control \r\nof any religious sect, nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be \r\ndivided between religious sects or denominations.</p></dir></dir><sup>66</sup> <b>\r\n</b><p>Characterizing Art. II, § 5 of the Oklahoma Constitution as a Blaine \r\nAmendment completely ignores the intent of the founders of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution who purposely sought to ensure future generations of Oklahomans \r\nwould be free to practice religious freedom without fear of governmental \r\nintervention.</p><sup>67</sup><b> </b>\r\n<p>¶25 Justice O'Connor wrote in the <u>McCreary County</u> case:</p>\r\n<dir>\r\n<dir>\r\n<p>At a time when we see around the world the violent consequences of the \r\nassumption of religious authority by government, Americans may count themselves \r\nfortunate: Our regard for constitutional boundaries has protected us from \r\nsimilar travails, while allowing private religious exercise to flourish. The \r\nwell-known statement that '[w]e are a religious people,' has proved true. . . . \r\nThose who would renegotiate the boundaries between church and state must \r\ntherefore answer a difficult question: Why would we trade a system that has \r\nserved us so well for one that has served others so poorly?<sup>68</sup> </p></dir></dir>\r\n<p>The constitutional guarantees of separation of church and state in many state \r\nconstitutions \"reflect their origin in specific disputes about the relationship \r\nbetween church and state . . . and represent considered constitutional judgments \r\nabout contentious church-state issues.\"<sup>69</sup> Art. II, § 5 in our Constitution is no different. Mr. Ellis wrote: \"The \r\nConvention, knowing the history of the union of Church and State in Europe and \r\nin New England in Colonial days, profited by the lessons of the past and made it \r\nimpossible to appropriate or give to any church denomination or ecclesiastical \r\nservant or any religious institution, as such; the money or property of the \r\npublic.\"<sup>70</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶26 Mr. Ellis went on to state that Art. II, § 5 \"is one of the wisest \r\nprovisions of our organic law. If there should ever be a demand by any \r\necclesiastical body that any part or portion of the public funds or any public \r\nproperty, be diverted to the use or benefit of any church or denomination or any \r\nof its servants, or for the support of any religious institution, as such; this \r\nsection will be found to be one of the safest of our safeguards.\"<sup>71</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶27 This generation has the same obligation today as the Founders did in 1907 \r\nto protect the Constitution of our State, lest future generations review it in a \r\ncasual way. As one member <i>of the clergy</i> wrote in 1923: \"The People of \r\nthis State should see to it well that [Art. II, § 5] in the bill of rights is \r\nnever emasculated or nullified by any future convention, by one jot or title, \r\nbut left intact as one of the imperishable provisions of the organic law \r\nprotecting the people in their right against any encroachment by any \r\necclesiastical organization.\"<sup>72</sup> </p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">FOOTNOTES</p>\r\n<p><sup>1</sup> <u>Michigan v.

The Per Curiam opinion's strict reading of Okla. \r\nConst. art. 2, § 5 ignores the context-based analysis we used in <i>Meyer v. \r\nOklahoma City, </i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1170594\"><a href=\"/opinion/1170594/meyer-v-oklahoma-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span>, and does not overrule that opinion. \r\nThe Appellee's need for clarification is apparent.</p>\r\n<p>¶2 The framers of the Oklahoma Constitution, although having strong views \r\nbehind the creation of Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 did not believe its provisions \r\nprohibited government acknowledgement of religion. Indeed, the first words of \r\nthe Preamble to the Oklahoma Constitution state \"[i]nvoking the guidance of \r\nAlmighty God, in order to secure and perpetuate the blessing of liberty.\" This \r\nCourt has previously determined, \"[i]t is not the exposure to religious \r\ninfluence that is to be avoided; it is the adoption of sectarian principles or \r\nthe monetary support of one or several or all sects that the state must not do.\" \r\n<i>Murrow Indian Orphans Home v. Childers, </i><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1946</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></span>, ¶7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3816889\"><a href=\"/opinion/4059371/murrow-indian-orphans-home-v-childers/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>. I do not believe the intent or \r\neffect behind this Ten Commandments Monument (\"Monument\") was for the adoption \r\nof sectarian principles. My belief is based not only on our context-based \r\nanalysis in <i>Meyer</i><sup>3</sup><i> </i>but also on the standard the district court and the parties agreed \r\nwas proper to use in this analysis; one based on federal jurisprudence in \r\nEstablishment Clause cases.</p>\r\n<p>¶3 In its petition for rehearing, the Appellee asserts \r\nfederal Establishment Clause precedent is relevant to this case.<sup>4</sup> I agree. The long and evolved federal \r\njurisprudence concerning alleged unconstitutional monuments and displays is \r\ninformative and persuasive in determining the meaning of \"support\" a \"system of \r\nreligion\" in our own constitution.<sup>5</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶4 At the hearing on summary judgment the district court used an \"objective \r\nstandard\" in finding the Monument did not violate Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5.<sup>6</sup> The attorney for the Appellant believed at the \r\nhearing that this was the proper standard; however, he appears to have \r\ninterpreted the standard differently than the court.<sup>7</sup> This objective standard evaluates whether or not \r\na reasonable observer, aware of the history and context of the community in \r\nwhich the conduct occurs, would view the government action as having a principle \r\nor primary effect of advancing or endorsing religion, or as here, government \r\nsupport of a system(s) of religion. <i>See Bauchman for Bauchman v. West High \r\nSchool</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></span>, 551-52, 555 (10th Cir. 1997). This reasonable observer \r\nis an informed reasonable observer whose knowledge of the context surrounding \r\nthe alleged offending display goes outside just observing the display itself.<sup>8</sup> It is a legal standard akin to the reasonable \r\nperson standard in tort law<sup>9</sup> and does not require a court to review endless testimony of opinion from \r\nactual observers.<sup>10</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶5 In religious symbols cases, context is the touchstone. <i>Glassroth v. \r\nMoore</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">335</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></span>, 1284 (11th Cir. 2003). This is the case not only in \r\nfederal Establishment Clause jurisprudence but also in our own jurisprudence. In \r\n<i>Meyer v. Oklahoma City</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1972</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></span>, ¶11, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1170594\"><a href=\"/opinion/1170594/meyer-v-oklahoma-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span>, a 50-foot Latin Cross which was \r\nplaced on city property and whose lighting was provided by the city was \r\nchallenged for violating Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5. This Court determined the \r\ncross did not violate Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 because the commercial setting \r\nand atmosphere of the Fair Grounds obscured any suggestions that might emanate \r\nfrom the cross' silent form and further \"stultify its symbolism and vitiate any \r\nuse, benefit or support for any sect, church, denomination, system of religion \r\nor sectarian institution . . . .\" Our holding in <i>Meyer</i> can best be \r\ninterpreted as holding in Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 cases the predominant context \r\nsurrounding the challenged government action is dispositive. This is similar to \r\nthe approach used in 2005 by Justice Breyer in determining the predominant \r\ncontext surrounding the Ten Commandments monument in <i>Van Orden v. Perry</i>, \r\n<span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799990\"><a href=\"/opinion/799990/van-orden-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> \r\n<span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span> (2005). </p>\r\n<p>¶6 In <i>Van Orden</i>, the constitutionality of a Ten Commandments monument \r\non the Texas Capitol grounds was challenged as violating the Establishment \r\nClause of the United States Constitution. Justice Breyer wrote the controlling \r\nopinion for the Court.<sup>11</sup> Justice Breyer believed that even though the Ten Commandments had an \r\nundeniable religious message, focusing on its text alone could not conclusively \r\nresolve the case. <i>Id</i>. at 701. He determined in order to resolve what the \r\ntext of the message conveyed, the proper inquiry required the Court to \"examine \r\nhow the text is <i>used</i>\" by considering the context of the display. \r\n<i>Id</i>. He found the text of the Ten Commandments can also be used in a \r\nsecular way to convey a general moral message about proper social conduct or in \r\na historical way to show a relation between its standards and the law. The \r\nlatter he believed is why so many courthouses throughout the Nation, including \r\nthe Supreme Court, displayed the tablets in some form. He determined the \r\ncircumstances surrounding the monument's placement at the Texas Capitol and its \r\nphysical setting suggested the State intended its secular message to \r\npredominate. <i>Id</i>. </p>\r\n<p>¶7 Title <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ohio St.</span> <span class=\"page\">2011</span></span>, § \r\n4110 (HB 1330) \r\nproclaimed the Monument was not meant to be construed to favor any particular \r\nreligion or denomination over others and it was essentially just another \r\nmonument on the Capitol grounds.<sup>12</sup> In federal jurisprudence, the courts have deferred to the professed \r\ngovernment purpose unless the secular purpose is a sham or secondary to a \r\nreligious purpose.<sup>13</sup> Where a \"plausible secular purpose\" has been demonstrated, the courts \r\nwill give deference to the government's motives.<sup>14</sup> The record is also silent as to any contravening \r\nsectarian purpose behind the Monument's placement. </p>\r\n<p>¶8 The Appellants expressly stated they were not challenging the \r\nconstitutionality of HB 1330. The Appellants are challenging the actions of the \r\nAppellee. Under federal jurisprudence, \"whether the government has endorsed a \r\nparticular religious display depends in large part on the display's particular \r\nphysical setting.\" <i>O'Connor v. Washburn University</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"166214\"><a href=\"/opinion/166214/oconnor-v-washburn-univ/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span>, 1228 \r\n(10th Cir. 2005) (citing <i>Lynch v. Donnelly</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111113\"><a href=\"/opinion/111113/lynch-v-donnelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 671, 681-82, 685 (1984)). The \r\nAppellants asserted the Appellee's placement and positioning of the Monument \r\nputs it in a prominent position leading one to conclude it represents State \r\nsupport of a system(s) of religion. The question being, regardless of purpose or \r\nintent, was the placement and positioning of the Monument done in such a way \r\nthat an informed reasonable observer would conclude it represents State support \r\nof a system(s) of religion? It appears from the record that the Monument was \r\nplaced in possibly the most inconvenient and low-trafficked part of the Capitol \r\ngrounds imaginable. Its placement on the northeast side of the Capitol Building \r\nmakes it impossible to view from the main parking lot or any entrance to the \r\nbuilding. The main parking lot and main entrance are on the south side of the \r\nCapitol Building with the other two working entrances being on the east and west \r\nsides. Because of this placement, a person inside the Capitol Building should \r\nonly be able to see the Monument through some of the windows on the east side of \r\nthe north wing and the north side of the east wing. Next to the Monument is a \r\nshort stairway that leads to the north entrance of the Capitol and is the only \r\nentrance on that side of the building. However, this nearby north entrance has \r\nbeen closed for many years. The Monument sits at the top and to the east of the \r\nstairway. The closest route from the Capitol Building to the Monument requires \r\none to leave the east or west side doors and walk a quarter of the way around \r\nthe large building. Nor does its placement provide accommodation for meditation \r\nor other religious activity. I do not believe an informed reasonable observer \r\nseeing the Monument would find that its placement or positioning rises to the \r\nlevel of being sacred or is in any way more unique than the placement of any of \r\nthe many other monuments on the Capitol grounds including the few that reside on \r\nthe north side. </p>\r\n<p>¶9 Nor do I believe that the Monument's content leads an informed reasonable \r\nobserver to conclude it supports a system(s) of religion as asserted by the \r\nAppellants. The message on the Monument's face is not the full story. What a \r\nreasonable observer is aware of \"is not limited to the 'information gleaned \r\nsimply from viewing the challenged display.'\" <i>O'Connor v. Washburn \r\nUniversity</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"166214\"><a href=\"/opinion/166214/oconnor-v-washburn-univ/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1216</span></a></span>, 1228 (citing <i>Wells v. City &amp; County of \r\nDenver</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"161267\"><a href=\"/opinion/161267/wells-v-city-and-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></a></span>, 1142-43 (10th Cir. 2001)). I agree with the reasoning \r\nof Justice Breyer in Van Orden, who found that the text of the Ten Commandments \r\nwas religious \"invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Deity,\" yet he determined that \r\nfact alone was not dispositive. <i>Van Orden v. Perry</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799990\"><a href=\"/opinion/799990/van-orden-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, 700-701 (Breyer, J., concurring). \r\nOne must review the surrounding context. Here, the surrounding context also \r\ntakes into account the plausible secular historical/legal purpose of the \r\nLegislature. In addition, the Monument includes an inscription showing it was \r\nprivately donated. Such message further distances the State from the Monument in \r\nthe mind of a reasonable observer. <i>See Card v. City of Everett</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201149\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201149/card-v-city-of-everett/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> \r\n<span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span>, 1020 (9th Cir. 2008).</p>\r\n<p>¶10 The Appellants also asserted the fact that the Monument was not made part \r\nof a larger display or coordinated series of monuments only adds to the effect \r\nthat the State was adopting sectarian principles. I disagree. I do not find the \r\nspacing or density of monuments is indicative here of an adoption of sectarian \r\nprinciples. The monuments spread throughout the Oklahoma Capitol Complex appear \r\nnot to be part of any particular spacing scheme or planned density. As the court \r\nin <i>Card v. City of Everett</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1201149\"><a href=\"/opinion/1201149/card-v-city-of-everett/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1009</span></a></span>, 1020 (9th Cir. 2008) determined in its context analysis, there is \r\nno \"quota system for monuments or a requirement for a particular density of \r\nmonuments in a given area.\" It should be noted that in Meyer there was only one \r\nmonument and it was found to be constitutional by this Court.</p>\r\n<p>¶11 Although initially raised on appeal in the Appellee's answer brief, on \r\nrehearing the parties did not brief the issue of whether Okla. Const. art. 2, § \r\n5 is a state Blaine Amendment; however, other Justices of this Court have \r\naddressed this issue. The Blaine Amendment was a failed 1870's proposed \r\namendment to the United States Constitution to bar aid to sectarian \r\ninstitutions. <i>Mitchell v. Helms</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118386\"><a href=\"/opinion/118386/mitchell-v-helms/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span>, 828 (2000). The proposed amendment \"arose at a \r\ntime of pervasive hostility to the Catholic Church and it was an open secret \r\nthat 'sectarian' was code for 'Catholic'. <i>Mitchell,</i> 530 U.S. at 828. This amendment would have applied \r\nalmost exclusively to Catholic parochial schools. <i>Id</i>. at 829. The \r\nAppellee had previously cited a 2003 law review article written by Mark E. \r\nDeForrest, for the purpose of demonstrating, after the Blaine Amendment's \r\nfailure, states adopted similar provisions in their own constitutions.<sup>15</sup> </p>\r\n<p>¶12 The parties have not cited any decision of this Court where we have \r\nreferred to Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 as an Oklahoma version of the Blaine \r\nAmendment or construed it so narrowly to only apply to sectarian institutions, \r\nor in other words, parochial schools. On this issue I would agree with the other \r\nJustices of this Court that Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 is not Oklahoma's version \r\nof a Blaine Amendment. The breadth and scope of Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5 differ \r\nsignificantly from the failed Blaine Amendment. </p>\r\n<p>¶13 In conclusion, I disagree with the Per Curiam opinion's overly narrow \r\ninterpretation of the language in Okla. Const. art. 2, § 5. Since statehood this \r\nCourt has interpreted our Constitution. I do not adopt the strict approach taken \r\nby other members of this Court in determining the meaning behind \"support\" of a \r\n\"system of religion\". Additionally, I would limit findings to the record before \r\nthe court on issues presented by the parties. I find the appropriate analysis of \r\nOkla. Const. art. 2 § 5 is a context-based analysis like that used by this Court \r\nin <i>Meyer</i> and found in federal jurisprudence. We should not lightly \r\nattribute unconstitutional motives to the government where we can discern a \r\nplausible secular purpose. I am of the opinion the facts of this case have more \r\nsimilarities to <i>Van Orden</i> than not. However, as Justice Breyer believed \r\nin <i>Van Orden</i>, I believe this case is a borderline case. A slight change \r\nin its facts could have tipped my view concerning the effect the Monument \r\nconveyed upon a reasonable observer. Today our State is composed of many \r\ndifferent religious beliefs and many persons of no religion. Wisdom, prudence \r\nand caution should be at the forefront when considering the placement of \r\ndisplays on government property. However, for the foregoing reasons, I dissent \r\nto the denial of the petition for rehearing.</p><b>\r\n</b><p align=\"center\">FOOTNOTES</p>\r\n<p><sup>1</sup> I would also restyle the case and set out Donald Chabot as a \r\nplaintiff only and not as an appellant. According to the Brief of \r\nPlaintiffs/Appellants, filed March 16, 2015, Mr. Chabot died prior to the \r\ndistrict court's ruling and is not an appellant in this case.</p>\r\n<p><sup>2</sup> <i>Tomahawk Resources, Inc. v.

The monument was a gift from another Oklahoma citizen and was \r\nplaced on the Capitol grounds pursuant to a Legislative act that was signed by \r\nthe Governor. While conceding that no public funds were expended to acquire the \r\nmonument, complainants nonetheless maintain its placement on the Capitol grounds \r\nconstitutes the use of public property for the benefit of a system of religion. \r\nSuch governmental action is forbidden by Article 2, Section 5 of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution.</p>\r\n<p>¶2 The trial court ruled that the monument did not violate Article 2, Section \r\n5 and entered a summary judgment denying complainants' request for an \r\ninjunction. This Court reviews de novo the constitutional issue and the legal \r\nquestion resolved by the summary judgment. <i>Sw. Bell Tel. Co. v. Okla. State \r\nBd. of Equalization</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630213\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630213/southwestern-bell-v-bd-of-equalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, ¶ 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630213\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630213/southwestern-bell-v-bd-of-equalization/\"><span class=\"volume\">231</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></a></span>, 641. \r\nUpon de novo review, the trial court's ruling is reversed.</p>\r\n<p>¶3 In deciding whether the State's display of the monument in question \r\nviolates Article 2, Section 5, the intent of this provision must be ascertained. \r\n<i>Draper v. State</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></span>, ¶ 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2608682\"><a href=\"/opinion/2608682/draper-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">621</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1142</span></a></span>, 1145. Such intent is \r\nfirst sought in the text of the provision.<i> Id.</i> Words of a constitutional \r\nprovision must be given their plain, natural and ordinary meaning. <i>Lepak v. \r\nMcClain</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> \r\n<span class=\"page\">166</span></span>, ¶ 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1249461\"><a href=\"/opinion/1249461/lepak-v-mcclain/\"><span class=\"volume\">844</span> \r\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span>, 854.</p>\r\n<p>¶4 The text of Article 2, Section 5 states:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n  <blockquote>\r\n    <p>§ 5. Public money or property - Use for sectarian purposes.</p>\r\n    <p>No public money or property shall ever be appropriated, applied, donated, \r\n    or used, directly or indirectly, for the use, benefit, or support of any \r\n    sect, church, denomination, or system of religion, or for the use, benefit, \r\n    or support of any priest, preacher, minister, or other religious teacher or \r\n    dignitary, or sectarian institution as such.</p></blockquote></blockquote>\r\n<p>The plain intent of Article 2, Section 5 is to ban State Government, its \r\nofficials, and its subdivisions from using public money or property for the \r\nbenefit of any religious purpose. Use of the words \"no,\" \"ever,\" and \"any\" \r\nreflects the broad and expansive reach of the ban. <i>See</i> <i>Coffee v. \r\nHenry</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2268048\"><a href=\"/opinion/2268048/coffee-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> \r\n<span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, ¶ 3, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2268048\"><a href=\"/opinion/2268048/coffee-v-henry/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> \r\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1056</span></a></span>, 1057.</p>\r\n<p>¶5 To reinforce the broad, expansive effect of Article 2, Section 5, the \r\nframers specifically banned any uses \"indirectly\" benefitting religion. As this \r\nCourt has previously observed, the word \"indirectly\" signifies the doing, by an \r\nobscure, circuitous method, something which is prohibited from being done \r\ndirectly, and includes all methods of doing the thing prohibited, except the \r\ndirect means. <i>Haynes v. Caporal</i>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></span>, ¶ 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1228516\"><a href=\"/opinion/1228516/haynes-v-caporal/\"><span class=\"volume\">571</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>, 433. \r\nProhibiting uses of public property that \"indirectly\" benefit a system of \r\nreligion was clearly done to protect the ban from circumvention based upon mere \r\nform and technical distinction.</p>\r\n<p>¶6 In authorizing its placement, the Legislature apparently believed that \r\nthere would be no legal impediment to placing the monument on the Capitol \r\ngrounds so long as (1) the text was the same as the text displayed on the Ten \r\nCommandments monument on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol, and (2) a \r\nnon-religious historic purpose was given for the placement of the monument. To \r\nbe sure, the United States Supreme Court case of <i>Van Orden v. Perry</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799990\"><a href=\"/opinion/799990/van-orden-v-perry/\"><span class=\"volume\">545</span> \r\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span> (2005), ruled that the Texas Ten Commandments monument did not violate \r\nthe Establishment Clause in the First Amendment to the United States \r\nConstitution. However, the issue in the case at hand is whether the Oklahoma Ten \r\nCommandments monument violates the Oklahoma Constitution, <i>not whether it \r\nviolates the Establishment Clause</i>. Our opinion rests solely on the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution with no regard for federal jurisprudence. <i>See</i> <i>Michigan v. \r\nLong</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111020\"><a href=\"/opinion/111020/michigan-v-long/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></a></span>, 1040-41 (1983). As concerns the \"historic purpose\" \r\njustification, the Ten Commandments are obviously religious in nature and are an \r\nintegral part of the Jewish and Christian faiths.</p>\r\n<p>¶7 Because the monument at issue operates for the use, benefit or support of \r\na sect or system of religion, it violates Article 2, Section 5 of the Oklahoma \r\nConstitution and is enjoined and shall be removed.</p>\r\n<div class=\"de-action-clause\">\r\n<p align=\"center\"><b>DISTRICT COURT'S JUDGMENT REVERSED; MATTER REMANDED FOR \r\n</b><br><b>FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION</b></p></div>\r\n<div class=\"de-vote\">\r\n<p>¶8 Reif, C.J., Kauger, Watt, Winchester, Edmondson, Taylor, Gurich, JJ., \r\nconcur.</p>\r\n<p>¶9 Combs, V.C.J., Colbert, J., dissent.</p></div></div>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<div class=\"tmp-citationizer\">\r\n\t<b><em>Citationizer<sup>©</sup> Summary of Documents Citing This Document</em></b><hr>\r\n\t<table>\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Cite</th>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Name</th>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Level</th>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t<tr><td>None Found.</td></tr>\r\n\t</tbody>\r\n\t</table>\r\n\t<b><em>Citationizer: Table of Authority</em></b><hr>\r\n\t<table>\r\n\t<thead>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Cite</th>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Name</th>\r\n\t\t<th align=\"LEFT\">Level</th>\r\n\t</thead>\r\n\t<tbody>\r\n\t<tr><td colspan=\"4\"><strong>Oklahoma Supreme Court Cases</strong></td></tr>\r\n<tr><td width=\"1%\"> </td><td width=\"25%\">Cite</td><td width=\"50%\">Name</td><td>Level</td></tr>\r\n\r\n<tr><td width=\"1%\" valign=\"top\"> </td><td width=\"25%\" valign=\"top\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1175998\"><a href=\"/opinion/1175998/tulsa-county-v-board-of-cty-comrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">1988</span> <span class=\"reporter\">OK</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">755</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">635</span></span>, 59 OBJ        1159, </td><td width=\"50%\" valign=\"top\">Alva State Bank and Trust Co. v.
