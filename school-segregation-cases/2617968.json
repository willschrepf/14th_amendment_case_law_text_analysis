If such an\ninmate meets the criteria enumerated in Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), he\nor she will be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.1 (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (f); People v. Yearwood (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 168.)\n       After the Act went into effect, Robert Luna Franco (defendant), an inmate serving\na term of 25 years to life following conviction of a felony that was not violent (as defined\nby § 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition for\nrecall of sentence and resentencing under the Act. Following a hearing addressing the\nfacts pertaining to risk of danger, the petition was denied.\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we explain that while a trial court has the\nauthority to obtain a supplemental probation officer’s report at the stage of the\nproceedings at which it must determine whether resentencing a petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, it is not required to do so. In the\nunpublished portion, we reject defendant’s claims that denial of his petition constituted\nan abuse of discretion because the trial court failed to make the requisite finding, relied\non facts unsupported and contradicted by the record, and misapprehended the scope of its\ndiscretion. We also explain the standard of proof applicable to a trial court’s ruling under\nsection 1170.126. Finally, we explain that recently enacted section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) does not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f). We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY*\n       On December 7, 1997, Bakersfield police officers searched the home of Sylvia\nRodriguez, having been informed she was selling heroin there.2 Through the open front\ndoor, an officer could see defendant inside a bedroom. Defendant appeared nervous, had\n“widened eyes” and was “‘somewhat fidgety.’” Defendant was seen to then go into the\nbathroom of the home. During the search, a tinfoil bindle containing 39 milligrams of\nheroin, a usable amount, was found under a floor mat in that bathroom. Defendant\nadmitted being a heroin user, and exhibited physical symptoms indicative of heroin use.\n       A jury convicted defendant of possession of heroin (Health & Saf. Code, § 11350,\nsubd. (a)) and he was found to have suffered two prior strike convictions. On June 9,\n1998, he was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life.\n       On February 25, 2013, defendant filed a petition to recall his sentence and be\nresentenced pursuant to the Act. He represented that his strike record consisted of two\n1990 convictions for first degree burglary and a 1992 conviction for attempted robbery,\nand asked to be resentenced to a total term of 96 months (the upper term for his\ncommitment offense, doubled pursuant to § 667, subd. (e)(1), plus one year for each of\nhis prior prison terms pursuant to § 667.5, subd. (b)).\n       The People opposed the petition. They argued defendant’s release would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. They pointed to defendant’s nine adult\nconvictions, three of which were strikes (defendant also had two juvenile adjudications\nfor strike offenses); the facts of defendant’s strike offenses; the “continuous life of crime”\ndefendant led before and after his strike convictions; and defendant’s disciplinary record\n\n\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n2      The facts are taken from our opinion in defendant’s prior appeal. (People v.\nFranco (Apr. 29, 1999, F031001 [nonpub. opn.].) By separate order, we have taken\njudicial notice of the appellate record in that case.\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fand record of rehabilitation while incarcerated. The People represented defendant had a\nrules violation report from July 2000, in which he and another inmate were engaged in\nmutual combat; a rules violation report from October 2009, in which defendant was\ninvolved in a fight with his cellmate, during which defendant stabbed the cellmate with a\npencil and then a pen3; and a rules violation report from January 2012, in which\ndefendant was involved in a fight with another inmate. The People also pointed to a\nprison record in which defendant admitted he had used heroin since the age of 14 and\nconsidered himself a drug addict, yet no record showed he attended any drug or alcohol\nclasses. The People located prison “chronos” showing defendant participated in adult\nbasic education, GED, and graphic arts classes, but found no record for vocational or job\ntraining or any work history. The People also pointed to defendant’s lack of parole plans.\n       Defendant did not file a written response or provide any information concerning\nhis in-prison efforts at rehabilitation or postrelease plans (if any).\n       The petition was heard on March 27, 2013. Defense counsel argued defendant,\nwho had “served 196 months for a dime bag of heroin,” was the type of person voters\nwanted to give an opportunity to rejoin society. Counsel further argued that getting into\nsome sort of altercation a few times in the course of 16 years in prison was “not\nunreasonable behavior given the violent and difficult environment” in which prisoners\nfind themselves.\n       The court noted it was allowed to consider the inmate’s current position, and\nwhether he presented an “extended” danger to society. It stated: “If we look at\n[defendant’s] current criminal history, there is an indication that there was a … rule\nviolation in the year of 2000 related to physical violence and confrontation in the\ninstitution. There was an additional [rules violation report] in 2009 that causes the Court\nsome grave concern in that that was an assault where he actually inflicted injury on\n3      We discuss this incident in more detail, post.\n\n\n\n                                               4.\n\fanother individual using a pen or a pencil. [¶] My concern about that is that even after\nthat assault on someone else, there appeared to have been a … rule violation, but there is\nnot any indication that the institution felt it was sufficiently significant to warrant\ncriminal prosecution.” After a discussion between the court and prosecutor about why\nsome in-prison offenses were referred for prosecution and others were not, the court\nstated:\n\n                 “[I]n light of the fact that there is the indication from his … file that\n          he actually stabbed a person with a pencil or a pen, I am going to at this\n          point deny the petition under 1170.126.\n\n                “[Defense counsel], at this point, without further foundation for\n          making a determination as to future inappropriate or unnecessary risk or\n          danger that he represents, since this incident occurred in 2009, the Court\n          has some concerns and will deny the petition at this time based on those\n          concerns.”\n                                          DISCUSSION\nI.        THE COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING THE PETITION.*\n          Defendant gives several reasons why, he claims, the court abused its discretion in\ndenying the petition.4 Before addressing the issues he specifically raises, however, we\nexplain the interplay, in the section 1170.126 context, between the abuse of discretion\n\n*         See footnote, ante, page 1.\n4      Defendant’s indeterminate third strike term was imposed by the Honorable Jon E.\nStuebbe. The section 1170.126 petition was heard by the Honorable Michael B. Lewis.\nDefendant contends the matter must be reversed and remanded so it can be heard by\nJudge Stuebbe, as required by section 1170.126, subdivision (j). Although Judge Stuebbe\nwas an active member of the Kern County Superior Court bench at the time the petition\nwas heard — and so should have been the judge to hear it (People v. Superior Court\n(Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1301 (Kaulick)) — he is no longer listed on the\nroster of superior court judges posted on the official Web site of the Judicial Branch of\nCalifornia. (Cal. Cts., Jud. Branch Home, Super. Cts. Judges Roster, at\n<http://www.courts.ca.gov/2948.htm> [as of Dec. 22, 2014].) This being the case, he is\nnot now available to hear the petition, so a remand for him to do so would serve no\npurpose. Accordingly, we do not further address that issue.\n\n\n\n                                                 5.\n\fand preponderance of the evidence standards. We do so because there seems to be\nconfusion on this subject, and because defendant challenges the trial court’s reliance on\nthe 2009 in-prison incident as unsupported by the record.5\n                                               A\n    1.   THE TRIAL COURT’S ULTIMATE DETERMINATION WHETHER TO RESENTENCE A\n         DEFENDANT IS MADE IN THE COURT’S DISCRETION. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW IS\n         ABUSE OF DISCRETION.\n\n         In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126.6 (People v. Superior Court (Martinez) (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 979,\n\n5       As an example, the Attorney General presents the core issue as being whether the\ntrial court properly found, by a preponderance of the evidence, that resentencing\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Defendant initially\nsays a finding of unreasonable danger must be supported by a preponderance of the\nevidence and is subject to review for substantial evidence, although the court’s\ndetermination whether to resentence a defendant under the Act is a discretionary one.\n       For the first time in his reply brief, defendant suggests that under Apprendi v. New\nJersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466 (Apprendi) and its progeny, the prosecution must establish\nand the trial court find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that an inmate petitioning for recall of\nsentence under the Act constitutes an unreasonable risk of danger to the public if the\ninmate’s petition is to be denied. Aside from the fact points raised for the first time in a\nreply brief generally will not be considered (People v. Adams (1990) 216 Cal.App.3d\n1431, 1441, fn. 2; People v. Jackson (1981) 121 Cal.App.3d 862, 873), we have rejected\nthe claim Apprendi requires that facts disqualifying an inmate from resentencing under\nthe Act must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt (People v. Blakely (2014) 225\nCal.App.4th 1042, 1060-1062; People v. Osuna (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1039-\n1040). In our view, the same reasoning and analysis mandates rejection of defendant’s\nclaim here. (See People v. Flores (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1075-1076; Kaulick,\nsupra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1305.)\n6      “An inmate is eligible for resentencing if: [¶] (1) The inmate is serving an\nindeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 for a conviction of a\nfelony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c)\nof Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7. [¶] (2) The inmate’s current\nsentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii),\ninclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or\n\n\n                                               6.\n\f989.) If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate’s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate’s] disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (g).)\n       The plain language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126 calls for an\nexercise of the sentencing court’s discretion. “‘Discretion is the power to make the\ndecision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367,\n375.) “Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its\nexercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the\ncourt exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that\nresulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nRodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125; see People v. Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th\n148, 162 [abuse-of-discretion review asks whether ruling in question falls outside bounds\nof reason under applicable law and relevant facts].)\n\n              “In reviewing for abuse of discretion, we are guided by two\n       fundamental precepts. First, ‘“[t]he burden is on the party attacking the\n       sentence to clearly show that the sentencing decision was irrational or\n\nclauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12. [¶] (3) The inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses\nappearing in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of\nSection 667 or clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (e).)\n\n\n\n                                              7.\n\f        arbitrary. [Citation.] In the absence of such a showing, the trial court is\n        presumed to have acted to achieve legitimate sentencing objectives, and its\n        discretionary determination … will not be set aside on review.”’ [Citation.]\n        Second, a ‘“decision will not be reversed merely because reasonable people\n        might disagree. ‘An appellate tribunal is neither authorized nor warranted\n        in substituting its judgment for the judgment of the trial judge.’”’\n        [Citation.] Taken together, these precepts establish that a trial court does\n        not abuse its discretion unless its decision is so irrational or arbitrary that\n        no reasonable person could agree with it.” (People v. Carmony, supra, 33\n        Cal.4th at pp. 376-377.)\n        “Because ‘all discretionary authority is contextual’ [citation], we cannot determine\nwhether a trial court has acted irrationally or arbitrarily … without considering the legal\nprinciples and policies that should have guided the court’s actions.” (People v. Carmony,\nsupra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 377.) “An abuse of discretion is shown when the trial court\napplies the wrong legal standard. [Citation.]” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior\nCourt (2009) 47 Cal.4th 725, 733.)\n        Under the clear language of section 1170.126, we review the trial court’s ultimate\ndetermination whether to resentence a petitioner for abuse of discretion. Of course, if\nthere is no evidence in the record to support the decision, the decision constitutes an\nabuse of discretion. (See In re Robert L. (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1066.)\n\n   2.   THE BURDEN OF PROOF BY PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE APPLIES TO PROOF\n        OF THE FACTS, NOT TO THE TRIAL COURT’S ULTIMATE DETERMINATION.\n\n        Division Three of the Second District Court of Appeal has stated that, where a\ncourt’s discretion under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is concerned, the People bear\nthe burden of proving “dangerousness” by a preponderance of the evidence. (Kaulick,\nsupra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1305 & fn. 25; see Evid. Code, § 115.) That court\ndetermined this is so — and the Apprendi line of cases do not apply — because\n“dangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence imposed when a defendant is\nresentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a hurdle which must be crossed in\norder for a defendant to be resentenced at all.” (Kaulick, supra, at p. 1303.)\n\n\n\n                                              8.\n\f       We agree with Kaulick that the applicable standard is preponderance of the\nevidence.7 This does not mean, however, that the trial court must apply that standard in\nmaking its ultimate determination whether to resentence a petitioner, or we must review\nthat determination for substantial evidence.8 Nor does it mean evidence of\ndangerousness must preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation for resentencing to be\ndenied. The language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) expressly provides a petitioner\nshall be resentenced unless the court, in its discretion, makes a determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger. The statute does not say the\npetitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing would pose such a\nrisk. Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126, we\nconclude the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,\nfacts from which a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made.9 Stated another way, evidence\n\n\n\n\n7      We have previously discussed Kaulick in the context of the initial determination\nwhether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under the Act. (People v. Blakely, supra,\n225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1058, 1060-1061; People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1033, 1039-1040.) Nothing we say here should be taken as disagreement with or\nmodification of those opinions. We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act, a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n8       The substantial evidence test applies to an appellate court’s review of findings\nmade under the preponderance of the evidence standard. (People v. Wong (2010) 186\nCal.App.4th 1433, 1444.) Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n9     Courts and parties have assumed whatever burden exists is on the People. (E.g.,\nPeople v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075; Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\n\n\n                                             9.\n\fshowing a petitioner poses a risk of danger to public safety must be proven by the People\nby a preponderance. The reasons a trial court finds resentencing would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence showing dangerousness versus\nevidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s discretion. The ultimate\ndetermination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger is a\ndiscretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts established by a\npreponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of danger by a\npreponderance of the evidence. (See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1065-\n1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of evidence standards].)\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme.10 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to\nCunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270 (Cunningham), “three terms of\nimprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses. The trial court’s discretion in\nselecting among [those] options [was] limited by section 1170, subdivision (b), which\ndirect[ed] that ‘the court shall order imposition of the middle term, unless there are\ncircumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.’” (People v. Black (2007) 41\nCal.4th 799, 808, fn. omitted.) Trial courts had “broad discretion” to impose the lower or\nupper term instead of the middle term of imprisonment (People v. Scott (1994) 9 Cal.4th\n331, 349), and generally were required by the statutes and sentencing rules to state\nreasons for their discretionary sentencing choices (ibid.). Such reasons had to be\n“supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record” and reasonably related to\n\np. 1301, fn. 25.) Such allocation is in harmony with the language of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f) that an eligible petitioner “shall be resentenced … unless” the court makes\nthe required determination.\n10     The determination of the appropriate penalty in a capital case “‘is “essentially\nmoral and normative …, and therefore … there is no burden of proof or burden of\npersuasion. [Citation.]” [Citation.]’ [Citations.]” (People v. McKinzie (2012) 54\nCal.4th 1302, 1362.)\n\n\n\n                                             10.\n\fthe particular sentencing determination. (Ibid.; see former Cal. Rules of Court,\nrule 4.420(b).) Even after the DSL was reformed and amended in response to\nCunningham, so as to eliminate judicial factfinding in selection of the appropriate term\nwhen three possible prison terms are specified by statute, establishment of facts by a\npreponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect to certain discretionary\nsentencing decisions. (See In re Coley (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524, 557-558.)11\n       In People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 850-851, the California Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making its discretionary sentencing choices post-Cunningham, “the\ntrial court need only ‘state [its] reasons’ [citation]; it is not required to identify\naggravating and mitigating factors, apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, or\nspecify the ‘ultimate facts’ that ‘justify[] the term selected.’ [Citations.] Rather, the\ncourt must ‘state in simple language the primary factor or factors that support the exercise\nof discretion.’ [Citation.]” (Italics added.)\n       The trial court’s ultimate determination when considering a petition for\nresentencing under section 1170.126 is analogous to an evaluation of the relative weight\nof mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Such an evaluation “is not equivalent to a\nfactual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) It follows, then,\nthat the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, in that it\nneed not find resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not, pose an\n\n\n\n\n11      After Cunningham concluded the DSL violated a defendant’s Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial (Cunningham, supra, 549 U.S. at p. 281), the Legislature amended\nsection 1170 so that now “(1) the middle term is no longer the presumptive term absent\naggravating or mitigating facts found by the trial judge; and (2) a trial judge has the\ndiscretion to impose an upper, middle or lower term based on reasons he or she states.”\n(People v. Wilson (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 988, 992.) Subdivision (b) of section 1170\nstates the court “shall select the term which, in the court’s discretion, best serves the\ninterests of justice.”\n\n\n\n                                                11.\n\funreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “‘more likely than not’”].)\n       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\nand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself. Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation. Kaulick\nstated, in part: “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly situated to\nhim, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life term to which he was\noriginally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him with an opportunity to be resentenced\nto a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the\nthird strike sentence based on the facts established at the time he was originally\nsentenced. As such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in\nhis favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e., dangerousness), and\nsuch factor need not be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Id.\nat p. 1303, italics added.) The court further stated: “[I]t is the general rule in California\nthat once a defendant is eligible for an increased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its\ndiscretion to impose that penalty, may rely on factors established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1305, italics added.)\n       To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its\n\n                                              12.\n\ffinding will be upheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within\n“the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered. [Citations.]” (People\nv. Giminez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 72.) The facts or evidence upon which the court’s\nfinding of unreasonable risk is based must be proven by the People by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, however, and are themselves subject to our review for substantial evidence.\nIf a factor (for example, that the petitioner recently committed a battery, is violent due to\nrepeated instances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a preponderance of the\nevidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk. (See People v. Cluff\n(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998 [trial court abuses its discretion when factual findings\ncritical to decision find no support in record]; cf. People v. Read (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d\n685, 689-691 [where trial court erroneously determined defendant was statutorily\nineligible for probation, reviewing court was required to determine whether trial court\ngave sufficient other reasons, supported by facts of case, for probation denial].)\n                                                B\n       Defendant contends the trial court never actually made a finding that the\npreponderance of the evidence showed resentencing defendant would pose an\nunreasonable risk to public safety. As we explained, ante, the trial court was not required\nto find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that resentencing defendant would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. Subdivision (f) of section 1170.126 clearly\nsets out the determination the court was required to make, and it is apparent, from the oral\nand written submissions of the parties and the court’s comments, that the court was aware\nof the law on this point. (See Evid. Code, § 664; People v. Diaz (1992) 3 Cal.4th 495,\n567.) Although it would have been better for the court expressly to state its\ndetermination resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety, its comments and ruling adequately conveyed its intent in this regard. (Cf.\nPeople v. Paul (1998) 18 Cal.4th 698, 706-707 [verdict should be read in light of\ncharging instrument and plea entered by defendant; form of verdict generally is\n\n                                               13.\n\fimmaterial so long as jury’s intent to convict clearly may be seen]; People v. Flohr\n(1939) 30 Cal.App.2d 576, 581 [same].)\n                                              C\n         Defendant next contends the trial court erred by relying on facts that were\nunsupported and contradicted by the record. He points to the court’s reliance on the 2009\nincident in which, he says, the court determined prison authorities found defendant guilty\nof, and disciplined him for, battery on an inmate with a weapon, whereas defendant\nactually was found guilty of and disciplined for the lesser offense of simple battery,\nwithout a weapon and without injury. Because the court’s sole basis for denying the\npetition was its misapprehension of the record evidence, defendant argues, its decision\nmust be reversed and the matter remanded for a new determination based on the true\nfacts.\n         The rules violation reports, photographs, and findings concerning the 2009\nincident were before the court as exhibit F of the People’s opposition to the petition.\nCorrectional Officer Day reported hearing noise that sounded like a fight coming from\ncell 239 on the morning of October 1, 2009. The cell was assigned to defendant and\nInmate Greenhaw, both of whom were inside at the time. Greenhaw had\nabrasions/scratches to the stomach area and left side; a swollen area, abrasion/scratch,\nand pain to the right hand; and a swollen area on the left hand. Defendant had a\ncut/laceration/slash over his right eye and right cheek, and a bruised area on his left knee.\nOfficer Sanchez searched the cell and discovered a pen wrapped with tape and a broken\npencil. The pen was approximately six inches long and the pencil was approximately\neight inches long. Sanchez observed the injuries to Greenhaw and determined they were\nconsistent with being struck with a weapon. Defendant was charged with battery on an\ninmate with a weapon.\n         On October 5, 2009, Correctional Lieutenant Smith received “reliable confidential\ninformation” that during the incident, defendant stabbed Greenhaw in the rib cage with a\n\n                                              14.\n\fpencil, breaking the pencil in the process. Defendant then stabbed Greenhaw in the\nabdominal area with the broken pencil. Realizing the broken pencil was not adequate,\ndefendant retrieved a pen from a shelf and attempted to stab Greenhaw a third time.\n       A disciplinary hearing was held before a senior hearing officer on October 28,\n2009. Defendant pled not guilty to the charge of battery on an inmate with a weapon,\nthen stated: “‘It was my pen. He would not allow me to wrap tape on a pen and use it on\nhim. It was an argument that got heated and out of hand.’”\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, defendant was found not guilty of the charged\noffense, but guilty of violating the lesser included offense of fighting with the use of a\nweapon. The hearing officer concluded a preponderance of the evidence presented at the\nhearing did not substantiate the original charge; however, the lesser charge was\nsubstantiated by, inter alia, the contents of Day’s report, which included Sanchez’s\nfinding of the pen and broken pencil and observation of injuries to Greenhaw that were\nconsistent with being struck with a weapon; the medical report on Greenhaw, which\nreflected he suffered injuries consistent with being involved in a fight with the use of a\nweapon; and the crime incident report, which reflected that Sanchez observed injuries to\ndefendant’s face consistent with being struck by several blows, and injuries to\nGreenhaw’s abdomen/rib area that were consistent with being struck with a weapon.12\nAs a result, defendant was assessed a credit forfeiture of 180 days, among other penalties.\n       On December 2, 2009, Associate Warden Hernandez, the chief disciplinary\nofficer, reduced the finding to battery on a prisoner with no serious injury and ordered a\ncorresponding reduction of credit forfeiture to 90 days. Hernandez’s report stated the\n\n12     In his report, Sanchez elaborated that, based on his training and experience, the\nwounds to Greenhaw’s abdomen and left rib cage region could have been caused by a\nstabbing/slash type weapon or weapons. After examining the broken pencil and pen,\nSanchez opined they were utilized during the incident, which was consistent with\nGreenhaw’s injuries.\n\n\n\n                                             15.\n\ffinding was reduced in the interest of justice, and explained the guilty finding was\nappropriate, but there was no offense of fighting with the use of a weapon listed in any of\nthe disciplinary schedules.13 As a result, since the senior hearing officer found defendant\nnot guilty of the original offense of battery on an inmate with a weapon, the finding was\nreduced to battery on a prisoner with no serious injury.\n       As we explained, ante, where a proceeding under section 1170.126 is involved, the\nPeople have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts from\nwhich a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety can reasonably be made. We review those facts for substantial\nevidence.\n       In arguing the trial court relied on facts unsupported and contradicted by the\nrecord, defendant focuses on the disciplinary findings made by prison authorities. The\nactual evidence before those authorities was also before the trial court, however, and we\nbelieve its comments show it relied on that information. Substantial evidence supports\nthe trial court’s findings, implicitly made by a preponderance of the evidence, that\ndefendant actually stabbed and inflicted injury (albeit not seriously) on another inmate\nwith a pen or pencil. This being the case, the trial court did not err by relying on the 2009\nincident as the basis for its determination resentencing defendant would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, regardless of the fact prison authorities did\nnot find defendant guilty of battery with a weapon. (Cf. People v. Towne (2008) 44\nCal.4th 63, 83-89 [in selecting appropriate sentence, trial court may take into account all\nevidence related to defendant’s conduct in committing crime, including evidence\nunderlying counts of which defendant was acquitted].)\n\n\n\n13     Section 3323 of title 15 of the California Code of Regulations sets out the various\ndisciplinary credit forfeiture schedules.\n\n\n\n                                             16.\n\f                                              D\n     1.   THE TRIAL COURT DID NOT MISAPPREHEND THE SCOPE OF ITS DISCRETION.\n\n          Defendant contends the trial court misapprehended the scope of its discretion. He\nessentially argues sentence reduction under the Act is now the rule, not the exception;\nhence, trial courts have only limited discretion in denying relief on the ground of\nunreasonable danger to public safety. We reject defendant’s reasoning and conclusions.\n          Defendant points to the syntax of section 1170.126, subdivision (f). Relying on\nPeople v. Guinn (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1130, 1141-1142, 1145 and its progeny (e.g.,\nPeople v. Murray (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 277, 282; People v. Ybarra (2008) 166\nCal.App.4th 1069, 1089), all of which deal with section 190.5, subdivision (b),14\ndefendant contends the “shall”/“unless” formulation employed in subdivision (f) of\nsection 1170.126 “creates in the petitioner a presumption and an expectation of being\nresentenced as a second striker .…” He reasons that, because resentencing an eligible\npetitioner to a second strike term is the “‘generally mandatory’ disposition,” a trial court\nretains only “‘circumscribed’ discretion upon proof of an ‘unreasonable’ danger to\n‘public safety’ to leave intact the more draconian punishment that [the Act] now\nabolishes.”\n          The California Supreme Court has recently disapproved the cases relied on by\ndefendant. (People v. Gutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1354, 1370, 1387.) Leaving aside\nconstitutional questions raised by establishing a presumption in favor of life without\nparole for juveniles after the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in Miller v. Alabama\n\n\n14     Section 190.5, subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part: “The penalty for a\ndefendant found guilty of murder in the first degree, in any case in which one or more\nspecial circumstances … has been found to be true …, who was 16 years of age or older\nand under the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the crime, shall be\nconfinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole or, at the\ndiscretion of the court, 25 years to life.”\n\n\n\n                                              17.\n\f(2012) 567 U.S. ___ [132 S.Ct. 2455], the state high court’s review of the text of\nsection 190.5, subdivision (b) led it to conclude the syntax is ambiguous concerning any\npresumption. The court stated: “It is not unreasonable to read this text … to mean that a\ncourt ‘shall’ impose life without parole unless ‘at the discretion of the court’ a sentence\nof 25 years to life appears more appropriate. [Citation.] But it is equally reasonable to\nread the text to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties in the exercise of its\ndiscretion, with no presumption in favor of one or the other. The latter reading accords\nwith common usage. For example, if a teacher informed her students that ‘you must take\na final exam or, at your discretion, write a term paper,’ it would be reasonable for the\nstudents to believe they were equally free to pursue either option. The text of\nsection 190.5[, subdivision ](b) does not clearly indicate whether the statute was intended\nto make life without parole the presumptive sentence.” (People v. Gutierrez, supra, 58\nCal.4th at p. 1371.)\n       The same example can be applied to the syntax of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). Thus, we do not agree with defendant that courts have only limited\ndiscretion to deny resentencing. A court considering whether to resentence an eligible\npetitioner under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) has circumscribed discretion in the\nsense it can only refuse to resentence if it finds that to do so would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety on the facts of the particular case before it. This does not\nmean, however, its discretion is circumscribed in the sense it can only find dangerousness\nin extraordinary cases. To the contrary, it can do so in any case in which such a finding\nis rational under the totality of the circumstances.\n       Such a conclusion comports with the plain language of the statute. Moreover,\ninterpreting the statute to find a strong presumption in favor of resentencing that will only\nbe overcome in an extraordinary case, would run directly contrary to the intent of the\nvoters in passing the Act. (See People v. Gutierrez, supra, 58 Cal.4th at pp. 1371-1372\n[examining legislative history and voter intent in attempt to resolve statutory ambiguity].)\n\n                                             18.\n\fAs we stated in People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036, “‘[e]nhancing\npublic safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].” Thus, although one purpose of\nthe Act was to save taxpayer dollars (People v. Osuna, supra, at p. 1037), “[i]t is clear the\nelectorate’s intent was not to throw open the prison doors to all third strike offenders\nwhose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but only to those who\nwere perceived as nondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public.” (Id. at p. 1038,\nsecond italics added.)\n         Had voters intended to permit retention of an indeterminate term only in\nextraordinary cases, they would have said so in subdivision (f) of section 1170.126, rather\nthan employing language that affords a court discretion to find dangerousness. They also\nwould not have afforded the court the power to consider any evidence it determined to be\nrelevant to the issue as they did in subdivision (g)(3) of the statute. Although voters\ncould have permitted automatic resentencing, under any and all circumstances, of those\neligible therefor, they did not do so. This demonstrates a recognition of two highly\nplausible scenarios: (1) Some inmates sentenced to indeterminate terms under the\noriginal version of the three strikes law for crimes not defined as serious or violent\nfelonies may have started out not posing any greater risk of danger than recidivists who\nwill now be sentenced to determinate terms as second strike offenders under the\nprospective provisions of the Act, but have become violent or otherwise dangerous while\nimprisoned, or (2) Enough time might have passed since some inmates committed their\ncriminal offenses so that those offenses no longer make such inmates dangerous, but\nother facts do. In light of the Act’s key purpose in enhancing public safety, we find it\napparent voters intended trial courts to determine resentencing would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger whenever it was reasonable to do so under the circumstances\nof a particular case, rather than to be able to make such a finding only in extraordinary\ncases.\n\n\n\n                                             19.\n\f       The foregoing essentially answers defendant’s analogizing of the resentencing\nprocedure under the Act to the striking of prior serious and/or violent felony allegations\nunder People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 (Romero). In Romero,\nthe California Supreme Court held that trial courts retain discretion to strike, in\nfurtherance of justice under section 1385, subdivision (a), prior felony conviction\nallegations in cases brought under the three strikes law. (Romero, supra, at pp. 529-530.)\nThe court subsequently clarified, however, that in deciding whether to do so, or\nreviewing such a ruling, “the court in question must consider whether, in light of the\nnature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony\nconvictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the\ndefendant may be deemed outside the scheme’s spirit, in whole or in part, and hence\nshould be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious\nand/or violent felonies.” (People v. Williams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 161.)\n       Because the three strikes law was intended to restrict courts’ discretion in\nsentencing repeat offenders, the state high court determined there were “stringent\nstandards” sentencing courts must follow in order to find a defendant should be treated as\nfalling outside the three strikes scheme. (People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at\np. 377.) The court explained:\n\n              “[T]he three strikes law not only establishes a sentencing norm, it\n       carefully circumscribes the trial court’s power to depart from this norm and\n       requires the court to explicitly justify its decision to do so. In doing so, the\n       law creates a strong presumption that any sentence that conforms to these\n       sentencing norms is both rational and proper.\n\n              “In light of this presumption, a trial court will only abuse its\n       discretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited\n       circumstances. For example, an abuse of discretion occurs where the trial\n       court was not ‘aware of its discretion’ to dismiss [citation], or where the\n       court considered impermissible factors in declining to dismiss [citation].\n       Moreover, ‘the sentencing norms [established by the Three Strikes law\n\n\n\n                                             20.\n\f       may, as a matter of law,] produce[] an “arbitrary, capricious or patently\n       absurd” result’ under the specific facts of a particular case. [Citation.]\n\n              “But ‘[i]t is not enough to show that reasonable people might\n       disagree about whether to strike one or more’ prior conviction allegations.\n       [Citation.] … Because the circumstances must be ‘extraordinary … by\n       which a career criminal can be deemed to fall outside the spirit of the very\n       scheme within which he squarely falls once he commits a strike as part of a\n       long and continuous criminal record, the continuation of which the law was\n       meant to attack’ [citation], the circumstances where no reasonable people\n       could disagree that the criminal falls outside the spirit of the three strikes\n       scheme must be even more extraordinary.” (People v. Carmony, supra, 33\n       Cal.4th at p. 378.)\n       As we explained in People v. Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1054, “The\npurpose of the three strikes law has been variously stated as being ‘“to ensure longer\nprison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been\npreviously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses”’ [citation] and ‘to\npromote the state’s compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in punishing\nrecidivism’ [citation]. Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].” Because\npublic safety remains a key purpose of the law under the Act, we reject defendant’s\nassertion that a section 1170.126 proceeding is the converse of a Romero determination,\nso that any refusal to resentence an eligible inmate must be subjected to the same\nrigorous scrutiny as the granting of a Romero motion.\n       “In enacting section 1170.126[, subdivision (f)] as part of Proposition 36, the issue\nbefore the voters was not whether a defendant could or should be punished more harshly\nfor a particular aspect of his or her offense, but whether, having already been found to\nwarrant an indeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender, he or she should now” be\nsentenced to a lesser term. (People v. Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1054.)\nRather than constricting the trial court’s discretion to leave intact a defendant’s original\nsentence, we read the language of section 1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g) as granting\ntrial courts unfettered discretion to determine, on the facts and circumstances of each\n\n                                             21.\n\fcase, whether resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety. Such an interpretation fully comports with the intent of the voters in\nenacting the Act. Constraining trial courts’ discretion to require resentencing except in\nextraordinary cases, manifestly does not.\n     2.   SECTION 1170.18, SUBDIVISION (C), ENACTED PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION 47, DOES\n          NOT MODIFY SECTION 1170.126, SUBDIVISION (F).\n\n          On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\npetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)15\n          Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision at\nissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\n\n15    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n\n                                                22.\n\fof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n              “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.16\n\n\n16     We solicited supplemental briefing concerning Proposition 47. Among the\nquestions we asked counsel to answer were whether defendant met the criteria for\nresentencing under section 1170.18 and, if so, whether we needed to determine the\napplicability, if any, of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to resentencing proceedings\n\n\n                                            23.\n\f       “‘In interpreting a voter initiative …, we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] ‘“The fundamental purpose of statutory\nconstruction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of\nthe law. [Citations.]”’ [Citation.]” (People v. Superior Court (Cervantes) (2014) 225\nCal.App.4th 1007, 1014.) Thus, in the case of a provision adopted by the voters, “their\nintent governs. [Citations.]” (People v. Jones (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1146.)\n       To determine intent, “‘we look first to the words themselves. [Citations.]’”\n(People v. Superior Court (Cervantes), supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1014.) We give the\n\nunder section 1170.126. We are satisfied it is appropriate for us to reach the issue of\napplicability regardless of whether defendant might obtain resentencing under\nProposition 47.\n        It appears that a number of inmates will be eligible to seek resentencing under\nboth the Act and Proposition 47. Such an inmate need not wait to file a petition under\nProposition 47 until the trial court’s ruling on the inmate’s petition under the Act is final.\nA trial court is not divested of jurisdiction over a Proposition 47 petition by the fact a\npetition under the Act is pending, whether in a trial court or a Court of Appeal, with\nrespect to the same inmate. (Cf. People v. Mayfield (1993) 5 Cal.4th 220, 222-227;\nPeople v. Johnson (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1183, 1256-1257; People v. Alanis (2008) 158\nCal.App.4th 1467, 1472-1473.) While the general rule is that “an appeal from an order in\na criminal case removes the subject matter of that order from the jurisdiction of the trial\ncourt [citations]” (Anderson v. Superior Court (1967) 66 Cal.2d 863, 865), the subject\nmatter of a ruling on a petition under the Act is legally independent from a petition under\nProposition 47 (see People v. Superior Court (Gregory) (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 324,\n332).\n       In light of the differences between the two proceedings — for instance, an inmate\nresentenced under Proposition 47 is generally subject to one year of parole (§§ 1170.18,\nsubd. (d), 3000.08), while an inmate resentenced under the Act is subject to up to three\nyears of postrelease community supervision (§ 3451; People v. Tubbs (2014) 230\nCal.App.4th 578, 585-586, petn. for review pending, petn. filed Nov. 12, 2014, time for\ngrant or denial of review extended to Feb. 10, 2015; People v. Espinoza (2014) 226\nCal.App.4th 635, 637-638) — we express no opinion concerning whether the granting of\na Proposition 47 petition would render moot resentencing proceedings, whether in a trial\ncourt or on appeal, under the Act. Nothing we say should be read as expressing any\nopinion concerning the appropriate result should defendant seek resentencing under\nProposition 47.\n\n\n\n                                             24.\n\fstatute’s words “‘a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however,\nconsider the statutory language “in isolation.” [Citation.] Rather, we look to “the entire\nsubstance of the statute … in order to determine the scope and purpose of the\nprovision .… [Citation.]” [Citation.] That is, we construe the words in question “‘in\ncontext, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute .…’ [Citation.]”\n[Citation.] We must harmonize “the various parts of a statutory enactment … by\nconsidering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a\nwhole.” [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Acosta (2002) 29 Cal.4th 105, 112.) We\n“accord[] significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the\nlegislative purpose. A construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.…\n[S]tatutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both\ninternally and with each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v.\nFair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387.)\n       “‘“When statutory language is clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nconstruction and courts should not indulge in it.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nHendrix (1997) 16 Cal.4th 508, 512.) On its face, “[a]s used throughout this Code,” as\nemployed in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), clearly and unambiguously refers to the\nPenal Code, not merely section 1170.18 or the other provisions contained in\nProposition 47. (See People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153, 164-165, 166; see\nalso Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1254-\n1255; People v. Vasquez (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 763, 766.)\n       This does not mean, however, that the definition contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) must inexorably be read into section 1170.126, subdivision (f). (Cf.\nMarshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at p. 1255.) “The\nliteral language of a statute does not prevail if it conflicts with the lawmakers’ intent .…\n[Citations.]” (People v.

City of Los Angeles (1974) 11 Cal.3d 726, 733.) Rather, “the literal meaning\nof a statute must be in accord with its purpose.” (People v. Mohammed (2008) 162\nCal.App.4th 920, 927.) “[I]t is settled that the language of a statute should not be given a\nliteral meaning if doing so would result in absurd consequences that the [voters] did not\nintend” (In re Michele D. (2002) 29 Cal.4th 600, 606), or would “frustrate[] the manifest\npurposes of the legislation as a whole .…” (People v. Williams (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th\n1389, 1393.) “To this extent, therefore, intent prevails over the letter of the law and the\nletter will be read in accordance with the spirit of the enactment. [Citation.]” (In re\nMichele D., supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 606; accord, People v. Ledesma (1997) 16 Cal.4th 90,\n95.)\n       Thus, “‘we look to a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be\nachieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy,\ncontemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the\nstatute is a part. [Citations.]’ [Citation.] We also ‘“refer to other indicia of the voters’\nintent, particularly the analyses and arguments contained in the official ballot pamphlet.”\n[Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1034.) We\nconsider “the consequences that will flow from a particular interpretation” (Dyna-Med,\nInc. v. Fair Employment & Housing Com., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1387), as well as “the\nwider historical circumstances” of the statute’s or statutes’ enactment (ibid.). “‘Using\nthese extrinsic aids, we “select the construction that comports most closely with the\napparent intent of the [electorate], with a view to promoting rather than defeating the\ngeneral purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd\nconsequences.” [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1034-1035.)\n       Proposition 47 and the Act address related, but not identical, subjects. As we\nexplain, reading them together, and considering section 1170.18, subdivision (c) in the\ncontext of the statutory framework as a whole (see People v. Acosta, supra, 29 Cal.4th at\n\n                                             26.\n\fp. 112; Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 658-659; In re\nCindy B. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 771, 781), we conclude its literal meaning does not\ncomport with the purpose of the Act, and applying it to resentencing proceedings under\nthe Act would frustrate, rather than promote, that purpose and the intent of the electorate\nin enacting both initiative measures (see People v. Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘… to deter repeat offenders and, at\n       some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 823-\n       824.)17\n\n17      The foregoing applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added\nsection 1170.12 to the Penal Code. The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\n\n\n                                             27.\n\f       A few months before the November 6, 2012, election, the California Supreme\nCourt observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is\nthat the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when … a\ndefendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies]\nis convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of\nany offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n\n\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’” (See Historical\nand Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen. Code (2004 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 239.)\n\n\n\n                                             28.\n\f       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an\nexercise of the public power of the people of the State of California for the protection of\nthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be\nliberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 6, 2012), supra, text of proposed law, p. 110, original italics omitted, italics\nadded.) As we explained in People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036,\n“Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat [citation], ‘[e]nhancing public\nsafety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\nshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.)\nProposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property\noffenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for\nan offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5,\nsubd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\n\n                                              29.\n\fSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super\nstrike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to\nsection 290, subdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the Official Title and Summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47\nwould “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses[,\ni.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\nunreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nsupra, official title and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do,\nthe Legislative Analyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders\nconvicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. This measure also\nallows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for\nreduced sentences.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra,\nanalysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the\nresentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained:\n\n               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes[, i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen\n       property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply\n       to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In\n       addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a\n       felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\n       felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who\n       has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n\n                                             30.\n\f       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\n       p. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47 spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47,\np. 38.) The Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47 reiterated these themes, and\nnever suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act.\n(See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\nasserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that\nmany of them had prior convictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and\nhome burglary” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to\nargument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), there is no suggestion the early release provisions\nwould extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The\nsame is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the Argument Against\nProposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n\n\n\n\n                                            31.\n\f       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 Jolts Landscape of California Justice System (Nov. 5,\n2014) Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-\nproposition47-20141106-story.html> [as of Dec. 22, 2014].) Looking at the information\nconveyed to voters, however, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is\nof no import. (Cf. People v. Garcia (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1175-1176, fn. 5; People v.\nBradley (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 64, 83; Kaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. v.\nPerformance Plastering, Inc. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 26, 30.)\n       We are also mindful “it has long been settled that ‘[t]he enacting body is deemed\nto be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is\nenacted’ [citation], ‘and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof’ [citation].\n‘This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]”\n(People v. Superior Court (Cervantes), supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015; accord, In re\nLance W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 890, fn. 11.) Thus, we presume voters were aware\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition. (People v. Garcia (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 763,\n769-770, petn. for review pending, petn. filed Nov. 18, 2014; People v. Flores, supra,\n227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075.) Because nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47\nwas it called to voters’ attention the definition of the phrase contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) would apply to resentencing proceedings under the Act, we simply cannot\nconclude voters intended Proposition 47 to alter the Act in that respect. Voters are not\nasked or presumed to be able to discern all potential effects of a proposed initiative\nmeasure; this is why they are provided with voter information guides containing not only\nthe actual text of such a measure, but also a neutral explanation and analysis by the\nLegislative Analyst and arguments in support of and in opposition to the measure. As we\n\n                                             32.\n\fhave already observed, none of those materials so much as hinted that Proposition 47\ncould have the slightest effect on resentencing under the Act. (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena\nUnified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of\nenactment included information bill would add definition of particular term to Public\nContract Code].)18\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code. We cannot do so. The only resentencing\nmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\nwhose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for\nresentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n       We recognize “[i]t is an established rule of statutory construction … that when\nstatutes are in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like\nmeanings. [Citations.]” (People v. Caudillo (1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 585, overruled on\nanother ground in People v. Martinez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 229, 237, fn. 6 &\ndisapproved on another ground in People v. Escobar (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 749-751 &\nfn. 5; see Robbins v. Omnibus R. Co. (1867) 32 Cal. 472, 474.) We question whether\nProposition 47 and the Act are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same\n\n18     For the same reasons, we reject any suggestion the definition contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) was intended to clarify the true meaning of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). (Cf. Re-Open Rambla, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1995) 39\nCal.App.4th 1499, 1511; In re Connie M. (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1225, 1238.)\n\n\n\n                                            33.\n\fsubject; relating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict. (9th ed. 2009) p. 862), and the\ntwo measures (albeit with some overlap) address different levels of offenses and\noffenders. In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\nprobable legislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 521, fn. 10);\nthey are “mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative\nintent otherwise determined [citation]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing\nCom., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391).\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v. Foley (2006) 39 Cal.4th 794, 813) —\nconstraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are released\nmanifestly does not, nor does it comport with voters’ intent in enacting either measure.\n       Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant is not entitled to a remand so the trial court can redetermine\ndefendant’s entitlement to resentencing under the Act utilizing the definition of\n“‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c).19\n\n19     Recently, the Third District Court of Appeal held section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c)’s definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” does not\napply retroactively to defendants whose petitions for resentencing under the Act were\ndecided before the effective date of Proposition 47. (People v. Chaney (Dec. 1, 2014,\nC073949) ___ Cal.App.4th ___, ___-___ [2014 D.A.R. 15934, 15935-15936].) Chaney\ndid not decide whether Proposition 47’s definition applies prospectively to such petitions.\n(Chaney, supra, at p. ___, fn. 3 [2014 D.A.R. 15934, 15936, fn. 3].) Were we to\n\n\n                                             34.\n\fII.    THE TRIAL COURT WAS NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A SUPPLEMENTAL\n       PROBATION REPORT BEFORE DENYING THE PETITION.\n\n       Defendant argues the trial court erred by failing to obtain a supplemental probation\nreport prior to denying his petition. He asserts such a report is necessary because the trial\ncourt’s decision whether to resentence him to a second strike term under\nsection 1170.126 is the functional equivalent of a decision whether to admit him to\nprobation. Defendant contends he is entitled to reversal of the trial court’s denial of his\npetition and a remand for further proceedings that include the preparation of such a\nreport. We disagree.\n       Initially, we note defendant did not request a supplemental probation report or\nobject to proceeding without one. Where, as here, a defendant is ineligible for probation,\nsuch omissions result in waiver of a supplemental report in the trial court and forfeiture\nof the right to object to the absence of such a report on appeal. (People v. Murray, supra,\n203 Cal.App.4th at p. 289, fn. 12; People v. Johnson (1999) 70 Cal.App.4th 1429, 1431-\n1432; People v. Llamas (1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 35, 38-39; but see People v. Dobbins\n(2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 176, 178, 181-182 [waiver and forfeiture principles not\napplicable where defendant remained eligible for probation grant on remand].) This is so\neven where, for instance, the issue before the sentencing court was whether to exercise\ndiscretion to dismiss a strike under section 1385 and Romero, supra, 13 Cal.4th 497.\n\n\n\nconclude section 1170.18, subdivision (c) modifies section 1170.126, subdivision (f), we\nwould agree with Chaney that it does not do so retroactively. We believe, however, that\na finding of nonretroactivity inexorably leads to the possibility of prospective-only\napplication, and that prospective-only application of Proposition 47’s definition to\nresentencing petitions under the Act would raise serious, perhaps insurmountable, equal\nprotection issues. “Mindful of the serious constitutional questions that might arise were\nwe to accept a literal construction of the statutory language, and of our obligation\nwherever possible both to carry out the intent of the electorate and to construe statutes so\nas to preserve their constitutionality [citations]” (People v. Skinner (1985) 39 Cal.3d 765,\n769), we rest our holding on the reasoning set out in our opinion, ante.\n\n\n\n                                             35.\n\f(People v. Johnson, supra, 70 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1432-1433; see People v. Llamas,\nsupra, 67 Cal.App.4th at p. 41, fn. 8.)\n       On the merits, however, we do not find a trial court has a duty to obtain a\nsupplemental probation report. Referral of the matter to the probation officer for\ninvestigation and report is mandatory when a defendant convicted of a felony is eligible\nfor probation (§ 1203, subd. (b)(1); Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.411(a)),20 but\ndiscretionary when the defendant is ineligible for probation, except where the amount of\na restitution fine must be determined (§ 1203, subd. (g); rule 4.411(b)).21\n       Defendant concedes he was ineligible for probation even as a second strike\noffender. (§§ 667, subd. (c)(2), 1170.12, subd. (a)(2).) Accordingly, neither statute nor\nrule of court required the trial court to obtain a supplemental report. (E.g., People v.\nMurray, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 289; People v. Dobbins, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at\np. 180; People v. Llamas, supra, 67 Cal.App.4th at pp. 39-40; People v. Bullock (1994)\n26 Cal.App.4th 985, 986-987, 989; People v. Webb (1986) 186 Cal.App.3d 401, 409.)\nDefendant argues, however, that the language in rule 4.414, criteria affecting probation\n— “[t]he likelihood that if not imprisoned the defendant will be a danger to others” — is\nsufficiently like the factor to be considered by the trial court under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f) — whether defendant “would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety” — to support the conclusion a referral for a supplemental probation report\nis required. We decline to impose a mandatory duty on the trial court where the statutes\nand rules of court granting authority for probation reports do not so provide.\n\n\n20     Further references to rules are to the California Rules of Court.\n21      Rule 4.411(c) states: “The court must order a supplemental probation officer’s\nreport in preparation for sentencing proceedings that occur a significant period of time\nafter the original report was prepared.” Read in light of rule 4.441(a) and (b), however,\nrule 4.411(c) requires a supplemental report only if the defendant is eligible for\nprobation. (People v. Johnson, supra, 70 Cal.App.4th at p. 1432.)\n\n\n\n                                             36.\n\f       Defendant makes no attempt to convince us the trial court not requesting a\nsupplemental report constituted an abuse of discretion.22 Rather, he argues the court’s\nfailure to obtain such a report prejudiced him, because it is reasonably probable the court\nwould have resentenced defendant had it “reviewed a probation report objectively\nproviding a thorough assessment of [defendant], including overview of his 15 years in\nprison.” (See People v. Dobbins, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 182 [applying standard of\nPeople v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 to erroneous failure to obtain supplemental\nprobation report].) Because defendant fails to establish error, we do not reach his claim\nof prejudice.\n                                      DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n                                                                 _____________________\n                                                                           DETJEN, J.\nI CONCUR:\n\n\n _____________________\n LEVY, Acting P.J.\n\n\n\n\n22     Nothing in the record suggests the trial court incorrectly believed it could not\norder a supplemental report if it wanted to do so. (See People v. Bullock, supra, 26\nCal.App.4th at p. 990.)\n\n\n\n                                            37.\n\fPEÑA, J.,\n       I concur in the judgment and the majority opinion with the exception of part I.D.2.\nI agree defendant may not take advantage of Proposition 47’s1 newly enacted definition\nof “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as provided in Penal Code section\n1170.18, subdivision (c) (1170.18(c)). I do so not because there is any ambiguity in the\nlanguage used in section 1170.18(c) or the notion that the statute does not mean what it\nsays, i.e., that the new definition applies “throughout this Code.” Rather, in my view,\nthere is no indication the electorate, in enacting section 1170.18(c), intended it to apply\nretroactively to resentencing determinations under Proposition 36, the Three Strikes\nReform Act of 2012 (the Act).\nI.     After November 4, 2014, the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” in\n       Section 1170.18(c) applies throughout the Penal Code\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, long past the time of defendant’s resentencing hearing.\nUnless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant. This is the only inquiry we must make to\nresolve the issue of whether the definition in section 1170.18(c) applies to defendant.\nHowever, the majority has opted to determine whether the new definition applies to any\nresentencing provisions under the Act, past, present, or future. I respectfully disagree\nwith the majority’s analysis and conclusion on this broader issue.\n\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014)).\n\f               “‘When construing a statute, we must “ascertain the intent of the\n       Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.”’ [Citations.] ‘[W]e\n       begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary\n       meaning.’ [Citation.] ‘If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,\n       then we need go no further.’ [Citation.] If, however, the language supports\n       more than one reasonable construction, we may consider ‘a variety of\n       extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to\n       be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous\n       administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is\n       a part.’ [Citation.] Using these extrinsic aids, we ‘select the construction\n       that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with\n       a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,\n       and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.’\n       [Citation.]” (People v. Sinohui (2002) 28 Cal.4th 205, 211-212.)\n       Where the statutory language is so clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nstatutory construction or to resort to legislative materials or other outside sources.\n(Quarterman v. Kefauver (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371.) Absent ambiguity, it is\npresumed the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure, and\nthe courts may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to a presumed intent not\napparent in its language. (People v. ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court (1996) 14 Cal.4th\n294, 301.)\n       In determining whether the words enacted here are unambiguous, we do not write\non a blank slate. For example, in Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119\nCal.App.4th 1241, 1255, the court stated there “is nothing ambiguous about the phrase\n‘as used in this code.’” It held the definition of “Emergency, as used in this code”\napplied to the entire Public Contract Code, and it was not limited to a particular chapter,\narticle, or division of that code. Also, in People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153,\n166, the court held: “The words ‘as in this code provided’ (Penal Code, § 182) refer to\nthe Penal Code.”\n       In a similar vein, the court in People v. Leal (2004) 33 Cal.4th 999, 1007-1008,\napplied the plain meaning rule as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f               “The statutory language of the provision defining ‘duress’ in each of\n       the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of ‘duress’ in\n       both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n       this section, “duress” means ….’ (§§ 261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This\n       clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of\n       ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.\n\n              “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n       into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n       sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n       its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n       incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n       well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n       observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n       the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n       “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n       rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n       immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n       meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n       lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n               “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n       providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n       has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n       “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n       construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n       meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n       is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n       compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n       analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n       “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n       ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n       to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n       [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While\nacknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory\nconstruction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually\nenacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority’s\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fview of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so\nthat it now states: “As used in this section only, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’ means ….” The majority does so without providing a compelling reason to do so\nand without showing the plain language used has a “‘meaning [that] is “‘repugnant to the\ngeneral purview of the act.’”’” (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1008.) Because\nthe Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or contradictory to the\nAct, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the general purview of\nProposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority on this part of\nthe opinion.\nII.    Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant’s resentencing under the\n       Act\n       I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the\ndefinition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant\nunder the Act.\n       I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that “[n]o\npart of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent.\nWhen the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,” section 3 provides the\ndefault rule. (People v. Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319.) Proposition 47 is silent on\nthe question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The\nanalysis of Proposition 47 by the legislative analyst and the arguments for and against\nProposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that\nsection 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no\nclearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4.\n\f       Defendant cites In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 to argue retroactive\napplication.\n       In Estrada, the court stated:\n\n       “When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it\n       has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe\n       and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission\n       of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must\n       have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now\n       deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\n       constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter\n       punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its\n       passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not\n       final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to\n       conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a\n       conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.” (In re\n       Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       One may argue that under the Estrada case, unless there is a “savings clause”\nproviding for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to\napply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute’s effective date. (In\nre Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the Estrada case has\nbeen revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In People v. Brown, supra, 54\nCal.4th at page 324 the court stated: “Estrada is today properly understood, not as\nweakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal\nCode] section 3, but rather as informing the rule’s application in a specific context by\narticulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment\nfor a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.” “The\nholding in Estrada was founded on the premise that ‘“[a] legislative mitigation of the\npenalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or\nthe different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.”’”\n(Id. at p. 325.) In Brown, the court did not apply the Estrada rule because “a statute\nincreasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not\n\n\n                                             5.\n\frepresent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular\ncriminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.”\n(People v. Brown, supra, at p. 325.)\n       Similarly here, Estrada does not control because applying the definition of\n“unreasonable risk to public safety” in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under\nthe Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime.2 Instead, the downward\nmodification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current\noffense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender,\nincluding criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and “[a]ny\nother evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n       Because section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct\nstandard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant.3 Since defendant has\nfailed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the\njudgment.\n\n                                                         ___________________________\n                                                                             PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n2For this reason, Holder v. Superior Court (1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 314, also relied upon\nby defendant, does not apply because its analysis and conclusion were based on Estrada\nprior to its clarification by subsequent California Supreme Court cases.\n3Recently  in People v. Chaney (Oct. 29, 2014 C073949) __ Cal.App.4th __ the Third\nDistrict Court of Appeal held the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” as provided in section 1170.18(c) does not apply retroactively. I agree.\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f",

If such an\ninmate meets the criteria enumerated in Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), he\nor she will be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.1 (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (f); People v. Yearwood (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168.)\n       After the Act went into effect, Robert Luna Franco (defendant), an inmate serving\na term of 25 years to life following conviction of a felony that was not violent (as defined\nby § 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition for\nrecall of sentence and resentencing under the Act. Following a hearing addressing the\nfacts pertaining to risk of danger, the petition was denied.\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we explain that while a trial court has the\nauthority to obtain a supplemental probation officer’s report at the stage of the\nproceedings at which it must determine whether resentencing a petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, it is not required to do so. In the\nunpublished portion, we reject defendant’s claims that denial of his petition constituted\nan abuse of discretion because the trial court failed to make the requisite finding, relied\non facts unsupported and contradicted by the record, and misapprehended the scope of its\ndiscretion. We also explain the standard of proof applicable to a trial court’s ruling under\nsection 1170.126. Finally, we explain that recently enacted section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) does not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f). We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY*\n       On December 7, 1997, Bakersfield police officers searched the home of Sylvia\nRodriguez, having been informed she was selling heroin there.2 Through the open front\ndoor, an officer could see defendant inside a bedroom. Defendant appeared nervous, had\n“widened eyes” and was “‘somewhat fidgety.’” Defendant was seen to then go into the\nbathroom of the home. During the search, a tinfoil bindle containing 39 milligrams of\nheroin, a usable amount, was found under a floor mat in that bathroom. Defendant\nadmitted being a heroin user, and exhibited physical symptoms indicative of heroin use.\n       A jury convicted defendant of possession of heroin (Health & Saf. Code, § 11350,\nsubd. (a)) and he was found to have suffered two prior strike convictions. On June 9,\n1998, he was sentenced to prison for 25 years to life.\n       On February 25, 2013, defendant filed a petition to recall his sentence and be\nresentenced pursuant to the Act. He represented that his strike record consisted of two\n1990 convictions for first degree burglary and a 1992 conviction for attempted robbery,\nand asked to be resentenced to a total term of 96 months (the upper term for his\ncommitment offense, doubled pursuant to § 667, subd. (e)(1), plus one year for each of\nhis prior prison terms pursuant to § 667.5, subd. (b)).\n       The People opposed the petition. They argued defendant’s release would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. They pointed to defendant’s nine adult\nconvictions, three of which were strikes (defendant also had two juvenile adjudications\nfor strike offenses); the facts of defendant’s strike offenses; the “continuous life of crime”\ndefendant led before and after his strike convictions; and defendant’s disciplinary record\n\n\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n2      The facts are taken from our opinion in defendant’s prior appeal. (People v.\nFranco (Apr. 29, 1999, F031001 [nonpub. opn.].) By separate order, we have taken\njudicial notice of the appellate record in that case.\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fand record of rehabilitation while incarcerated. The People represented defendant had a\nrules violation report from July 2000, in which he and another inmate were engaged in\nmutual combat; a rules violation report from October 2009, in which defendant was\ninvolved in a fight with his cellmate, during which defendant stabbed the cellmate with a\npencil and then a pen3; and a rules violation report from January 2012, in which\ndefendant was involved in a fight with another inmate. The People also pointed to a\nprison record in which defendant admitted he had used heroin since the age of 14 and\nconsidered himself a drug addict, yet no record showed he attended any drug or alcohol\nclasses. The People located prison “chronos” showing defendant participated in adult\nbasic education, GED, and graphic arts classes, but found no record for vocational or job\ntraining or any work history. The People also pointed to defendant’s lack of parole plans.\n       Defendant did not file a written response or provide any information concerning\nhis in-prison efforts at rehabilitation or postrelease plans (if any).\n       The petition was heard on March 27, 2013. Defense counsel argued defendant,\nwho had “served 196 months for a dime bag of heroin,” was the type of person voters\nwanted to give an opportunity to rejoin society. Counsel further argued that getting into\nsome sort of altercation a few times in the course of 16 years in prison was “not\nunreasonable behavior given the violent and difficult environment” in which prisoners\nfind themselves.\n       The court noted it was allowed to consider the inmate’s current position, and\nwhether he presented an “extended” danger to society. It stated: “If we look at\n[defendant’s] current criminal history, there is an indication that there was a … rule\nviolation in the year of 2000 related to physical violence and confrontation in the\ninstitution. There was an additional [rules violation report] in 2009 that causes the Court\nsome grave concern in that that was an assault where he actually inflicted injury on\n3      We discuss this incident in more detail, post.\n\n\n\n                                               4.\n\fanother individual using a pen or a pencil. [¶] My concern about that is that even after\nthat assault on someone else, there appeared to have been a … rule violation, but there is\nnot any indication that the institution felt it was sufficiently significant to warrant\ncriminal prosecution.” After a discussion between the court and prosecutor about why\nsome in-prison offenses were referred for prosecution and others were not, the court\nstated:\n\n                 “[I]n light of the fact that there is the indication from his … file that\n          he actually stabbed a person with a pencil or a pen, I am going to at this\n          point deny the petition under 1170.126.\n\n                “[Defense counsel], at this point, without further foundation for\n          making a determination as to future inappropriate or unnecessary risk or\n          danger that he represents, since this incident occurred in 2009, the Court\n          has some concerns and will deny the petition at this time based on those\n          concerns.”\n                                          DISCUSSION\nI.        THE COURT DID NOT ABUSE ITS DISCRETION BY DENYING THE PETITION.*\n          Defendant gives several reasons why, he claims, the court abused its discretion in\ndenying the petition.4 Before addressing the issues he specifically raises, however, we\nexplain the interplay, in the section 1170.126 context, between the abuse of discretion\n\n*         See footnote, ante, page 1.\n4      Defendant’s indeterminate third strike term was imposed by the Honorable Jon E.\nStuebbe. The section 1170.126 petition was heard by the Honorable Michael B. Lewis.\nDefendant contends the matter must be reversed and remanded so it can be heard by\nJudge Stuebbe, as required by section 1170.126, subdivision (j). Although Judge Stuebbe\nwas an active member of the Kern County Superior Court bench at the time the petition\nwas heard — and so should have been the judge to hear it (People v. Superior Court\n(Kaulick) (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

This being the case, he is\nnot now available to hear the petition, so a remand for him to do so would serve no\npurpose. Accordingly, we do not further address that issue.\n\n\n\n                                                 5.\n\fand preponderance of the evidence standards. We do so because there seems to be\nconfusion on this subject, and because defendant challenges the trial court’s reliance on\nthe 2009 in-prison incident as unsupported by the record.5\n                                               A\n    1.   THE TRIAL COURT’S ULTIMATE DETERMINATION WHETHER TO RESENTENCE A\n         DEFENDANT IS MADE IN THE COURT’S DISCRETION. THE STANDARD OF REVIEW IS\n         ABUSE OF DISCRETION.\n\n         In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126.6 (People v.

Aside from the fact points raised for the first time in a\nreply brief generally will not be considered (People v.

If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd.

In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate’s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate’s] disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (g).)\n       The plain language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126 calls for an\nexercise of the sentencing court’s discretion. “‘Discretion is the power to make the\ndecision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]” (People v.

Carmony, supra, 33\n        Cal.4th at pp. 376-377.)\n        “Because ‘all discretionary authority is contextual’ [citation], we cannot determine\nwhether a trial court has acted irrationally or arbitrarily … without considering the legal\nprinciples and policies that should have guided the court’s actions.” (People v. Carmony,\nsupra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 377.) “An abuse of discretion is shown when the trial court\napplies the wrong legal standard. [Citation.]” (Costco Wholesale Corp. v. Superior\nCourt (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 733.)\n        Under the clear language of section 1170.126, we review the trial court’s ultimate\ndetermination whether to resentence a petitioner for abuse of discretion. Of course, if\nthere is no evidence in the record to support the decision, the decision constitutes an\nabuse of discretion. (See In re Robert L. (1993) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2279294\"><a href=\"/opinion/2279294/in-re-robert-l/\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

THE BURDEN OF PROOF BY PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE APPLIES TO PROOF\n        OF THE FACTS, NOT TO THE TRIAL COURT’S ULTIMATE DETERMINATION.\n\n        Division Three of the Second District Court of Appeal has stated that, where a\ncourt’s discretion under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is concerned, the People bear\nthe burden of proving “dangerousness” by a preponderance of the evidence. (Kaulick,\nsupra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1305 & fn. 25; see Evid. Code, § 115.) That court\ndetermined this is so — and the Apprendi line of cases do not apply — because\n“dangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence imposed when a defendant is\nresentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a hurdle which must be crossed in\norder for a defendant to be resentenced at all.” (Kaulick, supra, at p. 1303.)\n\n\n\n                                              8.\n\f       We agree with Kaulick that the applicable standard is preponderance of the\nevidence.7 This does not mean, however, that the trial court must apply that standard in\nmaking its ultimate determination whether to resentence a petitioner, or we must review\nthat determination for substantial evidence.8 Nor does it mean evidence of\ndangerousness must preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation for resentencing to be\ndenied. The language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) expressly provides a petitioner\nshall be resentenced unless the court, in its discretion, makes a determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger. The statute does not say the\npetitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing would pose such a\nrisk. Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126, we\nconclude the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,\nfacts from which a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made.9 Stated another way, evidence\n\n\n\n\n7      We have previously discussed Kaulick in the context of the initial determination\nwhether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under the Act. (People v. Blakely, supra,\n225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1058, 1060-1061; People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1033, 1039-1040.) Nothing we say here should be taken as disagreement with or\nmodification of those opinions. We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act, a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n8       The substantial evidence test applies to an appellate court’s review of findings\nmade under the preponderance of the evidence standard. (People v. Wong (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2305872\"><a href=\"/opinion/2305872/people-v-wong/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1433</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1444.) Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n9     Courts and parties have assumed whatever burden exists is on the People. (E.g.,\nPeople v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075; Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\n\n\n                                             9.\n\fshowing a petitioner poses a risk of danger to public safety must be proven by the People\nby a preponderance. The reasons a trial court finds resentencing would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence showing dangerousness versus\nevidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s discretion. The ultimate\ndetermination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger is a\ndiscretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts established by a\npreponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of danger by a\npreponderance of the evidence. (See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1065-\n1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of evidence standards].)\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme.10 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to\nCunningham v. California (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145761\"><a href=\"/opinion/145761/cunningham-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cunningham), “three terms of\nimprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses. The trial court’s discretion in\nselecting among [those] options [was] limited by section 1170, subdivision (b), which\ndirect[ed] that ‘the court shall order imposition of the middle term, unless there are\ncircumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.’” (People v.

Such an evaluation “is not equivalent to a\nfactual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.)

(See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “‘more likely than not’”].)\n       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\nand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself. Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation. Kaulick\nstated, in part: “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly situated to\nhim, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life term to which he was\noriginally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him with an opportunity to be resentenced\nto a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the\nthird strike sentence based on the facts established at the time he was originally\nsentenced. As such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in\nhis favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e., dangerousness), and\nsuch factor need not be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Id.\nat p. 1303, italics added.) The court further stated: “[I]t is the general rule in California\nthat once a defendant is eligible for an increased penalty, the trial court, in exercising its\ndiscretion to impose that penalty, may rely on factors established by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. [Citation.]” (Id. at p. 1305, italics added.)\n       To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review.

He points to the court’s reliance on the 2009\nincident in which, he says, the court determined prison authorities found defendant guilty\nof, and disciplined him for, battery on an inmate with a weapon, whereas defendant\nactually was found guilty of and disciplined for the lesser offense of simple battery,\nwithout a weapon and without injury. Because the court’s sole basis for denying the\npetition was its misapprehension of the record evidence, defendant argues, its decision\nmust be reversed and the matter remanded for a new determination based on the true\nfacts.\n         The rules violation reports, photographs, and findings concerning the 2009\nincident were before the court as exhibit F of the People’s opposition to the petition.\nCorrectional Officer Day reported hearing noise that sounded like a fight coming from\ncell 239 on the morning of October 1, 2009. The cell was assigned to defendant and\nInmate Greenhaw, both of whom were inside at the time. Greenhaw had\nabrasions/scratches to the stomach area and left side; a swollen area, abrasion/scratch,\nand pain to the right hand; and a swollen area on the left hand. Defendant had a\ncut/laceration/slash over his right eye and right cheek, and a bruised area on his left knee.\nOfficer Sanchez searched the cell and discovered a pen wrapped with tape and a broken\npencil. The pen was approximately six inches long and the pencil was approximately\neight inches long. Sanchez observed the injuries to Greenhaw and determined they were\nconsistent with being struck with a weapon. Defendant was charged with battery on an\ninmate with a weapon.\n         On October 5, 2009, Correctional Lieutenant Smith received “reliable confidential\ninformation” that during the incident, defendant stabbed Greenhaw in the rib cage with a\n\n                                              14.\n\fpencil, breaking the pencil in the process. Defendant then stabbed Greenhaw in the\nabdominal area with the broken pencil. Realizing the broken pencil was not adequate,\ndefendant retrieved a pen from a shelf and attempted to stab Greenhaw a third time.\n       A disciplinary hearing was held before a senior hearing officer on October 28,\n2009. Defendant pled not guilty to the charge of battery on an inmate with a weapon,\nthen stated: “‘It was my pen. He would not allow me to wrap tape on a pen and use it on\nhim. It was an argument that got heated and out of hand.’”\n       At the conclusion of the hearing, defendant was found not guilty of the charged\noffense, but guilty of violating the lesser included offense of fighting with the use of a\nweapon. The hearing officer concluded a preponderance of the evidence presented at the\nhearing did not substantiate the original charge; however, the lesser charge was\nsubstantiated by, inter alia, the contents of Day’s report, which included Sanchez’s\nfinding of the pen and broken pencil and observation of injuries to Greenhaw that were\nconsistent with being struck with a weapon; the medical report on Greenhaw, which\nreflected he suffered injuries consistent with being involved in a fight with the use of a\nweapon; and the crime incident report, which reflected that Sanchez observed injuries to\ndefendant’s face consistent with being struck by several blows, and injuries to\nGreenhaw’s abdomen/rib area that were consistent with being struck with a weapon.12\nAs a result, defendant was assessed a credit forfeiture of 180 days, among other penalties.\n       On December 2, 2009, Associate Warden Hernandez, the chief disciplinary\nofficer, reduced the finding to battery on a prisoner with no serious injury and ordered a\ncorresponding reduction of credit forfeiture to 90 days. Hernandez’s report stated the\n\n12     In his report, Sanchez elaborated that, based on his training and experience, the\nwounds to Greenhaw’s abdomen and left rib cage region could have been caused by a\nstabbing/slash type weapon or weapons. After examining the broken pencil and pen,\nSanchez opined they were utilized during the incident, which was consistent with\nGreenhaw’s injuries.\n\n\n\n                                             15.\n\ffinding was reduced in the interest of justice, and explained the guilty finding was\nappropriate, but there was no offense of fighting with the use of a weapon listed in any of\nthe disciplinary schedules.13 As a result, since the senior hearing officer found defendant\nnot guilty of the original offense of battery on an inmate with a weapon, the finding was\nreduced to battery on a prisoner with no serious injury.\n       As we explained, ante, where a proceeding under section 1170.126 is involved, the\nPeople have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts from\nwhich a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety can reasonably be made. We review those facts for substantial\nevidence.\n       In arguing the trial court relied on facts unsupported and contradicted by the\nrecord, defendant focuses on the disciplinary findings made by prison authorities. The\nactual evidence before those authorities was also before the trial court, however, and we\nbelieve its comments show it relied on that information. Substantial evidence supports\nthe trial court’s findings, implicitly made by a preponderance of the evidence, that\ndefendant actually stabbed and inflicted injury (albeit not seriously) on another inmate\nwith a pen or pencil. This being the case, the trial court did not err by relying on the 2009\nincident as the basis for its determination resentencing defendant would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, regardless of the fact prison authorities did\nnot find defendant guilty of battery with a weapon.

The court stated: “It is not unreasonable to read this text … to mean that a\ncourt ‘shall’ impose life without parole unless ‘at the discretion of the court’ a sentence\nof 25 years to life appears more appropriate. [Citation.] But it is equally reasonable to\nread the text to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties in the exercise of its\ndiscretion, with no presumption in favor of one or the other. The latter reading accords\nwith common usage. For example, if a teacher informed her students that ‘you must take\na final exam or, at your discretion, write a term paper,’ it would be reasonable for the\nstudents to believe they were equally free to pursue either option. The text of\nsection 190.5[, subdivision ](b) does not clearly indicate whether the statute was intended\nto make life without parole the presumptive sentence.” (People v. Gutierrez, supra, 58\nCal.4th at p. 1371.)\n       The same example can be applied to the syntax of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). Thus, we do not agree with defendant that courts have only limited\ndiscretion to deny resentencing. A court considering whether to resentence an eligible\npetitioner under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) has circumscribed discretion in the\nsense it can only refuse to resentence if it finds that to do so would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety on the facts of the particular case before it. This does not\nmean, however, its discretion is circumscribed in the sense it can only find dangerousness\nin extraordinary cases. To the contrary, it can do so in any case in which such a finding\nis rational under the totality of the circumstances.\n       Such a conclusion comports with the plain language of the statute. Moreover,\ninterpreting the statute to find a strong presumption in favor of resentencing that will only\nbe overcome in an extraordinary case, would run directly contrary to the intent of the\nvoters in passing the Act. (See People v. Gutierrez, supra, 58 Cal.4th at pp. 1371-1372\n[examining legislative history and voter intent in attempt to resolve statutory ambiguity].)\n\n                                             18.\n\fAs we stated in People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036, “‘[e]nhancing\npublic safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].” Thus, although one purpose of\nthe Act was to save taxpayer dollars (People v. Osuna, supra, at p. 1037), “[i]t is clear the\nelectorate’s intent was not to throw open the prison doors to all third strike offenders\nwhose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but only to those who\nwere perceived as nondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public.” (Id. at p. 1038,\nsecond italics added.)\n         Had voters intended to permit retention of an indeterminate term only in\nextraordinary cases, they would have said so in subdivision (f) of section 1170.126, rather\nthan employing language that affords a court discretion to find dangerousness. They also\nwould not have afforded the court the power to consider any evidence it determined to be\nrelevant to the issue as they did in subdivision (g)(3) of the statute. Although voters\ncould have permitted automatic resentencing, under any and all circumstances, of those\neligible therefor, they did not do so. This demonstrates a recognition of two highly\nplausible scenarios: (1) Some inmates sentenced to indeterminate terms under the\noriginal version of the three strikes law for crimes not defined as serious or violent\nfelonies may have started out not posing any greater risk of danger than recidivists who\nwill now be sentenced to determinate terms as second strike offenders under the\nprospective provisions of the Act, but have become violent or otherwise dangerous while\nimprisoned, or (2) Enough time might have passed since some inmates committed their\ncriminal offenses so that those offenses no longer make such inmates dangerous, but\nother facts do. In light of the Act’s key purpose in enhancing public safety, we find it\napparent voters intended trial courts to determine resentencing would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger whenever it was reasonable to do so under the circumstances\nof a particular case, rather than to be able to make such a finding only in extraordinary\ncases.\n\n\n\n                                             19.\n\f       The foregoing essentially answers defendant’s analogizing of the resentencing\nprocedure under the Act to the striking of prior serious and/or violent felony allegations\nunder People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1135929\"><a href=\"/opinion/1135929/people-v-superior-court-romero/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Romero). In Romero,\nthe California Supreme Court held that trial courts retain discretion to strike, in\nfurtherance of justice under section 1385, subdivision (a), prior felony conviction\nallegations in cases brought under the three strikes law. (Romero, supra, at pp. 529-530.)\nThe court subsequently clarified, however, that in deciding whether to do so, or\nreviewing such a ruling, “the court in question must consider whether, in light of the\nnature and circumstances of his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony\nconvictions, and the particulars of his background, character, and prospects, the\ndefendant may be deemed outside the scheme’s spirit, in whole or in part, and hence\nshould be treated as though he had not previously been convicted of one or more serious\nand/or violent felonies.” (People v. Williams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 161.)\n       Because the three strikes law was intended to restrict courts’ discretion in\nsentencing repeat offenders, the state high court determined there were “stringent\nstandards” sentencing courts must follow in order to find a defendant should be treated as\nfalling outside the three strikes scheme. (People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at\np. 377.) The court explained:\n\n              “[T]he three strikes law not only establishes a sentencing norm, it\n       carefully circumscribes the trial court’s power to depart from this norm and\n       requires the court to explicitly justify its decision to do so. In doing so, the\n       law creates a strong presumption that any sentence that conforms to these\n       sentencing norms is both rational and proper.\n\n              “In light of this presumption, a trial court will only abuse its\n       discretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited\n       circumstances. For example, an abuse of discretion occurs where the trial\n       court was not ‘aware of its discretion’ to dismiss [citation], or where the\n       court considered impermissible factors in declining to dismiss [citation].\n       Moreover, ‘the sentencing norms [established by the Three Strikes law\n\n\n\n                                             20.\n\f       may, as a matter of law,] produce[] an “arbitrary, capricious or patently\n       absurd” result’ under the specific facts of a particular case. [Citation.]\n\n              “But ‘[i]t is not enough to show that reasonable people might\n       disagree about whether to strike one or more’ prior conviction allegations.\n       [Citation.] … Because the circumstances must be ‘extraordinary … by\n       which a career criminal can be deemed to fall outside the spirit of the very\n       scheme within which he squarely falls once he commits a strike as part of a\n       long and continuous criminal record, the continuation of which the law was\n       meant to attack’ [citation], the circumstances where no reasonable people\n       could disagree that the criminal falls outside the spirit of the three strikes\n       scheme must be even more extraordinary.” (People v. Carmony, supra, 33\n       Cal.4th at p. 378.)\n       As we explained in People v. Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1054, “The\npurpose of the three strikes law has been variously stated as being ‘“to ensure longer\nprison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been\npreviously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses”’ [citation] and ‘to\npromote the state’s compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in punishing\nrecidivism’ [citation]. Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].” Because\npublic safety remains a key purpose of the law under the Act, we reject defendant’s\nassertion that a section 1170.126 proceeding is the converse of a Romero determination,\nso that any refusal to resentence an eligible inmate must be subjected to the same\nrigorous scrutiny as the granting of a Romero motion.\n       “In enacting section 1170.126[, subdivision (f)] as part of Proposition 36, the issue\nbefore the voters was not whether a defendant could or should be punished more harshly\nfor a particular aspect of his or her offense, but whether, having already been found to\nwarrant an indeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender, he or she should now” be\nsentenced to a lesser term. (People v. Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1054.)\nRather than constricting the trial court’s discretion to leave intact a defendant’s original\nsentence, we read the language of section 1170.126, subdivisions (f) and (g) as granting\ntrial courts unfettered discretion to determine, on the facts and circumstances of each\n\n                                             21.\n\fcase, whether resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety. Such an interpretation fully comports with the intent of the voters in\nenacting the Act. Constraining trial courts’ discretion to require resentencing except in\nextraordinary cases, manifestly does not.\n     2.   SECTION 1170.18, SUBDIVISION (C), ENACTED PURSUANT TO PROPOSITION 47, DOES\n          NOT MODIFY SECTION 1170.126, SUBDIVISION (F).\n\n          On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\npetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)15\n          Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision at\nissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\n\n15    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n\n                                                22.\n\fof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n              “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.16\n\n\n16     We solicited supplemental briefing concerning Proposition 47. Among the\nquestions we asked counsel to answer were whether defendant met the criteria for\nresentencing under section 1170.18 and, if so, whether we needed to determine the\napplicability, if any, of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to resentencing proceedings\n\n\n                                            23.\n\f       “‘In interpreting a voter initiative …, we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction.

We are satisfied it is appropriate for us to reach the issue of\napplicability regardless of whether defendant might obtain resentencing under\nProposition 47.\n        It appears that a number of inmates will be eligible to seek resentencing under\nboth the Act and Proposition 47. Such an inmate need not wait to file a petition under\nProposition 47 until the trial court’s ruling on the inmate’s petition under the Act is final.\nA trial court is not divested of jurisdiction over a Proposition 47 petition by the fact a\npetition under the Act is pending, whether in a trial court or a Court of Appeal, with\nrespect to the same inmate.

Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘… to deter repeat offenders and, at\n       some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247818/people-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\n\n\n                                             27.\n\f       A few months before the November 6, 2012, election, the California Supreme\nCourt observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is\nthat the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when … a\ndefendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies]\nis convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of\nany offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\nto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd.

Code (2004 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 239.)\n\n\n\n                                             28.\n\f       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an\nexercise of the public power of the people of the State of California for the protection of\nthe health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be\nliberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 6, 2012), supra, text of proposed law, p. 110, original italics omitted, italics\nadded.) As we explained in People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036,\n“Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat [citation], ‘[e]nhancing public\nsafety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\nmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\nshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.)\nProposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property\noffenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for\nan offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5,\nsubd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\n\n                                              29.\n\fSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super\nstrike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to\nsection 290, subdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the Official Title and Summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47\nwould “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses[,\ni.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\nunreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nsupra, official title and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do,\nthe Legislative Analyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders\nconvicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. This measure also\nallows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for\nreduced sentences.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra,\nanalysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the\nresentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained:\n\n               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes[, i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen\n       property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply\n       to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In\n       addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a\n       felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\n       felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who\n       has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n\n                                             30.\n\f       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\n       p. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47 spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47,\np. 38.) The Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47 reiterated these themes, and\nnever suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act.\n(See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\nasserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that\nmany of them had prior convictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and\nhome burglary” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to\nargument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), there is no suggestion the early release provisions\nwould extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The\nsame is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the Argument Against\nProposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n\n\n\n\n                                            31.\n\f       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 Jolts Landscape of California Justice System (Nov. 5,\n2014) Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-\nproposition47-20141106-story.html> [as of Dec. 22, 2014].) Looking at the information\nconveyed to voters, however, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is\nof no import. (Cf. People v. Garcia (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1175-1176, fn. 5; People v.\nBradley (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Thus, we presume voters were aware\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition. (People v. Garcia (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Because nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47\nwas it called to voters’ attention the definition of the phrase contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) would apply to resentencing proceedings under the Act, we simply cannot\nconclude voters intended Proposition 47 to alter the Act in that respect. Voters are not\nasked or presumed to be able to discern all potential effects of a proposed initiative\nmeasure; this is why they are provided with voter information guides containing not only\nthe actual text of such a measure, but also a neutral explanation and analysis by the\nLegislative Analyst and arguments in support of and in opposition to the measure. As we\n\n                                             32.\n\fhave already observed, none of those materials so much as hinted that Proposition 47\ncould have the slightest effect on resentencing under the Act. (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena\nUnified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of\nenactment included information bill would add definition of particular term to Public\nContract Code].)18\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code. We cannot do so. The only resentencing\nmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\nwhose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for\nresentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n       We recognize “[i]t is an established rule of statutory construction … that when\nstatutes are in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like\nmeanings.

Fair Employment & Housing\nCom., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391).\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v. Foley (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600573\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600573/bernard-v-foley/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">794</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 813) —\nconstraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are released\nmanifestly does not, nor does it comport with voters’ intent in enacting either measure.\n       Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant is not entitled to a remand so the trial court can redetermine\ndefendant’s entitlement to resentencing under the Act utilizing the definition of\n“‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c).19\n\n19     Recently, the Third District Court of Appeal held section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c)’s definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” does not\napply retroactively to defendants whose petitions for resentencing under the Act were\ndecided before the effective date of Proposition 47. (People v. Chaney (Dec. 1, 2014,\nC073949) ___ Cal.App.4th ___, ___-___ [2014 D.A.R. 15934, 15935-15936].)

THE TRIAL COURT WAS NOT REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A SUPPLEMENTAL\n       PROBATION REPORT BEFORE DENYING THE PETITION.\n\n       Defendant argues the trial court erred by failing to obtain a supplemental probation\nreport prior to denying his petition. He asserts such a report is necessary because the trial\ncourt’s decision whether to resentence him to a second strike term under\nsection 1170.126 is the functional equivalent of a decision whether to admit him to\nprobation. Defendant contends he is entitled to reversal of the trial court’s denial of his\npetition and a remand for further proceedings that include the preparation of such a\nreport. We disagree.\n       Initially, we note defendant did not request a supplemental probation report or\nobject to proceeding without one. Where, as here, a defendant is ineligible for probation,\nsuch omissions result in waiver of a supplemental report in the trial court and forfeiture\nof the right to object to the absence of such a report on appeal.

Referral of the matter to the probation officer for\ninvestigation and report is mandatory when a defendant convicted of a felony is eligible\nfor probation (§ 1203, subd. (b)(1); Cal.

Accordingly, neither statute nor\nrule of court required the trial court to obtain a supplemental report. (E.g., People v.\nMurray, supra, 203 Cal.App.4th at p. 289; People v.

We decline to impose a mandatory duty on the trial court where the statutes\nand rules of court granting authority for probation reports do not so provide.\n\n\n20     Further references to rules are to the California Rules of Court.\n21      Rule 4.411(c) states: “The court must order a supplemental probation officer’s\nreport in preparation for sentencing proceedings that occur a significant period of time\nafter the original report was prepared.” Read in light of rule 4.441(a) and (b), however,\nrule 4.411(c) requires a supplemental report only if the defendant is eligible for\nprobation. (People v. Johnson, supra, 70 Cal.App.4th at p. 1432.)\n\n\n\n                                             36.\n\f       Defendant makes no attempt to convince us the trial court not requesting a\nsupplemental report constituted an abuse of discretion.22 Rather, he argues the court’s\nfailure to obtain such a report prejudiced him, because it is reasonably probable the court\nwould have resentenced defendant had it “reviewed a probation report objectively\nproviding a thorough assessment of [defendant], including overview of his 15 years in\nprison.” (See People v.

I do so not because there is any ambiguity in the\nlanguage used in section 1170.18(c) or the notion that the statute does not mean what it\nsays, i.e., that the new definition applies “throughout this Code.” Rather, in my view,\nthere is no indication the electorate, in enacting section 1170.18(c), intended it to apply\nretroactively to resentencing determinations under Proposition 36, the Three Strikes\nReform Act of 2012 (the Act).\nI.     After November 4, 2014, the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” in\n       Section 1170.18(c) applies throughout the Penal Code\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, long past the time of defendant’s resentencing hearing.\nUnless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant. This is the only inquiry we must make to\nresolve the issue of whether the definition in section 1170.18(c) applies to defendant.\nHowever, the majority has opted to determine whether the new definition applies to any\nresentencing provisions under the Act, past, present, or future. I respectfully disagree\nwith the majority’s analysis and conclusion on this broader issue.\n\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014)).\n\f               “‘When construing a statute, we must “ascertain the intent of the\n       Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.”’ [Citations.] ‘[W]e\n       begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary\n       meaning.’ [Citation.] ‘If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,\n       then we need go no further.’ [Citation.] If, however, the language supports\n       more than one reasonable construction, we may consider ‘a variety of\n       extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to\n       be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous\n       administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is\n       a part.’ [Citation.] Using these extrinsic aids, we ‘select the construction\n       that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with\n       a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,\n       and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.’\n       [Citation.]” (People v.

Absent ambiguity, it is\npresumed the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure, and\nthe courts may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to a presumed intent not\napparent in its language.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1255, the court stated there “is nothing ambiguous about the phrase\n‘as used in this code.’” It held the definition of “Emergency, as used in this code”\napplied to the entire Public Contract Code, and it was not limited to a particular chapter,\narticle, or division of that code. Also, in People v. Bucchierre (1943) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Leal (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2548607\"><a href=\"/opinion/2548607/people-v-leal/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1007-1008,\napplied the plain meaning rule as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f               “The statutory language of the provision defining ‘duress’ in each of\n       the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of ‘duress’ in\n       both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n       this section, “duress” means ….’ (§§ 261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This\n       clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of\n       ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.\n\n              “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n       into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n       sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n       its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n       incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n       well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n       observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n       the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n       “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n       rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n       immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n       meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n       lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n               “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n       providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n       has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n       “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n       construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n       meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n       is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n       compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n       analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n       “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n       ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n       to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n       [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While\nacknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory\nconstruction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually\nenacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority’s\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fview of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so\nthat it now states: “As used in this section only, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’ means ….” The majority does so without providing a compelling reason to do so\nand without showing the plain language used has a “‘meaning [that] is “‘repugnant to the\ngeneral purview of the act.’”’” (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1008.) Because\nthe Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or contradictory to the\nAct, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the general purview of\nProposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority on this part of\nthe opinion.\nII.    Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant’s resentencing under the\n       Act\n       I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the\ndefinition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant\nunder the Act.\n       I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that “[n]o\npart of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent.\nWhen the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,” section 3 provides the\ndefault rule. (People v. Brown (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319.) Proposition 47 is silent on\nthe question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The\nanalysis of Proposition 47 by the legislative analyst and the arguments for and against\nProposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that\nsection 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no\nclearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4.\n\f       Defendant cites In re Estrada (1965) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421177\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421177/in-re-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> to argue retroactive\napplication.\n       In Estrada, the court stated:\n\n       “When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it\n       has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe\n       and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission\n       of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must\n       have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now\n       deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\n       constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter\n       punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its\n       passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not\n       final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to\n       conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a\n       conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.” (In re\n       Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       One may argue that under the Estrada case, unless there is a “savings clause”\nproviding for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to\napply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute’s effective date. (In\nre Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the Estrada case has\nbeen revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In People v. Brown, supra, 54\nCal.4th at page 324 the court stated: “Estrada is today properly understood, not as\nweakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal\nCode] section 3, but rather as informing the rule’s application in a specific context by\narticulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment\nfor a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.” “The\nholding in Estrada was founded on the premise that ‘“[a] legislative mitigation of the\npenalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or\nthe different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.”’”\n(Id. at p. 325.) In Brown, the court did not apply the Estrada rule because “a statute\nincreasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not\n\n\n                                             5.\n\frepresent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular\ncriminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.”\n(People v. Brown, supra, at p. 325.)\n       Similarly here, Estrada does not control because applying the definition of\n“unreasonable risk to public safety” in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under\nthe Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime.2 Instead, the downward\nmodification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current\noffense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender,\nincluding criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and “[a]ny\nother evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n       Because section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct\nstandard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant.3 Since defendant has\nfailed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the\njudgment.\n\n                                                         ___________________________\n                                                                             PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n2For this reason, Holder v.
