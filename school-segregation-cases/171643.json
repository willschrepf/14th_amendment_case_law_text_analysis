GRADY JOLLY, Circuit Judge:*\n       Mississippi prisoner Kirby Tate brought suit against prison officials for\nplacing him in super-maximum security, solitary confinement for two years\nwithout satisfying due process requirements. Tate appeals the district court’s\ngrant of the defendants’ summary judgment motion and the denial of his motion\nto reopen. We AFFIRM in part and VACATE in part the district court’s grant\nof summary judgment, and VACATE the denial of the motion to reopen. We\nREMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings.\n                                              I.\n       Kirby Tate was sentenced to sixty years of imprisonment without the\npossibility for parole after being convicted of intent to distribute one half pound\nof marijuana.1 Until February 22, 2008, Tate’s prison classification was “B\n\n\n       *\n         Pursuant to 5TH CIR . R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR .\nR. 47.5.4.\n       1\n          On January 28, 1991, Tate pleaded guilty to two counts of sale of marijuana less than\none ounce and was sentenced to serve three years in prison for three years on each count. Tate\nv. State, 912 So. 2d 919, 922 n.2 (Miss. 2005). Twelve years later, in 2003, Tate was convicted\nof possession with intent to deliver and delivery of marijuana. Id. at 922. He was sentenced\nas a habitual and enhanced offender and sentenced to serve two concurrent sentences of sixty\nyears without the possibility of the sentences being reduced or suspended. Id. at 922-23.\nBecause Tate is not eligible for early release, he will not be released from prison until he is\nninety-nine years old. Id. Tate’s conviction and subsequent appeals have several unusual\nfeatures.\n\n       Tate was arrested on March 10, 2003 after giving a quantity of marijuana to\ngovernment informant Gerald Warren. Id. at 922. Tate presented an entrapment defense,\nclaiming that Warren left marijuana in Tate’s shed without Tate’s knowledge and Tate was\n\n                                              2\n\f   Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627          Page: 3    Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-60384\n\nCustody,” which entitled him to substantial privileges, including contact\nvisitation with his family, ability to watch television, and recreation time with\nother prisoners. On February 22, 2008, Tate was validated as a Security Threat\nGroup “Disruptive Core Leader” by prison officials, who charged that Tate was\na leader of the prison gang the Simon City Royals. Consequently, Tate was\nreclassified as “D Custody” and relocated to Unit 32 at Parchman, with super-\nmaximum security, solitary confinement conditions.                    In response to his\nreclassification, Tate brought this federal suit against numerous Mississippi\nDepartment of Corrections (MDOC) officials, asserting that they denied him\naccess to courts, disciplined him as a form of retaliation, and reclassified him\nfrom B Custody to the super-maximum security D Custody without a hearing or\n\n\n\n\nreturning it to Warren–not selling it–at the time he was arrested. Id. at 924-25.\n\n        The credibility of Gerald Warren was called into question at the time of trial when his\nfourteen year old daughter, Brittany Warren, approached the defense with several numerous\nassertions against his credibility, including that he owned four to five pounds of marijuana,\nsmoked marijuana, and that he had attempted to prostitute her for drugs. Id. at 928-29. She\nwas prepared to testify that Gerald Warren answered in the affirmative when asked whether\nhe set Tate up for $2,000 and a pound of marijuana given to him by the East Mississippi Task\nForce. Id. at 929. The trial court declined to admit Brittany’s testimony for a number of\nreasons, including her mother’s preference that she not testify and that Brittany had recently\nundergone drug treatment. Id. at 930.\n\n       After Tate was convicted, Gerald Warren recanted his trial testimony that Tate had\ndelivered drugs to him and admitted that he had planted the drugs in Tate’s shed. Tate v.\nParker, 2010 WL 2606045, *1 (S.D. Miss. June 22, 2010). Warren provided a recorded\ninterview with Tate’s counsel and signed two affidavits to this effect. Id. The district court\nfound, for a multitude of reasons, that Warren had “virtually no credibility” and thus that the\nnew evidence of Warren’s recantation of trial testimony was insufficient to satisfy Tate’s\nburden that, in light of the new evidence, it was more likely than not that no reasonable juror\nwould find Tate guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Id. at *5-*6.\n\n       Tate has filed several writs of habeas corpus, which have been dismissed. See Tate v.\nParker, 2007 WL 892449 (S.D. Miss. Jan. 16, 2007); Tate v. Parker, 2010 WL 2606045 (S.D.\nMiss. June 22, 2010); Tate v. Kelley, 2011 WL 1103769 (S.D. Miss. March 23, 2011). On March\n23, 2011, however, the district court certified for appeal the issue of whether Tate’s sentence\nwas grossly disproportionate to his crime. Tate, 2011 WL 1103769 at *4.\n\n                                              3\n\f   Case: 09-60384     Document: 00511514627        Page: 4    Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                     No. 09-60384\n\nwritten disclosure of the facts used to make the determination that he was a\ngang leader all in violation of his due process rights.\n      This case presents a somewhat confused record both procedurally and\nsubstantively. Although the initial pleadings seem to have been brought under\nthe consent decree of Presley v. Epps, Civil Action No. 4:05CV148, the complaint\nalso alleged, without citing the statute, certain 42 U.S.C. § 1983 constitutional\nclaims relating to retaliation, access to courts, and denial of due process rights.\nThe defendants have never raised the propriety of Tate’s claim proceeding only\nunder Presley as a defense or otherwise, but instead–apparently acknowledging\nthat the complaint alleged a § 1983 claim–moved for summary judgment on the\ngrounds that there was no issue of material fact and that Tate’s classification\nwas in compliance with the Mississippi Department of Corrections guidelines\nand not violative of Tate’s constitutional rights.2\n      Tate’s original complaint, filed on June 6, 2008, included allegations that\nprison officials were improperly interfering with his access to courts.             His\ncomplaint read, in relevant part:\n      MDOC officials have systematically interfered with my access to\n      courts not only in my habeas petitions, but also in my attempts to\n      file this complaint. They have intentionally tried to make me miss\n      deadlines, confiscated stamps provided by my attorney, monitored\n      confidential attorney client telephone calls, and censored\n      confidential attorney-client mail, including this Complaint.\n\nTate’s complaint was signed “Kirby Tate by, Sylvia Owen [Attorney for\nPlaintiff]” and was executed at Unit 32, Parchman, Mississippi.\n      The defendants moved for summary judgment but did not assert that\nTate’s affidavit did not constitute competent evidence. On February 25, 2009,\nthe Magistrate Judge filed a Report and Recommendation in which he sua sponte\n\n\n      2\n         The defendants’ motion for summary judgment was not briefed and was unresponsive\nto several of the allegations in Tate’s complaint.\n\n                                           4\n\f   Case: 09-60384    Document: 00511514627       Page: 5    Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-60384\n\nraided the issue and ruled that Tate’s complaint did not constitute admissible\nevidence because it was signed by Tate’s counsel, rather than Tate.\nAccordingly, he found that there was no bona fide dispute of material facts. The\nmagistrate judge also sua sponte addressed Tate’s access to courts claim– not\naddressed by the defendants’ motion for summary judgment–and found that\nTate had not stated a claim. Further, the magistrate judge recommended, sua\nsponte, that Tate’s complaint be dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a\nclaim because an individual prisoner cannot state a claim based upon failure to\ncomply with the provisions of Presley.\n      Tate’s objections to the Report and Recommendation were due by March\n11, 2009. Tate’s counsel filed a motion for extended time, noting that prison\nofficials refused to allow Tate to have his affidavit notarized. The court granted\nthe motion, giving Tate until March 25 to submit his objections. On March 25,\nTate filed a brief in support of objections and also a notice of technical difficulty\nregarding a scanner malfunction. On March 30, the district court issued an\nopinion overruling Tate’s objections to the Report and Recommendation and\napproving and adopting the Report and Recommendation. On the same day,\nTate filed a motion to reconsider, stating that “[d]ue to a scanner malfunction\nand prison legal mail it was not possible to file the [e]xhibits,” which included\nover thirty pages, including Tate’s affidavit and the affidavit of his counsel. On\nApril 13, 2009, Tate filed an amended motion for reconsideration. On April 16,\n2009, the district court issued an order denying Tate’s motion to reopen, finding\nthat Tate had failed to produce a legal or factual basis to alter the court’s ruling.\nTate timely appealed.\n                                         II.\n      We begin by noting that the district court cited cases holding that\nprisoners have no liberty interest in their classification. To the extent that the\nsummary judgment disposition of this case relied upon such cases, particularly\n\n                                          5\n\f   Case: 09-60384    Document: 00511514627      Page: 6    Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                    No. 09-60384\n\nHernandez v. Valasquez, 522 F.3d 556, 563-64 (5th Cir. 2008) and Pichardo v.\nKinker, 73 F.3d 612, 612-13 (5th Cir. 1996), the district court erred in not\nconsidering Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209 (2005), which constitutes a crucial\nexception to the general rule that a prisoner has no liberty interest in his\nclassification: that is, when the prisoner is incarcerated in super-maximum\nsecurity conditions, as was Tate.\n       We review the district court’s denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse\nof discretion. When deciding whether to grant a motion to reconsider, the trial\ncourt should consider the importance and probative value of the evidence, the\nreason for the moving party's failure to introduce the evidence earlier, and the\npossibility of prejudice to the non-moving party. Garcia v. Women's Hosp. of\nTex., 97 F.3d 810, 814 (5th Cir. 1996). Additionally, the decision of the district\ncourt “will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing that it has worked an\ninjustice.” Id.\n      With this in mind, we evaluate the district court’s denial of Tate’s motion\nfor reconsideration.   Tate contends that he presented significant new and\nadmissible evidence that the magistrate judge and district court refused to\nconsider on grounds that his original complaint was not signed. Tate’s original\ncomplaint noted “MDOC officials have systematically interfered with my access\nto courts . . . in my attempts to file this complaint. They have intentionally tried\nto make me miss deadlines . . . and censored confidential attorney-client mail,\nincluding this Complaint.”     Furthermore, the objections to the Report and\nRecommendation and the motion to reopen–addressing the basis of the\nmagistrate judge’s ruling, that is, that the complaint had not been signed–also\nalleged that Tate had not signed and submitted the necessary filings because the\nprison officials had prevented him from doing so. At oral argument, Tate’s\ncounsel further explained this claim by stating that prison guards refused to\npermit Tate to sign his pleading when she brought it to him on a visit.\n\n                                         6\n\f   Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627           Page: 7     Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-60384\n\nAdditionally, Tate’s counsel filed motions for extensions of time on March 16\nand March 30, 2009, claiming that prison officials were impeding Tate from\nsigning the necessary documents.3 Where important, probative evidence was not\nbefore the court because of the potentially illegal actions of defendants, an\ninjustice has been suggested.\n       Tate’s complaint was both important and probative to the appropriateness\nof granting the motion for summary judgment. The potential viability of Tate’s\nclaim to survive summary judgment is illustrated through the similar case of\nHogan v. Epps, 2009 WL 4785860 (S.D. Miss., Dec. 8, 2009) (unpublished). In\nHogan, the prisoner plaintiff alleged that, while housed at Parchman, he was\nidentified as a Security Threat Group leader and transferred to super-maximum\nsecurity conditions without due process. Id. at *2. The district court denied the\nstate’s summary judgment motion to dismiss Hogan’s due process claim, after\nfinding that:\n       Defendants have supported their motion with no evidence as to the\n       conditions or restrictions in the STG Units, the nature or frequency\n       of review accorded inmates in the units, or the circumstances under\n       which an inmate may be removed from STG segregation.\nId. at *3. As in Hogan, the defendants here have provided no information about\nthe conditions and restrictions of STG units or the circumstances under which\nan inmate may be removed from STG segregation.4 Further, the defendants\n\n\n       3\n        Tate has consistently maintained–in his original complaint filed on June 6, 2008 until\npresent–that MDOC officials interfered with his complaint.\n       4\n         The evidence supporting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment comprised of:\n(1) the affidavit of Ricky Scott, the CID Investigator who validated Tate; (2) computerized\nclassification record forms from February 28, 2008 to July 30, 2008; and (3) the affidavit of Dr.\nGloria Perry, discussing Tate’s psychological condition. Noticeably absent from the\ndefendants’ summary judgment evidence was an affidavit attesting to the quality and content\nof Tate’s possible classification hearing. The evidence submitted, like that presented in\nHogan, fails to discuss the condition and restrictions of STG units, the form or content of the\nhearings alleged STG leaders receive before transfer, or circumstances under which an inmate\nmay be removed from STG segregation.\n\n                                               7\n\f   Case: 09-60384      Document: 00511514627         Page: 8    Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                      No. 09-60384\n\nsubmitted a three-page motion for summary judgment and neither party\nprovided a supporting brief with the motion or response. In this light, the\nimportance of Tate’s complaint is clear: it addressed the issues in detail and\nthus provided significant probative value.           We therefore conclude that the\ndistrict   court   erred   in   adopting     the   magistrate     judge’s    Report    and\nRecommendation and abused its discretion in not further considering the motion\nto reopen. The judgment dismissing this complaint is, therefore, VACATED and\nthe case REMANDED.\n       We suggest that the district court allow a Spears hearing to consider at\nleast two matters. First, the district court should consider Tate’s claim of the\ndenial of access to courts, most particularly whether Tate was improperly\nprevented from signing his complaint and timely submitting his affidavit\ncontesting the prison’s policy. Second, the district court should consider whether\nthe due process afforded to Tate during his reclassification into D custody, and\nsubsequent review of the custody, satisfy the due process standards referenced\nin Wilkinson v. Austin.5\n       Tate also raised an additional claim relating to retaliation. The part of the\njudgment dismissing the retaliation claim is affirmed. The only viable claims\nremaining for the court to consider on remand are Tate’s access to courts and\ndue process claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\nAFFIRMED, in part, and VACATED, in part, and the case is REMANDED.\n                      AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part; and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         We are very sensitive to the fact that prison security issues are clearly involved.\nHowever, at oral argument, the defendants’ counsel offered that they would be fully amenable\nto the court undertaking an in camera inspection of the evidence they have against Tate\nimplicating him as a leader in the security threat group.\n\n                                             8\n\f   Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627          Page: 9     Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-60384\n\nJERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n\n       Kirby Tate is a three-time convicted drug dealer who state prison officials\nbelieve is the leader of a prison gang known primarily for drug distribution.1\nThey accordingly confined him in a super-maximum security prison unit, be-\ncause he posed a security threat. Tate argues that the prison provided insuf-\nficient process in making that determination, but he did not proffer any evidence\nsupporting his allegations before the district court granted summary judgment.\n       Giving Tate a mulligan, the majority (1) distorts or ignores crucial facts,\n(2) significantly muddles our caselaw concerning the standard for reviewing the\ndenial of a motion to reconsider a judgment, (3) orders the district court to con-\nsider a claim that Tate did not preserve on appeal and that was not mentioned\nat oral argument, and (4) suggests that it is appropriate for a district court to re-\nview the substantive evidence supporting a state prison’s classification deter-\nmination in adjudicating a procedural due process claim. Moreover, the majority\ndoes so after having turned oral argument into a meandering, eighty-minute evi-\ndentiary hearing2 involving unsworn, hearsay testimony by each party’s counsel.\nI respectfully dissent and would affirm the summary judgment and the denial\nof the request to reopen.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         The majority seeks to buttress its opinion by dredging up facts to cast doubt on Tate’s\nmost recent conviction, even though those facts are utterly irrelevant to this appeal concerning\nprison conditions, and despite the fact that the conviction was upheld by the Mississippi Su-\npreme Court and on habeas corpus review (only a challenge to the length of Tate’s three-\nstrikes-law sentence remains). The majority’s cherry-picking of irrelevant but sympathetic\nfacts merely gives the impressionSSnot unwarrantedSSthat its opinion is motivated more by\nmisplaced sympathy for a criminal than by careful legal analysis.\n       2\n        Even the most complex and important cases in this circuit usually receive, at most,\nforty minutes of oral argument. A very limited number, including en banc cases, receive an\nhour. This frivolous appeal was the exception and was given about double the customary time.\n\n                                               9\n\f   Case: 09-60384        Document: 00511514627            Page: 10       Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                          No. 09-60384\n\n                                                  I.\n       Tate sued the Mississippi Department of Corrections (“MDOC”) and many\nof its officials in June 2008, via a complaint signed only by his lawyer, which the\nmajority erroneously and misleadingly refers to as “Tate’s affidavit”. R.23. Four\nmonths passed, and Tate did not present any evidence—not one iota—supporting\nhis allegations. The discovery deadline expired in October 2008. Two months\nlater, with a bare record, the MDOC moved for summary judgment on Tate’s\nclaims. R.188-89. Two months after that, with the record still bare, the magis-\ntrate judge issued a report in which he noted that Tate had not presented any\nproper summary judgment evidence because he had never signed his complaint\nand had not submitted anything else to support his allegations.3\n       Although Tate’s attorney, Sylvia Owen, had signed the complaint and de-\nclared that it was true and correct under penalty of perjury, a verified complaint\nsigned only by an attorney who, like Owen, lacks personal knowledge of a mat-\nter, is not competent summary judgment evidence, but only hearsay.4 According\n\n\n       3\n            See R.262 (“Tate’s complaint asserts that Tate is not a member of any gang, much less\na gang leader. But his complaint, while containing language that it is under oath, is signed\nnot by Tate, but his counsel. . . . Therefore Tate has failed to provide admissible evidence\n. . . .”). The majority makes much of the fact that the magistrate judge addressed the eviden-\ntiary value of Tate’s complaint sua sponte, but he had the authority to do so. See Celotex Corp.\nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325 (1986) (“[D]istrict courts are widely acknowledged to possess the\npower to enter summary judgments sua sponte, so long as the losing party was on notice that\nshe had to come forward with all of her evidence.”). Even assuming that Tate was not on no-\ntice about the fact that he had no competent summary judgment evidence to support his claims\neight months after he filed his complaint, he had about a month after the magistrate judge’s\nreport to sign his complaint, but did not do so, and, as will be discussed, it was his own fault\nthat the district court granted summary judgment.\n       4\n         See, e.g., FED . R. CIV . P. 56(c)(4) (“An affidavit or declaration used to support or oppose\na motion must be made on personal knowledge . . . .”); Wells Fargo Home Mortg., Inc. v. Lind-\nquist, 592 F.3d 838, 845-46 (8th Cir. 2010) (holding that district court properly ignored attor-\nney’s affidavit because he did not assert personal knowledge of the transaction); Brainard v.\nAm. Skandia Life Assur. Corp., 432 F.3d 655, 667 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding attorney’s affidavit\nthat does nothing more than assemble properly authenticated evidence is still not admissible,\nbecause it is not based on personal knowledge); United States v. Peterson, 414 F.3d 825, 827\n                                                                                         (continued...)\n\n                                                 10\n\f  Case: 09-60384        Document: 00511514627           Page: 11     Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-60384\n\nly, the magistrate judge properly ignored it and recommended summary judg-\nment.\n        Owen stated at oral argument that the reason the complaint was not\nsigned by Tate was that prison officials had prevented her from passing the doc-\nument to him during visitation. She says she complained to the MDOC, “all the\nway to the warden,” to no avail. But, aside from Tate’s affidavit filed after the\ndistrict court had granted summary judgment, R.373, there is no indication of\nany of that in the record, even though the record contains dozens of pages of\ncommunications between Owen and the MDOC that Owen submitted. See\nR.55-93.\n        If Tate’s and Owen’s assertions were true, one would expect them to have\nuttered those claims around the time the complaint was filed, not after the dis-\ntrict court had granted summary judgment over eight months later. Indeed,\neven after the magistrate judge recommended summary judgment because Tate\nhad not signed his complaint and there was nothing else to support his allega-\ntions, Tate and Owen still did not mention that the prison had obstructed Tate’s\nattempt to sign it.5 We should not rely on Tate’s and Owen’s self-serving, post\n\n\n        4\n          (...continued)\n(7th Cir. 2005) (“The lawyer’s affidavit, being hearsay, is no evidence at all.”); Albright v.\nFDIC, 1994 U.S. App. LEXIS 6206, at *16-*17 (1st Cir. Apr. 1, 1994) (unpublished) (holding\nthat attorney’s affidavit was not competent evidence of his clients’ agreement or\ncommunications with the defendants, because it was not based on personal knowledge); Suit\nv. Ellis, 282 F.2d 145, 147 n.2 (5th Cir. 1960) (“The motion for new trial is of little assistance\nto the petitioner except as a pleading to be considered by the Court, because the affidavit was\nmade by the attorney and not by the petitioner, and because it failed to contain any showing\nthat the attorney had any personal knowledge of the facts alleged.”); 11 JAM ES W. MOORE ET\nAL ., MOORE ’S FEDERAL PRACTICE § 56.94[7][a], at 56-245 (3d ed. 2011) (stating that, in\nopposing summary judgment, “an attorney’s affidavit or declaration is subject to the same\npersonal knowledge requirement as any other affidavit or declaration . . . .”).\n        5\n        When Owen was asked at oral argument whether she mentioned to the magistrate\njudge that prison officials had prevented her from passing the complaint to Tate at visitation,\nshe said, “I believe that’s in my affidavit.” But Owen’s affidavit, dated September 5, 2008,\n                                                                                (continued...)\n\n                                               11\n\f  Case: 09-60384        Document: 00511514627          Page: 12     Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-60384\n\nhoc explanations to force the district court to grant reconsideration. Yet the ma-\njority does precisely that.\n       Indeed, the majority goes further by making the unsupportable contention\nthat Tate’s complaint itself alleged that the MDOC had prevented him from sign-\ning it. That is physically and temporally impossible. According to Owen’s claims\nat oral argument, she brought the complaint to the prison, where she sat down\nacross from Tate separated by glass and could not hand the complaint to him be-\ncause prison officials would not let her, so she signed it herself then and there.\nThe complaint could not have related those events, because, if they occurred, it\nmust have been after it was written.\n       What the complaint alleged was merely that prison officials had “censored\nconfidential attorney-client mail, including this Complaint.” R.38 (emphasis ad-\nded). Moreover, the complaint explained the alleged “censor[ing]” of prison mail\nthat the majority relies on, and it has nothing to do with preventing Tate from\nsigning the complaint: When Tate attempted to mail the complaint to his attor-\nney (unsigned, apparently), he “instructed the [prison] not to open it or make a\ncopy. However, they obviously did so anyway because they returned a copy to\n[Tate].” R.38 n.4. Alleging that a prison read a high-security inmate’s mail be-\nfore mailing it and gave the inmate a copy does not equate to alleging that the\nprison obstructed a client’s attempt to sign it.6 Thus, despite the majority’s\nclaims, the record does not show that the MDOC prevented Tate from signing\nhis complaint before the magistrate judge excluded it from evidence.\n\n\n\n       5\n         (...continued)\ndoes not so allege. See R.366-71. Moreover, in what appears to be a pattern, Owen’s affidavit\nis not competent evidence, because she never signed it. R.11, 371.\n       6\n        According to the MDOC, it needed to monitor Tate’s communications with Owen be-\ncause they were in a physical relationship together, so she posed a security risk. There is no\nevidence in the record to support that claim, but the district court may wish to inquire into the\nmatter on remand.\n\n                                               12\n\f  Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627          Page: 13      Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-60384\n\n       What the record does showSSand the majority omitsSSis that Owen mailed\nan affidavit to Tate on February 26, 2009, a day after the magistrate judge is-\nsued his report recommending summary judgment.7 In other words, Owen was\nnot diligently attempting to get Tate’s complaint signed for months; it was not\nuntil the deadline that Owen realized for the first time that her client needed to\nsign something. That is not at all that surprising, given that she is an estate\nplanning attorney who says she is representing Tate as a family friend, not a liti-\ngator with trial expertise. Owen’s inexperience, not prison interference, is the\nreason Tate’s complaint had not been signed over the course of eight months.\n       After Owen sent Tate the affidavit in February 2009, she was unsuccessful\nin obtaining a signed copy from him, so she sought a ten-day extension, allegedly\nbecause “prison officials refused to allow [Tate] to have it notarized,” and\n“[Tate’s] mental state after being locked down for over a year appears to be hin-\ndering his ability to follow instructions and assist counsel in the production of\nthis case.” R.266.8 That Owen asked for only a ten-day extension casts further\ndoubt on her allegations of prison malfeasance, because if the MDOC had really\nbeen consistently denying her client access to her documents for almost a year\nby that point, one would think she would have asked for more than an extra ten\ndays. Regardless, the district court granted Owen precisely the ten-day exten-\nsion she requested. R.269.\n       When the deadline expired, Owen filed objections to the magistrate judge’s\nreport without any accompanying evidence. In her brief, she stated that “Tate\n\n\n\n       7\n         See R.266 (“Magistrate Jerry Davis filed his Report and Recommendations in the\nabove referenced action on February 25, 2009 . . . . Plaintiff’s counsel mailed an affidavit to\nPlaintiff on February 26, 2009 . . . .”).\n       8\n        Given that Tate’s affidavit did not need to be notarized, only signed and declared true\nand correct under penalty of perjury, see DIRECTV, Inc. v. Budden, 420 F.3d 521, 530-31 (5th\nCir. 2005) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 1746 (2006)), even if Owen’s allegations were true, one can ques-\ntion whether the prison materially hindered her from obtaining Tate’s affidavit.\n\n                                              13\n\f  Case: 09-60384    Document: 00511514627       Page: 14   Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-60384\n\nwill miss the ten day deadline to file his affidavit” because “he was not allowed\nto have [it] notarized.” R.296. She did not explain why she had failed to submit\nany other evidence. The next day, however, she filed a notice of technical diffi-\nculty explaining that she could not submit Tate’s exhibits because of a “scanner\nmalfunction,” but that “[t]he problem will be corrected promptly.” R.11, 328. She\ndid not request an extension of her deadline to submit evidence. At that point,\nit would have appeared to the district court that Owen had every document she\nrequired but only needed a few hours or an extra day to submit them.\n       Five days passed, however, with silence from Tate and his counsel. The\ndistrict court, its deadline now having been flouted, pulled the trigger and grant-\ned summary judgment to the MDOC. R.331-32. Given that Owen did not re-\nquest an extension of her already-extended deadline, and that her reason for the\ndelay was a “scanner malfunction” that continued for five days, it was not unrea-\nsonable for the district court to do so.\n       Immediately after the court entered summary judgment, on March 30,\n2009, Owen filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion to reopen the\ncase on the ground that, “[d]ue to a scanner malfunction and prison legal mail[,]\nit was not possible to file” her exhibits on time. R.333-34. Along with that mo-\ntion, she submitted a number of documents, including affidavits from Tate’s\nbrother and wife, signed February 25 and 28, respectively, and various public\ndocuments relating to the procedures the MDOC had provided Tate. R.335-59.\nAny of those documents could have been filed months earlier and have nothing\nto do with the prison’s alleged interference with Owen’s communications with\nher client, but the majority holds that the district court must consider them any-\nway.\n       Along with her motion to reopen, Owen filed a motion for additional time\nto obtain Tate’s affidavit on the ground that the prison had “interfer[ed] with le-\ngal mail when [Tate] attempted to make the necessary revisions to his Affidavit.”\n\n                                           14\n\f  Case: 09-60384    Document: 00511514627       Page: 15   Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-60384\n\nR.360. She also submitted an untimely affidavit of her own, dated September\n2008, which the court rejected because she had not signed it. R.11, 366-71. Fi-\nnally, in April 2009, before the court could rule on the motion for additional time,\nOwen submitted another rule 59(e) motion to reopen, along with various docu-\nments, including another copy of Tate’s complaint and an affidavit, both of which\nTate finally signed and declared true and correct under penalty of perjury.\nR.372-415. The district court then declined to reopen, without considering the\nadditional materials, because the “same arguments” were before the magistrate\njudge when he issued his report and recommendation. R.416.\n\n\n                                        II.\n      Where, as here, the district court did “not expressly or impliedly refer to\nthe materials [submitted with a rule 59(e) motion] in its ruling,” we review its\ndenial of the motion for abuse of discretion. Templet v. Hydrochem, Inc., 367\nF.3d 473, 477 (5th Cir. 2004). The majority cites Garcia v. Woman’s Hospital of\nTexas, 97 F.3d 810, 814 (5th Cir. 1994), for the proposition that a decision not to\nreopen “will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing that it has worked an\ninjustice in the cause.” The majority concludes, however, that “because an in-\njustice has been suggested” (emphasis added), not shown, the district court\nabused its discretion. Not only does the majority ignore the very standard it\ncites but, by its reasoning, no judgment would ever be final.\n      We do not have a freewheeling “possible injustice” standard for reviewing\ndenials of motions to reopen, and it will cause chaos in the district courts if we\nadopt one. To the contrary, because granting rule 59(e) relief to reopen a final\njudgment is an “extraordinary remedy” that should be “used sparingly,” id. at\n479 (citations omitted), we reverse a denial of a rule 59(e) motion only to correct\nmanifest errors of law or fact or because of newly discovered evidence. Id. (citing\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f  Case: 09-60384        Document: 00511514627           Page: 16     Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-60384\n\nWaltman v. Int’l Paper Co., 875 F.2d 468, 473 (5th Cir. 1989)).9 Those are the\nspecific kinds of “injustice” that we have held are grounds for reversing a denial\nof a rule 59(e) motion. Such a motion “is not the proper vehicle for rehashing ev-\nidence, legal theories, or arguments that could have been offered or raised before\nthe entry of judgment.” Id.\n       An unexcused failure to present evidence available at the time of summary\njudgment is a valid reason for denying a motion to reopen. Id. (citing Russ v.\nInt’l Paper Co., 943 F.2d 589, 593 (5th Cir. 1991)). For example, in Templet the\nplaintiffs did not provide expert evidence to the district court before summary\njudgment because, by the time they obtained the evidence, the deadline for pro-\nviding such evidence had expired. Id. at 478. The plaintiffs argued, in their mo-\ntion for reconsideration, that they could not have produced the evidence without\nviolating the scheduling order, but the district court denied the motion to recon-\nsider because plaintiffs could have asked for a continuance or a rescheduling of\ndeadlines before summary judgment. Id. at 479. We held that the court did not\nabuse its discretion. Id. at 479-80.\n       The same is true here. Tate does not and cannot allege that the district\ncourt manifestly misconstrued the law or facts when it granted summary judg-\nment, because the record was essentially bare. There were thus no facts to mis-\nconstrue, and without facts, there was no law that could help Tate.10 Moreover,\n\n\n\n       9\n         We may also do so when there has been an intervening change in the controlling law,\nSchiller v. Physicians Res. Grp., Inc., 342 F.3d 563, 567-68 (5th Cir. 2003), but that is not the\nsituation here.\n       10\n          Irrespective of whether Tate both possesses a liberty interest and was denied due\nprocess under Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209 (2005)—issues that neither the majority nor\nI address—Tate did not showSSbefore the district court granted summary judgmentSSany com-\npetent evidence of either a liberty interest or a due process violation, let alone sufficient evi-\ndence to satisfy his burden to defeat summary judgment. See Duffie v. United States, 600 F.3d\n362, 371 (5th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he nonmoving party cannot survive a summary judgment motion\nby resting on the mere allegations of its pleadings.”).\n\n                                               16\n\f  Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627          Page: 17      Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-60384\n\nTate was obviously aware of the possibility that his testimony could be used as\nevidence, so it was not newly discovered.11\n       It is true that Tate alleged that the MDOC prevented him from getting the\naffidavit notarized, but if he did not believe he could submit evidence on time,\nit was his responsibility to ask for an extension before summary judgment, as he\nhad once already done.12 Instead, he said, through counsel, that he would sub-\nmit all his exhibits as soon as a scanner malfunction was promptly corrected.\nThe district court patiently waited for five days, and when still nothing was\nforthcoming, it entered a final judgment. Because it was Tate’s own fault that\nthe court decided the case, the court was entitled to deny his rule 59(e) motion\nfor reconsideration.\n       In addition, we have no information about the extent, nature, or impropri-\nety of the MDOC’s alleged interference. We have nothing more than an unelab-\norated assertion of “interference” with legal mail causing “delay.” R.373. The\nmajority thus reopens the case, as it concedes, based only on the possibility that\ninjustice might have occurred. That will open the door to any number of plain-\ntiffs’ seeking to reopen cases based on unsupported allegations of injustice when\nthe case does not go their way, and this will significantly increase costs on both\nthe court system and parties. It cannot be squared with the notion that recon-\nsideration of a judgment is an “extraordinary remedy that should be used spar-\n\n\n\n       11\n        See Templet, 367 F.3d at 479 (holding evidence was not newly discovered because “the\nunderlying facts were well within the [party’s] knowledge prior to the district court’s entry of\njudgment”).\n       12\n          See Fanning v. Metro. Transit Auth., 141 F. App’x 311, 314 (5th Cir. 2005) (“[O]ur\ncourt has foreclosed a party’s contention on appeal that it had inadequate time to marshal evi-\ndence to defend against summary judgment when the party did not seek Rule 56(f) [now rule\n56(d)] relief before the summary judgment ruling. A Rule 56[(d)] motion [for continuance], not\n[a rule 59(e) motion] for reconsideration, is the proper remedy for a party claiming summary\njudgment is inappropriate because of inadequate discovery.” (citing Potter v. Delta Air Lines,\nInc., 98 F.3d 881, 887 (5th Cir. 1996))).\n\n                                              17\n\f  Case: 09-60384    Document: 00511514627      Page: 18    Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-60384\n\ningly.” Templet, 367 F.3d at 479 (citations omitted).\n      Moreover, the majority does not consider that Tate’s claim of interference\nis questionable given that, as discussed in part I, Tate and Owen now say that\nthe prison interfered with Tate’s attempts to sign his original complaint, yet they\ndid not see fit to mention that salient fact over the course of eight months until\nafter summary judgment had been granted. That is not to say Tate and Owen\nnecessarily lied, but only to reason that the district court did not abuse its dis-\ncretion by not granting the “extraordinary remedy” of reopening the case\n\n\n                                        III.\n      Just as troubling as the majority’s legal analysis, however, is that it reach-\nes its conclusion by seizing on the explanations that Owen gave at our eighty-\nminute “evidentiary hearing,” while ignoring the MDOC’s attorney’s claims that\nOwen’s post hoc allegations were false. Although the majority pays lip service\nto the abuse-of-discretion standard for motions to reopen, it essentially reviews\nthe district court’s decision de novo by putting its own credibility determinations\nahead of the district court’s conclusions. There is no law that I am aware of that\ngives us the authority to decide that the district court got it wrong and to reach\nthat conclusion by turning oral argument into a fact-gathering excursion, then\nbasing our ruling on our own assessment of each party’s lawyer’s credibility at\nargument. If the practice of retrying cases at oral argument becomes wide-\nspread, we will have mostly done away with the notion of deference to the dis-\ntrict courts, and the courts will incur considerable expense by having to con-\nstruct witness stands in appellate courtrooms.\n\n\n                                        IV.\n      The majority also errs by inexplicably resurrecting a claim that Tate had\nwaived.

The notion that the MDOC might\nbe prejudiced by the majority’s eleventh-hour action apparently does not concern\nthe majority in any way.\n\n\n                                         V.\n      The majority drops a footnote, near the end of its opinion, suggesting that\nthe district court undertake an in camera review of the MDOC’s evidence against\nTate, because the MDOC stated that it was “fully amenable” to doing so. That\ncreates the impression that this case turns on whether Tate was properly classi-\nfied as a gang leader. It does not. The majority appears to have forgotten that\nTate’s claim is one of procedural due process—i.e., whether the MDOC has fol-\nlowed constitutionally adequate procedures in classifying Tate—not a question\nof whether the MDOC had adequate substantive ground to place him in Unit 32.\nNo law exists for the proposition that federal courts may sit as tribunals in re-\nview of state prisons’ substantive decisions concerning who should or should not\nbe placed in super-maximum-security custody. Whether the MDOC made the\nright decision in moving Tate into Unit 32 is entirely irrelevant to whether his\ndue process rights were violated.\n\n\n                                        VI.\n      The majority opinion does have two virtues.

The second is that the majority does not grant or deny sum-\n\n                                         19\n\f  Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627         Page: 20     Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                      No. 09-60384\n\nmary judgment but remands to the district court to consider any issues it deems\nappropriate.\n       The district court should inquire whether Tate’s claim is moot.

He was sentenced\nas a habitual and enhanced offender and sentenced to serve two concurrent sentences of sixty\nyears without the possibility of the sentences being reduced or suspended. Id. at 922-23.\nBecause Tate is not eligible for early release, he will not be released from prison until he is\nninety-nine years old. Id. Tate’s conviction and subsequent appeals have several unusual\nfeatures.\n\n       Tate was arrested on March 10, 2003 after giving a quantity of marijuana to\ngovernment informant Gerald Warren. Id. at 922. Tate presented an entrapment defense,\nclaiming that Warren left marijuana in Tate’s shed without Tate’s knowledge and Tate was\n\n                                              2\n\f   Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627          Page: 3    Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-60384\n\nCustody,” which entitled him to substantial privileges, including contact\nvisitation with his family, ability to watch television, and recreation time with\nother prisoners. On February 22, 2008, Tate was validated as a Security Threat\nGroup “Disruptive Core Leader” by prison officials, who charged that Tate was\na leader of the prison gang the Simon City Royals. Consequently, Tate was\nreclassified as “D Custody” and relocated to Unit 32 at Parchman, with super-\nmaximum security, solitary confinement conditions.                    In response to his\nreclassification, Tate brought this federal suit against numerous Mississippi\nDepartment of Corrections (MDOC) officials, asserting that they denied him\naccess to courts, disciplined him as a form of retaliation, and reclassified him\nfrom B Custody to the super-maximum security D Custody without a hearing or\n\n\n\n\nreturning it to Warren–not selling it–at the time he was arrested. Id. at 924-25.\n\n        The credibility of Gerald Warren was called into question at the time of trial when his\nfourteen year old daughter, Brittany Warren, approached the defense with several numerous\nassertions against his credibility, including that he owned four to five pounds of marijuana,\nsmoked marijuana, and that he had attempted to prostitute her for drugs. Id. at 928-29. She\nwas prepared to testify that Gerald Warren answered in the affirmative when asked whether\nhe set Tate up for $2,000 and a pound of marijuana given to him by the East Mississippi Task\nForce. Id. at 929. The trial court declined to admit Brittany’s testimony for a number of\nreasons, including her mother’s preference that she not testify and that Brittany had recently\nundergone drug treatment. Id. at 930.\n\n       After Tate was convicted, Gerald Warren recanted his trial testimony that Tate had\ndelivered drugs to him and admitted that he had planted the drugs in Tate’s shed.

Although the initial pleadings seem to have been brought under\nthe consent decree of Presley v. Epps, Civil Action No. 4:05CV148, the complaint\nalso alleged, without citing the statute, certain 42 U.S.C. § 1983 constitutional\nclaims relating to retaliation, access to courts, and denial of due process rights.\nThe defendants have never raised the propriety of Tate’s claim proceeding only\nunder Presley as a defense or otherwise, but instead–apparently acknowledging\nthat the complaint alleged a § 1983 claim–moved for summary judgment on the\ngrounds that there was no issue of material fact and that Tate’s classification\nwas in compliance with the Mississippi Department of Corrections guidelines\nand not violative of Tate’s constitutional rights.2\n      Tate’s original complaint, filed on June 6, 2008, included allegations that\nprison officials were improperly interfering with his access to courts.             His\ncomplaint read, in relevant part:\n      MDOC officials have systematically interfered with my access to\n      courts not only in my habeas petitions, but also in my attempts to\n      file this complaint. They have intentionally tried to make me miss\n      deadlines, confiscated stamps provided by my attorney, monitored\n      confidential attorney client telephone calls, and censored\n      confidential attorney-client mail, including this Complaint.\n\nTate’s complaint was signed “Kirby Tate by, Sylvia Owen [Attorney for\nPlaintiff]” and was executed at Unit 32, Parchman, Mississippi.\n      The defendants moved for summary judgment but did not assert that\nTate’s affidavit did not constitute competent evidence. On February 25, 2009,\nthe Magistrate Judge filed a Report and Recommendation in which he sua sponte\n\n\n      2\n         The defendants’ motion for summary judgment was not briefed and was unresponsive\nto several of the allegations in Tate’s complaint.\n\n                                           4\n\f   Case: 09-60384    Document: 00511514627       Page: 5    Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-60384\n\nraided the issue and ruled that Tate’s complaint did not constitute admissible\nevidence because it was signed by Tate’s counsel, rather than Tate.\nAccordingly, he found that there was no bona fide dispute of material facts. The\nmagistrate judge also sua sponte addressed Tate’s access to courts claim– not\naddressed by the defendants’ motion for summary judgment–and found that\nTate had not stated a claim. Further, the magistrate judge recommended, sua\nsponte, that Tate’s complaint be dismissed with prejudice for failure to state a\nclaim because an individual prisoner cannot state a claim based upon failure to\ncomply with the provisions of Presley.\n      Tate’s objections to the Report and Recommendation were due by March\n11, 2009. Tate’s counsel filed a motion for extended time, noting that prison\nofficials refused to allow Tate to have his affidavit notarized. The court granted\nthe motion, giving Tate until March 25 to submit his objections. On March 25,\nTate filed a brief in support of objections and also a notice of technical difficulty\nregarding a scanner malfunction. On March 30, the district court issued an\nopinion overruling Tate’s objections to the Report and Recommendation and\napproving and adopting the Report and Recommendation. On the same day,\nTate filed a motion to reconsider, stating that “[d]ue to a scanner malfunction\nand prison legal mail it was not possible to file the [e]xhibits,” which included\nover thirty pages, including Tate’s affidavit and the affidavit of his counsel. On\nApril 13, 2009, Tate filed an amended motion for reconsideration. On April 16,\n2009, the district court issued an order denying Tate’s motion to reopen, finding\nthat Tate had failed to produce a legal or factual basis to alter the court’s ruling.\nTate timely appealed.\n                                         II.\n      We begin by noting that the district court cited cases holding that\nprisoners have no liberty interest in their classification.

When deciding whether to grant a motion to reconsider, the trial\ncourt should consider the importance and probative value of the evidence, the\nreason for the moving party's failure to introduce the evidence earlier, and the\npossibility of prejudice to the non-moving party. Garcia v. Women's Hosp. of\nTex., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"727331\"><a href=\"/opinion/727331/monica-m-garcia-v-womans-hospital-of-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 814 (5th Cir. 1996). Additionally, the decision of the district\ncourt “will not be disturbed in the absence of a showing that it has worked an\ninjustice.” Id.\n      With this in mind, we evaluate the district court’s denial of Tate’s motion\nfor reconsideration.   Tate contends that he presented significant new and\nadmissible evidence that the magistrate judge and district court refused to\nconsider on grounds that his original complaint was not signed. Tate’s original\ncomplaint noted “MDOC officials have systematically interfered with my access\nto courts . . . in my attempts to file this complaint. They have intentionally tried\nto make me miss deadlines . . . and censored confidential attorney-client mail,\nincluding this Complaint.”     Furthermore, the objections to the Report and\nRecommendation and the motion to reopen–addressing the basis of the\nmagistrate judge’s ruling, that is, that the complaint had not been signed–also\nalleged that Tate had not signed and submitted the necessary filings because the\nprison officials had prevented him from doing so. At oral argument, Tate’s\ncounsel further explained this claim by stating that prison guards refused to\npermit Tate to sign his pleading when she brought it to him on a visit.\n\n                                         6\n\f   Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627           Page: 7     Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                        No. 09-60384\n\nAdditionally, Tate’s counsel filed motions for extensions of time on March 16\nand March 30, 2009, claiming that prison officials were impeding Tate from\nsigning the necessary documents.3 Where important, probative evidence was not\nbefore the court because of the potentially illegal actions of defendants, an\ninjustice has been suggested.\n       Tate’s complaint was both important and probative to the appropriateness\nof granting the motion for summary judgment. The potential viability of Tate’s\nclaim to survive summary judgment is illustrated through the similar case of\nHogan v. Epps, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">4785860</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (S.D. Miss., Dec. 8, 2009) (unpublished). In\nHogan, the prisoner plaintiff alleged that, while housed at Parchman, he was\nidentified as a Security Threat Group leader and transferred to super-maximum\nsecurity conditions without due process. Id. at *2. The district court denied the\nstate’s summary judgment motion to dismiss Hogan’s due process claim, after\nfinding that:\n       Defendants have supported their motion with no evidence as to the\n       conditions or restrictions in the STG Units, the nature or frequency\n       of review accorded inmates in the units, or the circumstances under\n       which an inmate may be removed from STG segregation.\nId. at *3. As in Hogan, the defendants here have provided no information about\nthe conditions and restrictions of STG units or the circumstances under which\nan inmate may be removed from STG segregation.4 Further, the defendants\n\n\n       3\n        Tate has consistently maintained–in his original complaint filed on June 6, 2008 until\npresent–that MDOC officials interfered with his complaint.\n       4\n         The evidence supporting the defendants’ motion for summary judgment comprised of:\n(1) the affidavit of Ricky Scott, the CID Investigator who validated Tate; (2) computerized\nclassification record forms from February 28, 2008 to July 30, 2008; and (3) the affidavit of Dr.\nGloria Perry, discussing Tate’s psychological condition. Noticeably absent from the\ndefendants’ summary judgment evidence was an affidavit attesting to the quality and content\nof Tate’s possible classification hearing. The evidence submitted, like that presented in\nHogan, fails to discuss the condition and restrictions of STG units, the form or content of the\nhearings alleged STG leaders receive before transfer, or circumstances under which an inmate\nmay be removed from STG segregation.\n\n                                               7\n\f   Case: 09-60384      Document: 00511514627         Page: 8    Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                      No. 09-60384\n\nsubmitted a three-page motion for summary judgment and neither party\nprovided a supporting brief with the motion or response. In this light, the\nimportance of Tate’s complaint is clear: it addressed the issues in detail and\nthus provided significant probative value.           We therefore conclude that the\ndistrict   court   erred   in   adopting     the   magistrate     judge’s    Report    and\nRecommendation and abused its discretion in not further considering the motion\nto reopen. The judgment dismissing this complaint is, therefore, VACATED and\nthe case REMANDED.\n       We suggest that the district court allow a Spears hearing to consider at\nleast two matters. First, the district court should consider Tate’s claim of the\ndenial of access to courts, most particularly whether Tate was improperly\nprevented from signing his complaint and timely submitting his affidavit\ncontesting the prison’s policy. Second, the district court should consider whether\nthe due process afforded to Tate during his reclassification into D custody, and\nsubsequent review of the custody, satisfy the due process standards referenced\nin Wilkinson v. Austin.5\n       Tate also raised an additional claim relating to retaliation. The part of the\njudgment dismissing the retaliation claim is affirmed. The only viable claims\nremaining for the court to consider on remand are Tate’s access to courts and\ndue process claims. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is\nAFFIRMED, in part, and VACATED, in part, and the case is REMANDED.\n                      AFFIRMED in part; VACATED in part; and REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n         We are very sensitive to the fact that prison security issues are clearly involved.\nHowever, at oral argument, the defendants’ counsel offered that they would be fully amenable\nto the court undertaking an in camera inspection of the evidence they have against Tate\nimplicating him as a leader in the security threat group.\n\n                                             8\n\f   Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627          Page: 9     Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-60384\n\nJERRY E. SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n\n\n       Kirby Tate is a three-time convicted drug dealer who state prison officials\nbelieve is the leader of a prison gang known primarily for drug distribution.1\nThey accordingly confined him in a super-maximum security prison unit, be-\ncause he posed a security threat. Tate argues that the prison provided insuf-\nficient process in making that determination, but he did not proffer any evidence\nsupporting his allegations before the district court granted summary judgment.\n       Giving Tate a mulligan, the majority (1) distorts or ignores crucial facts,\n(2) significantly muddles our caselaw concerning the standard for reviewing the\ndenial of a motion to reconsider a judgment, (3) orders the district court to con-\nsider a claim that Tate did not preserve on appeal and that was not mentioned\nat oral argument, and (4) suggests that it is appropriate for a district court to re-\nview the substantive evidence supporting a state prison’s classification deter-\nmination in adjudicating a procedural due process claim. Moreover, the majority\ndoes so after having turned oral argument into a meandering, eighty-minute evi-\ndentiary hearing2 involving unsworn, hearsay testimony by each party’s counsel.\nI respectfully dissent and would affirm the summary judgment and the denial\nof the request to reopen.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         The majority seeks to buttress its opinion by dredging up facts to cast doubt on Tate’s\nmost recent conviction, even though those facts are utterly irrelevant to this appeal concerning\nprison conditions, and despite the fact that the conviction was upheld by the Mississippi Su-\npreme Court and on habeas corpus review (only a challenge to the length of Tate’s three-\nstrikes-law sentence remains). The majority’s cherry-picking of irrelevant but sympathetic\nfacts merely gives the impressionSSnot unwarrantedSSthat its opinion is motivated more by\nmisplaced sympathy for a criminal than by careful legal analysis.\n       2\n        Even the most complex and important cases in this circuit usually receive, at most,\nforty minutes of oral argument. A very limited number, including en banc cases, receive an\nhour. This frivolous appeal was the exception and was given about double the customary time.\n\n                                               9\n\f   Case: 09-60384        Document: 00511514627            Page: 10       Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                          No. 09-60384\n\n                                                  I.\n       Tate sued the Mississippi Department of Corrections (“MDOC”) and many\nof its officials in June 2008, via a complaint signed only by his lawyer, which the\nmajority erroneously and misleadingly refers to as “Tate’s affidavit”. R.23. Four\nmonths passed, and Tate did not present any evidence—not one iota—supporting\nhis allegations. The discovery deadline expired in October 2008. Two months\nlater, with a bare record, the MDOC moved for summary judgment on Tate’s\nclaims. R.188-89. Two months after that, with the record still bare, the magis-\ntrate judge issued a report in which he noted that Tate had not presented any\nproper summary judgment evidence because he had never signed his complaint\nand had not submitted anything else to support his allegations.3\n       Although Tate’s attorney, Sylvia Owen, had signed the complaint and de-\nclared that it was true and correct under penalty of perjury, a verified complaint\nsigned only by an attorney who, like Owen, lacks personal knowledge of a mat-\nter, is not competent summary judgment evidence, but only hearsay.4 According\n\n\n       3\n            See R.262 (“Tate’s complaint asserts that Tate is not a member of any gang, much less\na gang leader. But his complaint, while containing language that it is under oath, is signed\nnot by Tate, but his counsel. . . . Therefore Tate has failed to provide admissible evidence\n. . . .”). The majority makes much of the fact that the magistrate judge addressed the eviden-\ntiary value of Tate’s complaint sua sponte, but he had the authority to do so. See Celotex Corp.\nv.

But, aside from Tate’s affidavit filed after the\ndistrict court had granted summary judgment, R.373, there is no indication of\nany of that in the record, even though the record contains dozens of pages of\ncommunications between Owen and the MDOC that Owen submitted. See\nR.55-93.\n        If Tate’s and Owen’s assertions were true, one would expect them to have\nuttered those claims around the time the complaint was filed, not after the dis-\ntrict court had granted summary judgment over eight months later. Indeed,\neven after the magistrate judge recommended summary judgment because Tate\nhad not signed his complaint and there was nothing else to support his allega-\ntions, Tate and Owen still did not mention that the prison had obstructed Tate’s\nattempt to sign it.5 We should not rely on Tate’s and Owen’s self-serving, post\n\n\n        4\n          (...continued)\n(7th Cir. 2005) (“The lawyer’s affidavit, being hearsay, is no evidence at all.”); Albright v.\nFDIC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. App. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">6206</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *16-*17 (1st Cir.

Yet the ma-\njority does precisely that.\n       Indeed, the majority goes further by making the unsupportable contention\nthat Tate’s complaint itself alleged that the MDOC had prevented him from sign-\ning it. That is physically and temporally impossible. According to Owen’s claims\nat oral argument, she brought the complaint to the prison, where she sat down\nacross from Tate separated by glass and could not hand the complaint to him be-\ncause prison officials would not let her, so she signed it herself then and there.\nThe complaint could not have related those events, because, if they occurred, it\nmust have been after it was written.\n       What the complaint alleged was merely that prison officials had “censored\nconfidential attorney-client mail, including this Complaint.” R.38 (emphasis ad-\nded). Moreover, the complaint explained the alleged “censor[ing]” of prison mail\nthat the majority relies on, and it has nothing to do with preventing Tate from\nsigning the complaint: When Tate attempted to mail the complaint to his attor-\nney (unsigned, apparently), he “instructed the [prison] not to open it or make a\ncopy. However, they obviously did so anyway because they returned a copy to\n[Tate].” R.38 n.4. Alleging that a prison read a high-security inmate’s mail be-\nfore mailing it and gave the inmate a copy does not equate to alleging that the\nprison obstructed a client’s attempt to sign it.6 Thus, despite the majority’s\nclaims, the record does not show that the MDOC prevented Tate from signing\nhis complaint before the magistrate judge excluded it from evidence.\n\n\n\n       5\n         (...continued)\ndoes not so allege. See R.366-71. Moreover, in what appears to be a pattern, Owen’s affidavit\nis not competent evidence, because she never signed it. R.11, 371.\n       6\n        According to the MDOC, it needed to monitor Tate’s communications with Owen be-\ncause they were in a physical relationship together, so she posed a security risk. There is no\nevidence in the record to support that claim, but the district court may wish to inquire into the\nmatter on remand.\n\n                                               12\n\f  Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627          Page: 13      Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-60384\n\n       What the record does showSSand the majority omitsSSis that Owen mailed\nan affidavit to Tate on February 26, 2009, a day after the magistrate judge is-\nsued his report recommending summary judgment.7 In other words, Owen was\nnot diligently attempting to get Tate’s complaint signed for months; it was not\nuntil the deadline that Owen realized for the first time that her client needed to\nsign something. That is not at all that surprising, given that she is an estate\nplanning attorney who says she is representing Tate as a family friend, not a liti-\ngator with trial expertise. Owen’s inexperience, not prison interference, is the\nreason Tate’s complaint had not been signed over the course of eight months.\n       After Owen sent Tate the affidavit in February 2009, she was unsuccessful\nin obtaining a signed copy from him, so she sought a ten-day extension, allegedly\nbecause “prison officials refused to allow [Tate] to have it notarized,” and\n“[Tate’s] mental state after being locked down for over a year appears to be hin-\ndering his ability to follow instructions and assist counsel in the production of\nthis case.” R.266.8 That Owen asked for only a ten-day extension casts further\ndoubt on her allegations of prison malfeasance, because if the MDOC had really\nbeen consistently denying her client access to her documents for almost a year\nby that point, one would think she would have asked for more than an extra ten\ndays. Regardless, the district court granted Owen precisely the ten-day exten-\nsion she requested. R.269.\n       When the deadline expired, Owen filed objections to the magistrate judge’s\nreport without any accompanying evidence.

She did not explain why she had failed to submit\nany other evidence. The next day, however, she filed a notice of technical diffi-\nculty explaining that she could not submit Tate’s exhibits because of a “scanner\nmalfunction,” but that “[t]he problem will be corrected promptly.” R.11, 328. She\ndid not request an extension of her deadline to submit evidence. At that point,\nit would have appeared to the district court that Owen had every document she\nrequired but only needed a few hours or an extra day to submit them.\n       Five days passed, however, with silence from Tate and his counsel. The\ndistrict court, its deadline now having been flouted, pulled the trigger and grant-\ned summary judgment to the MDOC. R.331-32. Given that Owen did not re-\nquest an extension of her already-extended deadline, and that her reason for the\ndelay was a “scanner malfunction” that continued for five days, it was not unrea-\nsonable for the district court to do so.\n       Immediately after the court entered summary judgment, on March 30,\n2009, Owen filed a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) motion to reopen the\ncase on the ground that, “[d]ue to a scanner malfunction and prison legal mail[,]\nit was not possible to file” her exhibits on time. R.333-34. Along with that mo-\ntion, she submitted a number of documents, including affidavits from Tate’s\nbrother and wife, signed February 25 and 28, respectively, and various public\ndocuments relating to the procedures the MDOC had provided Tate. R.335-59.\nAny of those documents could have been filed months earlier and have nothing\nto do with the prison’s alleged interference with Owen’s communications with\nher client, but the majority holds that the district court must consider them any-\nway.\n       Along with her motion to reopen, Owen filed a motion for additional time\nto obtain Tate’s affidavit on the ground that the prison had “interfer[ed] with le-\ngal mail when [Tate] attempted to make the necessary revisions to his Affidavit.”\n\n                                           14\n\f  Case: 09-60384    Document: 00511514627       Page: 15   Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                  No. 09-60384\n\nR.360.

Fi-\nnally, in April 2009, before the court could rule on the motion for additional time,\nOwen submitted another rule 59(e) motion to reopen, along with various docu-\nments, including another copy of Tate’s complaint and an affidavit, both of which\nTate finally signed and declared true and correct under penalty of perjury.\nR.372-415. The district court then declined to reopen, without considering the\nadditional materials, because the “same arguments” were before the magistrate\njudge when he issued his report and recommendation.

United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71496\"><a href=\"/opinion/71496/duffie-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">600</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 371 (5th Cir. 2010) (“[T]he nonmoving party cannot survive a summary judgment motion\nby resting on the mere allegations of its pleadings.”).\n\n                                               16\n\f  Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627          Page: 17      Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                       No. 09-60384\n\nTate was obviously aware of the possibility that his testimony could be used as\nevidence, so it was not newly discovered.11\n       It is true that Tate alleged that the MDOC prevented him from getting the\naffidavit notarized, but if he did not believe he could submit evidence on time,\nit was his responsibility to ask for an extension before summary judgment, as he\nhad once already done.12 Instead, he said, through counsel, that he would sub-\nmit all his exhibits as soon as a scanner malfunction was promptly corrected.\nThe district court patiently waited for five days, and when still nothing was\nforthcoming, it entered a final judgment. Because it was Tate’s own fault that\nthe court decided the case, the court was entitled to deny his rule 59(e) motion\nfor reconsideration.\n       In addition, we have no information about the extent, nature, or impropri-\nety of the MDOC’s alleged interference. We have nothing more than an unelab-\norated assertion of “interference” with legal mail causing “delay.” R.373. The\nmajority thus reopens the case, as it concedes, based only on the possibility that\ninjustice might have occurred. That will open the door to any number of plain-\ntiffs’ seeking to reopen cases based on unsupported allegations of injustice when\nthe case does not go their way, and this will significantly increase costs on both\nthe court system and parties. It cannot be squared with the notion that recon-\nsideration of a judgment is an “extraordinary remedy that should be used spar-\n\n\n\n       11\n        See Templet, 367 F.3d at 479 (holding evidence was not newly discovered because “the\nunderlying facts were well within the [party’s] knowledge prior to the district court’s entry of\njudgment”).\n       12\n          See Fanning v. Metro. Transit Auth., 141 F. App’x 311, 314 (5th Cir. 2005) (“[O]ur\ncourt has foreclosed a party’s contention on appeal that it had inadequate time to marshal evi-\ndence to defend against summary judgment when the party did not seek Rule 56(f) [now rule\n56(d)] relief before the summary judgment ruling. A Rule 56[(d)] motion [for continuance], not\n[a rule 59(e) motion] for reconsideration, is the proper remedy for a party claiming summary\njudgment is inappropriate because of inadequate discovery.” (citing Potter v.

That is not to say Tate and Owen\nnecessarily lied, but only to reason that the district court did not abuse its dis-\ncretion by not granting the “extraordinary remedy” of reopening the case\n\n\n                                        III.\n      Just as troubling as the majority’s legal analysis, however, is that it reach-\nes its conclusion by seizing on the explanations that Owen gave at our eighty-\nminute “evidentiary hearing,” while ignoring the MDOC’s attorney’s claims that\nOwen’s post hoc allegations were false. Although the majority pays lip service\nto the abuse-of-discretion standard for motions to reopen, it essentially reviews\nthe district court’s decision de novo by putting its own credibility determinations\nahead of the district court’s conclusions. There is no law that I am aware of that\ngives us the authority to decide that the district court got it wrong and to reach\nthat conclusion by turning oral argument into a fact-gathering excursion, then\nbasing our ruling on our own assessment of each party’s lawyer’s credibility at\nargument. If the practice of retrying cases at oral argument becomes wide-\nspread, we will have mostly done away with the notion of deference to the dis-\ntrict courts, and the courts will incur considerable expense by having to con-\nstruct witness stands in appellate courtrooms.\n\n\n                                        IV.\n      The majority also errs by inexplicably resurrecting a claim that Tate had\nwaived. The majority instructs the district court to review Tate’s access-to-\n\n                                        18\n\f  Case: 09-60384     Document: 00511514627      Page: 19    Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                   No. 09-60384\n\ncourts claim even though that claim was given only a few lines in the “statement\nof the case” section of Tate’s opening brief, without citation to any authority.\nFailing to cite any authority in even a one-page argument constitutes waiver.\nL & A Contracting Co. v. S. Concrete Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"663735\"><a href=\"/opinion/663735/l-a-contracting-company-plaintiff-counter-v-southern-concrete-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (5th Cir. 1994).\nIndeed, we did not discuss the issue at oral argument and did not ask the parties\nto address it in their supplemental briefing. The notion that the MDOC might\nbe prejudiced by the majority’s eleventh-hour action apparently does not concern\nthe majority in any way.\n\n\n                                         V.\n      The majority drops a footnote, near the end of its opinion, suggesting that\nthe district court undertake an in camera review of the MDOC’s evidence against\nTate, because the MDOC stated that it was “fully amenable” to doing so. That\ncreates the impression that this case turns on whether Tate was properly classi-\nfied as a gang leader. It does not. The majority appears to have forgotten that\nTate’s claim is one of procedural due process—i.e., whether the MDOC has fol-\nlowed constitutionally adequate procedures in classifying Tate—not a question\nof whether the MDOC had adequate substantive ground to place him in Unit 32.\nNo law exists for the proposition that federal courts may sit as tribunals in re-\nview of state prisons’ substantive decisions concerning who should or should not\nbe placed in super-maximum-security custody. Whether the MDOC made the\nright decision in moving Tate into Unit 32 is entirely irrelevant to whether his\ndue process rights were violated.\n\n\n                                        VI.\n      The majority opinion does have two virtues. The first is that, as an unpub-\nlished decision, it is non-precedential, 5 TH C IR. R. 47.5, so future panels are en-\ntitled to ignore it. The second is that the majority does not grant or deny sum-\n\n                                         19\n\f  Case: 09-60384       Document: 00511514627         Page: 20     Date Filed: 06/21/2011\n\n\n\n                                      No. 09-60384\n\nmary judgment but remands to the district court to consider any issues it deems\nappropriate.\n       The district court should inquire whether Tate’s claim is moot. The MDOC\nappears to have closed down Unit 32 at Parchman and transferred Tate to a non-\nsupermax prison while this appeal was pending. Mississippi seemingly does not\nhave any other super-maximum security units. Voluntary cessation of a chal-\nlenged practice moots a case if it is “absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful\nbehavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.”13\n       I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n       13\n         Parents Involved in Cmty.
