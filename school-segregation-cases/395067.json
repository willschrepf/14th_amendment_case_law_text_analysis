Moran moved for summary\n\njudgment in her individual capacity on the basis of qualified\n\nimmunity.    The district court denied this motion, and Moran filed\n\nan interlocutory appeal.1\n\n     We reverse the district court’s judgment as to Gonzalez’s\n\nFirst Amendment claim brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Even viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to Gonzalez, a reasonable\n\nperson in Moran’s position would not have known that Gonzalez’s\n\nletter of September 28, 1995, constituted speech on a matter of\n\npublic concern.   See infra Part III.    On the other hand, we affirm\n\nthe district court’s judgment as to Gonzalez’s claim brought under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 3617. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto Gonzalez, a reasonable person in Moran’s position would have\n\nknown that her termination of Gonzalez’s employment was unlawful.\n\nSee infra Part IV.\n\n                                  I.\n\n     The record, for purposes of summary judgment, reveals the\n\nfollowing:    Gonzalez worked for the LCHA from October 1993 to\n\nOctober 1995. She began as an Administrative Clerk and assumed the\n\n\n\n1\n  The district court also granted Moran’s motion for summary judgment in\nher official capacity and denied Gonzalez’s motion for partial summary\njudgment as to Gonzalez’s contract claim.     The sole issue on appeal,\nhowever, is whether the district court erred in denying summary judgment\nto Moran in her individual capacity.\n\n                                   1\n\fposition of Property Manager in May 1995.         Her duties as Property\n\nManager included overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Low\n\nIncome Housing Program and the Rural Community Economic Development\n\nRural Housing Program.      At all times, she worked under Moran.\n\n     According to Gonzalez, Moran directed her to engage in certain\n\nactions that, in Gonzalez’s view, violated the anti-discrimination\n\nlaws that apply to public housing programs.2          For example, Moran\n\ncomplained when Gonzalez attempted to place a white woman with a\n\nblack child in a vacant apartment, and Moran told Gonzalez that she\n\ndid not want a black person placed in a vacant elderly housing\n\nunit.3    Moran’s efforts to force Gonzalez to discriminate were a\n\ncentral cause of the arguments that arose between Gonzalez and\n\nMoran.4     Finally,   during   August   and   September   1995,   Gonzalez\n\n“confront[ed]” Moran about the fact that Moran wanted Gonzalez to\n\ntake certain actions that violated the rules and regulations of the\n\n\n\n\n2\n  See R1-20, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, Ex. A, ¶ 5, at 1 (“While I worked at the housing\nauthority, Ms. Moran directed me to engage in certain job acts that I\nthought violated the laws about discrimination [sic] the regulations that\napply to the housing programs. Despite my concerns, I did as she asked\nbecause she was my boss.”).\n3\n  See id., Ex. A, Attach. 3, ¶ 8, at 2 (“I never know who you will want\nme to house even if they are next on the waiting list. If it’s a white\ngirl with a black baby, you complain, if we have a vacancie on the\nlederly site, you do not want me to put a black person on that site\n. . . .”); accord R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for\nSummary Judgment of Defendant Moran in her Individual Capacity, Ex. B,\n¶ 8, at 2. This letter from Gonzalez to Moran is reproduced as Appendix\nA, infra. The quotations from the letter that appear throughout this\nopinion are unedited.\n4\n  See App. A, ¶ 9 (“[T]he times that you and me had argue is because you\nhad forced me to discriminate, or rip-off people . . . .”).\n\n                                    2\n\fU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”).5                 These\n\nconfrontations         concerned,      inter   alia,    Moran’s      desire   to\n\ndiscriminate against specific potential tenants:                 two white women\n\nwith black children and an elderly black man.6\n\n       On September 20, 1995, Moran called Gonzalez into Moran’s\n\noffice and criticized Gonzalez for failing to fill apartment\n\nvacancies at the LCHA during the prior two months.7                 An argument\n\nensued, in which Gonzalez raised her voice.8                On September 21,\n\nMoran presented Gonzalez with a letter that stated in part: “This\n\nis to advise you that under no circumstance will I ever again\n\ntolerate your violent outburst of yesterday. . . . [I]f anything\n\nlike    that   occurs    again   you    will   be   terminated    immediately.”9\n\nGonzalez refused to sign the letter.\n\n\n5\n  See R1-20, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, Ex. A, Attach. 4, at 1.\n6\n  Gonzalez stated:\n      [F]or about 2 months I have been confronting Ms. Moran on\n      things that she want me to do and are against HUD rules and\n      regulations and against the Department of Labor.\n      The following are only some of those things:\n      ****\n      7) I had to enforce the authority Ms. Moran gave me, to house\n      two white girls that came up on the waiting list, but as Ms.\n      Moran opinion they were no good just because they had babies\n      from black men.\n      Example:   Victoria Fisher -- 14153 Warner Circle\n                 Chandra Sharp -- 9831 Poplar Grove Lane\n      Also had to do the same thing for Mr. Steven Thomas, who lives\n      now at 9750 Feathertree Lane, because Ms. Moran did not want\n      me to put any black person on the elderly site.\nSee id., Ex. A, Attach. 4, at 1-2.\n7\n    See App. A, ¶ 1.\n8\n    See id., ¶ 2.\n9\n  See R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment\nof Defendant Moran in her Individual Capacity, Ex. A, at 1.\n\n                                         3\n\f        According to Gonzalez’s complaint, Gonzalez called a member of\n\nthe LCHA Board of Commissioners (the “LCHA Board”) on September 27\n\nto complain about, inter alia, discriminatory rental practices at\n\nthe LCHA.10 On the same day, Gonzalez phoned an employee at the HUD\n\noffice in Jacksonville, Florida, to lodge the same complaint.11\n\nGonzalez also called the Chairman of the LCHA Board, James Puccio\n\n(“Puccio”), to report the alleged discrimination.12                Gonzalez does\n\nnot claim that Moran knew about these phone calls.\n\n        On September 28, Gonzalez wrote Moran a four-page letter,\n\nreproduced      as   Appendix   A,    infra.      In    the    letter,   Gonzalez\n\ncomplained about various aspects of Moran’s management, including\n\nMoran’s discriminatory directives, and stated that Moran’s efforts\n\nto force Gonzalez to discriminate were a central cause of the\n\narguments between them.13\n\n        On October 2, Moran fired Gonzalez. In the termination letter\n\ngiven     to   Gonzalez,    Moran    stated    that    Gonzalez   had    exhibited\n\n“offensive      or   antagonistic     conduct     toward      superiors,   fellow\n\nemployees, or the public; criticism of orders, rules and policies,\n\n\n\n\n10\n     See R1-15, Amended Complaint, ¶ 15, at 5.\n11\n     See id., ¶ 16, at 5-6.\n12\n     See id., ¶ 17, at 6.\n13\n  See App. A, ¶¶ 8-9. In addition, on September 29, Gonzalez wrote Moran\na one-page letter in which she complained that another LCHA employee had\nbeen spreading information about Moran’s reprimand of Gonzalez. See R1-\n20, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial Summary\nJudgment, Ex. A, Attach. 2.\n\n                                         4\n\for conduct interfering with proper cooperation of employees, or\n\nwhich impairs the efficiency of the Authority.”14\n\n        On October 4, according to Gonzalez’s affidavit testimony, she\n\nand other LCHA employees met with Puccio to discuss “problems\n\n[they] saw at the housing authority and with the practices of Ms.\n\nMoran.”15    On October 9, Gonzalez sent a letter to Puccio in which\n\nshe requested that the LCHA Board review her termination.16           The\n\nLCHA Board did not reverse Moran’s decision.\n\n        Gonzalez then filed suit against the LCHA and against Moran in\n\nher official and individual capacities.          Gonzalez claimed that\n\nMoran, in her individual capacity, violated: (1) Gonzalez’s First\n\nAmendment      rights   by   terminating    Gonzalez’s   employment   in\n\nretaliation for her “objections and complaints about the operations\n\nof the Defendants,” giving rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983;17\n\nand (2) 42 U.S.C. § 3617 by terminating Gonzalez’s employment in\n\nretaliation for her “complaints and refusal to participate in the\n\ndiscriminatory rental practices of the Defendants.”18       Moran moved\n\nfor summary judgment in her individual capacity on both claims.\n\n\n\n14\n  See R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment\nof Defendant Moran in her Individual Capacity, Ex. D, at 1.\n15\n  See R1-20, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, Ex. A, ¶ 10, at 2.\n16\n     See id., Ex. A, Attach. 4.\n17\n     See R1-15, Amended Complaint, ¶ 34, at 8.\n18\n  See id., ¶ 30, at 7-8. Gonzalez also brought these two claims against\nLCHA and against Moran in her official capacity. See id., ¶¶ 30, 34, at\n7-8. Furthermore, Gonzalez alleged that LCHA and Moran, in her official\ncapacity, breached Gonzalez’s employment contract. See id., ¶ 39, at 9.\n\n                                     5\n\fThe district court, without elaboration, ruled that “issues of\n\nmaterial fact” precluded the court from granting summary judgment\n\nin Moran’s favor.19         Moran appeals the district court’s denial of\n\nthat motion.\n\n                                        II.\n\n                                        A.\n\n      This   court    lacks    interlocutory       jurisdiction    to    review   a\n\ndistrict court’s denial of summary judgment where the moving party\n\nappeals based solely on the argument that the district court erred\n\nin evaluating evidentiary sufficiency.              See Cottrell v. Caldwell,\n\n85 F.3d 1480, 1484 (11th Cir. 1996) (citing Johnson v. Jones, 515\n\nU.S. 304, 313, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 2156 (1995)).                       We do have\n\ninterlocutory jurisdiction to review the denial of a summary\n\njudgment in qualified immunity cases, however, where our review\n\nrequires a determination of the clearly established law that\n\nexisted at the time of the allegedly unlawful acts.               See Cottrell,\n\n85 F.3d at 1484 (citing Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 528, 105\n\nS.   Ct.   2806,     2816    (1985)).        In   the   latter   case,   we   have\n\njurisdiction even if the district court, as it did here, simply\n\nruled that “issues of material fact” precluded summary judgment.\n\nSee Cottrell, 85 F.3d at 1484-85 (citing Behrens v. Pelletier, 516\n\nU.S. 299, 304, 116 S. Ct. 834, 838 (1996)).\n\n                                        B.\n\n\n\n19\n  R1-44, Order, at 2. The district court also granted Moran’s motion for\nsummary judgment in her official capacity and denied Gonzalez’s motion\nfor partial summary judgment as to Gonzalez’s contract claim. Id.\n\n                                         6\n\f        We review de novo the district court’s denial of a defendant’s\n\nsummary judgment motion that is based on the affirmative defense of\n\nqualified immunity.       See Walker v. Schwalbe, 112 F.3d 1127, 1130\n\n(11th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, __ U.S. __, 118 S. Ct. 1794 (1998).\n\nIn exercising interlocutory jurisdiction in such cases, we have the\n\ndiscretion to accept the district court’s findings of fact, if they\n\nare adequate.     See Cottrell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1486.                 Where, as here,\n\nthe district court has made no specific findings of fact, we must\n\nmake such findings ourselves after full review of the record.\n\n        A party seeking summary judgment must demonstrate that “there\n\nis no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\n\nparty     is   entitled   to     a   judgment      as     a    matter    of    law.”\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).         The moving party bears the initial burden\n\nof   informing   the   court    of   the   basis    for       its   motion    and   of\n\nidentifying those materials that demonstrate the absence of a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact.        See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477\n\nU.S. 317, 323, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2552-53 (1986).                      When the non-\n\nmoving party bears the burden of proof on an issue at trial, the\n\nmoving party need not “support its motion with affidavits or other\n\nsimilar material negating the opponent’s claim,” id. at 323, 106\n\nS. Ct. at 2553, in order to discharge this initial responsibility.\n\nInstead, the moving party simply may “‘show[]’--that is, point[]\n\nout to the district court--that there is an absence of evidence to\n\nsupport the nonmoving party’s case.”            Id. at 325, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n2554 (quoting Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159, 90\n\nS.Ct. 1598, 1609 (1970)).\n\n                                       7\n\f        In   response    to   a   properly     supported    motion   for   summary\n\njudgment, “an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations\n\nor denials of the adverse party’s pleadings, but . . . must set\n\nforth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for\n\ntrial.”      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).        If the non-moving party fails to\n\n“make a sufficient showing on an essential element of her case with\n\nrespect to which she has the burden of proof,” then the court must\n\nenter summary judgment for the moving party. See Celotex, 477 U.S.\n\nat 323, 106 S. Ct. at 2552.            In determining whether genuine issues\n\nof material fact exist, we resolve all ambiguities and draw all\n\njustifiable      inferences       in    favor    of   the    non-moving      party.\n\nSee Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S. Ct.\n\n2505, 2513 (1986).\n\n                                          C.\n\n        In   analyzing   a    defense    of    qualified    immunity,   we    first\n\nconsider whether “the defendant government official [has proved]\n\nthat he was acting within the scope of his discretionary authority\n\nwhen the alleged wrongful act occurred.”              Evans v. Hightower, 117\n\nF.3d 1318, 1320 (11th Cir. 1997).               If the defendant has met this\n\nburden, “the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the defendant\n\nviolated clearly established law based upon objective standards.”\n\nId.     Because it is undisputed that Moran was acting within the\n\nscope of her discretionary authority when she fired Gonzalez, we\n\nconsider only the second part of the qualified immunity analysis in\n\nour resolution of Gonzalez’s claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and\n\n3617.\n\n                                          8\n\f        This    circuit   has       established      stringent   standards        for    a\n\nplaintiff seeking to overcome the affirmative defense of qualified\n\nimmunity       asserted   by    a    government      official    in   an   individual\n\ncapacity.       “Qualified      immunity         protects    government     officials\n\nperforming discretionary functions from civil trials (and the other\n\nburdens of litigation, including discovery) and from liability if\n\ntheir    conduct     violates        no   ‘clearly    established     statutory         or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have\n\nknown.’”       Lassiter v. Alabama A & M Univ., Bd. of Trustees, 28 F.3d\n\n1146,    1149     (11th   Cir.       1994)   (en     banc)    (quoting     Harlow       v.\n\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 2738 (1982)). “For\n\nthe law to be clearly established to the point that qualified\n\nimmunity does not apply, the law must have earlier been developed\n\nin such a concrete and factually defined context to make it obvious\n\nto all reasonable government actors, in the defendant’s place, that\n\n‘what he is doing’ violates federal law.”                    Lassiter, 28 F.3d at\n\n1149 (quoting Anderson v.

Because resolution of this question requires us to\n\ndetermine    the   contours   of   clearly   established   law,   we   have\n\ninterlocutory jurisdiction to review the district court’s denial of\n\nsummary judgment.     See Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1484\n\n(11th Cir. 1996).\n\n     A public employee must satisfy four conditions in order to\n\nprevail in a section 1983 action alleging that she was fired in\n\nretaliation for constitutionally protected speech.         See Bryson v.\n\nCity of Waycross, 888 F.2d 1562, 1565 (11th Cir. 1989). First, the\n\nemployee must demonstrate that the speech allegedly resulting in\n\nher termination can “be fairly characterized as constituting speech\n\non a matter of public concern . . . .”       Connick v. Myers, 461 U.S.\n\n138, 146, 103 S. Ct. 1684, 1690 (1983), cited in Bryson, 888 F.2d\n\nat 1565.20   Second, the employee must show that her First Amendment\n\ninterests outweigh “the interest of the State, as an employer, in\n\npromoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through\n\nits employees.”    Pickering v. Board of Educ. of Township High Sch.\n\n\n\n20\n  Even where a public employee’s speech does not touch upon a matter of\npublic concern, that speech is not “totally beyond the protection of the\nFirst Amendment,” Connick, 461 U.S. at 147, 103 S. Ct. at 1690, but\n“absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the\nappropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision\ntaken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee’s\nbehavior,” id.\n\n                                     10\n\fDist. 205, 391 U.S. 563, 568, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 1734-35 (1968), cited\n\nin Bryson, 888 F.2d at 1565.         If these two prerequisites are\n\nsatisfied, then the employee must prove that her speech played a\n\n“substantial part” in the employer’s termination decision. See Mt.\n\nHealthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287,\n\n97 S. Ct. 568, 576 (1977), cited in Bryson, 888 F.2d at 1565-66.\n\nFinally, the employee must rebut successfully any attempt by the\n\nemployer to demonstrate that “it would have reached the same\n\ndecision . . . even in the absence of the protected conduct.”        Mt.\n\nHealthy, 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S. Ct. at 576, cited in Bryson, 888\n\nF.2d at 1566.\n\n     At the outset, we note that our review of Gonzalez’s section\n\n1983 claim concerns solely Gonzalez’s letter to Moran on September\n\n28. Although evidence indicates that Gonzalez and Moran previously\n\nargued about compliance with discrimination rules, see infra Part\n\nIV.B.2, we are unable to perform a Pickering review of Gonzalez’s\n\nspeech on those occasions because the record does not disclose the\n\n“manner, time, and place” of Gonzalez’s statements.        See Connick,\n\n461 U.S. at 150-55, 103 S. Ct. at 1692-93 (describing elements of\n\nPickering balancing test). Accordingly, we pretermit our review of\n\nthat speech and leave this question for the district court.21\n\n21\n  Similarly, we pretermit our review of other instances of Gonzalez’s\nspeech because of the lack of causation evidence required under Mt.\nHealthy.   See 429 U.S. at 287, 97 S. Ct. at 576 (stating that the\nemployee must prove that her speech played a “substantial” part in the\nemployer’s termination decision). No evidence indicates that Moran, when\nfiring Gonzalez, knew about Gonzalez’s pre-termination conversations with\nthe HUD official and LCHA Board members.           Similarly, Gonzalez’s\ndiscussions with Puccio on October 4 obviously played no role in\nGonzalez’s termination on October 2. Thus, Gonzalez’s speech in these\n\n                                   11\n\f     In reviewing Gonzalez’s letter of September 28, the threshold\n\nquestion is whether the letter can “be fairly characterized as\n\nconstituting speech on a matter of public concern . . . .”\n\nConnick, 461 U.S. at 146, 103 S. Ct. at 1690.        According to Moran,\n\nthe letter does not satisfy the public concern requirement because\n\nGonzalez   did   not   distribute   her   letter   publicly   and   because\n\nGonzalez has not shown that her letter addressed specific matters\n\nthat already had drawn significant public attention.          In Connick,\n\nhowever, the Supreme Court held that the public concern requirement\n\nwas satisfied where a government employee spoke about an important\n\nmatter of public interest, even though the employee spoke only\n\nwithin the workplace and even though the specific matter addressed\n\nhad not drawn significant public attention prior to her speech.\n\nSee id. at 149, 103 S. Ct. at 1691.22\n\n\ninstances cannot form the basis of a successful claim under § 1983. See\nHughes v. Bedsole, 48 F.3d 1376, 1386 (4th Cir. 1995) (pretermitting\nreview of § 1983 free speech claim based on lack of causation evidence).\n22\n  In Connick, Assistant District Attorney Myers opposed District Attorney\nConnick’s decision to transfer her. See 461 U.S. at 140-41, 103 S. Ct.\nat 1686. As a result of her discontent, Myers prepared and circulated\nto other assistant district attorneys a questionnaire concerning office\ntransfer policy, office morale, the need for a grievance committee, the\nlevel of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured\nto work in political campaigns. See id. at 141, 103 S. Ct. at 1687.\nConnick then terminated Myers. See id.\n      The Connick Court analyzed each of the questions in the\nquestionnaire separately.    Most of the questions were not “of public\nimport in evaluating the performance of the District Attorney as an\nelected official,” 461 U.S. at 148, 103 S. Ct. at 1690, but simply\n“reflect[ed] one employee’s dissatisfaction with a transfer and an\nattempt to turn that displeasure into a cause cèlèbre,” id. at 148, 103\nS. Ct. at 1691. The Court, however, held that the question concerning\nwhether assistant district attorneys felt pressured to work in political\ncampaigns did touch upon a matter of public concern in light of: (1) the\nconstitutional guarantees protecting employees from having to work for\npolitical candidates not of their own choice; and (2) the “demonstrated\ninterest in this country that government service should depend upon\n\n                                    12\n\f     In order to determine whether the letter satisfies the public\n\nconcern requirement, we must analyze its “content, form, and\n\ncontext . . . as revealed by the whole record,”       Connick, 461 U.S.\n\nat 147-48, 103 S. Ct. at 1690, and evaluate whether Gonzalez’s\n\npurpose was “to raise issues of public concern, on the one hand, or\n\nto further her own private interest, on the other,”           Morgan v.\n\nFord, 6 F.3d 750, 754 (11th Cir. 1993).       This question is one of\n\nlaw, not of fact.   See Connick, 461 U.S. at 148 n.7, 103 S. Ct. at\n\n1690 n.7. If it is unclear whether the letter satisfies the public\n\nconcern requirement, then Moran is entitled to qualified immunity\n\non Gonzalez’s section 1983 claim because Moran’s actions did not\n\nviolate Gonzalez’s clearly established First Amendment rights.\n\nSee Badia v. City of Miami, 133 F.3d 1443, 1445 (11th Cir. 1998)\n\n(per curiam).\n\n\n\n\nmeritorious performance rather than political service.” Id. at 149, 103\nS. Ct. at 1691.\n     The Connick Court thus held that the public concern requirement was\nsatisfied even though Myers did not publicize the questionnaire and even\nthough no evidence indicated that the public, at the time Myers\ncirculated the questionnaire, knew about the District Attorney’s unlawful\npractice of pressuring his employees to work on political campaigns. We\nreject Moran’s contention that Peterson v. Atlanta Hous. Auth., 998 F.2d\n904 (11th Cir. 1993), indicates a contrary rule. Although Peterson’s\ninter-office speech did concern an issue that had received media\nscrutiny, see id. at 916, the court specifically noted that public\nawareness of the problem was not necessary to satisfy the public concern\nrequirement, see id. at 917 n.25; see also Morgan v. Ford, 6 F.3d 750,\n754 n.5 (11th Cir. 1993) (“[A] court cannot determine that an utterance\nis not a matter of public concern solely because the employee does not\nair the concerns to the public.”); Deremo v. Watkins, 939 F.2d 908, 911\nn.3 (11th Cir. 1991) (stating that an employee’s effort to communicate\nher concerns to the public is a relevant, but not dispositive, element\nin the public concern analysis).\n\n                                   13\n\f      In large part, the letter simply blames Moran for creating a\n\npoor working atmosphere at the LCHA.23     We thus conclude that much\n\nof the letter does not touch upon matters of public concern.\n\nSee Connick, 461 U.S. at 148-49, 103 S. Ct. at 1690-91 (stating\n\nthat most of the elements of an employee’s questionnaire were “mere\n\nextensions of [her] dispute over her transfer” and holding that\n\n“the First Amendment does not require a public office to be run as\n\na    roundtable   for   employee   complaints   over   internal   office\n\naffairs”).\n\n      We must evaluate every element of the letter, however, in\n\norder to determine whether Gonzalez has satisfied the public\n\nconcern requirement.     See Connick, 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S. Ct. at\n\n1691 (holding that one question in an employee’s questionnaire\n\nconstituted speech on a matter of public concern).       In particular,\n\nGonzalez’s accusations about Moran’s discriminatory behavior merit\n\nscrutiny.    The letter, unedited, states in part:\n\n      All I have learned from this place is to agravate myself\n      day after they, because of the things that I see and\n      hear.\n\n      I never know who you will want me to house even if they\n      are next on the waiting list. If it’s a white girl with\n      a black baby, you complain, if we have a vacancie on the\n      lederly site, you do not want me to put a black person on\n      that site, if the client has HIV, you complain, if it’s\n\n23\n  See, e.g., App. A, ¶ 3 (“[W]hen things get a little blurry, you turn\ninto a very critical, and verbally abusive person.”); id., ¶ 4 (“I have\nseen and also received a lot of verbal abuse along with my co-workers.”);\nid., ¶ 5 (“[Y]ou have no consideration for your staff.”); id., ¶ 14\n“[Y]ou are a terrible instigator among all of us in this\noffice . . . .”); id., ¶ 15 (stating that Moran only gives “miserable\nraise[s]”); id., ¶ 16 (criticizing Moran for blaming others for her own\nmistakes); id., ¶ 18 (blaming Moran for “creating this miserable\nenvironment”).\n\n                                   14\n\f        a white that has not been in the job for too long, you do\n        not want me to house them, because it will become a\n        negative rent.\n\n        If you remember, that the times that you and me had argue\n        is because you had forced me to discriminate or rip-off\n        people . . . .24\n\n        It is unclear whether this portion of the letter can “be\n\nfairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public\n\nconcern . . . .”      Connick, 461 U.S. at 146, 103 S. Ct. at 1690.            On\n\nthe one hand, a public official’s authorization of discriminatory\n\nrental practices unquestionably is an important                matter of general\n\npublic interest.       See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 3601 (“It is the policy of\n\nthe United States to provide . . . for fair housing throughout the\n\nUnited States.”); cf. Connick, 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S. Ct. at 1691\n\n(holding that the pressuring of public employees to work in\n\npolitical campaigns is a matter of public concern).                 Moreover, a\n\npublic       employee’s    statement   may    satisfy    the    public   concern\n\nrequirement even where, as here, the employee speaks within the\n\nworkplace, after an adverse employment decision, about a specific\n\nmatter that had not drawn significant public attention prior to her\n\nspeech.      See Connick, 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S. Ct. at 1691.\n\n        On   the   other   hand,   three    unrebutted   facts     suggest   that\n\nGonzalez’s purpose in writing this part of the letter was to blame\n\nMoran for Gonzalez’s dissatisfaction with the stressful conditions\n\nof her own employment.        First, this portion of the letter does not\n\nspecifically address the legal rights of the potential tenants, but\n\n\n\n24\n     See App. A, ¶¶ 7-9.\n\n                                       15\n\frather concerns (a) Gonzalez’s own aggravation and confusion, (b)\n\nMoran’s complaints to Gonzalez, and (c) the arguments between Moran\n\nand Gonzalez.25 Second, the letter as a whole focuses on Gonzalez’s\n\ntheory that Moran, by breaking rules, was harming the office\n\nenvironment.26   Third, Gonzalez’s “complaints . . . were in large\n\nmeasure conveyed in light of a reprimand, still fresh, which\n\nappellant    believed    unfairly     attributed   responsibility     to\n\nher . . . .”     Pearson v. Macon-Bibb County Hosp. Auth., 952 F.2d\n\n1274, 1278 (11th Cir. 1992).27      Viewed in combination, these facts\n\n\n25\n  See App. A, ¶¶ 7-8 (stating that Gonzalez becomes aggravated at work\nand cannot predict whether Moran will want to rent to certain tenants);\nid., ¶ 8 (stating that Moran complains to Gonzalez when Gonzalez rents\nin a non-discriminatory manner); id., ¶ 9 (stating that Moran and\nGonzalez argue when Moran forces Gonzalez to break the rules).\n      This portion of the letter thus differs from the element of the\nemployee’s speech in Connick that satisfied the public concern\nrequirement. See 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S. Ct. at 1691. Even though Myers\ncirculated the questionnaire as a result of her employment grievance, the\nactual question about whether assistant district attorneys were forced\nto work on political campaigns did not refer explicitly to Myers’s self-\ninterest.\n26\n  See, e.g., id., ¶ 6 (“[Y]ou do not follow Rules and Regulations . . .,\nwhich causes so much confusion not only to me, also to every person in\nthis office.”); id., ¶ 10 (“You can not keep blaming me for this place\nstarting to fall apart. You owe all this to yourself, because you are\nthe one that bend the rules all the time.”); id., ¶ 19 (stating that\nMoran creates a “miserable environment” in the office).\n27\n  In Pearson, a hospital nurse alleged that her employer violated § 1983\nby discharging her for comments she made about her supervisors’\nassignment of cleaning responsibilities and about operating room\ncleanliness. See id. at 1276-77. In holding that her comments did not\nsatisfy the public concern requirement, we explained:\n     Pearson’s complaints primarily pertained to the assignment of\n     cleaning responsibilities in the O.R. and the allocation of\n     blame among the nurses responsible for O.R. conditions on\n     those occasions when cleaning duties were neglected. It was\n     only incident to speaking on these concerns that appellant’s\n     remarks touched on conditions that might be potentially\n     hazardous to patients. Appellant’s complaints, furthermore,\n     were in large measure conveyed in light of a reprimand, still\n     fresh,   which   appellant   believed   unfairly   attributed\n     responsibility to her for poor O.R. conditions. In essence,\n\n                                    16\n\findicate   that   Gonzalez,   even    though      she   was   involved   in   a\n\ncontinuing   battle    with   Moran        over    Moran’s    discriminatory\n\ndirectives, see infra Part IV, wrote this portion of the letter in\n\norder to “further her own private interest,” rather than “to raise\n\nissues of public concern,” Morgan, 6 F.3d at 754; see Ferrara v.\n\nMills, 781 F.2d 1508, 1515-16 (11th Cir. 1986) (holding that the\n\npublic concern requirement was not satisfied where the teacher’s\n\nspeech was based on the teacher’s personal concerns that collegiate\n\nregistration contributed to his inability to enforce discipline).\n\n     Because housing discrimination by a public housing authority\n\nis an issue of significant public importance, a public official\n\nordinarily would know that an employee’s statement addressing this\n\nissue constitutes speech on a matter of public concern.            See Kurtz\n\nv. Vickrey, 855 F.2d 723, 727 (11th Cir. 1988) (stating that the\n\ncontent of the speech is an important factor in the public concern\n\nanalysis).   Due to the unique confluence of facts in this case,\n\nhowever, we hold that the evidence, even viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to Gonzalez, would not have compelled a reasonable\n\nofficial in Moran’s position to believe that Gonzalez’s letter\n\nconstituted speech on a matter of public concern.             See Badia, 133\n\nF.3d at 1445; see also Jenkins by Hall v. Talladega City Bd. of\n\nEduc., 115 F.3d 821, 823 (11th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, __\n\nU.S. __, 118 S. Ct. 412 (1997).           We therefore hold that Moran is\n\n\n\n     Pearson’s comments concerned the circumstances of her own\n     employment.\nId. at 1278-79.\n\n                                     17\n\fentitled to qualified immunity on Gonzalez’s section 1983 claim,\n\nand we reverse the district court’s denial of summary judgment to\n\nMoran in her individual capacity on this claim.\n\n\n\n                                    IV.\n\n        Gonzalez also claims that Moran violated 42 U.S.C. § 3617, a\n\nprovision of the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619, 3631, by\n\nterminating Gonzalez’s employment “in retaliation of her complaints\n\nand refusal to participate in the discriminatory rental practices\n\nof the Defendants.”28     According to section 3617, it is unlawful to\n\n        coerce, intimidate, threaten, or interfere with any\n        person in the exercise or enjoyment of, or on account of\n        his having exercised or enjoyed, or on account of his\n        having aided or encouraged any other person in the\n        exercise or enjoyment of, any right granted or protected\n        by section 3603, 3604, 3605, or 3606 of this title.\n\nSection 3604 proscribes, inter alia, racial discrimination in the\n\nrental of housing.      See 42 U.S.C. § 3604(b).\n\n                                     A.\n\n        Moran contends that she is entitled to qualified immunity on\n\nGonzalez’s section 3617 claim.       It is a matter of first impression\n\nfor this court whether a public official sued in her individual\n\ncapacity under section 3617 may assert the defense of qualified\n\nimmunity.      We conclude that the qualified immunity defense is\n\navailable in such cases.\n\n\n\n\n28\n     R1-15, Amended Complaint at 7-8, ¶ 30.\n\n                                     18\n\f       In resolving this question, we rely on the Supreme Court’s\n\nqualified immunity jurisprudence relating to 42 U.S.C. § 1983.29\n\nIn Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 94 S. Ct. 1683 (1974), the\n\nSupreme Court held that state executive-branch officials may assert\n\na    qualified   immunity   defense   when   sued   in   their   individual\n\ncapacities under section 1983 for deprivations of federal rights\n\nunder color of state law.        See id. at 247, 94 S. Ct. at 1692\n\n(stating that “in varying scope, a qualified immunity is available\n\nto officers of the executive branch of government . . . .”).           The\n\nScheuer Court reasoned that executive officials under common law\n\nenjoyed a qualified immunity from civil damage actions and that\n\nCongress did not intend to abolish this immunity when it enacted\n\nsection 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13, now\n\ncodified at 42 U.S.C. § 1983.     See 416 U.S. at 239-48, 94 S. Ct. at\n\n1688-92.    The Court also relied on the importance of according\n\nimmunity to executive officials’ actions.           See id. at 245-47, 94\n\nS. Ct. at 1691-92.30\n\n\n29\n  This jurisprudence is not directly applicable here because Gonzalez\nbrought her Fair Housing Act claim under 42 U.S.C. §§ 3617 and 3613, not\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n30\n  The Supreme Court’s reasoning in subsequent cases confirms its analysis\nin Scheuer. For example, in Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S. 622,\n638, 100 S. Ct. 1398, 1409 (1980), the Court stated: “Where the immunity\nclaimed by the defendant was well established at common law at the time\n§ 1983 was enacted, and where its rationale was compatible with the\npurposes of the Civil Rights Act, we have construed the statute to\nincorporate that immunity.”     Likewise, in City of Newport v. Fact\nConcerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 101 S. Ct. 2748 (1981), the Court held that\nmunicipalities are immune from punitive damages in actions brought under\n§ 1983 because: (1) municipalities enjoyed that immunity at common law,\nsee id. at 259-63, 101 S. Ct. at 2756-58; (2) neither the language nor\nlegislative history of § 1983 demonstrates Congress’s intent to abolish\nthat immunity, see id. at 263-66, 101 S. Ct. at 2758-59; and (3) such\n\n                                      19\n\f     Applying the reasoning of Scheuer, we hold that Moran is\n\nentitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity in this\n\nsection 3617 action.         Neither the text31 nor the legislative\n\nhistory32 of section 3617 indicates that Congress intended to\n\nabrogate the qualified immunity to which executive-branch officials\n\nwere entitled under common law.     Because of this fact and in light\n\nof   the   importance   of    protecting   officials’   decision-making\n\ncapacity,33 we conclude that executive-branch officials sued in\n\ntheir individual capacities under section 3617 may assert the\n\ndefense of qualified immunity.\n\n\nimmunity is compatible with the policy goals of § 1983, see id. at 266-\n71, 101 S. Ct. at 2759-62.\n31\n  The fact that § 3617 is silent as to qualified immunity indicates that\nCongress did not intend to preclude the common-law qualified immunity\ndefense in § 3617 actions. Cf. Buckley v. Fitzsimmons, 509 U.S. 259,\n268, 113 S. Ct. 2606, 2613 (1993) (“Certain immunities were so well\nestablished in 1871, when § 1983 was enacted, that we presume that\nCongress would have specifically so provided had it wished to abolish\nthem.”) (internal quotation omitted); Fact Concerts, 453 U.S. at 258, 101\nS. Ct. at 2755 (“One important assumption underlying the Court’s\ndecisions in this area is that members of the 42d Congress were familiar\nwith common-law principles, including defenses previously recognized in\nordinary tort litigation, and that they likely intended these common-law\nprinciples to obtain, absent specific provisions to the contrary.”).\n32\n  The substance of § 3617: (1) appeared in the amendment to H.R. 2516\nthat was introduced and later tabled by Senators Mondale and Brooks, see\n114 Cong. Rec. at 2270; (2) was included in Senator Dirksen’s approved\nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 2516, see 114 Cong. Rec. at 4573; and (3)\nwas part of the bills passed by the Senate, see id. at 5992, and the\nHouse of Representatives, see id. at 9621; see also Pub. L. 90-284, Title\nVIII, § 817, 82 Stat. 89 (1968). No aspect of the legislative history\nsuggests that Congress intended to deprive public officials of the\nability to assert a qualified immunity defense in a § 3617 action. See,\ne.g., S. Rep. No. 721 (1968), reprinted in 1968 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1837\n(concerning relevant public law, but not addressing § 3617).\n33\n  See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 814, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 2736\n(1982) (stating that qualified immunity is necessary to avoid “the\nexpenses of litigation, the diversion of official energy from pressing\npublic issues, and the deterrence of able citizens from acceptance of\npublic office”).\n\n                                   20\n\f     In reaching this conclusion, we follow the only other court of\n\nappeals that has considered the matter.       See Samaritan Inns, Inc.\n\nv. District of Columbia, 114 F.3d 1227, 1238-39 (D.C. Cir. 1997)\n\n(allowing public officials sued in their individual capacities\n\nunder section 3617 to plead the affirmative defense of qualified\n\nimmunity); see also Baggett v.

Our holding also is\n\nconsistent with various decisions in which this court and others\n\nhave held that public officials are entitled to assert the defense\n\nof qualified immunity when sued under a federal statute other than\n\nsection 1983.34    Furthermore, we do not believe that Burrell v.\n\n\n\n\n34\n  See Lussier v.

We stress, however, that our opinion in this case should not be\nconstrued to address whether qualified immunity is available in actions\nbrought under statutes other than § 3617.\n\n                                   21\n\fBoard of Trustees of Ga. Military College, 970 F.2d 785 (11th Cir.\n\n1992), counsels a contrary conclusion.35\n\n\n35\n   In Burrell, this court held that a public official sued in an\nindividual capacity under 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3) may not assert a defense\nof qualified immunity. The court reasoned:\n      Unlike in section 1983 actions, public officials . . . will\n      not be subject to liability under section 1985(3) unless their\n      actions were motivated by ‘some racial, or perhaps otherwise\n      class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus.’ . . . We hold\n      that this additional safeguard obviates the need for granting\n      public officials qualified immunity in section 1985(3)\n      actions.\n970 F.2d at 794.      Because section 3617, like 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3),\nrequires a showing of discriminatory intent, see Sofarelli v. Pinellas\nCounty, 931 F.2d 718, 722-23 (11th Cir. 1991), Burrell might suggest that\nthe qualified immunity defense is not available in a § 3617 action.\n      For several reasons, we decline to extend Burrell’s holding to\nsection 3617 actions.      Initially, we note that this court has not\nextended Burrell to 42 U.S.C. § 1981 actions even though § 1981, under\nGeneral Building Contractors Ass’n v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 386-91,\n102 S. Ct. 3141, 3147-50 (1982), requires a showing of purposeful\ndiscrimination. See Johnson v. City of Fort Lauderdale, 126 F.3d 1372,\n1379-80 (11th Cir. 1997) (holding that defendant officials were entitled\nto qualified immunity on § 1981 claim but, under Burrell, could not\nassert qualified immunity on § 1985(3) claim). In light of the Johnson\ncourt’s implicit decision to limit Burrell, we hesitate to extend Burrell\nhere.\n      Furthermore, our research reveals no case other than Burrell in\nwhich a court of appeals or the Supreme Court has barred the qualified\nimmunity defense on the ground that the statute creating liability\nrequires a showing of discriminatory intent.      In other circuits, for\nexample, public officials may assert the qualified immunity defense in\na § 1985(3) action. See Southard v. Texas Bd. of Criminal Justice, 114\nF.3d 539, 555 (5th Cir. 1997); Brown v. City of Oneonta, N.Y., Police\nDep’t, 106 F.3d 1125, 1133 (2d Cir. 1997); Vaughn v. U.S. Small Business\nAdmin., 65 F.3d 1322, 1324-30 (6th Cir. 1995); Simmons v. Poe, 47 F.3d\n1370, 1376-78 (4th Cir. 1995); Bisbee v. Bey, 39 F.3d 1096, 1101-02 (10th\nCir. 1994); Howard v. Suskie, 26 F.3d 84, 87 (8th Cir. 1994); Prokey v.\nWatkins, 942 F.2d 67, 71-74 (1st Cir. 1991); Auriemma v. Rice, 910 F.2d\n1449, 1457-59 (7th Cir. 1990); Hobson v. Wilson, 737 F.2d 1, 24 (D.C.\nCir. 1984).\n      Finally, although we do not question Burrell’s result, we are not\nconvinced of one of its premises.       Contrary to the Burrell court’s\nstatement that plaintiffs in § 1983 actions need not demonstrate\ndiscriminatory intent, see 970 F.2d at 793-94, discriminatory intent is\na requisite element of § 1983 claims based on equal protection, see\nMencer v. Hammonds, 134 F.3d 1066, 1070 (11th Cir. 1998), cert. denied,\n__ U.S. __, __ S. Ct. __, 67 U.S.L.W. 3177 (U.S. Nov. 9, 1998)(No. 98-\n403); see also Edwards v. Wallace Community College, 49 F.3d 1517, 1524\n(11th Cir. 1995) (“[A]lthough intent is irrelevant for a qualified\nimmunity inquiry per se, it is relevant if intent is an element of the\nunderlying alleged constitutional violation.”) (citations omitted). For\n\n                                   22\n\f                                      B.\n\n       Having determined that Moran may assert a qualified immunity\n\ndefense against Gonzalez’s section 3617 claim, we must ascertain\n\nwhether, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nGonzalez, a reasonable person in Moran’s position would have known\n\nthat     her    actions   violated   rights   clearly   established   under\n\nsection 3617.        See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102\n\nS. Ct. 2727, 2738 (1982).       Because we must determine the contours\n\nof clearly established law, we have interlocutory jurisdiction to\n\nreview the district court’s denial of summary judgment on this\n\nclaim.     See Cottrell v. Caldwell, 85 F.3d 1480, 1484 (11th Cir.\n\n1996).    Our inquiry involves two stages.       First, we determine what\n\na reasonable government official, in Moran’s position, would have\n\nbelieved to be the clearly established law in 1995. See infra Part\n\nIV.B.1.        Second, we evaluate whether the evidence, viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to Gonzalez, indicates that Moran should have\n\nknown that her termination of Gonzalez violated clearly established\n\nlaw.    See infra Part IV.B.2.\n\n                                      1.\n\n       To determine what a reasonable government official, in Moran’s\n\nposition, would have believed the Fair Housing Act permitted when\n\nshe terminated Gonzalez, we look to the law as it stood in 1995.\n\nAlthough Gonzalez has not proffered any applicable, previously\n\ndecided cases that clearly established that Moran’s alleged conduct\n\n\nall of these reasons, we decline to extend Burrell’s holding to § 3617\nactions.\n\n                                      23\n\fviolated   the   Fair   Housing   Act,    our   review   of   the   statutory\n\nprovisions and the applicable regulation lead us to conclude that\n\nno public official, in Moran’s position, could reasonably have\n\nbelieved that federal law permitted her to fire an employee for\n\nrefusing to discriminate against tenants on the basis of race.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s decision that Moran was\n\nnot immune from suit.\n\n     Ordinarily,    a   plaintiff   who    seeks   to    overcome    a   state\n\nofficial’s affirmative defense of qualified immunity must cite case\n\nlaw, in force at the time of the defendant’s actions, that would\n\nhave made it absolutely clear that the defendant’s conduct violated\n\nfederal law.     There is no case from the U.S. Supreme Court, this\n\nCircuit, or the relevant state Supreme Court, that would have\n\nestablished that a person violates section 3617 by firing an\n\nemployee for refusing to discriminate against potential tenants on\n\nthe basis of race.      Cf. Jenkins by Hall v. Talladega City Bd. of\n\nEduc., 115 F.3d 821, 826 n.4 (11th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied,\n\n__ U.S. __, 118 S. Ct. 412 (1997) (explaining that decisions from\n\nonly these courts clearly establish the law for the purposes of\n\nqualified immunity).     The absence of such a case is not fatal to\n\nGonzalez’s claim, however, because this case differs from the\n\ntypical qualified immunity case in which the plaintiff sues a\n\npublic official pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and asserts the\n\nviolation of some (often generally worded) constitutional right.\n\nAlthough the assertion of such broadly conceived rights, without\n\nthe benefit of sufficiently illuminating case law, may fail to\n\n                                    24\n\fovercome the hurdle of qualified immunity, see Lassiter v. Alabama\n\nA & M Univ., Bd. of Trustees, 28 F.3d 1146, 1150 (11th Cir. 1994)\n\n(en banc); Jenkins, 115 F.3d at 825 n.3, we have acknowledged the\n\npossibility   that   some   federal     statutory   provisions   will   be\n\nsufficiently clear on their own to provide defendants with fair\n\nnotice of their obligations under the law, see Santamorena v.\n\nGeorgia Military College, 147 F.3d 1337, 1340 n.6 (11th Cir. 1998);\n\nLassiter, 28 F.3d at 1150 n.4.36        Cf. United States v. Lanier, __\n\nU.S. __, 117 S. Ct. 1219, 1227 (“[G]eneral statements of the law\n\nare not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning, and\n\n. . . may apply with obvious clarity to the specific conduct in\n\nquestion, even though ‘the very action in question has [not]\n\npreviously been held unlawful.’”) (quoting Anderson v. Creighton,\n\n483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S. Ct. 3034, 3039 (1987)).          Section 3617\n\nprovides just such an explicit statement of what the Fair Housing\n\nAct demanded of the defendant in this case.\n\n       Section 3617 renders it unlawful to “interfere with any\n\nperson . . . on account of his having aided or encouraged any other\n\nperson in the exercise or enjoyment of . . . any right granted or\n\nprotected by section 3603, 3604, 3605, or 3606 of this title.”\n\nSection 3604, in turn, bars racial discrimination in the “terms,\n\n36\n   See also Hansen v. Soldenwagner, 19 F.3d 573, 575 (11th Cir. 1994)\n(“Pre-existing law – whether it be case law or statutory law – must be\navailable to instruct in a concrete way the government agent, given the\ncircumstances.”); Leeks v. Cunningham, 997 F.2d 1330, 1333 (11th Cir.\n1993) (determining whether clear “statutory or case law” existed at the\ntime of the defendant’s actions); accord Samaritan Inns, 114 F.3d at 1239\n(affirming the district court, which had ruled, without relying on\nmaterially similar pre-existing case law, that the defendants did not\nhave qualified immunity in a § 3617 case).\n\n                                   25\n\fconditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in\n\nthe provision of services or facilities in connection therewith .\n\n. . .”   42 U.S.C. § 3604(b).     Section 3617, read in conjunction\n\nwith   section   3604,   therefore,    straightforwardly   states   the\n\nunsurprising (and presumably uncontroversial) proposition that the\n\nFair Housing Act prohibits “interfering” with any person because\n\nshe “aided or encouraged” another person’s exercise of her right to\n\nrent property free from racial discrimination.37       Any reasonable\n\npublic official, having read the plain terms of this statute,\n\ncertainly would have understood that federal law makes it unlawful\n\nto terminate an employee for refusing to discriminate against\n\npotential tenants on the basis of race.     To the extent any federal\n\nstatute, standing alone, can provide a potential defendant with\n\nconcrete notice, “that is, truly compel (not just suggest or allow\n\nor raise a question about), the conclusion for every like-situated,\n\nreasonable government agent that what [she] is doing violates\n\nfederal law,” we believe that section 3617 provides such notice in\n\nthe circumstances of this case.       Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1150.    Cf.\n\n\n\n37\n    Sofarelli, 931 F.2d at 722-23, confirms that § 3617 permits a\nplaintiff to sue public officials who interfere with the plaintiff’s\nefforts to provide housing on a race neutral basis as long as the\nplaintiff can allege and establish that race played some role in the\ndefendant’s conduct. See also Baytree of Inverrary Realty Partners v.\nCity of Lauderhill, 873 F.2d 1407, 1409 (11th Cir. 1989) (stating that\nnon-minority developers have standing to assert § 3617 claims against\nlocal government officials). Even though Sofarelli probably raises a\nquestion about the legality of Moran’s alleged conduct in this case,\nbecause Sofarelli involved different facts, it alone cannot, under our\nprecedent, clearly establish the relevant pre-existing law because it\nwould not compel the conclusion that firing an employee for failing to\ndiscriminate against tenants on the basis of race violates the law. See\nLassiter, 28 F.3d at 1150.\n\n                                  26\n\fBaggett.38   Just as generally stated constitutional principles,\n\nstanding alone, without materially similar case support, would have\n\nprovided fair warning to the Supreme Court’s hypothetical welfare\n\nofficials who sold foster children into slavery, see Lanier, __\n\nU.S. at __, 117 S. Ct. at 1227-28, the statutory provisions at\n\nissue in this case, standing alone, provide fair warning and thus\n\nclearly establish that the Fair Housing Act prohibits firing an\n\nemployee for refusing to discriminate against tenants on the basis\n\nof race.\n\n     Alternatively, even if a public official credibly could argue\n\nthat the language of the statute provided insufficient notice, its\n\nimplementing federal regulation, adopted in 1989, removes all doubt\n\nabout whether federal law makes it illegal to fire an employee for\n\nrefusing to discriminate on the basis of race.      As this regulation\n\npointedly restates, section 3617 prohibits\n\n\n38\n    The district court in Baggett considered whether §§ 3604 and 3617,\nstanding alone, without the benefit of illuminating case law,\nsufficiently had established the relevant pre-existing law to permit the\nplaintiffs to overcome the defendants’ assertion of qualified immunity,\nas contemplated in Lassiter. Baggett. The court explained that, in light\nof the statute, “no competent government agent reasonably could believe\nthat truly egregious acts of discrimination . . . would not violate\nfederal law,” but concluded that because the plaintiffs’ claims posed a\n“sophisticated legal issue” the defendants remained immune.           Id.\nGonzalez’s claims in this case, however, present no such complications.\nGonzalez has alleged and offered evidence that Moran fired her because\nGonzalez refused to discriminate against tenants on the basis of race,\nprecisely the type of egregious discrimination that the plain language\nof the statute warns against and which the Baggett court explained no\ncompetent official could reasonably claim federal law permitted.\nFinally, and to avoid confusion, we do not cite Baggett as a case that\nclearly establishes the law on this point; our precedent firmly states\nthat a district court opinion cannot accomplish that result, see Jenkins,\n115 F.3d at 826 n.4. We cite the case only as a persuasive illustration\nthat the provisions at issue here, standing alone, clearly establish the\nlaw in a case alleging conduct so plainly at odds with the statutes.\n\n                                   27\n\f     [t]hreatening an employee or agent with dismissal or an\n     adverse employment action, or taking such adverse\n     employment action, for any effort to assist a person\n     seeking access to the sale or rental of a dwelling or\n     seeking access to any residential real estate-related\n     transaction, because of the race, color, religion, sex,\n     handicap, familial status, or national origin of that\n     person or of any person associated with that person.\n\n24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3) (codifying Implementation of the Fair\n\nHousing Amendments Act of 1988, 54 Fed. Reg. 3232, 3292 (1989))\n\n(emphasis added).39\n\n     A public official forfeits qualified immunity by violating the\n\nclear      command         of   a   federal       regulation       that,      like\n\nsection 100.400(c)(3), reinforces a statute and thus helps to\n\nprovide the basis for a cause of action.               The Supreme Court has\n\nconcluded that administrative regulations, in and of themselves, do\n\nnot provide sufficient notice to override officials’ qualified\n\nimmunity    when     the    plaintiff   alleges    a   violation    of     broadly\n\nconceived constitutional rights.         See Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183,\n\n\n39\n   Although Gonzalez herself did not cite § 100.400(c)(3) before the\ndistrict court or initially on appeal, we must evaluate the clearly\ndefined scope of § 3617 sua sponte, regardless of whether the\nimplementing regulation was proffered as relevant legal authority. In\nElder v. Holloway, 975 F.2d 1388 (9th Cir. 1991), rev’d, 510 U.S. 510,\n114 S. Ct. 1019 (1994), the plaintiff in a § 1983 action appealed the\ndistrict court’s determination that the defendants were entitled to\nqualified immunity. The plaintiff failed to inform either the district\ncourt or the Ninth Circuit of factually similar pre-existing case law\nthat indicated the illegality of the defendants’ actions. See id. at\n1390.   Although the Ninth Circuit noticed that a pre-existing case\nappeared to proscribe defendants’ actions, see id. at 1391, the court\nheld that a plaintiff may not benefit on appeal from precedent that\nneither he nor the district court cited.      See id. at 1394-96.    The\nSupreme Court reversed, holding that an appellate court is required to\ndetermine the clearly established law sua sponte, based on “its ‘full\nknowledge of its own [and other relevant] precedents,’” 510 U.S. at 516,\n114 S. Ct. at 1023 (citing Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 192 n.9, 104\nS. Ct. 3012, 3018 n.9 (1984)) (brackets in Elder). Accordingly, we must\ndetermine the clearly established contours of § 3617 sua sponte.\n\n                                        28\n\f193-96, 104 S. Ct. 3012, 3018-20 (1984); see also Childress v.

James,\n\n157 F.3d 1271, 1285-86 (11th Cir. 1998). As the Supreme Court explained,\n\nbecause every failure to obey a regulation could potentially\n\nprovide the basis for the assertion of a constitutional right--even\n\none “that was not clearly defined or perhaps not even foreshadowed\n\nat the time of the alleged violation”--the mere breach of a\n\nregulation    cannot,    in   itself,    defeat   a   defendant’s   qualified\n\nimmunity.

The reason\n\nfor this rule is obvious given the rationale underlying the\n\nqualified immunity doctrine:            public officers should have fair\n\nwarning of what actions will expose them to the threat of lawsuits\n\nand eventual liability.         “[O]fficials can act without fear of\n\nharassing litigation only if they reasonably can anticipate when\n\ntheir conduct may give rise to liability for damages . . . .”\n\nDavis, 468 U.S. at 195, 104 S. Ct. at 3019.           Accordingly, we do not\n\nexpect state officials to be aware of every regulation that\n\nindirectly might give rise to a possible constitutional claim.\n\n        As this line of cases expressly acknowledges, however, the\n\nlogic they employ does not apply where a statute or regulation\n\nspecifically creates the plaintiff’s cause of action, because in\n\nthose    instances,     government   officials    are    on   notice   of   the\n\nparameters of their exposure to suit and liability. See Davis, 468\n\nU.S. at 194 n.12, 104 S. Ct. at 3019 n.12 (“[I]f a statute or\n\nregulation does give rise to a cause of action for damages, clear\n\n                                        29\n\fviolation of the statute or regulation forfeits immunity only with\n\nrespect to damages caused by that violation.”); Childress, 825 F.2d\n\nat 1553 (“[N]either federal nor state officials lose their immunity\n\nby violating the clear command of a statute or regulation . . .\n\nunless that statute or regulation provides the basis for the cause\n\nof action sued upon.”)(quoting Davis, 468 U.S. at 194 n.12, 104\n\nS. Ct. at 3019 n.12); Harbert, 157 F.3d at 1285 (same).40         As the\n\nSupreme Court subsequently described its decision in Davis:\n\n     Davis, in short, concerned not the authorities a court\n     may consider in determining qualified immunity, but this\n     entirely discrete question:      Is qualified immunity\n     defeated where a defendant violates any clearly\n     established duty, including one under state law, or must\n     the clearly established right be the federal right on\n     which the claim for relief is based? The Court held the\n     latter.\n\nElder v. Holloway, 510 U.S. 510, 515, 114 S. Ct. 1019, 1023 (1994).\n\nThus, where a plaintiff’s claim arises under a specific statutory\n\ncause of action, a regulation interpreting that statute can provide\n\nsufficient notice to abrogate a defendant’s qualified immunity.41\n\n\n40\n  See also W.B. v. Matula, 67 F.3d 484, 500-01 (3d Cir. 1995) (examining\nregulations to determine parameters of clearly established law); Torcasio\nv. Murray, 57 F.3d 1340, 1350-52 (4th Cir. 1995) (stating that\nadministrative guidelines “may provide some evidence that it is . . .\nestablished that the ADA applies to state prisons”); Doe by and through\nDoe v. Petaluma City Sch. Dist., 54 F.3d 1447, 1452 (9th Cir. 1995)\n(“[A]n obligation to act might arise from something other than decisional\nlaw, such as a regulation or policy that an official is legally bound to\nfollow.”).\n41\n   This holding is consistent with the principle that individuals\npresumptively have notice of their legal duties under federal\nregulations. See, e.g., Heckler v. Community Health Servs. of Crawford\nCounty, Inc., 467 U.S. 51, 65-66, 104 S. Ct. 2218, 2227 (1984) (“[T]he\nregulations governing the cost reimbursement provisions of Medicare\nshould and did put respondent on ample notice of the care with which its\ncost reports must be prepared . . . .”); Ed Taylor Constr. Co. v.\nOccupational Safety & Health Review Comm’n, 938 F.2d 1265, 1272 (11th\n\n                                   30\n\fGonzalez’s    claim      in    this     case     asserts,    not    some      general\n\nconstitutional      claim     premised    on     Moran’s    breach      of    a   duty\n\nestablished   in    an     administrative        regulation,      but   a    specific\n\nviolation of the federal statute and regulation under which she\n\nbrought suit.      See R1-15, Amended Complaint, ¶ 33, at 8 (bringing\n\nsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 3613).\n\n     The special concurrence argues that section 100.400(c)(3)\n\n“should not be deemed the source of clearly established law”\n\nbecause no authoritative case has yet approved it as valid or\n\napplied it to a specific set of facts. Special Concurrence at __.42\n\nMoran has conceded, however, “that the validity of [section]\n\n100.400(c)(3)      under      Chevron    would    have     been    apparent       to   a\n\nreasonable public official in 1995.” Moran Supp. Br. at 5.43 Moran\n\nalso should not have needed a court to explain to her that the\n\n\nCir. 1991) (holding that OSHA regulation placed employers on notice of\nfederal construction requirement; stating that “[w]hether or not\nemployers are in fact aware of each OSHA regulation and fully understand\nit, they are charged with this knowledge and are responsible for\ncompliance”).\n42\n  The special concurrence also expresses “doubt that a regulation which\non its face purports only to be an executive department’s ‘interpretation\nof [unlawful] conduct’ can be the basis of clearly established law.”\nSpecial Concurrence at __.      The regulation at issue in this case,\nhowever, is more than a mere interpretation: it is binding law. See\nKing v. Housing Auth. of City of Huntsville, 670 F.2d 952, 954 (11th Cir.\n1982) (holding that HUD has the authority to promulgate binding\nregulations) (citing statute under which § 100.400 promulgated); 24\nC.F.R. § 100.400(c) (“Conduct made unlawful under [§ 3617] includes, but\nis not limited to, the following: [listing types of unlawful conduct].”)\n(emphasis added).\n43\n  Indeed, § 100.400(c)(3) was patently valid because a reasonable public\nofficial would have no reason to believe that § 100.400(c)(3) represents\nan impermissible construction of § 3617 or is contrary to clearly\nexpressed Congressional intent. See Chevron, U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural\nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S. Ct. 2778,\n2781-82 (1984).\n\n                                         31\n\fregulation applied to the facts alleged here.             The regulation\n\nstates that section 3617 prohibits dismissing an employee for\n\n“assist[ing] a person seeking access to the . . . rental of a\n\ndwelling . . .    because of the race . . . of that person or of any\n\nperson associated with that person.”         This language unmistakably\n\ninstructs that it is illegal to fire an employee for refusing to\n\ndiscriminate against prospective tenants on the basis of race.44\n\nWhere, as here, a regulation plainly and specifically describes a\n\npublic official’s behavior, the official is on notice that she is\n\nsubject to liability for its violation, and thus, that she will not\n\nbe able to claim qualified immunity.\n\n     Accordingly, we hold that sections 3617 and 3604, which were\n\nin effect in 1995, truly would have compelled a reasonable public\n\nofficial   in    Moran’s   position    to   conclude   that   federal   law\n\nprohibited firing an employee for refusing to rent public housing\n\nin a racially discriminatory manner.          See 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(b),\n\n3617; see also Jenkins, 115 F.3d at 823.         Alternatively, we hold\n\nthat section 100.400(c)(3), promulgated under the Fair Housing Act\n\n\n\n44\n  In fact, Moran’s Supplemental Brief all but abandons any attempt to\nargue that the regulation is ambiguous. Instead, Moran argues that the\nregulation does not clearly establish that the Fair Housing Act prevents\na public official from firing an employee for any reason or for\ninsubordination. See Moran’s Supp. Br. at 5-6. This argument misses the\npoint.    As long as Gonzalez presents evidence in support of her\nallegation that Moran fired her for refusing to engage in racial\ndiscrimination, and that evidence is sufficient to survive a motion for\nsummary judgment, see infra Part IV.B.2, Moran’s actual motivation for\nfiring Gonzalez presents classic questions of fact and credibility that\nthe jury will have to resolve. For purposes of resolving the issue of\nqualified immunity at the summary judgment stage of the case, we must\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to Gonzalez and determine\nwhether her allegations, if true, would violate clearly established law.\n\n                                      32\n\fand   also    in   effect    in     1995,       compels   the     same   conclusion.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that if Gonzalez’s evidence regarding\n\nMoran’s conduct and motivation is sufficient to withstand summary\n\njudgement    under   Rule     56,    the    conduct       would    violate   clearly\n\nestablished    federal      law,    and    Moran,    therefore,      would   not   be\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.45\n\n\n\n45\n   The special concurrence advances the attractive proposition that since\nthe Civil War and the more recent “great crusade for civil rights,”\nracial discrimination in rental practices is so inherently evil as to bar\nan assertion of qualified immunity without the need for supporting case\nlaw or legislation. Special Concurrence at __. Certainly, we agree that\nracial discrimination, in any context, is evil and wish that the concept\nwas as universally acknowledged and readily accepted as the special\nconcurrence suggests. Regrettably however, in the years since the Civil\nWar and the adoption of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth\nAmendments, the recognition of equality in all aspects of life has\nneither been axiomatic nor obvious, see, e.g., Plessy v. Ferguson, 163\nU.S. 537, 16 S. Ct. 1138 (1896) (establishing the separate but equal\ndoctrine almost 30 years after the ratification of the Fourteenth\nAmendment), but has emerged only gradually, see, e.g., Brown v. Board of\nEduc., 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686 (1954) (striking down segregation in\npublic schools more than 80 years after the Fourteenth Amendment); Loving\nv. Virginia, 388 U.S. 1, 87 S. Ct. 1817 (1967) (striking down—only 30\nyears ago—a statute that criminalized interracial marriage). Indeed,\nCongress has recognized the continuing need for legislation to eradicate\nthe cancer of racial discrimination by enacting measures such as the\nVoting Rights Act, Title VII, and, in this context, the Fair Housing Act.\n      We also have no quarrel with the special concurrence’s observation\nthat, in the appropriate case, a government official’s conduct might be\nso egregious that the violation of federal law is obvious, even in the\nabsence of case law or legislation recognizing the illegality of\nmaterially similar acts; deference to the Supreme Court’s holdings\nrequires nothing less. See Lanier, __ U.S. at __, 117 S. Ct. at 1225-26.\nUnlike the conduct at issue in Lanier, which was so repugnant that it had\nescaped prior contemplation in the relevant sources of authority, the\nconduct in this case is both outrageous and specifically addressed in the\nFair Housing Act. Standing alone, or as further clarified by regulation\n24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3), the Fair Housing Act “stake[s] out a bright\nline” such that the law prohibiting racial discrimination in rental\npractices was clearly established in the “concrete and factually defined\ncontext” we required in Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1149-50.       As a result,\nMoran’s assertion of qualified immunity must fail, and we need not\nconsider this additional teaching of Lanier.\n\n\n\n\n                                           33\n\f                                       2.\n\n        The remaining question is whether the evidence, viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to Gonzalez, indicates that Moran should have\n\nknown that her actions violated clearly established prohibitions of\n\nthe Fair Housing Act.         We review this issue under the framework\n\nestablished in Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-27, 106\n\nS. Ct. 2548, 2552-55 (1986).         See supra Part II.B.\n\n        In her Amended Complaint, Gonzalez specifically alleged that\n\nduring her employment at LCHA, Gonzalez objected to Moran’s orders\n\nthat Gonzalez deny housing to individuals based on race and that\n\nGonzalez “skip” individuals on the housing waiting list because of\n\nrace.46 Gonzalez generally alleged that Moran violated section 3617\n\nby     terminating    Gonzalez’s    employment     “in   retaliation   of   her\n\ncomplaints and refusal to participate in the discriminatory rental\n\npractices of the Defendants.”47\n\n        Gonzalez, of course, bears the burden of demonstrating that\n\nMoran     should     have   known   that    her   actions   violated   clearly\n\nestablished prohibitions of section 3617.                Thus, under Celotex,\n\nMoran may prevail on her summary judgment motion without bringing\n\nforth “affidavits or other similar materials” negating Gonzalez’s\n\nclaim.      See 477 U.S. at 323, 106 S. Ct. at 2553.             Nonetheless,\n\nMoran must at least “‘show[]’--that is, point[] out to the district\n\ncourt--that there is an absence of evidence to support” Gonzalez’s\n\n\n\n46\n     See R1-15, Amended Complaint, ¶ 1, at 1-2; id., ¶¶ 11-12, at 5.\n47\n     Id., ¶ 30, at 7-8.\n\n                                       34\n\fcase.     See id. at 325, 106 S. Ct. at 2554 (quoting Adickes v. S.H.\n\nKress & Co., 398 U.S. 144, 159, 90 S. Ct. 1598, 1609 (1970)).\n\n        We are not convinced that Moran satisfied her initial summary\n\njudgment burden.      In her memorandum in support of her motion for\n\nsummary judgment, Moran cited no record evidence that would rebut\n\nGonzalez’s section 3617 claim, and it is doubtful that Moran\n\n“show[ed]” or “point[ed] out” the “absence of evidence to support”\n\nGonzalez’s claim.       See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n2554.     For example, in responding to the allegation that Gonzalez\n\nobjected to Moran’s directive to deny housing based on race,48 Moran\n\nsimply asserted that Gonzalez was referring to two white women with\n\nblack babies and that these women ultimately did receive LCHA\n\nhousing.49      Gonzalez,     however,    need   not   show   that   applicants\n\nactually were denied housing based on race,50 but rather that Moran\n\nfired Gonzalez based in significant part on Gonzalez’s efforts to\n\nrent public housing in a non-racially discriminatory manner.51\n\nBecause Moran does not even address Gonzalez’s claim that Moran\n\nterminated Gonzalez’s employment “in retaliation of her complaints\n\nand refusal to participate in the discriminatory rental practices\n\n\n\n48\n     See id., ¶ 1, at 1; id., ¶ 11, at 5.\n49\n  See R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment\nof Defendant Moran in her Individual Capacity, at 8.\n50\n   Indeed, if Gonzalez successfully thwarted Moran’s intent to deny\nhousing based on race, as would be consistent with Moran’s assertion,\nthen Gonzalez obviously made an “effort to assist a person seeking access\nto the . . . rental of a dwelling,” 24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3), and thus\nGonzalez enjoyed the protections of § 3617.\n51\n     See supra Part IV.B.1.\n\n                                         35\n\fof the Defendants,”52 Moran appears to have failed to point out the\n\nabsence of evidence supporting Gonzalez’s claim.       See Celotex, 477\n\nU.S. at 325, 106 S. Ct. at 2554.53\n\n        Even assuming, arguendo, that Moran did meet her Celotex\n\nburden, we would hold that Gonzalez did not “rest upon the mere\n\nallegations” of her complaint, but rather “set forth specific facts\n\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”       Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(e).      In her memorandum in opposition to Moran’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment, Gonzalez relied upon the affidavit that Gonzalez\n\npreviously filed in support of her motion for partial summary\n\njudgment.54     That affidavit contained several important pieces of\n\n52\n     R1-15, Amended Complaint, ¶ 30, at 7-8.\n53\n   Similarly, Moran did not respond effectively to the allegation that\nGonzalez resisted Moran’s orders to “skip” individuals on the housing\nwaiting list because of race.     See id., ¶ 12, at 5.      Moran simply\ncontended that this allegation was “founded upon a single instance in\nwhich defendant Moran purportedly told the plaintiff not to offer low-\nincome housing to an individual who was felt to be suffering from a\nmental disorder.”   R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for\nSummary Judgment of Defendant Moran in her Individual Capacity, at 8.\n      Section 3617, however, prohibits interference with the housing\nrights of the mentally disabled. See 24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3) (stating\nthat § 3617 prohibits the dismissal of an employee based on the\nemployee’s effort to provide rental housing to a person with a handicap);\nsee also 42 U.S.C. § 3617 (prohibiting interference with       efforts to\nassist others in enjoying rights established under § 3604); 42 U.S.C. §\n3604(f) (prohibiting discrimination based on renter’s handicap); 42\nU.S.C. § 3602(h)(1),(3) (defining handicapped person as person with\nsubstantially limiting mental impairment or person regarded as such).\nBecause Moran did not dispute that Gonzalez resisted Moran’s orders to\n“skip” individuals on the housing waiting list, Moran’s admission that\nshe ordered Gonzalez to skip an individual based on that person’s mental\ncondition tends to support, rather than refute, Gonzalez’s claim that\nMoran fired her “in retaliation of her complaints and refusal to\nparticipate in the discriminatory rental practices of the Defendants.”\nR1-15, Amended Complaint, ¶ 30, at 7-8.\n54\n  See R1-37, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant Moran’s\nMotions for Summary Judgment, at 3 (“The facts, as relied upon by the\nCourt for the purposes of these motions, should be as they have been\npresented by the Plaintiff in her Amended Complaint and the Affidavit\n\n                                     36\n\fevidence.      First, Gonzalez testified that Moran directed her to\n\nengage in actions that, in Gonzalez’s view, violated the anti-\n\ndiscrimination laws that apply to public housing programs.55\n\n        Second,    attached    to   the    affidavit   and   incorporated   by\n\nreference therein56 was the letter written by Gonzalez to Moran on\n\nSeptember 28, 1995.57         According to that letter, Moran complained\n\nwhen Gonzalez attempted to place a white woman with a black child\n\nin a vacant apartment and tried to place an elderly black man in a\n\nvacant unit.58       Of particular note, Gonzalez also stated in the\n\nletter that Gonzalez’s refusal to discriminate was a central cause\n\nof the arguments between Moran and Gonzalez.59\n\n        Third, attached to the affidavit and incorporated by reference\n\ntherein60 was the letter written by Gonzalez to Puccio on October\n\n9, 1995.61    In that letter, Gonzalez stated that during August and\n\nSeptember 1995, Gonzalez “confront[ed]” Moran about the fact that\n\n\n\nattached to ‘Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment’ . . . .”) (footnote omitted).\n55\n  See R1-20, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, Ex. A, ¶ 5, at 1.\n56\n  See id., Ex. A, ¶ 8, at 1 (“A copy of my letter is attached to and\nincorporated into this Affidavit.

A, Attach. 4.\n\n                                          37\n\fMoran wanted Gonzalez to take certain actions that violated HUD\n\nrules and regulations.62           These confrontations concerned, inter\n\nalia, Moran’s desire to discriminate against specific potential\n\ntenants:     two white women with black children and an elderly black\n\nman.63\n\n        Gonzalez thus made an affirmative showing that, in the time\n\nimmediately preceding Moran’s decision to fire her, a serious rift\n\nwas developing between Moran and Gonzalez concerning Gonzalez’s\n\nrefusal to comply with Moran’s directives to deny housing to\n\nindividuals based on race.               Indeed, the record suggests that\n\nGonzalez’s refusal to follow Moran’s discriminatory directives was\n\na central cause of the problems between them.                     Moreover, when\n\nGonzalez, in the context of a wide-ranging personal complaint about\n\noffice     conditions,    stated    in    writing   that    Moran   was   forcing\n\nGonzalez to discriminate,64 Moran’s displeasure with Gonzalez’s\n\nrecalcitrance probably sharpened even further. Viewed in the light\n\nmost     favorable   to   Gonzalez,      the   evidence    thus   suggests   that\n\nGonzalez’s termination represented the culmination of a long-\n\nstanding      and    intensifying        disagreement      in     which   Moran’s\n\ndiscriminatory directives played an important role, and that Moran\n\n\n62\n     See id., Ex. A, Attach. 4, at 1.\n63\n     See id., Ex. A, Attach. 4, at 2.\n64\n  See App. A, ¶ 9 (“[T]he times that you and me had argue is because you\nhad forced me to discriminate, or rip-off people . . . .”); see also id.,\n¶ 8 (“I never know who you will want me to house even if they are next\non the waiting list.     If it’s a white girl with a black baby, you\ncomplain, if we have a vacancie on the lederly site, you do not want me\nto put a black person on that site . . . .”).\n\n                                         38\n\ffired her based in significant part on Gonzalez’s resistance to\n\nMoran’s discriminatory orders.\n\n     This inference finds additional support in the termination\n\nletter that Moran herself sent to Gonzalez.           As a reason for\n\nGonzalez’s termination, the letter cites Gonzalez’s “criticism of\n\norders, rules and policies,”65 and Moran has brought forth no\n\nevidence showing that the phrase “orders, rules and policies”\n\nrefers   to   anything    other   than   Moran’s    own   discriminatory\n\ndirectives.\n\n     Accordingly,    we   hold    that   Gonzalez   has   brought   forth\n\nsufficient evidence to create the reasonable inference that Moran\n\nfired her based in significant part on Gonzalez’s efforts to rent\n\npublic housing in a non-racially discriminatory manner.        Because a\n\nreasonable official in Moran’s position should have known that such\n\nan action was unlawful, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(b), 3617; 24 C.F.R.\n\n§ 100.400(c)(3), we affirm the district court’s decision to deny\n\nMoran’s motion for summary judgment on this claim.\n\n                                    V.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court’s\n\ndenial of summary judgment to Moran in her individual capacity as\n\nto Gonzalez’s section 1983 claim; we AFFIRM the district court’s\n\ndenial of summary judgment to Moran in her individual capacity as\n\nto Gonzalez’s section 3617 claim; and we REMAND the case for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n65\n  See R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment\nof Defendant Moran in her Individual Capacity, Ex. D, at 1.\n\n                                    39\n\fAPPENDIX A\nReproduced below, unedited, is the text of\nGonzalez’s letter to Moran dated September 28, 1995.66\n\n         Dear Ms. Moran\n\n[¶ 1]    On Wednesday, September 20, 1995, you called me in your office to insult me blaming me for all the vacancies\n         LCHA has in all the sites for the past 2 months. You had told me that I am not doing my job.\n\n[¶ 2]    I felt hurt and raised my voice at you, because I could not believe what you said to me. I have done more than\n         I am supposed to do for this business and everyone is a witness to that.\n\n[¶ 3]    You are the kind of person that whenever things go fine, you are happy, but when things get a little blurry, you\n         turn into a very critical, and verbally abusive person.\n\n[¶ 4]    In two years that I have been here, I have seen and also received a lot of verbal abuse along with my co-\n         workers. You had called my co-workers words and names that I can not even write in this letter.\n\n[¶ 5]    It is very sad to say that you have no consideration for your staff. All you know is to exploit people and then\n         if someone complaints you threaten us we will loose our jobs, because you happen to be the “Executive\n         Director”.\n\n[¶ 6]    I suppose you were not happy for what you did to me on September 20, 1995, on Thursday, September 21, 1995\n         you had sent me to Charleston Park in Alva and without even saying a good morning to me you gave me a\n         letter, a reprimend and asked me to sign it, which I refused because it is a lie. You also started yelling at me\n         because I refused to sign the reprimend. You wrote in the reprimend that you will not tolerate my violent\n         outburst, that I have a problem with language interpretation. You needed to write in the reprimend that my\n         outburst was provoked by you and you had also said I have a problem following Rules and Regulations, that\n         is correct too, but it is because you do not follow Rules and Regulations, you changed them, if it is not on a\n         daily basis, it is on a weekly basis, which causes so much confusion not only to me, also to every person in this\n         office.\n\n[¶ 7]    You had also said to me that you made me from a Receptionist to a Property Manager, well I have learned\n         everything on my own, because you had never trained me or have anyone training me at this job. I had to work\n         my way up all by myself, learning from my mistakes. If you look at my file when I put an application to work\n         here, I brought you reference letters from my other jobs. I was not a nobody when I came to work here. All\n         I have learned from this place is to agravate myself day after they, because of the things that I see and hear.\n\n[¶ 8]    I never know who you will want me to house even if they are next on the waiting list. If it’s a white girl with\n         a black baby, you complain, if we have a vacancie on the lederly site, you do not want me to put a black person\n         on that site, if the client has HIV, you complain, if it’s a white that has not been in the job for too long, you do\n         not want me to house them, because it will become a negative rent.\n\n[¶ 9]    If you remember, that the times that you and me had argue is because you had forced me to discriminate, or rip-\n         off people (meaning that if someone moves after the 5th. of the months, you do not want me to pro-rate the rent\n         and charge them from the 1st. of the month.\n\n[¶ 10]   You can not keep blaming me for this place starting to fall apart. You owe all this to yourself, because you are\n         the one that bend the rules all the time. More examples are, if I give a tenant a violation, which is part of my\n         job and the tenant does not like it, they come to you and then you will not back me up, causing for the tenants\n\n\n66\n  See R1-20, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, Ex. A, Attach. 3; R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support\nof Motion for Summary Judgment of Defendant Moran in her Individual\nCapacity, Ex. B.\n\n                                                            40\n\f         not to respect my position. Another good example will be last year when I did the re-certification inspections\n         that I had found Ms. Loretta Huff with a cat inside the unit. After I mentioned the tenant she needed to get rid\n         of the pet, she called you and then you called me in your office to tell me to “stay away from the elderly site”.\n         A few months ago you received a complaint from a tenant at the elderly site about so many cats around, and\n         then you wanted me to take care of the problem. There are plenty of violation over on that site, but if I try to\n         do my job, is either you get upset or your good friend Mr. Edward Kross (board member that you\n         recommended), will come to this office and complaint about me doing my job and I will be asked to back out.\n\n[¶ 11]   Also, when Mr. Willie Christmas, tenant from Charleston Park, Alva took you to Legal Aid, you told Legal Aid\n         that the eviction was done while you were on vacation, trying to blame the mistake on me, but what you forgot\n         is that I do not process evictions unless you order me, and also you were the one that singed all the paperwork\n         before you left on vacation. Here again, the mistake was made, because the bookeping department gives the\n         notices for eviction out and then you do not file thru with them. First tenants have no respect for eviction\n         notices and that is why we keep loosing money all the time.\n\n[¶ 12]   You also drive the company car, and most of the time is not available for the rest of the staff that do inspections,\n         banck deposits, etc. Libby has to use her car to do FSS inspections or go to meetings, Sylvia has to use her car\n         to do the bank deposits, and I have to use my car all the time for inspections and to go to Alva. If I tell you I\n         need the car to do an inspection, is either you tell me to reschedule for another day or will give me 10 minutes\n         to come back, which it is impossible. You get very upset if someone uses the car after 3:00 P.M., because you\n         want the car for you to leave a 3:30 P.M. most of the time. We do not consider that a company car, it is your\n         personal car.\n\n[¶ 13]   Also, I had reported to you all the complaints we had received of Mr. Richard Wombwell, the Senior Aide you\n         have at Barrett Park. There are plenty of verbal and written complaints against Mr. Wombwell about him being\n         unrespectful to tenants, fresh with the spanish married women, and even denied the use of the LCHA lawn\n         mower to the tenants he does not like, or timed them with same. You said he was going to help me with the\n         tenants problems, collecting rent, delivering notices and rent receipts, give out violations to the tenants, things\n         that he has denied to do, but on the other hand you had approved a lot of social activities, that he uses LCHA\n         money to buy refreshments and candy all the time. He also got a brand new TV and a VCR with LCHA money\n         for entertainment. I reported to you the time Mr. Wombwell asked me if I could give violations to his\n         “buddies” so they would not get mad at him. Today, I had to write you a complaint about Mr. Wombwell\n         asking the bookeeper if I still work for LCHA, which make me think why someone that does not even work\n         for LCHA, because he is an employee for Dr. Ella Piper, knows if I am going to be fired or not. On the other\n         hand I heard the bookeeper suplying him with all the updates about me.\n\n[¶ 14]   The communication problems that I have with staff members, maintenance members, are all caused by you\n         because you are a terrible instigator among all of us in this office and that is very sad. You had always make\n         us feel we do not worth anything and nothing is appreciated.\n\n[¶ 15]   You keep giving us a miserable raise if any every year, because there is no money, but then you went ahead\n         and bought yourself a new computer that you hardly look at it, the TV and VCR for Barrett Park, to keep Mr.\n         Richard Wombwell happy and also a few more toys.\n\n[¶ 16]   Writing this type of letter is not me, but you had pushed me to do it, you had been very unfair with me and my\n         co-workers and that LCHA could be a wonderful place to work if things are done the right way and if we could\n         accept our mistakes, starting with you, instead of putting the blame on somebody else.\n\n[¶ 17]   You had also mentioned to some staff members about the money I asked you to lend me to buy my car and I\n         need to remind you that God is my witness I have never asked you for that money, because I did not know that\n         well to do something like that. You offered me that money and told me that I could pay you anyway I could\n         and I accepted and also wrote my debt to you in a piece of paper that I signed, compromising myself to give\n         $100.00 every month. I have done this every months, but since I had a problem this month and could not give\n         you any money this month, you even called me at my house on Tuesday, September 26, 1995 around 7:00 P.M.\n         to asked to borrow the money and made me feel real bad. I do not know what kind of person you think I am,\n         but even that I did not asked for that money, I will pay you every single dollar you lent me, because I happen\n\n\n                                                            41\n\f         to be a decent and grateful person. Even that this job and you have tried to change me, I’m still a good person\n         inside, that only fights back when she gets pushed or abused.\n\n[¶ 18]   I will like for you to take some time and think of all the good things and the good atmosphere we could have\n         in this office, instead of creating this miserable environment.\n\n[¶ 19]   The new Job Description you had given me on Tuesday, September 26, 1995, I will consider it as a revision\n         to the first one you gave me, because I know the things that you added to it, is because of the argument we had\n         on September 20, 1995, because when you gave me the letter changing my title you never mentioned about\n         giving me a new job description.\n\n         Sincerely,\n         /s/L. Gonzalez\n         Luz N. Gonzalez\n         Property Manager\n\n         cc:\n\n[¶ 20]   NOTE: I need to mention that when you hired me, it was for Pine Echo (Family and Elderly sites) and Barrett\n         Park. When you fired Richard Brevick, you had asked me if I could help you collecting the rent and I even\n         expressed to you that I will do only that because I knew nothing about Farmers Home Housing, but I ended\n         doing all the work and now you blamed me for the vacancies overthere too. That is why you decided to add\n         Charleston Park to the new job description.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          42\n\fBLACK, Circuit Judge, specially concurring:\n\n     In   part   IV.B.   of   the   opinion,   the   Court   holds   that   a\n\ngovernment official who implements a plan to discriminate against\n\nblack persons in public housing and fires a subordinate employee\n\nfor refusing to discriminate pursuant to the plan has no qualified\n\nimmunity.   I completely agree.1      I write separately because of the\n\nexplanation given for today’s decision.\n\n     Part IV.B. of the opinion sets out two alternative bases for\n\nfinding clearly established law to overcome qualified immunity:\n\nfirst, the plain language of 42 U.S.C. § 3617; and second, the\n\nclear command of 24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3), which interprets 42\n\nU.S.C. § 3617.    Section 3617 is a very general statute and is not\n\nsufficiently fact-specific to satisfy the requirements of Lassiter\n\nv. Alabama A&M Univ., Bd. of Trustees, 28 F.3d 1146, 1149-50 (11th\n\nCir. 1994) (en banc).     As this Circuit has made clear, it is the\n\n“exceptional case where the words of a federal statute or federal\n\nconstitutional provision will be specific enough to establish the\n\nlaw applicable to particular circumstances clearly and to overcome\n\nqualified immunity even in the absence of case law.”           Santamorena\n\nv. Georgia Military College, 147 F.3d 1337, 1340 n.6 (11th Cir.\n\n1998) (emphasis added) (quoting Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1150 n.4).\n\nThus, the federal regulation is the only the only remaining source\n\n\n\n1\n  I also concur with the majority in parts I, II, III, and IV.A. of the\nopinion.\n\n                                     43\n\fof   clearly   established    law.    Neither    party   cited   24   C.F.R.\n\n§ 100.400(c)(3) in the briefs to this Court or the district court.\n\nWe   requested   supplemental    briefing   as   to   whether    24   C.F.R.\n\n§ 100.400(c)(3) even applies to the facts of this case and were not\n\ninformed of any United States Supreme Court or Eleventh Circuit\n\ncase in which 24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3) is mentioned.\n\n      Even if a regulation can be the basis of clearly established\n\nlaw, neither this Circuit nor the Supreme Court has ever so held.\n\nMoreover, I doubt that a regulation which on its face purports only\n\nto be an executive department’s “interpretation of [unlawful]\n\nconduct” can be the basis of clearly established law.2                In the\n\ncontext of qualified immunity, I believe courts should not give\n\nmuch weight to executive branch regulations interpreting statutes\n\nwhen the regulations have not been held by a court to be accurate\n\ninterpretations. At any rate, 24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3) should not\n\nbe deemed the source of clearly established law in this case, where\n\nthe Court today recognizes its application for the first time.\n\n      The purpose of qualified immunity is to protect government\n\nofficials from liability for conduct they could not reasonably have\n\nknown was unlawful.          Much of federal constitutional law and\n\nstatutory law is unpredictable and unclear in its application to\n\nparticular circumstances.       Thus, as the Court states, we require\n\n\n2\n The regulation “provides the Department’s interpretation of the conduct\nthat is unlawful under section 818 of the Fair Housing Act.” 24 C.F.R.\n§ 100.400(a).\n\n                                     44\n\fmaterially similar case law or a very specific statute before\n\nsaying that a government official should have known her conduct was\n\nunlawful.3   There is no specific pre-existing case law applicable\n\nto this case.\n\n     On the other hand, we have recognized that in the extremely\n\nrare case a government official’s conduct may be so egregious, in\n\nfact evil, as to be obviously contrary to federal law, so that no\n\ncase law or statute needs to have recognized previously that\n\nmaterially similar conduct is unlawful. The facts alleged here, if\n\ntrue, make this that extremely rare case.         More than a century\n\nafter the Civil War and more than a quarter century after the great\n\ncrusade for civil rights for black persons in this country, no\n\ngovernment housing official could reasonably believe that she may\n\nlawfully discriminate against black persons on the basis of race,\n\nor that she might punish another public official for refusing to\n\ndiscriminate in the course of her official duties against black\n\npersons on the basis of race.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  See Opinion at ___ (“Ordinarily, a plaintiff who seeks to overcome a\nstate official’s affirmative defense of qualified immunity must cite case\nlaw, in force at the time of the defendant’s actions, that would have\nmade it absolutely clear that the defendant’s conduct violated federal\nlaw [and] we have acknowledged the possibility that some federal\nstatutory provisions will be sufficiently clear on their own to provide\ndefendants with fair notice of their obligations under the law.”).\n\n                                   45\n\f",

Moran moved for summary\n\njudgment in her individual capacity on the basis of qualified\n\nimmunity.    The district court denied this motion, and Moran filed\n\nan interlocutory appeal.1\n\n     We reverse the district court’s judgment as to Gonzalez’s\n\nFirst Amendment claim brought under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Even viewing\n\nthe evidence in the light most favorable to Gonzalez, a reasonable\n\nperson in Moran’s position would not have known that Gonzalez’s\n\nletter of September 28, 1995, constituted speech on a matter of\n\npublic concern.   See infra Part III.    On the other hand, we affirm\n\nthe district court’s judgment as to Gonzalez’s claim brought under\n\n42 U.S.C. § 3617. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto Gonzalez, a reasonable person in Moran’s position would have\n\nknown that her termination of Gonzalez’s employment was unlawful.\n\nSee infra Part IV.\n\n                                  I.\n\n     The record, for purposes of summary judgment, reveals the\n\nfollowing:    Gonzalez worked for the LCHA from October 1993 to\n\nOctober 1995. She began as an Administrative Clerk and assumed the\n\n\n\n1\n  The district court also granted Moran’s motion for summary judgment in\nher official capacity and denied Gonzalez’s motion for partial summary\njudgment as to Gonzalez’s contract claim.     The sole issue on appeal,\nhowever, is whether the district court erred in denying summary judgment\nto Moran in her individual capacity.\n\n                                   1\n\fposition of Property Manager in May 1995.         Her duties as Property\n\nManager included overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Low\n\nIncome Housing Program and the Rural Community Economic Development\n\nRural Housing Program.      At all times, she worked under Moran.\n\n     According to Gonzalez, Moran directed her to engage in certain\n\nactions that, in Gonzalez’s view, violated the anti-discrimination\n\nlaws that apply to public housing programs.2          For example, Moran\n\ncomplained when Gonzalez attempted to place a white woman with a\n\nblack child in a vacant apartment, and Moran told Gonzalez that she\n\ndid not want a black person placed in a vacant elderly housing\n\nunit.3    Moran’s efforts to force Gonzalez to discriminate were a\n\ncentral cause of the arguments that arose between Gonzalez and\n\nMoran.4     Finally,   during   August   and   September   1995,   Gonzalez\n\n“confront[ed]” Moran about the fact that Moran wanted Gonzalez to\n\ntake certain actions that violated the rules and regulations of the\n\n\n\n\n2\n  See R1-20, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, Ex.

In    the    letter,   Gonzalez\n\ncomplained about various aspects of Moran’s management, including\n\nMoran’s discriminatory directives, and stated that Moran’s efforts\n\nto force Gonzalez to discriminate were a central cause of the\n\narguments between them.13\n\n        On October 2, Moran fired Gonzalez. In the termination letter\n\ngiven     to   Gonzalez,    Moran    stated    that    Gonzalez   had    exhibited\n\n“offensive      or   antagonistic     conduct     toward      superiors,   fellow\n\nemployees, or the public; criticism of orders, rules and policies,\n\n\n\n\n10\n     See R1-15, Amended Complaint, ¶ 15, at 5.\n11\n     See id., ¶ 16, at 5-6.\n12\n     See id., ¶ 17, at 6.\n13\n  See App. A, ¶¶ 8-9. In addition, on September 29, Gonzalez wrote Moran\na one-page letter in which she complained that another LCHA employee had\nbeen spreading information about Moran’s reprimand of Gonzalez. See R1-\n20, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial Summary\nJudgment, Ex.

Gonzalez claimed that\n\nMoran, in her individual capacity, violated: (1) Gonzalez’s First\n\nAmendment      rights   by   terminating    Gonzalez’s   employment   in\n\nretaliation for her “objections and complaints about the operations\n\nof the Defendants,” giving rise to a claim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983;17\n\nand (2) 42 U.S.C. § 3617 by terminating Gonzalez’s employment in\n\nretaliation for her “complaints and refusal to participate in the\n\ndiscriminatory rental practices of the Defendants.”18       Moran moved\n\nfor summary judgment in her individual capacity on both claims.\n\n\n\n14\n  See R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment\nof Defendant Moran in her Individual Capacity, Ex.

See id., ¶¶ 30, 34, at\n7-8. Furthermore, Gonzalez alleged that LCHA and Moran, in her official\ncapacity, breached Gonzalez’s employment contract. See id., ¶ 39, at 9.\n\n                                     5\n\fThe district court, without elaboration, ruled that “issues of\n\nmaterial fact” precluded the court from granting summary judgment\n\nin Moran’s favor.19         Moran appeals the district court’s denial of\n\nthat motion.\n\n                                        II.\n\n                                        A.\n\n      This   court    lacks    interlocutory       jurisdiction    to    review   a\n\ndistrict court’s denial of summary judgment where the moving party\n\nappeals based solely on the argument that the district court erred\n\nin evaluating evidentiary sufficiency.

Although evidence indicates that Gonzalez and Moran previously\n\nargued about compliance with discrimination rules, see infra Part\n\nIV.B.2, we are unable to perform a Pickering review of Gonzalez’s\n\nspeech on those occasions because the record does not disclose the\n\n“manner, time, and place” of Gonzalez’s statements.        See Connick,\n\n461 U.S. at 150-55, 103 S. Ct. at 1692-93 (describing elements of\n\nPickering balancing test). Accordingly, we pretermit our review of\n\nthat speech and leave this question for the district court.21\n\n21\n  Similarly, we pretermit our review of other instances of Gonzalez’s\nspeech because of the lack of causation evidence required under Mt.\nHealthy.

No evidence indicates that Moran, when\nfiring Gonzalez, knew about Gonzalez’s pre-termination conversations with\nthe HUD official and LCHA Board members.

See 461 U.S. at 140-41, 103 S. Ct.\nat 1686. As a result of her discontent, Myers prepared and circulated\nto other assistant district attorneys a questionnaire concerning office\ntransfer policy, office morale, the need for a grievance committee, the\nlevel of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured\nto work in political campaigns. See id. at 141, 103 S. Ct. at 1687.\nConnick then terminated Myers. See id.\n      The Connick Court analyzed each of the questions in the\nquestionnaire separately.    Most of the questions were not “of public\nimport in evaluating the performance of the District Attorney as an\nelected official,” 461 U.S. at 148, 103 S.

The Court, however, held that the question concerning\nwhether assistant district attorneys felt pressured to work in political\ncampaigns did touch upon a matter of public concern in light of: (1) the\nconstitutional guarantees protecting employees from having to work for\npolitical candidates not of their own choice; and (2) the “demonstrated\ninterest in this country that government service should depend upon\n\n                                    12\n\f     In order to determine whether the letter satisfies the public\n\nconcern requirement, we must analyze its “content, form, and\n\ncontext . . . as revealed by the whole record,”       Connick, 461 U.S.\n\nat 147-48, 103 S.

See Connick, 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S. Ct. at\n\n1691 (holding that one question in an employee’s questionnaire\n\nconstituted speech on a matter of public concern).       In particular,\n\nGonzalez’s accusations about Moran’s discriminatory behavior merit\n\nscrutiny.    The letter, unedited, states in part:\n\n      All I have learned from this place is to agravate myself\n      day after they, because of the things that I see and\n      hear.\n\n      I never know who you will want me to house even if they\n      are next on the waiting list. If it’s a white girl with\n      a black baby, you complain, if we have a vacancie on the\n      lederly site, you do not want me to put a black person on\n      that site, if the client has HIV, you complain, if it’s\n\n23\n  See, e.g., App. A, ¶ 3 (“[W]hen things get a little blurry, you turn\ninto a very critical, and verbally abusive person.”); id., ¶ 4 (“I have\nseen and also received a lot of verbal abuse along with my co-workers.”);\nid., ¶ 5 (“[Y]ou have no consideration for your staff.”); id., ¶ 14\n“[Y]ou are a terrible instigator among all of us in this\noffice . . . .”); id., ¶ 15 (stating that Moran only gives “miserable\nraise[s]”); id., ¶ 16 (criticizing Moran for blaming others for her own\nmistakes); id., ¶ 18 (blaming Moran for “creating this miserable\nenvironment”).\n\n                                   14\n\f        a white that has not been in the job for too long, you do\n        not want me to house them, because it will become a\n        negative rent.\n\n        If you remember, that the times that you and me had argue\n        is because you had forced me to discriminate or rip-off\n        people . . . .24\n\n        It is unclear whether this portion of the letter can “be\n\nfairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public\n\nconcern . . . .”      Connick, 461 U.S. at 146, 103 S. Ct. at 1690.            On\n\nthe one hand, a public official’s authorization of discriminatory\n\nrental practices unquestionably is an important                matter of general\n\npublic interest.       See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 3601 (“It is the policy of\n\nthe United States to provide . . . for fair housing throughout the\n\nUnited States.”); cf. Connick, 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S. Ct. at 1691\n\n(holding that the pressuring of public employees to work in\n\npolitical campaigns is a matter of public concern).                 Moreover, a\n\npublic       employee’s    statement   may    satisfy    the    public   concern\n\nrequirement even where, as here, the employee speaks within the\n\nworkplace, after an adverse employment decision, about a specific\n\nmatter that had not drawn significant public attention prior to her\n\nspeech.      See Connick, 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S. Ct. at 1691.\n\n        On   the   other   hand,   three    unrebutted   facts     suggest   that\n\nGonzalez’s purpose in writing this part of the letter was to blame\n\nMoran for Gonzalez’s dissatisfaction with the stressful conditions\n\nof her own employment.        First, this portion of the letter does not\n\nspecifically address the legal rights of the potential tenants, but\n\n\n\n24\n     See App. A, ¶¶ 7-9.\n\n                                       15\n\frather concerns (a) Gonzalez’s own aggravation and confusion, (b)\n\nMoran’s complaints to Gonzalez, and (c) the arguments between Moran\n\nand Gonzalez.25 Second, the letter as a whole focuses on Gonzalez’s\n\ntheory that Moran, by breaking rules, was harming the office\n\nenvironment.26   Third, Gonzalez’s “complaints . . . were in large\n\nmeasure conveyed in light of a reprimand, still fresh, which\n\nappellant    believed    unfairly     attributed   responsibility     to\n\nher . . . .”     Pearson v.

See 461 U.S. at 149, 103 S. Ct. at 1691. Even though Myers\ncirculated the questionnaire as a result of her employment grievance, the\nactual question about whether assistant district attorneys were forced\nto work on political campaigns did not refer explicitly to Myers’s self-\ninterest.\n26\n  See, e.g., id., ¶ 6 (“[Y]ou do not follow Rules and Regulations . . .,\nwhich causes so much confusion not only to me, also to every person in\nthis office.”); id., ¶ 10 (“You can not keep blaming me for this place\nstarting to fall apart. You owe all this to yourself, because you are\nthe one that bend the rules all the time.”); id., ¶ 19 (stating that\nMoran creates a “miserable environment” in the office).\n27\n  In Pearson, a hospital nurse alleged that her employer violated § 1983\nby discharging her for comments she made about her supervisors’\nassignment of cleaning responsibilities and about operating room\ncleanliness. See id. at 1276-77. In holding that her comments did not\nsatisfy the public concern requirement, we explained:\n     Pearson’s complaints primarily pertained to the assignment of\n     cleaning responsibilities in the O.R. and the allocation of\n     blame among the nurses responsible for O.R. conditions on\n     those occasions when cleaning duties were neglected. It was\n     only incident to speaking on these concerns that appellant’s\n     remarks touched on conditions that might be potentially\n     hazardous to patients. Appellant’s complaints, furthermore,\n     were in large measure conveyed in light of a reprimand, still\n     fresh,   which   appellant   believed   unfairly   attributed\n     responsibility to her for poor O.R. conditions.

See 416 U.S. at 239-48, 94 S. Ct. at\n\n1688-92.    The Court also relied on the importance of according\n\nimmunity to executive officials’ actions.           See id. at 245-47, 94\n\nS.

For example, in Owen v. City of Independence, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110236\"><a href=\"/opinion/110236/owen-v-independence/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n638, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110236\"><a href=\"/opinion/110236/owen-v-independence/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct. at 2756-58; (2) neither the language nor\nlegislative history of § 1983 demonstrates Congress’s intent to abolish\nthat immunity, see id. at 263-66, 101 S.

Neither the text31 nor the legislative\n\nhistory32 of section 3617 indicates that Congress intended to\n\nabrogate the qualified immunity to which executive-branch officials\n\nwere entitled under common law.     Because of this fact and in light\n\nof   the   importance   of    protecting   officials’   decision-making\n\ncapacity,33 we conclude that executive-branch officials sued in\n\ntheir individual capacities under section 3617 may assert the\n\ndefense of qualified immunity.\n\n\nimmunity is compatible with the policy goals of § 1983, see id. at 266-\n71, 101 S. Ct. at 2759-62.\n31\n  The fact that § 3617 is silent as to qualified immunity indicates that\nCongress did not intend to preclude the common-law qualified immunity\ndefense in § 3617 actions. Cf.

Second, we evaluate whether the evidence, viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to Gonzalez, indicates that Moran should have\n\nknown that her termination of Gonzalez violated clearly established\n\nlaw.    See infra Part IV.B.2.\n\n                                      1.\n\n       To determine what a reasonable government official, in Moran’s\n\nposition, would have believed the Fair Housing Act permitted when\n\nshe terminated Gonzalez, we look to the law as it stood in 1995.\n\nAlthough Gonzalez has not proffered any applicable, previously\n\ndecided cases that clearly established that Moran’s alleged conduct\n\n\nall of these reasons, we decline to extend Burrell’s holding to § 3617\nactions.\n\n                                      23\n\fviolated   the   Fair   Housing   Act,    our   review   of   the   statutory\n\nprovisions and the applicable regulation lead us to conclude that\n\nno public official, in Moran’s position, could reasonably have\n\nbelieved that federal law permitted her to fire an employee for\n\nrefusing to discriminate against tenants on the basis of race.\n\nAccordingly, we affirm the district court’s decision that Moran was\n\nnot immune from suit.\n\n     Ordinarily,    a   plaintiff   who    seeks   to    overcome    a   state\n\nofficial’s affirmative defense of qualified immunity must cite case\n\nlaw, in force at the time of the defendant’s actions, that would\n\nhave made it absolutely clear that the defendant’s conduct violated\n\nfederal law.     There is no case from the U.S. Supreme Court, this\n\nCircuit, or the relevant state Supreme Court, that would have\n\nestablished that a person violates section 3617 by firing an\n\nemployee for refusing to discriminate against potential tenants on\n\nthe basis of race.

Even though Sofarelli probably raises a\nquestion about the legality of Moran’s alleged conduct in this case,\nbecause Sofarelli involved different facts, it alone cannot, under our\nprecedent, clearly establish the relevant pre-existing law because it\nwould not compel the conclusion that firing an employee for failing to\ndiscriminate against tenants on the basis of race violates the law.

As this regulation\n\npointedly restates, section 3617 prohibits\n\n\n38\n    The district court in Baggett considered whether §§ 3604 and 3617,\nstanding alone, without the benefit of illuminating case law,\nsufficiently had established the relevant pre-existing law to permit the\nplaintiffs to overcome the defendants’ assertion of qualified immunity,\nas contemplated in Lassiter. Baggett. The court explained that, in light\nof the statute, “no competent government agent reasonably could believe\nthat truly egregious acts of discrimination . . . would not violate\nfederal law,” but concluded that because the plaintiffs’ claims posed a\n“sophisticated legal issue” the defendants remained immune.           Id.\nGonzalez’s claims in this case, however, present no such complications.\nGonzalez has alleged and offered evidence that Moran fired her because\nGonzalez refused to discriminate against tenants on the basis of race,\nprecisely the type of egregious discrimination that the plain language\nof the statute warns against and which the Baggett court explained no\ncompetent official could reasonably claim federal law permitted.\nFinally, and to avoid confusion, we do not cite Baggett as a case that\nclearly establishes the law on this point; our precedent firmly states\nthat a district court opinion cannot accomplish that result, see Jenkins,\n115 F.3d at 826 n.4. We cite the case only as a persuasive illustration\nthat the provisions at issue here, standing alone, clearly establish the\nlaw in a case alleging conduct so plainly at odds with the statutes.\n\n                                   27\n\f     [t]hreatening an employee or agent with dismissal or an\n     adverse employment action, or taking such adverse\n     employment action, for any effort to assist a person\n     seeking access to the sale or rental of a dwelling or\n     seeking access to any residential real estate-related\n     transaction, because of the race, color, religion, sex,\n     handicap, familial status, or national origin of that\n     person or of any person associated with that person.\n\n24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3) (codifying Implementation of the Fair\n\nHousing Amendments Act of 1988, 54 Fed.

As the Supreme Court explained,\n\nbecause every failure to obey a regulation could potentially\n\nprovide the basis for the assertion of a constitutional right--even\n\none “that was not clearly defined or perhaps not even foreshadowed\n\nat the time of the alleged violation”--the mere breach of a\n\nregulation    cannot,    in   itself,    defeat   a   defendant’s   qualified\n\nimmunity.    Davis, 468 U.S. at 195, 104 S. Ct. at 3019.            The reason\n\nfor this rule is obvious given the rationale underlying the\n\nqualified immunity doctrine:            public officers should have fair\n\nwarning of what actions will expose them to the threat of lawsuits\n\nand eventual liability.         “[O]fficials can act without fear of\n\nharassing litigation only if they reasonably can anticipate when\n\ntheir conduct may give rise to liability for damages . . . .”\n\nDavis, 468 U.S. at 195, 104 S. Ct. at 3019.           Accordingly, we do not\n\nexpect state officials to be aware of every regulation that\n\nindirectly might give rise to a possible constitutional claim.\n\n        As this line of cases expressly acknowledges, however, the\n\nlogic they employ does not apply where a statute or regulation\n\nspecifically creates the plaintiff’s cause of action, because in\n\nthose    instances,     government   officials    are    on   notice   of   the\n\nparameters of their exposure to suit and liability.

The regulation\n\nstates that section 3617 prohibits dismissing an employee for\n\n“assist[ing] a person seeking access to the . . . rental of a\n\ndwelling . . .    because of the race . . . of that person or of any\n\nperson associated with that person.”         This language unmistakably\n\ninstructs that it is illegal to fire an employee for refusing to\n\ndiscriminate against prospective tenants on the basis of race.44\n\nWhere, as here, a regulation plainly and specifically describes a\n\npublic official’s behavior, the official is on notice that she is\n\nsubject to liability for its violation, and thus, that she will not\n\nbe able to claim qualified immunity.\n\n     Accordingly, we hold that sections 3617 and 3604, which were\n\nin effect in 1995, truly would have compelled a reasonable public\n\nofficial   in    Moran’s   position    to   conclude   that   federal   law\n\nprohibited firing an employee for refusing to rent public housing\n\nin a racially discriminatory manner.          See 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(b),\n\n3617; see also Jenkins, 115 F.3d at 823.         Alternatively, we hold\n\nthat section 100.400(c)(3), promulgated under the Fair Housing Act\n\n\n\n44\n  In fact, Moran’s Supplemental Brief all but abandons any attempt to\nargue that the regulation is ambiguous. Instead, Moran argues that the\nregulation does not clearly establish that the Fair Housing Act prevents\na public official from firing an employee for any reason or for\ninsubordination. See Moran’s Supp. Br. at 5-6. This argument misses the\npoint.    As long as Gonzalez presents evidence in support of her\nallegation that Moran fired her for refusing to engage in racial\ndiscrimination, and that evidence is sufficient to survive a motion for\nsummary judgment, see infra Part IV.B.2, Moran’s actual motivation for\nfiring Gonzalez presents classic questions of fact and credibility that\nthe jury will have to resolve. For purposes of resolving the issue of\nqualified immunity at the summary judgment stage of the case, we must\nview the evidence in the light most favorable to Gonzalez and determine\nwhether her allegations, if true, would violate clearly established law.\n\n                                      32\n\fand   also    in   effect    in     1995,       compels   the     same   conclusion.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude that if Gonzalez’s evidence regarding\n\nMoran’s conduct and motivation is sufficient to withstand summary\n\njudgement    under   Rule     56,    the    conduct       would    violate   clearly\n\nestablished    federal      law,    and    Moran,    therefore,      would   not   be\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.45\n\n\n\n45\n   The special concurrence advances the attractive proposition that since\nthe Civil War and the more recent “great crusade for civil rights,”\nracial discrimination in rental practices is so inherently evil as to bar\nan assertion of qualified immunity without the need for supporting case\nlaw or legislation. Special Concurrence at __. Certainly, we agree that\nracial discrimination, in any context, is evil and wish that the concept\nwas as universally acknowledged and readily accepted as the special\nconcurrence suggests. Regrettably however, in the years since the Civil\nWar and the adoption of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth\nAmendments, the recognition of equality in all aspects of life has\nneither been axiomatic nor obvious, see, e.g., Plessy v.

Indeed,\nCongress has recognized the continuing need for legislation to eradicate\nthe cancer of racial discrimination by enacting measures such as the\nVoting Rights Act, Title VII, and, in this context, the Fair Housing Act.\n      We also have no quarrel with the special concurrence’s observation\nthat, in the appropriate case, a government official’s conduct might be\nso egregious that the violation of federal law is obvious, even in the\nabsence of case law or legislation recognizing the illegality of\nmaterially similar acts; deference to the Supreme Court’s holdings\nrequires nothing less. See Lanier, __ U.S. at __, 117 S. Ct. at 1225-26.\nUnlike the conduct at issue in Lanier, which was so repugnant that it had\nescaped prior contemplation in the relevant sources of authority, the\nconduct in this case is both outrageous and specifically addressed in the\nFair Housing Act. Standing alone, or as further clarified by regulation\n24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3), the Fair Housing Act “stake[s] out a bright\nline” such that the law prohibiting racial discrimination in rental\npractices was clearly established in the “concrete and factually defined\ncontext” we required in Lassiter, 28 F.3d at 1149-50.       As a result,\nMoran’s assertion of qualified immunity must fail, and we need not\nconsider this additional teaching of Lanier.\n\n\n\n\n                                           33\n\f                                       2.\n\n        The remaining question is whether the evidence, viewed in the\n\nlight most favorable to Gonzalez, indicates that Moran should have\n\nknown that her actions violated clearly established prohibitions of\n\nthe Fair Housing Act.

See supra Part II.B.\n\n        In her Amended Complaint, Gonzalez specifically alleged that\n\nduring her employment at LCHA, Gonzalez objected to Moran’s orders\n\nthat Gonzalez deny housing to individuals based on race and that\n\nGonzalez “skip” individuals on the housing waiting list because of\n\nrace.46 Gonzalez generally alleged that Moran violated section 3617\n\nby     terminating    Gonzalez’s    employment     “in   retaliation   of   her\n\ncomplaints and refusal to participate in the discriminatory rental\n\npractices of the Defendants.”47\n\n        Gonzalez, of course, bears the burden of demonstrating that\n\nMoran     should     have   known   that    her   actions   violated   clearly\n\nestablished prohibitions of section 3617.                Thus, under Celotex,\n\nMoran may prevail on her summary judgment motion without bringing\n\nforth “affidavits or other similar materials” negating Gonzalez’s\n\nclaim.      See 477 U.S. at 323, 106 S. Ct. at 2553.             Nonetheless,\n\nMoran must at least “‘show[]’--that is, point[] out to the district\n\ncourt--that there is an absence of evidence to support” Gonzalez’s\n\n\n\n46\n     See R1-15, Amended Complaint, ¶ 1, at 1-2; id., ¶¶ 11-12, at 5.\n47\n     Id., ¶ 30, at 7-8.\n\n                                       34\n\fcase.

In her memorandum in support of her motion for\n\nsummary judgment, Moran cited no record evidence that would rebut\n\nGonzalez’s section 3617 claim, and it is doubtful that Moran\n\n“show[ed]” or “point[ed] out” the “absence of evidence to support”\n\nGonzalez’s claim.       See Celotex, 477 U.S. at 325, 106 S. Ct. at\n\n2554.     For example, in responding to the allegation that Gonzalez\n\nobjected to Moran’s directive to deny housing based on race,48 Moran\n\nsimply asserted that Gonzalez was referring to two white women with\n\nblack babies and that these women ultimately did receive LCHA\n\nhousing.49      Gonzalez,     however,    need   not   show   that   applicants\n\nactually were denied housing based on race,50 but rather that Moran\n\nfired Gonzalez based in significant part on Gonzalez’s efforts to\n\nrent public housing in a non-racially discriminatory manner.51\n\nBecause Moran does not even address Gonzalez’s claim that Moran\n\nterminated Gonzalez’s employment “in retaliation of her complaints\n\nand refusal to participate in the discriminatory rental practices\n\n\n\n48\n     See id., ¶ 1, at 1; id., ¶ 11, at 5.\n49\n  See R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment\nof Defendant Moran in her Individual Capacity, at 8.\n50\n   Indeed, if Gonzalez successfully thwarted Moran’s intent to deny\nhousing based on race, as would be consistent with Moran’s assertion,\nthen Gonzalez obviously made an “effort to assist a person seeking access\nto the . . . rental of a dwelling,” 24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3), and thus\nGonzalez enjoyed the protections of § 3617.\n51\n     See supra Part IV.B.1.\n\n                                         35\n\fof the Defendants,”52 Moran appears to have failed to point out the\n\nabsence of evidence supporting Gonzalez’s claim.       See Celotex, 477\n\nU.S. at 325, 106 S. Ct. at 2554.53\n\n        Even assuming, arguendo, that Moran did meet her Celotex\n\nburden, we would hold that Gonzalez did not “rest upon the mere\n\nallegations” of her complaint, but rather “set forth specific facts\n\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial.”       Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(e).      In her memorandum in opposition to Moran’s motion for\n\nsummary judgment, Gonzalez relied upon the affidavit that Gonzalez\n\npreviously filed in support of her motion for partial summary\n\njudgment.54     That affidavit contained several important pieces of\n\n52\n     R1-15, Amended Complaint, ¶ 30, at 7-8.\n53\n   Similarly, Moran did not respond effectively to the allegation that\nGonzalez resisted Moran’s orders to “skip” individuals on the housing\nwaiting list because of race.     See id., ¶ 12, at 5.      Moran simply\ncontended that this allegation was “founded upon a single instance in\nwhich defendant Moran purportedly told the plaintiff not to offer low-\nincome housing to an individual who was felt to be suffering from a\nmental disorder.”   R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for\nSummary Judgment of Defendant Moran in her Individual Capacity, at 8.\n      Section 3617, however, prohibits interference with the housing\nrights of the mentally disabled. See 24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3) (stating\nthat § 3617 prohibits the dismissal of an employee based on the\nemployee’s effort to provide rental housing to a person with a handicap);\nsee also 42 U.S.C. § 3617 (prohibiting interference with       efforts to\nassist others in enjoying rights established under § 3604); 42 U.S.C. §\n3604(f) (prohibiting discrimination based on renter’s handicap); 42\nU.S.C. § 3602(h)(1),(3) (defining handicapped person as person with\nsubstantially limiting mental impairment or person regarded as such).\nBecause Moran did not dispute that Gonzalez resisted Moran’s orders to\n“skip” individuals on the housing waiting list, Moran’s admission that\nshe ordered Gonzalez to skip an individual based on that person’s mental\ncondition tends to support, rather than refute, Gonzalez’s claim that\nMoran fired her “in retaliation of her complaints and refusal to\nparticipate in the discriminatory rental practices of the Defendants.”\nR1-15, Amended Complaint, ¶ 30, at 7-8.\n54\n  See R1-37, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Opposition to Defendant Moran’s\nMotions for Summary Judgment, at 3 (“The facts, as relied upon by the\nCourt for the purposes of these motions, should be as they have been\npresented by the Plaintiff in her Amended Complaint and the Affidavit\n\n                                     36\n\fevidence.      First, Gonzalez testified that Moran directed her to\n\nengage in actions that, in Gonzalez’s view, violated the anti-\n\ndiscrimination laws that apply to public housing programs.55\n\n        Second,    attached    to   the    affidavit   and   incorporated   by\n\nreference therein56 was the letter written by Gonzalez to Moran on\n\nSeptember 28, 1995.57         According to that letter, Moran complained\n\nwhen Gonzalez attempted to place a white woman with a black child\n\nin a vacant apartment and tried to place an elderly black man in a\n\nvacant unit.58       Of particular note, Gonzalez also stated in the\n\nletter that Gonzalez’s refusal to discriminate was a central cause\n\nof the arguments between Moran and Gonzalez.59\n\n        Third, attached to the affidavit and incorporated by reference\n\ntherein60 was the letter written by Gonzalez to Puccio on October\n\n9, 1995.61    In that letter, Gonzalez stated that during August and\n\nSeptember 1995, Gonzalez “confront[ed]” Moran about the fact that\n\n\n\nattached to ‘Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment’ . . . .”) (footnote omitted).\n55\n  See R1-20, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, Ex.

Indeed, the record suggests that\n\nGonzalez’s refusal to follow Moran’s discriminatory directives was\n\na central cause of the problems between them.                     Moreover, when\n\nGonzalez, in the context of a wide-ranging personal complaint about\n\noffice     conditions,    stated    in    writing   that    Moran   was   forcing\n\nGonzalez to discriminate,64 Moran’s displeasure with Gonzalez’s\n\nrecalcitrance probably sharpened even further. Viewed in the light\n\nmost     favorable   to   Gonzalez,      the   evidence    thus   suggests   that\n\nGonzalez’s termination represented the culmination of a long-\n\nstanding      and    intensifying        disagreement      in     which   Moran’s\n\ndiscriminatory directives played an important role, and that Moran\n\n\n62\n     See id., Ex.

As a reason for\n\nGonzalez’s termination, the letter cites Gonzalez’s “criticism of\n\norders, rules and policies,”65 and Moran has brought forth no\n\nevidence showing that the phrase “orders, rules and policies”\n\nrefers   to   anything    other   than   Moran’s    own   discriminatory\n\ndirectives.\n\n     Accordingly,    we   hold    that   Gonzalez   has   brought   forth\n\nsufficient evidence to create the reasonable inference that Moran\n\nfired her based in significant part on Gonzalez’s efforts to rent\n\npublic housing in a non-racially discriminatory manner.        Because a\n\nreasonable official in Moran’s position should have known that such\n\nan action was unlawful, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 3604(b), 3617; 24 C.F.R.\n\n§ 100.400(c)(3), we affirm the district court’s decision to deny\n\nMoran’s motion for summary judgment on this claim.\n\n                                    V.\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE the district court’s\n\ndenial of summary judgment to Moran in her individual capacity as\n\nto Gonzalez’s section 1983 claim; we AFFIRM the district court’s\n\ndenial of summary judgment to Moran in her individual capacity as\n\nto Gonzalez’s section 3617 claim; and we REMAND the case for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n65\n  See R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support of Motion for Summary Judgment\nof Defendant Moran in her Individual Capacity, Ex.

I have done more than\n         I am supposed to do for this business and everyone is a witness to that.\n\n[¶ 3]    You are the kind of person that whenever things go fine, you are happy, but when things get a little blurry, you\n         turn into a very critical, and verbally abusive person.\n\n[¶ 4]    In two years that I have been here, I have seen and also received a lot of verbal abuse along with my co-\n         workers. You had called my co-workers words and names that I can not even write in this letter.\n\n[¶ 5]    It is very sad to say that you have no consideration for your staff. All you know is to exploit people and then\n         if someone complaints you threaten us we will loose our jobs, because you happen to be the “Executive\n         Director”.\n\n[¶ 6]    I suppose you were not happy for what you did to me on September 20, 1995, on Thursday, September 21, 1995\n         you had sent me to Charleston Park in Alva and without even saying a good morning to me you gave me a\n         letter, a reprimend and asked me to sign it, which I refused because it is a lie. You also started yelling at me\n         because I refused to sign the reprimend. You wrote in the reprimend that you will not tolerate my violent\n         outburst, that I have a problem with language interpretation. You needed to write in the reprimend that my\n         outburst was provoked by you and you had also said I have a problem following Rules and Regulations, that\n         is correct too, but it is because you do not follow Rules and Regulations, you changed them, if it is not on a\n         daily basis, it is on a weekly basis, which causes so much confusion not only to me, also to every person in this\n         office.\n\n[¶ 7]    You had also said to me that you made me from a Receptionist to a Property Manager, well I have learned\n         everything on my own, because you had never trained me or have anyone training me at this job. I had to work\n         my way up all by myself, learning from my mistakes. If you look at my file when I put an application to work\n         here, I brought you reference letters from my other jobs. I was not a nobody when I came to work here. All\n         I have learned from this place is to agravate myself day after they, because of the things that I see and hear.\n\n[¶ 8]    I never know who you will want me to house even if they are next on the waiting list. If it’s a white girl with\n         a black baby, you complain, if we have a vacancie on the lederly site, you do not want me to put a black person\n         on that site, if the client has HIV, you complain, if it’s a white that has not been in the job for too long, you do\n         not want me to house them, because it will become a negative rent.\n\n[¶ 9]    If you remember, that the times that you and me had argue is because you had forced me to discriminate, or rip-\n         off people (meaning that if someone moves after the 5th. of the months, you do not want me to pro-rate the rent\n         and charge them from the 1st. of the month.\n\n[¶ 10]   You can not keep blaming me for this place starting to fall apart. You owe all this to yourself, because you are\n         the one that bend the rules all the time. More examples are, if I give a tenant a violation, which is part of my\n         job and the tenant does not like it, they come to you and then you will not back me up, causing for the tenants\n\n\n66\n  See R1-20, Plaintiff’s Memorandum in Support of Motion for Partial\nSummary Judgment, Ex. A, Attach. 3; R1-33, Memorandum of Law in Support\nof Motion for Summary Judgment of Defendant Moran in her Individual\nCapacity, Ex. B.\n\n                                                            40\n\f         not to respect my position. Another good example will be last year when I did the re-certification inspections\n         that I had found Ms. Loretta Huff with a cat inside the unit. After I mentioned the tenant she needed to get rid\n         of the pet, she called you and then you called me in your office to tell me to “stay away from the elderly site”.\n         A few months ago you received a complaint from a tenant at the elderly site about so many cats around, and\n         then you wanted me to take care of the problem. There are plenty of violation over on that site, but if I try to\n         do my job, is either you get upset or your good friend Mr. Edward Kross (board member that you\n         recommended), will come to this office and complaint about me doing my job and I will be asked to back out.\n\n[¶ 11]   Also, when Mr. Willie Christmas, tenant from Charleston Park, Alva took you to Legal Aid, you told Legal Aid\n         that the eviction was done while you were on vacation, trying to blame the mistake on me, but what you forgot\n         is that I do not process evictions unless you order me, and also you were the one that singed all the paperwork\n         before you left on vacation. Here again, the mistake was made, because the bookeping department gives the\n         notices for eviction out and then you do not file thru with them. First tenants have no respect for eviction\n         notices and that is why we keep loosing money all the time.\n\n[¶ 12]   You also drive the company car, and most of the time is not available for the rest of the staff that do inspections,\n         banck deposits, etc. Libby has to use her car to do FSS inspections or go to meetings, Sylvia has to use her car\n         to do the bank deposits, and I have to use my car all the time for inspections and to go to Alva. If I tell you I\n         need the car to do an inspection, is either you tell me to reschedule for another day or will give me 10 minutes\n         to come back, which it is impossible. You get very upset if someone uses the car after 3:00 P.M., because you\n         want the car for you to leave a 3:30 P.M. most of the time. We do not consider that a company car, it is your\n         personal car.\n\n[¶ 13]   Also, I had reported to you all the complaints we had received of Mr. Richard Wombwell, the Senior Aide you\n         have at Barrett Park. There are plenty of verbal and written complaints against Mr. Wombwell about him being\n         unrespectful to tenants, fresh with the spanish married women, and even denied the use of the LCHA lawn\n         mower to the tenants he does not like, or timed them with same. You said he was going to help me with the\n         tenants problems, collecting rent, delivering notices and rent receipts, give out violations to the tenants, things\n         that he has denied to do, but on the other hand you had approved a lot of social activities, that he uses LCHA\n         money to buy refreshments and candy all the time. He also got a brand new TV and a VCR with LCHA money\n         for entertainment. I reported to you the time Mr. Wombwell asked me if I could give violations to his\n         “buddies” so they would not get mad at him. Today, I had to write you a complaint about Mr. Wombwell\n         asking the bookeeper if I still work for LCHA, which make me think why someone that does not even work\n         for LCHA, because he is an employee for Dr. Ella Piper, knows if I am going to be fired or not. On the other\n         hand I heard the bookeeper suplying him with all the updates about me.\n\n[¶ 14]   The communication problems that I have with staff members, maintenance members, are all caused by you\n         because you are a terrible instigator among all of us in this office and that is very sad. You had always make\n         us feel we do not worth anything and nothing is appreciated.\n\n[¶ 15]   You keep giving us a miserable raise if any every year, because there is no money, but then you went ahead\n         and bought yourself a new computer that you hardly look at it, the TV and VCR for Barrett Park, to keep Mr.\n         Richard Wombwell happy and also a few more toys.\n\n[¶ 16]   Writing this type of letter is not me, but you had pushed me to do it, you had been very unfair with me and my\n         co-workers and that LCHA could be a wonderful place to work if things are done the right way and if we could\n         accept our mistakes, starting with you, instead of putting the blame on somebody else.\n\n[¶ 17]   You had also mentioned to some staff members about the money I asked you to lend me to buy my car and I\n         need to remind you that God is my witness I have never asked you for that money, because I did not know that\n         well to do something like that. You offered me that money and told me that I could pay you anyway I could\n         and I accepted and also wrote my debt to you in a piece of paper that I signed, compromising myself to give\n         $100.00 every month. I have done this every months, but since I had a problem this month and could not give\n         you any money this month, you even called me at my house on Tuesday, September 26, 1995 around 7:00 P.M.\n         to asked to borrow the money and made me feel real bad. I do not know what kind of person you think I am,\n         but even that I did not asked for that money, I will pay you every single dollar you lent me, because I happen\n\n\n                                                            41\n\f         to be a decent and grateful person. Even that this job and you have tried to change me, I’m still a good person\n         inside, that only fights back when she gets pushed or abused.\n\n[¶ 18]   I will like for you to take some time and think of all the good things and the good atmosphere we could have\n         in this office, instead of creating this miserable environment.\n\n[¶ 19]   The new Job Description you had given me on Tuesday, September 26, 1995, I will consider it as a revision\n         to the first one you gave me, because I know the things that you added to it, is because of the argument we had\n         on September 20, 1995, because when you gave me the letter changing my title you never mentioned about\n         giving me a new job description.\n\n         Sincerely,\n         /s/L. Gonzalez\n         Luz N. Gonzalez\n         Property Manager\n\n         cc:\n\n[¶ 20]   NOTE: I need to mention that when you hired me, it was for Pine Echo (Family and Elderly sites) and Barrett\n         Park. When you fired Richard Brevick, you had asked me if I could help you collecting the rent and I even\n         expressed to you that I will do only that because I knew nothing about Farmers Home Housing, but I ended\n         doing all the work and now you blamed me for the vacancies overthere too. That is why you decided to add\n         Charleston Park to the new job description.\n\n\n\n\n                                                          42\n\fBLACK, Circuit Judge, specially concurring:\n\n     In   part   IV.B.   of   the   opinion,   the   Court   holds   that   a\n\ngovernment official who implements a plan to discriminate against\n\nblack persons in public housing and fires a subordinate employee\n\nfor refusing to discriminate pursuant to the plan has no qualified\n\nimmunity.   I completely agree.1      I write separately because of the\n\nexplanation given for today’s decision.\n\n     Part IV.B. of the opinion sets out two alternative bases for\n\nfinding clearly established law to overcome qualified immunity:\n\nfirst, the plain language of 42 U.S.C. § 3617; and second, the\n\nclear command of 24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3), which interprets 42\n\nU.S.C. § 3617.    Section 3617 is a very general statute and is not\n\nsufficiently fact-specific to satisfy the requirements of Lassiter\n\nv.

As this Circuit has made clear, it is the\n\n“exceptional case where the words of a federal statute or federal\n\nconstitutional provision will be specific enough to establish the\n\nlaw applicable to particular circumstances clearly and to overcome\n\nqualified immunity even in the absence of case law.”           Santamorena\n\nv.

Neither    party   cited   24   C.F.R.\n\n§ 100.400(c)(3) in the briefs to this Court or the district court.\n\nWe   requested   supplemental    briefing   as   to   whether    24   C.F.R.\n\n§ 100.400(c)(3) even applies to the facts of this case and were not\n\ninformed of any United States Supreme Court or Eleventh Circuit\n\ncase in which 24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3) is mentioned.\n\n      Even if a regulation can be the basis of clearly established\n\nlaw, neither this Circuit nor the Supreme Court has ever so held.\n\nMoreover, I doubt that a regulation which on its face purports only\n\nto be an executive department’s “interpretation of [unlawful]\n\nconduct” can be the basis of clearly established law.2                In the\n\ncontext of qualified immunity, I believe courts should not give\n\nmuch weight to executive branch regulations interpreting statutes\n\nwhen the regulations have not been held by a court to be accurate\n\ninterpretations. At any rate, 24 C.F.R. § 100.400(c)(3) should not\n\nbe deemed the source of clearly established law in this case, where\n\nthe Court today recognizes its application for the first time.\n\n      The purpose of qualified immunity is to protect government\n\nofficials from liability for conduct they could not reasonably have\n\nknown was unlawful.          Much of federal constitutional law and\n\nstatutory law is unpredictable and unclear in its application to\n\nparticular circumstances.       Thus, as the Court states, we require\n\n\n2\n The regulation “provides the Department’s interpretation of the conduct\nthat is unlawful under section 818 of the Fair Housing Act.” 24 C.F.R.\n§ 100.400(a).\n\n                                     44\n\fmaterially similar case law or a very specific statute before\n\nsaying that a government official should have known her conduct was\n\nunlawful.3   There is no specific pre-existing case law applicable\n\nto this case.\n\n     On the other hand, we have recognized that in the extremely\n\nrare case a government official’s conduct may be so egregious, in\n\nfact evil, as to be obviously contrary to federal law, so that no\n\ncase law or statute needs to have recognized previously that\n\nmaterially similar conduct is unlawful. The facts alleged here, if\n\ntrue, make this that extremely rare case.         More than a century\n\nafter the Civil War and more than a quarter century after the great\n\ncrusade for civil rights for black persons in this country, no\n\ngovernment housing official could reasonably believe that she may\n\nlawfully discriminate against black persons on the basis of race,\n\nor that she might punish another public official for refusing to\n\ndiscriminate in the course of her official duties against black\n\npersons on the basis of race.\n\n\n\n\n3\n  See Opinion at ___ (“Ordinarily, a plaintiff who seeks to overcome a\nstate official’s affirmative defense of qualified immunity must cite case\nlaw, in force at the time of the defendant’s actions, that would have\nmade it absolutely clear that the defendant’s conduct violated federal\nlaw [and] we have acknowledged the possibility that some federal\nstatutory provisions will be sufficiently clear on their own to provide\ndefendants with fair notice of their obligations under the law.”).\n\n                                   45\n\f</pre>",
