A LCALA,\nJ., concurred.\n\n                                        OPINION\n\n       On November 12, 2013, a jury convicted Franklin Davis of capital murder for the\n\nSeptember 2012 murder of Shania Gray in the course of committing or attempting to commit\n\nobstruction.1 Pursuant to the jury’s answers to the special issues set forth in Texas Code of\n\n\n\n       1\n           TEX . PENAL CODE § 19.03(a)(2).\n\f                                                                                  DAVIS—2\n\nCriminal Procedure Article 37.071, §§ 2(b) and 2(e),2 the trial judge sentenced Davis to\n\ndeath.3 Direct appeal to this Court is automatic.4 Davis raises forty-eight points of error.\n\nAfter reviewing Davis’s points of error, we find them to be without merit. Consequently, we\n\naffirm the trial court’s judgment and sentence of death.\n\n       In his eleventh and twenty-fourth points of error, Davis challenges the legal\n\nsufficiency of the evidence to support his conviction and the jury’s affirmative answer to the\n\nfuture dangerousness special issue. We shall address these claims first. The remaining\n\npoints of error will be addressed in the order presented in his brief.\n\n                                      STATEMENT OF FACTS\n\n       In September 2010, when Shania Gray was fourteen years old, her mother, Sherri\n\nGray-James, arranged a babysitting job for her at the request of an acquaintance named\n\nJennifer Dibrell. Gray began babysitting Dibrell’s three children after school. One of those\n\nthree children was Davis and Dibrell’s daughter, Dezire. Gray-James would drop Gray off\n\nat Dibrell’s apartment each time she was scheduled to babysit. In March 2011, Gray-James\n\nnoticed some text messages on Gray’s phone from a person named “Wish.” Gray-James had\n\nmet Davis and knew that “Wish” was his nickname. In one of the text messages, Wish asked\n\nGray why she was not coming to babysit anymore. In another message, Wish stated, “That’s\n\n\n\n       2\n           See TEX . CODE CRIM . PROC. art. 37.071, § 2(g).\n       3\n           Id. art. 37.071, § 2(g).\n       4\n           Id. art. 37.071, § 2(h).\n\f                                                                               DAVIS—3\n\nfoul. So I’m supposed to sit around and wait? Man. Whatever.” Gray responded, “Nope.\n\nYou[’re] getting mad for what?      You got two for the price of one. What [are] you\n\ncomplaining for? Tryna [sic] have your cake and eat it too.” Davis answered, “Just want you\n\nbut can’t fully have you yet.” When Gray-James asked Gray about the messages, Gray\n\nbecame very upset and began crying.\n\n       Gray-James then drove to Dibrell’s apartment with Gray and showed Dibrell the\n\nmessages. Dibrell called Davis and told him that Gray-James was upset about the text\n\nmessages. Gray-James felt that Dibrell reacted in a “nonchalant” manner, and she demanded\n\nto speak with Davis herself. Dibrell instructed her to call him the next day. When Gray-\n\nJames sent Davis a text message the next morning, he responded that Gray was lying. He\n\nclaimed that, when he sent the messages to Gray, he thought that someone was playing a\n\nprank with the phone and did not know he was corresponding with Gray. Gray-James told\n\nDavis that he was the liar and she would go to the police.\n\n       Davis preemptively called the police himself. He told the responding officer that,\n\nwhen Gray texted him, he did not know who it was and he “did not know Shania had a cell\n\nphone.” He said that he was just “playing around” with an unknown correspondent.\n\nHowever, in a later interview with Detective Brandon Snyder, Davis changed his story and\n\nadmitted he knew he was corresponding with Gray. He said that his text message to Gray,\n\nstating that he wanted her, was really intended to inform her that she was “too young” and\n\nthat was why he could not “see her.”\n\f                                                                                   DAVIS—4\n\n       The day after Gray-James talked to Dibrell, Gray was visibly upset and crying at\n\nschool. She confided in two sisters who were her close friends. She told them that she had\n\nbeen babysitting and this “guy” started “messing with her, touching her and stuff like that.”\n\nGray told the older sister that the sexual encounters had started out “as a habit,” but the man\n\nhad gotten “rough” with her. She told her that he threw her on the bed, threatened her with\n\na “[s]amurai sword,” and told her “If you tell, I’m going to kill you and your family.” The\n\nsisters convinced her to come home with them after school and tell their mother what had\n\nhappened. Gray then revealed to their mother that she had been sexually assaulted multiple\n\ntimes while she was babysitting. Their mother convinced her that she needed to tell her own\n\nmother. Gray then told Gray-James about the sexual assaults.\n\n       Gray-James contacted the school resource officer at Gray’s school, Horn High School.\n\nShe also took Gray to the Mesquite Police Department and met with Detective Snyder.\n\nSubsequently, she took Gray to the Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center (DCAC) for a\n\nvideotaped interview and then to the Children’s Medical Center for a physical examination.\n\n       In the DCAC interview, Gray described four separate sexual assaults in which Davis\n\npenetrated her vagina when she fourteen years old—three at Dibrell’s apartment and one at\n\nDavis’s apartment.    Snyder obtained an analysis of the content of Gray’s phone and\n\ndiscovered that she had Davis’s birthday listed in her phone’s calendar. He also viewed the\n\ntext message exchange between Wish and Gray that had distressed Gray-James.\n\n       Later, Davis was arrested for sexual assault and began having scheduled court dates.\n\f                                                                                 DAVIS—5\n\nGray was planning to testify against Davis in his trial. Several months passed, during which\n\nGray’s family prepared to move from Mesquite to Carrollton, Texas, and Gray started\n\nattending Hebron High School in Carrollton.\n\n       On September 6, 2012, Gray informed her mother that she was going to attend after-\n\nschool tutoring for her physics class, and Gray-James planned to pick her up at school after\n\nthe tutoring. During the tutoring session, Gray sent a text message to her mother telling her\n\nthat she was almost done. Gray-James parked in front of the school at around 4:00 p.m. and\n\nwaited for Gray, but Gray never came out to meet her. Gray-James called and sent text\n\nmessages to Gray repeatedly. She went to a nearby Starbucks and used her laptop to try to\n\nlocate Gray’s phone with no success. She returned to the school and found that the physics\n\nclassroom where Gray had gone for tutoring was locked and dark. She contacted the physics\n\nteacher, who stated that Gray had left tutoring when it ended at 4:15 p.m. A group of\n\nteachers and coaches helped Gray-James search the school and the nearby football stadium,\n\nbut they found no sign of Gray.\n\n       Gray-James contacted the Hebron High School resource officer, Officer Forest Cole\n\nLangston. Officer Langston became very concerned when he spoke to the Horn High School\n\nresource officer and learned that Gray was the named victim on four sexual assault\n\nindictments and Davis was the defendant charged in those cases. Officer Langston reviewed\n\nsurveillance footage showing that Gray had exited Hebron High School through a back door\n\nnormally used by coaches. A still photo from a surveillance camera showed a gray Dodge\n\f                                                                                DAVIS—6\n\nStratus parked nearby. Further investigation indicated that this car matched the description\n\nof a vehicle owned by Davis’s wife, Jawanna Arrington Davis (hereafter “Arrington”).\n\n       Meanwhile, on the evening of September 6th, Davis picked Arrington up after work\n\ndriving her Stratus. She noticed a strong smell of cologne in the car and wondered if Davis\n\nwas trying to cover up the smell of a woman. They drove to the hospital because Davis said\n\nthat he had injured his arm at the gym. However, he only waited about ten minutes and then\n\nleft before seeing a doctor. They went home and took a bubble bath together. Arrington said\n\nDavis was being more affectionate than normal and they “were intimate” that night.\n\n       The missing person case was assigned to Detective Dena Williams of the Carrollton\n\nPolice Department. Gray-James gave Williams access to Gray’s cell phone records and the\n\npasswords to her social media accounts. Officers discovered that the phone number that\n\nGray had communicated with immediately before and after she sent the last text message to\n\nher mother had a 903 area code. Gray-James did not recognize this number. Williams\n\nobtained call records for both Gray’s phone and the 903 phone number.\n\n       Detective Snyder testified that he tried to determine who had purchased the phone\n\nwith the 903 number but could not uncover this information. However, he determined that\n\nthe 903 phone number had contacted another number on the day of Gray’s disappearance.\n\nOfficers called this number and discovered that it belonged to Shakeema Morsley, a\n\ncoworker and friend of Arrington’s. Morsley gave police full access to her phone and text\n\nmessages. They discovered that the person using the 903 phone number had asked Morsley\n\f                                                                                 DAVIS—7\n\nto tell him where her new apartment was located. He had refused to tell Morsley his name,\n\nbut provided hints to his identity. Based on the various contextual clues, Morsley deduced\n\nthat this person was Davis. She refused to give him her new address.\n\n       Morsley also gave Arrington’s phone number to Detective Williams. Williams called\n\nArrington. Within a few minutes, Arrington handed the phone to Davis and he spoke with\n\nWilliams. Williams told him she was investigating a missing child. Davis acted very\n\nconcerned. Williams asked Davis if he knew anything about the 903 phone number. He\n\ndenied any knowledge of it.\n\n       Officers conducted surveillance on Davis and Arrington’s apartment and the Dodge\n\nStratus, which was parked in the apartment complex parking lot. While officers were\n\nwatching, Davis exited the apartment and began walking toward the officers.            They\n\nhandcuffed him for their safety because he was known to be a bodybuilder and to carry a\n\npistol. They walked with him back to the apartment because he said his knees were hurting\n\nand mosquitoes were biting him. They removed the handcuffs and requested that he follow\n\nthem to the police department to discuss Gray. Davis agreed to come with them and,\n\naccompanied by Arrington, he drove to the police department in the Dodge Stratus.\n\n       Williams interviewed Davis at the police department. Davis said that he felt that Gray\n\nhad falsely accused him of sexual assault. He told Williams that he had text messages from\n\nGray on his phone proving that she had lied about the sexual assaults. He denied having any\n\nknowledge of the 903 phone number or Gray’s current location and denied having any recent\n\f                                                                                DAVIS—8\n\ncommunications with Morsley.\n\n       While Davis was being interviewed, Arrington gave consent for the police to retain\n\nher Dodge Stratus for processing. Canine handlers brought a “cadaver dog” (trained to\n\nsearch for the scent of a decaying body) and a dog trained to alert to Gray’s scent to the\n\nparking lot at the police station. Both dogs displayed a positive reaction to the Dodge\n\nStratus. At some point after the interview with Williams, Davis was arrested on the basis of\n\noutstanding traffic ticket warrants.\n\n       Detectives Edward Teniente and Jeremy Chevallier also assisted with the\n\ninvestigation. They received cell phone tower data for Davis’s T-Mobile phone, which\n\nshowed that his phone was at or near Hebron High School at 4:01 p.m. on September 6th,\n\nwhich was around the time that Gray had disappeared. Davis indicated to officers at the jail\n\nthat he wished to speak with detectives. Teniente and Chevallier brought Davis into an\n\ninterview room and read him his Miranda5 rights. In this interview, the detectives informed\n\nDavis about the cell tower data. Davis admitted that he had been speaking with Gray on the\n\nphone and recording their conversations to document discrepancies between what she said\n\non the phone and what she said in the police reports. He continued to deny having had any\n\ncontact with Gray on the day she disappeared. Davis was returned to the jail after this\n\ninterview.\n\n       About an hour and a half later, Davis indicated that he wanted to talk to Detective\n\n\n\n       5\n           Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\n\f                                                                                    DAVIS—9\n\nChevallier again. Chevallier and Teniente retrieved Davis from the jail for a third recorded\n\ninterview.   They asked him if he remembered the rights Chevallier had read to him\n\npreviously. Davis said he did and then stated:\n\n       A lot of the information that y’all say y’all have, it’s not correct . . . .\n       Honestly, I felt like that with a lot of the information that you was [sic] saying\n       to me, that I would have been able to, been able to walk but I wouldn’t be able\n       to live with myself because I done it [sic].\n\n       Davis admitted to the officers that he had met Gray at the high school in the parking\n\nlot on the day of the offense. He explained that, about two and one-half months before the\n\nday he met Gray at the school, he adopted a false identity and began communicating with\n\nGray using a “go phone” with a 903 phone number. Davis had selected a young man’s\n\nprofile photo from Facebook that he thought Gray would like. He told Gray that this was a\n\nphoto of him and his nickname was “D.” Davis told Gray that he (“D”) had seen her on\n\nFacebook and he was “looking for a new friend, someone to get to know.” He assured her\n\nit was “nothing sexual.” Davis told the officers that he used this “D” alias to have telephone\n\nconversations with Gray on the go phone and recorded those conversations using his T-\n\nMobile phone.\n\n       Posing as “D,” Davis persuaded Gray to trust him. He induced her to talk about the\n\nfirst time she had sex and other personal matters. She eventually talked about the sexual\n\nassaults. Davis insisted to the detectives that Gray’s account to “D” of the sexual assaults\n\nwas not the same as the account in the police report. He said that he felt he got what he\n\n“needed” for his trial from the recorded conversations with Gray. He told the officers that\n\f                                                                                    DAVIS—10\n\nhe had not talked to Gray in a while, but then he decided he wanted to talk to her “face-to-\n\nface” and renewed contact with her on September 5th.\n\n       Davis recalled that, when Gray first saw him at the school on September 6th, she said,\n\n“Oh, shit.” He said he reassured her that he was not going to hurt her and she got into the\n\ncar with him voluntarily. He then drove to a park area. He asked her “why she [had] lied and\n\nsaid things that she did to get [him] in trouble.” Davis said Gray responded that her “mama\n\nmade her do it.” He said, “I told her I had been sitting outside her house and my demons was\n\n[sic] weighing on me so bad to where I wanted to kill everybody in that house.” He said that\n\nhe called this part of him “Wish,” which was “the dark side of me that I let go years ago.”\n\n       Davis told the officers that he and Gray got out of the car at the park and started\n\nwalking down a trail. He said that he was “trying to tell her how much she had fucked up\n\n[his] whole life with the lies that she told.” He said they walked off the trail, and he pulled\n\nthe gun out. He shot Gray, but he was not sure where he had hit her. She fell into the water.\n\nHe said Gray lay in the water for a second, “trying to act like she was dead.” He shot her\n\nagain. He said she cried and said, “[W]hy Wish?” He said he threw her jacket down to her\n\nto get her out of the water. He explained: “I wanted to stop but . . . I felt like if I would have\n\nstopped she would have told what had happened . . . . So I told her to lay [sic] down on the\n\ngrass. And she laid [sic] down on the grass . . . . I put my foot on her neck and I pressed\n\ndown.” Davis said Gray grabbed his leg for about three seconds, then let go. He said, “I\n\nasked her to forgive me.” He then rolled her body into the water and left the park. He said\n\f                                                                               DAVIS—11\n\nhe drove out of the parking lot and then pulled back in because he wanted to go to help her,\n\nbut he knew it was too late. He told the detectives that he was sorry for what he had done.\n\n       Detective Teniente asked Davis if he always carried a gun. He shook his head “no.”\n\nDavis said he initially obtained the gun to use it on himself. He was not sure when he\n\ndecided to use it on Gray. Davis said he threw the gun out the window while driving down\n\nthe highway. He said he also threw Gray’s cell phone and the go phone out the window. He\n\nsaid he left Gray’s backpack with her body.\n\n       At the end of the interview, Gray agreed to accompany the officers to locate Gray’s\n\nbody. He rode with the officers in an unmarked vehicle. In the meantime, a bicycle officer\n\nhad already found Gray’s body floating in the Trinity River and found her backpack nearby.\n\nWhen Chevallier and Teniente asked Davis to take them “to where it happened,” he led them\n\nto the place where the crime scene team was already in the process of recovering Gray’s\n\nbody. He also led them to the locations where he had thrown the gun into a pond, where he\n\nhad thrown Gray’s phone into another pond, and where he had disposed of his shoes in a\n\nsewer drain.\n\n       The autopsy revealed that Gray’s body had undergone a substantial amount of\n\ndecomposition while floating in the water. She had been shot once in the shoulder and once\n\nin the back. She had further suffered forceful asphyxia to her neck. The medical examiner\n\nrecovered one bullet lodged in her body. The examiner ruled that the cause of Gray’s death\n\nwas homicidal violence, including the two gunshot wounds, asphyxia due to neck\n\f                                                                                      DAVIS—12\n\ncompression, and possible drowning.\n\n       The police also located a Diamondback .380 pistol at the edge of a pond, Gray’s phone in\n\nanother pond, and Davis’s shoes in a sewer drain, where Davis told them they would be. Davis’s\n\ngo phone was never found. A senior forensic scientist specializing in firearms testified that the\n\nDiamondback .380 pistol was compared to a bullet and two cartridge casings found near Gray’s\n\nbody, as well as the bullet recovered from her body. His analysis showed that the Diamondback .380\n\npistol fired the bullets and ejected the casings.\n\n       On September 9, 2012, after Detective Williams viewed the autopsy, she received a message\n\nthat Davis wanted to speak with detectives again. In this fourth interview, Davis told them where\n\nhe disposed of a soiled “Scarface” blanket from the car, the sweat pants he was wearing at the time\n\nof the shooting, and the magazine for his gun. He again described the killing and how he had\n\ncontacted Gray using his go phone pretending to be a different person. Davis continued to insist that\n\nhe had never had sex with Gray. He said, when he picked Gray up on September 6th, she told him\n\nshe would tell the “truth,” meaning she would recant the sexual assault charges. Williams expressed\n\ndisbelief in Davis’s story. She asked him why he would kill Gray if she was planning to recant the\n\ncharges. Davis simply responded, “That’s what happened.” He asked Williams if “[t]his was a\n\ncapital murder.” After Williams confirmed that the charge would be capital murder, Davis stated,\n\n“It should be.”\n\n       Secret Service Special Agent Jeff Shaffer used a digital forensic tool to analyze Davis’s T-\n\nMobile cell phone. He discovered that the 903 phone number for the go phone used to call Gray and\n\nMorsley on September 6th was listed as a contact called “Throw Away” in Davis’s T-Mobile phone\n\nand then later deleted. The phone also contained a photo of Gray in a bikini top and shorts which\n\f                                                                                      DAVIS—13\nwas downloaded on July 13, 2012, and again on September 5, 2012.\n\n       Forensic analysis revealed that Davis had used his phone to log into Facebook under the\n\nname “Jazmine Brown.” Using the Brown profile, he searched for and located Gray’s Facebook\n\npage. Davis (posing as Brown) sent Gray a message on Facebook on May 1, 2012, saying “Hey,\n\nShania, I’m new in the city and trying to find a cool female to befriend without the drama. I like to\n\nshop my butt off. LOL . . . . Get back at me if we have some things in common.”\n\n       On July 10, 2012, Davis hired a new defense attorney for the sexual assault case. On July\n\n18, 2012, he used his T-Mobile phone to search the Internet for “Can you record a person without\n\nthem knowing in Texas” and “[b]est way to get off of a sexual assault charge.” Also on July 18th,\n\nDavis searched for “with no proof that you did the murder can you still be held in jail[?]” The next\n\nday, he searched for “can you voice record of [sic] minor over the phone in [T]exas” and “can tape\n\nrecorded conversation with a person story changing get you off a charge.” He performed similar\n\nsearches on July 23, 2012. He called and exchanged text messages with Gray hundreds of times\n\nbetween July 17, 2012, and August 1, 2012, using the go phone.\n\n       On August 24, 2012, the trial judge formally scheduled Davis’s sexual-assault trial for\n\nOctober 29, 2012. On August 27th, Davis installed on his T-Mobile phone an application called\n\n“Fake Call & SMS & Call Logs.” On the same day, text messages appearing to be from Gray’s\n\nphone were created on Davis’s phone, including the following messages:\n\n       Sorry I li3d on u but my momma mad3 m3 do it. If we go to court ima t3ll th3m u\n       never touched me. My momma go b3 mad @ m3 but fuck that bitch I can’t stand her\n       no ways. Please 4give me. . . .\n\n       I beli3v3 if I t3ll the truth sh3 will punish m3 for a long tim3 and I want to b3 able\n       to play basketball.\n\nAndrew Hoog, a mobile forensics security expert, testified that he used specialized technology to\n\f                                                                                     DAVIS—14\nanalyze Davis’s T-Mobile phone. Hoog determined that the above application was used to create\n\nthese messages on Davis’s phone.\n\n       On August 28, 2012, Davis used his T-Mobile phone to search for gun shows. On August\n\n29, 2012, he made five calls using his T-Mobile phone to a contact named “Chris.” The next day,\n\nhe used his T-Mobile phone to search for prices on a Diamondback .380 pistol. Police used the\n\nserial number on the Diamondback .380 pistol found in the pond and traced the firearm back to a\n\nregistered owner named Christopher Allen. Allen testified that he is the brother of Davis’s ex-\n\ngirlfriend, Linda Crawford. He said that Davis called him around August 28 or 29, 2012, and asked\n\nabout buying a handgun from him. Allen agreed to sell Davis the Diamondback .380 pistol for just\n\nunder $200. He sold the gun to Davis a few days later. Davis paid him in cash.\n\n       On the evening of September 5, 2012, Davis (posing as “D”) used the go phone to contact\n\nGray again. Phone records showed that, when he initiated these new communications with Gray,\n\nthe go phone was “hitting off” a cell tower close to her home. He told Gray, “I miss you” and “When\n\ncan I see you?” Gray asked for a “pic” of “D,” but Davis did not send her a photo. The next\n\nmorning, Davis and Gray continued exchanging text messages. He asked, “What time do you get\n\nhome from school?” Around lunchtime, Davis told her, “I’m going to be in your area today. I owe\n\nyou something too.” She asked, “Do you?” He responded, “Yep money money yeah yeah lol.” She\n\nresponded, “Lol yay.!!!” Twice, he asked whether Gray and her mother would be dropping off her\n\nstepfather that day. She answered, “Nope.” At 1:53 p.m., Davis used his T-Mobile phone to search\n\nfor “hebron high school” and looked up the address of the school in the map “app” on his T-Mobile\n\nphone. He also used the map app to look up Sam Houston Trail Park, where Gray’s body was\n\neventually found.\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—15\n       Around mid-afternoon, Gray told Davis: “You don’t have to come all inside the school.”\n\nShe sent a message to him at 3:46 p.m. asking, “Where are you?” He responded, “Kids park.” At\n\n4:01 p.m. Davis’s T-Mobile phone “hit off” the cell tower that was right next to Hebron High\n\nSchool, indicating that he was close to the school. At around 5:06 p.m., his phone and Gray’s phone\n\nwere both “hitting off” the cell tower near his apartment. After 5:17 p.m., Gray’s phone stopped\n\nreceiving and sending any data, indicating that it was no longer in contact with the network.\n\nSimilarly, after 5:15 p.m., Davis’s go phone stopped sending and receiving data. An expert testified\n\nthat this could happen when a phone was thrown into water.\n\n       Davis’s T-Mobile phone also contained a recorded conversation between Davis (posing as\n\n“D”) and Gray. In this phone conversation, “D” asked Gray, “What about the person with your big\n\nsecret?” She responded, “He’s permanently locked up . . . . he is permanently in jail. We didn’t talk\n\nin the first place.” He asked, “How did he get in jail if y’all [sic] didn’t talk.” She said, “It’s\n\ncomplicated” and told him to change the subject, but he continued to ask her questions about it. He\n\nasked her how he broke the law and she answered, “he committed a crime against me.” He asked,\n\n“He raped you?” She said, “New subject. Damn it.”\n\n       Gray told “D” about her little brother’s autism and severe disabilities. She discussed her\n\nfeelings about her real father, who had died before she was born. Later, she returned to the subject\n\nof the sexual assaults and their impact on her: “What happened, it fucked my mind up [sic]. It really\n\ndid . . . . He got inside my head.” “D” tried to get her to discuss the matter further. Gray said that\n\nshe was about to start therapy for this incident and she really did not want to talk about it. She told\n\nhim that the man who sexually assaulted her was in his late twenties and,\n\n       [He] got into my head. I mean – at first I was going to cover for him [–] that’s how\n       stupid I was. I don’t know what the hell I was thinking. I was going to cover up and\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—16\n       take all the blame. And then my mama caught us . . . . I had a babysitting job and\n       he was the father of the kids I was babysitting . . . . He think[s] he [is] going to run\n       away from that. Not like that. I was a child.\n\n       Gray explained how Davis would come to the apartment and harass her while she was\n\nbabysitting and Dibrell was not there. Gray said Dibrell did not provide adequate clothing, shoes,\n\nor food for the children, so she started taking the children to the store for food whenever she would\n\nbabysit. She said the kids acted so happy when she came to babysit, that she “kind of felt trapped,\n\nlike, like [the] kids wasn’t [sic] going to have what they needed unless I came. And if I did come\n\nover, I [ran] the risk of running into him again.” “D” asked her, “How many times did he sexually\n\nassault you?” She said, “Probably three or four different times.”\n\n       She explained that she knew she would have to testify at the trial if Davis did not plead\n\nguilty. She said she did not want to be at the trial and she wished that he would plead guilty and\n\nmake the case disappear. She felt that her mom was blaming her for what had happened and she,\n\ntoo, began to think that it was her fault. After “D” prodded her for more detail about the assaults,\n\nshe told him about the first time Davis sexually assaulted her. She said Davis told the children to\n\ngo into the other room and not come out and then he “got what he wanted.” She said she was afraid\n\nof Davis so she did not tell anyone about the sexual assaults. She explained that she was intimidated\n\nby Davis, who was a large, muscular bodybuilder who took out his samurai swords and played with\n\nthem in front of her. She also did not tell anyone because she was afraid that people would blame\n\nher. She said that she was a good student but, around the time of the sexual assaults, she could not\n\nconcentrate at school and her grades dropped.\n\n       “D” told Gray a story about his cousin whom, he claimed, a woman falsely accused of rape.\n\nIn his story, the accuser was eventually charged with “false imprisonment” and “they locked her up\n\f                                                                                          DAVIS—17\nthat day.” He asked Gray if Davis had any information about her that he could use to discredit her\n\nin that way. She said Davis did not. She explained to “D” that she had given depositions. He asked\n\nher why she did not just tell everyone that she had lied, so that they would drop the charges. He said\n\nthat, because she was a minor, they would not be able to do anything to her. She said that her parents\n\nhad wanted her to file the charges, and she could not drop them. He suggested that Davis might have\n\na grudge against her and might come after her after he went to “the pen.” Gray simply responded,\n\n“no.” She added that Davis had lied about some text messages. When the phone conversation\n\nended, Gray had not agreed to recant the charges, nor had she stated that she lied about the sexual\n\nassaults.\n\n        After the State presented its case in chief, Davis took the stand in his own defense. Defense\n\ncounsel started off by asking him, “Frank, why is Shania dead?” Davis responded, “Because I killed\n\nher.” Counsel asked, “Why did you kill her?” Davis answered, “Because she ruined my life.” Davis\n\nsaid that Gray had a crush on him because he is a “charmer,” but he insisted that he never had sexual\n\nrelations with Gray. He described having sex one time with Dibrell after he got engaged to\n\nArrington. He said Dibrell had told Gray about this incident. He claimed that Gray’s text message\n\nthat he was trying to “have [his] cake and eat it too” actually referred to him having sex with his wife\n\nand Dibrell.\n\n        Davis further testified that, after he was charged with sexual assault, he lost his job, he could\n\nnot provide for his family, and his wife looked at him like he was “less than a man.” He blamed this\n\nmisfortune on “Shania’s lies.” He was frustrated with his attorney’s lack of efforts on his behalf and\n\ndecided he needed to conduct his own “investigation.” Davis admitted creating the fake Facebook\n\npage in the name of “Jazmine Brown” to try to access Gray’s Facebook page. Gray did not accept\n\f                                                                                      DAVIS—18\nthe friend request from Jazmine Brown, so Davis asked his nephew, Dominique Elkins, for his\n\nFacebook password. Davis sent a friend request to Gray while logged into Facebook as Elkins. Gray\n\naccepted that friend request. Davis then obtained Gray’s mobile phone number from her Facebook\n\npage. He searched on Facebook for a man with an attractive profile picture with light skin and a\n\nmuscular build. He found a young man meeting this description, then sent the man a message from\n\nhis Jazmine Brown alias telling him that a friend (i.e., Gray) might be trying to contact him but he\n\nshould not have any contact with her because she was too young. That night, Davis started sending\n\ntext messages to Gray using a go phone that he had purchased for this purpose. He told Gray through\n\ntext messages that he was the man with light skin and muscular build from Facebook.\n\n       Davis said he and Gray exchanged text messages for a while and then she began calling him.\n\nHe recorded their phone conversations using his T-Mobile phone by setting the go phone on the\n\n“speaker[ ]phone” setting. He recorded about seven conversations, though two or three of them did\n\nnot have much content. He said Gray made statements in their phone conversations that he believed\n\nwere inconsistent with statements she made in the DCAC interview. For example, he said that, on\n\nthe phone, Gray only described three sexual incidents with him, yet she told the DCAC interviewer\n\nthey had sex four times. Also, Gray told him that, when she had sex with him in his apartment, it\n\noccurred in his bedroom, but she told the DCAC interviewer that it occurred in his bathroom. (The\n\nrecord shows that Gray explained in both interviews that Davis’s bathroom was connected to his\n\nbedroom and he came into the bathroom to get her). He also pointed to her statement in the\n\nrecordings that she had had sex for the first time before her first encounter with him.\n\n       Davis said he took his recordings of the phone conversations to his lawyer, whose “judgment\n\nwas kind of iffy” about them. Davis said he decided he wanted to play the recorded phone calls for\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—19\nGray’s parents. He drove to Gray’s house the next day and sat for a while in his car watching Gray\n\nplaying basketball with her little brother at the nearby park. He debated whether to go inside and talk\n\nto Gray’s parents. He called Linda Crawford, the mother of one of his children, and she told him\n\nabout an application that would generate fake text messages. Instead of talking to Gray’s parents,\n\nhe decided to use the application to make some fake text messages from Gray. He decided this\n\nwould give him a little “extra push” to get the prosecutor to dismiss the case against him. He\n\nadmitted creating the false text messages from Gray presented by the State. He said he also\n\nmentioned to Crawford that he wanted to get a gun so he could go to the shooting range. She put\n\nhim in touch with her brother, Chris Allen. Davis bought the Diamondback .380 from Allen about\n\na week before he shot Gray with it.\n\n       Davis also admitted performing the Internet search asking whether a person would stay in\n\njail on a murder charge if investigators could not find the body. Davis stated that he did the last\n\nsearch because of “the thoughts going through [his] head of wanting to do harm to Shania . . . she\n\nruined my life. I wanted to ruin hers.”\n\n       Davis said he shared his thoughts with his wife, Arrington, and she told him it was too much\n\nfor her to “deal with.” He said that was when it really started “eating at” him. He was “thinking\n\nabout hurting [himself], hurting other people,” specifically Gray. He said he drove out to Gray’s\n\nhome on or around September 5th with his new gun, intending to “kill everybody in the house.” He\n\nsat outside for a while and “couldn’t get the thought out of [his] head.” He got out of his car and\n\nwent into their front yard, but he did not go inside. He thought about Gray’s innocent little brother\n\nwith his health issues. Davis decided against killing them and drove home.\n\n       Davis said he renewed contact with Gray around that time using the go phone and posing as\n\f                                                                                      DAVIS—20\n“D.” Davis explained the gap in their communications by telling Gray that he had been in school\n\nand had turned off his phone to focus on his studies. He said he was “speaking of money so she\n\nwould want to meet up” with him. He arranged to meet her after school at Hebron High School.\n\nThey agreed to meet at the parking lot by the tennis courts. Davis said that, when Gray came out of\n\nthe school and saw him instead of “D,” she “froze up” and said, “Oh, shit.” He approached her and\n\nassured her he was not going to hurt her. She walked with him to his car and got into the passenger\n\nseat. He started the car and pulled away. She objected, saying that her mother was waiting for her\n\non the other side of the school. Davis said he continued driving because he wanted to kill her. He\n\nplaced the gun between his legs while he was driving.\n\n        Davis further testified that he took Gray to Sam Houston Trail Park. He ordered Gray to\n\ndelete the text message exchanges with “D” and then turn her phone off, and she complied. They\n\nsat in the car for a while and he berated her for having a happy life. Davis said he was thinking of\n\nhow he was raped by both his grandfather and his brother and how his youngest daughter had holes\n\nin her shoes because he could not provide for her. He told Gray to leave her phone in the car and\n\nmade her walk down the slope toward the river, and then he shot her. He was aiming for her head.\n\nShe fell into the water, and then he shot her again. He walked down the slope to make sure she was\n\ndead. She asked, “Why, Wish[?]” and told him that the right side of her body was going numb. He\n\nthrew her the end of her jacket and pulled her out of the water, injuring his tricep muscle in the\n\nprocess. He told her to lie down, then he stepped on her neck and held his foot there. She briefly\n\nreached up and touched his ankle and then her hand fell. He rolled her into the water and then he\n\nleft.\n\n        Davis described the four police interviews he gave. He admitted that he lied in the first two\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—21\ninterviews and that he continued to lie about the fake text messages throughout all the interviews.\n\nThe defense presented two recordings of statements Davis made to the media. In these media\n\nrecordings, Davis tearfully admitted that he murdered Gray. He blamed the murders on a part of him\n\ncalled “Wish,” which he described as a kind of evil alter ego. Davis repeatedly denied sexually\n\nassaulting Gray and said he became increasingly obsessed with hurting people as his trial was\n\nrepeatedly delayed. He told one reporter that he had text messages in his phone showing that Gray\n\nadmitted she lied about the sexual assaults. The text messages he described to the reporter matched\n\nthe fake text messages he created to bolster his defense. Davis also told the reporter that he did not\n\nintend to kill Gray when he went to meet her at her school. He said he just wanted to talk with her.\n\nHe said he had the gun with him only because he had owned it for a long time and carried it with him\n\nall the time.\n\n        The State called Dibrell in rebuttal. Dibrell contradicted Davis’s testimony about whether\n\nshe told Gray about her sexual encounter with Davis. She said she never told Gray about it because\n\n“[Gray] was a child, and I don’t discuss stuff like that with children.” Dibrell recalled that she had\n\nargued with Davis about the excessive amount of time he was spending at her apartment when she\n\nwas not home. She was angry with Davis because, although he had refused to babysit the children\n\nfor her, he kept coming over when Gray was there watching the children. She testified that Davis\n\nhad asked her to provide a statement for his sexual assault trial asserting that her children said that\n\nhe was never alone with Gray. She refused to write that statement. Dibrell testified that Davis was\n\nnot always truthful.\n\n        At the punishment stage of trial, Linda Crawford testified that, when she was sixteen years\n\nold and seven or eight months pregnant with Davis’s son, she walked in on Davis and another\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—22\nwoman at his apartment. Davis pushed her out, grabbed her by the throat, picked her up, and held\n\nher against the building. He ordered her to leave and not come back. Later, when she was holding\n\ntheir young son, Davis hit her with a coat hanger and cut her arm.\n\n       Similarly, Dibrell testified that Davis had been violent with her on multiple occasions during\n\ntheir relationship. She said that these incidents had twice resulted in her nose bleeding. Once, Davis\n\n“pulled a knife” on her. On another occasion, he shot her in the leg with a BB gun. When she was\n\npregnant with their daughter, she caught him with another woman and they argued. He grabbed her,\n\npinned her arms, and whispered into her ear that he hoped she would lose the baby.\n\n       Labrena Henderson, the mother of one of Davis’s sons, testified that she lived with Davis\n\nfrom 1999 through 2001. She recalled that Davis once pushed her violently against a wall during\n\nan argument. She also testified that she and Davis would fight when Davis would take her car at\n\nnight and use it to look for girls and break into other people’s cars.\n\n       The State introduced records revealing that Davis received a deferred adjudication in 1999\n\nfor theft of property valued between $1,500 and $20,000, and that his probation had been revoked\n\nin January 2001 due in part to a subsequent burglary of a motor vehicle. Davis’s criminal record also\n\nincluded convictions for evading arrest and failure to identify in February 2001, and fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer in October 2007.\n\n       Deputy Steven Underwood testified that he was assigned to supervise Davis when Davis was\n\nhospitalized during his incarceration while awaiting in this case. Davis, who was secured to the bed\n\nwith leg restraints and handcuffs, asked Underwood if he could take a shower before he was sent\n\nback to the jail. Underwood agreed. As soon as Underwood unlocked the restraints, Davis said,\n\n“I’m sorry, man,” grabbed Underwood, and backed him into the wall. As the two men struggled,\n\nDavis grasped for Underwood’s gun. Underwood saw that Davis had some sort of sharp object in\n\f                                                                                         DAVIS—23\nhis hand, but could not tell what it was. (Officers later located in the hospital room a Shasta can that\n\nhad been torn and pinched to form a sharp edge.) Underwood heard a “pop” and saw that his holster\n\nhad come off and Davis was holding his gun. Davis pulled away from Underwood and pointed the\n\ngun at him. He pulled the slide back to make sure the gun was loaded and ordered Underwood to\n\n“[g]et on the ground.” Underwood complied.\n\n        Davis then ran out of the hospital. He fled to a nearby residential area, where he tried to\n\nconvince a family to let him inside their home by claiming that someone was shooting at him. The\n\nmother refused to let him in, but she offered to call 911 for him. Davis asked her not to call the\n\npolice, saying that he had “warrants,” and fled again. The family later found Underwood’s gun\n\nstuffed inside a hospital sock in their front yard. They called the police, who came to the house and\n\ndiscovered that there was a round in the pistol’s chamber. Davis was located while hiding in a red\n\nvan in a parking lot near the hospital. Over eighty officers surrounded the parking lot and Davis\n\neventually surrendered.\n\n        Arrington took the stand and testified about her relationship with Davis. She explained that,\n\non at least twenty occasions, he had become extremely angry with her and choked her. This would\n\nusually happen whenever they argued, even over something minor. She said Davis would typically\n\n“tussle” or wrestle with her first, and then push her up against the wall while choking her with both\n\nhands. On approximately three of these occasions, he threatened Arrington with knives and he once\n\nplaced a gun against her head. He also once threw her against a brick fireplace, and she suffered\n\nbruising. After these fights, Davis would apologize. He would talk to Arrington about the fact that\n\nhis mother was murdered and remind her that his family had placed him in foster care. Arrington\n\ntearfully conceded that she did not reveal Davis’s assaultive conduct when initially questioned by\n\nDetective Williams, she never called the police following these assaults, and she did not tell her\n\f                                                                                         DAVIS—24\nfamily. She said that she did not report the assaults because she loved Davis and did not want to\n\nbecome one of the people who had “abandoned him, as he calls it.” Arrington said she felt ashamed\n\nof her failure to report his abuse and intended to divorce him after the trial.\n\n        The defense offered testimony showing that, as a child, Davis lived with his six siblings,\n\nmother, and grandfather in a small apartment in a poverty-stricken, crime-ridden neighborhood in\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri. Davis’s sister testified that their grandfather molested all of the children in the\n\nhouse. Medical records suggested that Davis’s intellectually-disabled older brother had sex with his\n\nyounger siblings. After Davis’s mother shot another resident of the housing complex, Davis and his\n\nsix siblings were placed in foster care. When she was released from prison, Davis’s mother moved\n\nto Texarkana, where the children were then living, and resumed her role as parent. However, she\n\nwas re-arrested for violating her parole and sent back to prison. She was brutally raped and then\n\nmurdered with a shotgun when Davis was a teenager. Davis’s foster mother, who raised him for one\n\nyear when he was fifteen or sixteen years old, testified that he was always obedient and he liked to\n\ntell jokes. However, after Davis left her home and went to live with his sister, his foster mother\n\nstarted hearing about him getting into trouble. Other caretakers who worked with Davis as a\n\nteenager stated that he was respectful and polite. Latrice Brown, the mother of Davis’s oldest\n\ndaughter, Kurstyne, testified that Davis was a good father and took care of their daughter for over\n\nthree years while Brown was incarcerated. Kurstyne testified that she loves her father and has a\n\ngood relationship with him.\n\n        The defense further offered expert witness testimony that Davis would be a vulnerable inmate\n\nlacking “juice” or power in the prison system due to the nature of the offense he committed. Frank\n\nAu Buchon, a retired Texas prison classification official, testified that an offender sentenced to life\n\nwithout parole could never receive a classification any less restrictive than level three in the general\n\f                                                                                         DAVIS—25\npopulation. Because Davis had attempted to escape, the least restrictive classification that Davis\n\nwould receive upon entering prison would be level four. And, because he had committed a violent\n\nact against a staff member within the past year, he could be classified as level five, which is the most\n\nrestrictive general population classification. Moreover, considering the fact that Davis had\n\nphysically assaulted and disarmed an officer using a makeshift weapon during a premeditated escape\n\nattempt, Au Buchon opined that Davis “needs to go to administrative segregation for a long time.”\n\nAu Buchon acknowledged that he could only make an “educated guess” about how the prison system\n\nwould actually classify Davis. Au Buchon agreed that, if an inmate took a gun from a guard on one\n\noccasion, he might be willing to do it again. Au Buchon also stated that Davis would have contact\n\nwith female guards in prison.\n\n        A Texarkana police officer testified that Davis reported to authorities that his uncle, Robert\n\nElkins, had admitted committing a robbery. Davis provided information that aided officers in\n\npreventing Elkins from committing another robbery. On cross-examination, however, the State\n\nelicited testimony that, two days before Davis provided information to police about Elkins, Davis\n\nwas arrested with Elkins for possession of criminal instruments. Further, Davis was a suspect in a\n\nburglary committed during the same time period. After assisting the police, Davis was not\n\nprosecuted for burglary or for possession of criminal instruments.\n\n        Gray-James took the stand again and described the effects of her daughter’s murder on her\n\nfamily. She also described the terror she experienced when she learned that Davis had escaped from\n\ncustody.\n\n                              SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n        In point of error eleven, Davis contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to support\n\nhis conviction for capital murder. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider all\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—26\nof the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether any rational trier of\n\nfact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.6 This\n\nstandard “gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the\n\ntestimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate\n\nfacts.”7 Each fact need not point directly and independently to the defendant’s guilt, as long as the\n\ncumulative effect of all the incriminating facts is sufficient to support the conviction.8 Motive is a\n\nsignificant circumstance indicating guilt, and intent may be inferred from a defendant’s acts, words,\n\nand conduct.9 In addition, attempts to conceal incriminating evidence, inconsistent statements, and\n\nimplausible explanations are probative of unlawful acts and circumstances indicative of guilt.10\n\n       Davis argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove the underlying offense of\n\nobstruction. He admits that he intentionally shot and killed Gray, but he disputes the State’s\n\nevidence concerning his motive for killing her. Texas Penal Code § 36.06 provides:\n\n       (a) A person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly harms or threatens to harm\n       another by an unlawful act:\n       ...\n\n       (2) to prevent or delay the service of another as a:\n\n                  (A) public servant, witness, prospective witness, or informant; or\n\n                  (B) person who has reported or who the actor knows intends to report the occurrence\n\n\n\n       6\n           Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S. 307, 318-19 (1979).\n       7\n           Id. at 319.\n       8\n           Guevara v. State, 152 S.W.3d 45, 49 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004).\n       9\n           Id. at 50.\n       10\n            Id.\n\f                                                                                          DAVIS—27\n                  of a crime.11\n\nChapter 36 does not define the term “prospective witness.” However, this Court has determined that\n\nofficial court proceedings need not have been initiated in order for a person who has information\n\nabout a crime to be a “prospective witness” covered by this statute.12 A “central purpose” of § 36.06\n\nis to encourage public servants, witnesses, prospective witnesses, and informants to perform vital\n\npublic duties, such as reporting criminal activities, testifying in official proceedings, and cooperating\n\nwith the government in criminal investigations, without fear of harm or physical injury.13\n\n        The record in this case shows—and Davis does not dispute—that Gray was “a person who\n\nha[d] reported . . . [t]he occurrence of a crime” and was a “prospective witness” in Davis’s upcoming\n\nsexual assault trial. Further, the record indisputably shows that Davis intentionally and knowingly\n\nharmed Gray by an unlawful act. In fact, Davis admitted to police, television reporters, and the jury\n\nthat he intentionally shot Gray twice with a firearm and then stepped on her neck until she stopped\n\nstruggling. And there is no dispute that Davis knew that Gray had accused him of sexually\n\nassaulting her and knew that she intended to serve as a witness against him.\n\n        Thus, the only remaining element of obstruction at issue is whether Davis killed Gray for the\n\npurpose of preventing or delaying her service as a witness, prospective witness, or person who\n\nreported the occurrence of a crime. Davis argues that the State did not prove that he killed Gray in\n\norder to prevent her from testifying, noting that he “never stated that was the reason he murdered her,\n\neven though all the detectives tried to get him to admit this.” Davis emphasizes that he repeatedly\n\n\n        11\n             TEX .

Gray was the\n\nnamed victim and the only eyewitness in the four sexual assault cases. Davis did not react violently\n\nwhen Gray first brought the charges, when he was arrested, or even when he lost his job. Rather, as\n\nDavis’s court date on the sexual assault charges approached, he became singularly focused on\n\ncombating the charges and targeting Gray. He concocted and executed an elaborate ruse whereby\n\nhe pretended to be a young man named “D” in order to gain Gray’s confidence, and he had hundreds\n\nof communications with Gray. Davis claimed that he was confident that the recordings of his phone\n\nconversations with Gray would bolster his defense, because they demonstrated that Gray had lied\n\nabout the sexual assaults. However, the one recorded conversation in which he and Gray discussed\n\nthe sexual assaults does not support his contention. In this conversation, Gray reluctantly described\n\nthe sexual assaults to “D,” explaining how Davis had intimidated and manipulated her. In response,\n\nDavis attempted to cajole and frighten her into telling people that she had lied about the assaults, and\n\nyet she refused. A reasonable juror could have deduced from this evidence that Davis did sexually\n\nassault Gray and, knowing that she was an indispensable witness against him, actively attempted to\n\nconvince her not to participate in the trial and, failing that, murdered her.\n\n        Other evidence in the record suggests that Davis was very concerned about his upcoming\n\nsexual assault trial, and he developed a plan to manufacture evidence and dispose of Gray as his trial\n\ndate approached. Over two weeks before he killed Gray, he used his T-Mobile phone to search for\n\n“[b]est way to get off of a sexual assault charge” and “with no proof that you did the murder can you\n\f                                                                                          DAVIS—29\nstill be held in jail[?]” Three days after the hearing at which the trial judge set his trial date, Davis\n\ndownloaded a fake text message application and used it to create text messages, purportedly from\n\nGray, saying she was sorry that she had lied about the sexual assaults. He additionally asked Dibrell\n\nto manufacture statements (purportedly made by her children) to support his defense. The day after\n\nhe created the bogus text messages, he began actively seeking to purchase a gun. Shortly thereafter,\n\nhe obtained the Diamondback .380 pistol. Less than a week after he bought the gun, he assumed his\n\n“D” persona again and contacted Gray. He began trying to convince her to meet with “D” after\n\nschool, making sure that her stepfather would not be present. He used his phone to search for the\n\nlocation of her school and an isolated park where he would be able to kill her without being seen.\n\nHe enticed her to meet him behind the school by leading her to think that “D” planned to give her\n\nsomething that might be “money money.” Davis brought a loaded gun with him to meet Gray at the\n\nschool. After killing her, he shoved her body in the river, then carefully disposed of the murder\n\nweapon, their phones, and other incriminating evidence. Later that evening, he doused the car with\n\ncologne before picking up his wife from work.\n\n        The jury was charged with weighing any conflicts in the evidence and evaluating the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses. The jurors had the opportunity to evaluate Davis’s credibility as he\n\ntestified at trial concerning his motive for the killing. They were free to believe or disbelieve some\n\nor all of his testimony. They were also free to draw reasonable, yet adverse inferences from his acts,\n\nwords, and conduct, including his attempts to manufacture evidence and his inconsistent statements\n\nand explanations. The jury could have reasonably inferred from the evidence that Davis intentionally\n\nkilled Gray to prevent her service as witness against him.\n\n        We hold that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, is legally\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—30\nsufficient to support the jury’s verdict that Davis intentionally murdered Gray in the course of\n\ncommitting or attempting to commit the offense of obstruction. Davis’s eleventh point of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error twenty-four, Davis challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence to\n\nsupport the jury’s affirmative answer to the future dangerousness special issue.14 He argues that the\n\nevidence was insufficient because he had no prior violent offense convictions and “the defense\n\nwitnesses testified that he essentially was a low risk for future dangerousness.”\n\n       When reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s answer to the\n\nfuture dangerousness special issue, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\n\nand determine whether any rational trier of fact could have believed beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nthere is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute\n\na continuing threat to society.15 In its determination of this special issue, the jury is entitled to\n\nconsider all of the evidence admitted at both the guilt and punishment phases of trial.16 This Court\n\nhas not required that the record contain evidence of prior violent offense convictions to support a\n\njury’s finding of future dangerousness.17       The circumstances of the offense and the events\n\n\n\n\n       14\n             See TEX .

Armed with a home-made\n\nweapon, he had executed a violent escape from custody in which he overpowered an officer and took\n\nhis firearm. Further, he had demonstrated a pattern of assaulting his intimate partners. Davis, who\n\nis a bodybuilder, had thrown women up against walls, choked them, injured them, and threatened\n\nthem with knives and firearms. Some of these assaults were committed when young children were\n\npresent. Although Davis asserts that defense punishment witnesses “essentially” testified that he\n\npresented a low risk for violent conduct, Frank Au Buchon testified that Davis might very well\n\nattempt to take an officer’s firearm again and “need[ed] to go to administrative segregation for a long\n\ntime.”19 The jury also heard evidence of Davis’s sexual assaults of Gray and other threatening\n\nconduct towards her when she was only fourteen years old, as well as the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe instant brutal, premeditated murder. Moreover, a rational jury could have given particular weight\n\nto Davis’s admissions that, as his trial was repeatedly delayed, he had experienced persistent\n\nthoughts of killing Gray’s entire family and had become increasingly preoccupied with hurting\n\npeople.\n\n          Viewing the record in the light most favorable to the jury’s punishment verdict, the evidence\n\nwas sufficient to support the jury’s affirmative answer to the future dangerousness special issue.

Kentucky.20 In Batson, the Supreme Court held that\n\nthe State violates the Equal Protection Clause when it excludes a veniremember based on his or her\n\nrace. A Batson challenge to the State’s use of a peremptory strike has three steps. First, the\n\nopponent of the strike must establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.21 Second, if the\n\nopponent makes the requisite showing, the burden shifts to the proponent of the strike to articulate\n\na reason for the strike that is race-neutral on its face.22 Third, if a race-neutral explanation is offered,\n\nthen the trial judge must determine whether the opponent of the strike has shown purposeful\n\ndiscrimination.23 “Whether the opponent satisfies his burden of persuasion to show that the\n\nproponent’s facially race-neutral explanation for his strike is pre-textual, not genuine, is a question\n\nof fact for the trial court.”24\n\n        Although the burden of production shifts after the opponent makes a prima facie case, the\n\nburden of persuasion remains with the opponent of the strike to establish purposeful discrimination.25\n\n\n\n        20\n             476 U.S. 79 (1986).\n        21\n             Nieto v.

In determining whether clear error occurred, we look to the\n\nentire record of the voir dire, not merely the passages highlighted by the parties.26\n\n       Davis compares three peremptorily-struck African-American veniremembers with non-\n\nminority veniremembers who were not struck by the State. He argues that they gave “similar”\n\nanswers on the jury questionnaire. He contends that this comparative juror analysis provides\n\nevidence of intentional discrimination based on race.27 However, a comparative juror analysis is\n\nonly one of several nonexclusive factors the Supreme Court has identified in determining whether\n\nintentional discrimination occurred.28\n\nPrima Facia Case\n\n       Davis argues that the State used three of its peremptory strikes to eliminate three of six (50%)\n\nof the qualified African-American veniremembers within the strike range reached during voir dire:\n\nSyrene Mitchell (No. 15), Louise Horsely (No. 27), and Freddie Watson (No. 34). At the pretrial\n\nhearing on Davis’s Batson challenges, the State disputed Davis’s prima facie case. However, before\n\nseeking a ruling on the prima facie case issue, the prosecutor moved directly to discussing his race-\n\nneutral reasons for striking each of the complained-of jurors. Because the prosecutor did not seek\n\na timely ruling on Davis’s prima facie case or object to the trial judge’s failure to rule, the prima\n\n\n\n\n       26\n            Nieto, 365 S.W.3d at 675-76.\n       27\n         See Reed v.

Davis notes that Mitchell answered “no” to the\n\nquestion, “Do you have any moral, religious or personal beliefs that would prevent you from\n\nreturning a verdict which would result in the execution of another human being?” while one of the\n\nseated jurors answered this question, “yes.” He points out that Mitchell agreed that intentional\n\nmurder during the course of obstruction should be a capital offense, “as [had] all jurors accepted by\n\nthe State,” and that Mitchell had not heard about the case, “as did sixteen jurors accepted by the\n\nState.” He further observes that Mitchell ranked himself a six out of ten when asked how strongly\n\nhe believed in the death penalty, while five jurors accepted by the State ranked themselves a six or\n\nlower on this question.\n\n       Davis contends that Horsely also had characteristics that would have benefitted the State,\n\nincluding her intelligence, her military service, and her statement that she could make the decision\n\nto assess the death penalty “under the right circumstances.” He states that her answers to certain\n\nquestions were similar to those given by others who were accepted as jurors. Davis argues the trial\n\njudge failed to examine the validity of the State’s proffered reasons and the credibility of the\n\nprosecutor. He contends the State’s reasons for the peremptory strikes were mere pretexts for\n\npurposeful discrimination.\n\n       In his brief, Davis fails to focus on the specific race-neutral reasons enumerated by the State.\n\n\n\n       29\n          See Chambers v. State, 866 S.W.2d 9, 23 (Tex. Crim.

(Circle only one.)”\n\nAnswer number three corresponded to the following statement: “Although I do not believe that the\n\ndeath penalty should ever be imposed, as long as the law provides for it, I could assess it under the\n\nproper set of circumstances.” The prosecutor stated that the State struck all veniremembers who\n\nanswered this question with a value of three or higher. Higher numbered answers became\n\nprogressively less favorable to the death penalty. The prosecutor also stated that Mitchell indicated\n\nthat he would hold the State to a higher burden of proof in a death penalty case. The trial judge\n\nasked defense counsel if he had any response to the State’s explanations. Defense counsel did not\n\noffer any further argument or dispute the State’s assertions about these jurors.30 The judge then\n\ndenied Davis’s Batson challenges to Mitchell and Horsely.\n\n       The State’s first asserted justification for its peremptory strikes—that Mitchell and Horsely\n\ngave an answer on the questionnaire expressing that they did not believe in the death penalty—is the\n\ntype of reason we have held in the past to be facially race-neutral.31 Further, the record shows that\n\n\n       30\n          See Camacho v.

For example, Mitchell was asked, “When the State of Texas is saying that person over\n\nthere needs to be killed based on his actions and based on what future actions he might do, then that\n\nstandard has to be higher than what we’re talking about in a normal burglary of a habitation case\n\n. . . . Would you agree with that?” Mitchell responded, “Yes, I do.” Mitchell later responded, “I\n\ndon’t know that I’d make it any higher than a reasonable doubt,” but he then agreed that he is the\n\ntype of person who believes that, “if you’re going to charge someone with a death penalty [offense]\n\nand seek the death penalty, the standard of proof is higher than . . . beyond a reasonable doubt.” He\n\nstated that he believed the burden for death penalty cases “should be higher,” and he “would hold\n\nthe State to a higher burden.”\n\n          Mitchell equivocated upon cross-examination by defense counsel and questioning by the trial\n\njudge. At one point, he stated that he would apply the beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard in a\n\ndeath-penalty case. However, he also asserted that his beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard would\n\n\n          31\n               (...continued)\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—37\nbe higher in a capital murder case than it would in a burglary case. Although the trial judge denied\n\nthe State’s challenge for cause on this basis, Mitchell’s vacillation on this issue was nevertheless a\n\nvalid, race-neutral reason supporting the State’s peremptory strike.32\n\n       Davis has not shown that Mitchell and Horsely were treated differently from non-minority\n\nveniremembers or that the prosecutor’s stated reasons for striking them were a pretext for\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n                                       Veniremember Watson\n\n       Davis emphasizes that, during voir dire, Watson stated that killing a witness to keep her from\n\ntestifying should be capital murder and, when told what the two possible punishments for that crime\n\nwere, Watson stated, “[R]ight.” Similarly, Davis notes that Watson responded, “[R]ight,” as the\n\nprosecutor explained how a person could post bond and the reasons for the bond requirement. Davis\n\nmaintains that Watson’s answers on other questions showed that he was a proponent of the death\n\npenalty.    He asserts that Watson’s answers were similar to the answers of non-minority\n\nveniremembers who were seated on the jury. He submits that the State’s justifications for the\n\nperemptory strike of Watson were implausible and merely a pretext for purposeful discrimination.\n\n       The prosecutor stated at the Batson hearing that he struck Watson for a combination of\n\nreasons. First, on his questionnaire, Watson added a handwritten note after his answer to question\n\nnumber twelve. Question number twelve read:\n\n       The crime of “Obstruction” means harming or threatening to harm another person to\n       prevent or delay the service of that person as a witness or prospective witness. The\n       law in the State of Texas says that the intentional murder of an individual during\n       the course of committing or attempting to commit the offense of “obstruction” is\n\n\n       32\n          See Chambers, 866 S.W.2d at 24 (observing that a prospective juror’s vacillation on an\nissue related to the death penalty was a race-neutral explanation for the State’s peremptory strike\nof the juror).\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—38\n       a capital offense, for which, depending on the facts and circumstances of the case, a\n       sentence of life without parole or the death penalty may be imposed? [sic] Do you\n       agree with the punishment range outlined above?\n\nWatson checked “yes” in response to this question but then wrote, “Life without parole would be\n\nbetter for me.”\n\n       Second, at the end of his individual voir dire, Watson notified the trial judge that he had read\n\nabout the case in the newspaper. At this point, both sides had already interviewed Watson, and he\n\nhad stated on his questionnaire that he had not heard anything about the case in the media.\n\n       Third, on a question about the presumption of innocence, Watson added the notation:\n\n“Should be set free until trial is over.” He also asked during voir dire why a defendant could not be\n\nallowed to remain free in the community until the conclusion of his trial, suggesting that the\n\npresumption of innocence should mandate his release. The prosecutor then explained the bond\n\nprocess and the purpose for requiring a bond. At the Batson hearing, the prosecutor said Watson\n\nseemed unsatisfied with this explanation.\n\n       The record shows that, after offering an extensive explanation of the bond process in\n\nresponse to Watson’s concerns, the prosecutor asked Watson, “Is that okay?” Watson responded,\n\n“Yeah, mostly. It answers the question, but it . . . still seems like to me that if a bond is set for a\n\nperson, there are still implications that that person is guilty.” Watson continued to indicate that he\n\nbelieved forcing a defendant to pay a bond meant that the person was being presumed guilty, rather\n\nthan innocent. Thus, the record supports the prosecutor’s claim that Watson was not satisfied with\n\nhis explanation. Watson’s statements arguably indicated a bias against the State and for Davis.\n\n       Additionally, the State asserted at the Batson hearing that Watson was the only one of the\n\nforty-five jurors questioned who wrote, “life without parole would be better for me,” and expressed\n\nconcern about why the defendant would not be released while awaiting the outcome of his trial. The\n\f                                                                                         DAVIS—39\ntrial judge asked defense counsel for a response to the State’s race-neutral explanation. Counsel did\n\nnot respond to or contradict the prosecutor’s assertions. The burden of persuasion remained with\n\nDavis’s counsel to establish that a prohibited motive lay behind the State’s peremptory strike.33 The\n\nrecord supports the prosecutor’s assertions about the race-neutral reasons for the strike, and defense\n\ncounsel did not rebut them. Davis has not demonstrated that the State’s race-neutral reasons were\n\nmerely a pretext for discrimination.\n\n        The trial judge’s rulings denying Davis’s Batson challenges are supported by the record and\n\nwere not clearly erroneous. We overrule Davis’s first, second, and third points of error.\n\n                              DISCHARGE OF DISABLED JUROR\n\n        In his fourth point of error, Davis argues that the trial judge abused his discretion in\n\ndischarging juror John Bigley due to a disability. Davis contends that the record contains “no\n\nevidence” supporting the trial judge’s finding that Bigley suffered an emotional disability justifying\n\nhis discharge under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 36.29(b), which provides in relevant\n\npart:\n\n        If alternate jurors have been selected in a capital case in which the state seeks the\n        death penalty and a juror dies or becomes disabled from sitting at any time before the\n        charge of the court is read to the jury, the alternate juror whose name was called first\n        under Article 35.26 of this code shall replace the dead or disabled juror.\n\n        On August 29, 2013, with counsel for both parties and Davis present, the trial judge\n\nconvened a hearing regarding Bigley “under the auspices” of Article 36.29(b). The judge explained\n\nthat the trial was originally set for August 19th, but at the request of the defense, he had continued\n\nthe trial to November 4th to allow the defense to develop “certain potentially mitigating evidence.”\n\nBigley had expressed “extreme reluctance” about the new trial date to court staff. The judge stated\n\n\n        33\n             See Camacho, 864 S.W.2d at 529.\n\f                                                                                          DAVIS—40\nthat he called Bigley to discuss the matter. The judge said that Bigley “was adamant that because\n\nof his work situation that he simply did not feel like he would be able to be fair and impartial to both\n\nsides and to carefully weigh the evidence because his mind would be elsewhere.” The judge then\n\ncontacted Bigley’s boss in the Netherlands via email. The boss said that Bigley’s participation at\n\nwork from November 4th through November 18th was critical. Defense counsel objected to the trial\n\njudge excusing Bigley from jury service.\n\n        The trial judge then called Bigley to the stand. Bigley explained that he is the only United\n\nStates employee for a company called In Continuum. He said that, due to the nature of his business,\n\nall of his work setting up partnerships and relationships would be coming to fruition in the last\n\nquarter of the year. Bigley testified that, if he was forced to serve as a juror in November, he would\n\nhave to work early mornings, trial breaks, lunch periods, and late nights during the trial to close deals\n\nand he would be distracted during the trial. He said he would do his best to fulfill his duties as a\n\njuror, but he would be thinking about the work he needed to do and he would be worried about\n\nkeeping his job. The judge asked him, “Is it fair to say that because of your emotional state, you’re\n\nconcerned that you would not be attentive during the trial?” Bigley answered, “That’s correct.” The\n\ntrial judge discharged Bigley from jury service and replaced him with one of the two alternate jurors.\n\nThe jury was subsequently sworn on November 4, 2013.\n\n        Although Article 36.29 was discussed at the pretrial hearing and in Davis’s brief, it was not\n\napplicable in this case because the jury had not yet been sworn when Bigley was removed. This\n\nCourt has held that Article 36.29 applies only after the jury has been sworn.34 In this case, the trial\n\njudge did not swear in the twelve jurors until after Bigley had been discharged and replaced with an\n\n\n        34\n          Broussard v. State, 910 S.W.2d 952, 957 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995) (citing Williams v.\nState, 631 S.W.2d 955, 957 (Tex. Crim.

Although there is no statutorily defined procedure for discharging jurors that applies\n\nto this particular situation, we have held that a trial judge does not err in following the process set\n\nout in Article 36.29 and replacing a disabled juror with a duly-selected alternate juror.35\n\n        Article 36.29(b) sets out the process for replacing a juror who “becomes disabled from\n\nsitting,” but it does not define the phrase “disabled from sitting.” Under Article 36.29, a trial judge\n\nhas discretion to determine whether a juror has become disabled and to replace that juror with an\n\nalternate juror.36 We have interpreted the phrase “disabled from sitting” in Article 36.29 to require\n\nthat the juror must be suffering from a “physical illness, mental condition, or emotional state that\n\nwould hinder or inhibit the juror from performing his or her duties as a juror.”37 A disability in this\n\ncontext is “not limited to physical disease, but also includes ‘any condition that inhibits a juror from\n\nfully and fairly performing the functions of a juror.’”38\n\n        The trial judge’s decision is subject to a review for abuse of discretion and, absent such an\n\nabuse, no reversible error will be found.39 When reviewing the dismissal of a juror, we will not\n\n\n\n\n       35\n           Id. at 958 (“Faced with the need to complete the jury, and having no specific statutory\ndirective, the trial court chose an acceptable option by replacing the disabled venireman with a\nvenireman who had already been qualified and accepted by both parties . . . .

Instead,\n\nwe examine whether, in the context of the case, the failure to provide notice affected “the\n\ndefendant’s ability to prepare a defense and, if so, how great an impact it was.”52 The due process\n\nnotice requirement may be satisfied by means other than the language in the charging instrument.\n\nWe have held that, “[w]hen a motion to quash [an indictment for lack of notice] is overruled, a\n\ndefendant suffers no harm unless he did not, in fact, receive notice of the State’s theory against\n\n\n\n\n        48\n             Daniels v.

The trial judge additionally\n\nasked defense counsel, “haven’t you received notice of what the obstruction is through other\n\npleadings and other discovery mechanisms . . . ?” Counsel responded: “Yes, in answer to your\n\nquestion, we’ve had - - we have discovery. We know what the State’s position is in the case, and\n\nwhat it is that they believe happened and why. But we just - - our position is that we need to have\n\nthat in the indictment so that we know specifically what it is we’re defending against.”\n\n       Davis argues that more detail should have been provided in the indictment in this case to\n\ndescribe the underlying offense of obstruction because Texas Penal Code § 36.06 has eight different\n\nelements with “distinct alternatives that may or may not be included in the indictment.” However,\n\nother underlying offenses of capital murder, such as burglary, also have multiple elements and\n\n\n       53\n            Kellar v.

Davis cites no authority to support his argument that we should\n\ntreat indictments in capital murder cases involving the underlying offense of obstruction differently\n\nfrom capital murders involving other underlying offenses. Moreover, any lack of detail in the\n\nindictment did not harm Davis because, as his counsel’s statements to the trial judge reveal, the\n\ndefense received actual notice of the State’s theory of the case regarding the obstruction element.55\n\n       Davis, therefore, has not shown that the trial judge erred in denying his motion to quash the\n\nindictment.

He argues that the denial of the motion for continuance\n\nviolated his rights to due process of law and effective assistance of counsel under the Fourteenth and\n\nSixth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\n\n       By the time Davis filed the motion for continuance that was denied, the trial judge had\n\nalready granted two previous motions for continuance. On October 8, 2012, on defense counsel’s\n\noral motion, the trial judge reset the trial to August 19, 2013. On August 8, 2013, defense counsel\n\nfiled a written motion for continuance stating that certain redacted government records showed it\n\nwas “obvious that sexual abuse was occurring” in Davis’s childhood home, though it was “not clear\n\nwhat kind of abuse, by whom, upon whom.” In response to this motion, the trial judge postponed\n\nDavis’s trial to November 4, 2013.\n\n\n\n       55\n          See Smith v. State, 297 S.W.3d 260, 267 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (“The record in this\ncase clearly shows that appellant had actual notice of the capital charge upon which the State was\nbasing its allegations.”); Kellar, 108 S.W.3d at 314 (“Given the extensive and detailed discovery\nthat occurred prior to trial, the appellant had ample notice in addition to that provided by the\nindictment.”).\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—47\n       Davis’s November 1st motion for continuance stated in relevant part:\n\n       It has come to the attention of defense counsel that the Defendant, Mr. Franklin\n       Davis, has an extensive history of sexual abuse perpetrated upon him. New evidence\n       has come to light as of the afternoon of October 31, 2013. This evidence is\n       paramount to the effective representation of Mr. Davis. This evidence must be\n       investigated for both guilt/innocence issues as well as possible mitigation evidence.\n\nThe November motion did not further explain the nature of the evidence, witnesses, or investigation\n\nneeded, the diligence used to procure the evidence, or why the evidence could not be procured from\n\nanother source, such as Davis himself. The copies of the motion and attached affidavit in the clerk’s\n\nrecord were not signed by counsel or Davis. The only signature on the document is that of a notary\n\npublic who, curiously, certified that defense counsel had signed the unsigned affidavit.\n\n       The trial judge observed that the motion was “filed literally at the 11th hour.” The judge\n\nnoted that nearly fourteen months had passed since the case had been first assigned to his district\n\ncourt and that he had already granted Davis two continuances. The judge said that Davis’s August\n\nmotion for continuance had stated essentially the same grounds as the instant motion: the need to\n\ninvestigate newly discovered mitigating evidence suggesting Davis had been sexually abused as a\n\nchild. The judge also stated that Davis’s latest motion did not comply with Article 29.07, governing\n\nsubsequent motions for continuance by a defendant. The judge commented that the motion appeared\n\nto have been filed for the purpose of obtaining cumulative testimony.\n\n       Defense counsel responded that, on October 31, 2013, he was speaking with Davis during\n\na visit and “things came to light about the defendant’s past which only the defendant could be able\n\nto address specifically,” and these “things” were not contained in the records that were the basis for\n\nthe last motion for continuance. Counsel emphasized that “nobody else can testify directly as to\n\nwhat has happened to Mr. Davis himself . . . . [O]nly he can speak about the acts, about the things\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—48\nthat were done to him by the people who did them to him.” Defense counsel explained that they\n\nwanted to explore the psychological impact of the childhood abuse on Davis.\n\n       The trial judge confirmed that defense counsel intended to direct their investigators to\n\ncontinue to investigate this issue throughout the week. The judge asked for daily reports on the\n\nstatus of that investigation. He then denied the motion for continuance. Subsequently during trial,\n\nbefore the State completed its presentation of evidence, the trial judge asked defense counsel about\n\ntheir progress on this investigation. Defense counsel asked to speak to the judge in camera about\n\nthis matter. The judge then took a short recess. When the judge and parties returned to the\n\ncourtroom, there was no further discussion of the matter on the record and defense counsel did not\n\nrenew the request for a continuance.\n\n       An appellate court reviews a trial judge’s ruling on a motion for continuance for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.56 To establish an abuse of discretion, an appellant must show that he was actually\n\nprejudiced by the denial of his motion.57 Generally, we will conclude that a trial judge’s denial of\n\na motion for continuance was an abuse of discretion “only if the record shows with considerable\n\nspecificity how the defendant was harmed by the absence of more preparation time than he actually\n\nhad.”58 In determining whether the denial of a motion for continuance is so arbitrary that it violates\n\ndue process, we look at the individual circumstances of each case, especially the reasons presented\n\n\n\n\n       56\n          See TEX . CODE CRIM . PROC. art. 29.06 (providing that the sufficiency of a motion for\ncontinuance shall be addressed to the “sound discretion” of the court and “shall not be granted as\nmatter of right”); Heiselbetz v. State, 906 S.W.2d 500, 511 (Tex. Crim. App. 1995).\n       57\n            Janecka v. State, 937 S.W.2d 456, 468 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\n       58\n            Gonzales v. State, 304 S.W.3d 838, 842 (Tex. Crim. App. 2010).\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—49\nto the trial judge at the moment the motion was denied.59\n\n       Davis also argues that the trial judge’s denial of his motion for continuance rendered his\n\nattorneys’ performance constitutionally deficient on the issue of mitigation. To prevail on an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must prove: (1) trial counsel’s representation\n\nfell below an objective standard of reasonableness (i.e., deficient performance); and (2) there is a\n\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel’s deficiency, the result of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different (i.e., prejudice).60 A defendant bears the burden of proving an ineffectiveness claim\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence.61 A reviewing court need not always address both prongs of the\n\ninquiry, because the “[f]ailure to make the required showing of either deficient performance or\n\nsufficient prejudice defeats the ineffectiveness claim.”62\n\n       Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 29.08 provides that, “All motions for continuance\n\nmust be sworn to by a person having personal knowledge of the facts relied on for the continuance.”\n\nArticle 29.07 requires that a defendant’s subsequent motion for continuance must comply with all\n\nthe requirements for a first motion for continuance set out in Article 29.06, and further must state:\n\n(1) that the testimony sought by the defense cannot be procured from any other source known to the\n\ndefendant; and (2) that the defendant has a reasonable expectation of procuring the testimony “at the\n\nnext term of the court.” “Mere conclusions and general averments are not sufficient for the court\n\nto determine their materiality, and the motion for continuance must show on its face the materiality\n\n\n       59\n            Rosales v. State, 841 S.W.2d 368, 374 (Tex. Crim. App. 1992).\n       60\n        Thompson v. State, 9 S.W.3d 808, 812-13 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999); see Strickland v.\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).\n       61\n            Thompson, 9 S.W.3d at 813.\n       62\n            Id.\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—50\nof the absent testimony.”63 A defendant forfeits his appellate challenge to the trial judge’s denial of\n\nhis continuance motion by failing to comply with the procedural requirements set out in these\n\nstatutes.64 We have refused to recognize a due process exception to the rule requiring motions for\n\ncontinuance to be written and sworn in order to be preserved on appeal.65\n\n       Davis’s November 1st motion for continuance was not sworn to by any person with personal\n\nknowledge of the facts. Therefore, it did not comply with Article 29.08. In addition, as the trial\n\njudge observed, the motion did not comply with Article 29.07, in that it did not state that the\n\ntestimony sought could not be procured from any other source known to the defendant or that the\n\ndefendant had a reasonable expectation of procuring the evidence “at the next term of the court.”\n\n       Further, the weight of the evidence in this case suggests that Davis did not suffer prejudice\n\nas a result of the denial of his motion for continuance, and no due process violation occurred.\n\nAlthough this case was undeniably complex, defense counsel and the defense investigator had over\n\na year to prepare for trial. Davis had already received two continuances, including a lengthy\n\ncontinuance in part for the purpose of developing childhood sexual-assault evidence. There was no\n\ntestimony establishing that defense counsel’s performance was compromised or defense witnesses\n\nwere inconvenienced by the judge’s refusal to grant the third continuance. When the trial judge\n\nasked defense counsel during the trial about the status of their investigation into the alleged sexual\n\nabuse, counsel made no complaint on the record that the defense had not been able to progress in its\n\n\n       63\n            Harrison v. State, 187 S.W.3d 429, 434 (Tex. Crim. App. 2005).\n       64\n          See Anderson v. State, 301 S.W.3d 276, 280 (Tex. Crim. App. 2009) (“Anderson\nforfeited his appellate challenge to the trial judge’s denial of his unsworn oral continuance\nmotion by failing to comply with procedural requirements of Articles 29.03 and 29.08.”).\n       65\n        See Blackshear v. State, 385 S.W.3d 589, 591 (Tex. Crim. App. 2012) (citing\nAnderson, 301 S.W.3d at 279).\n\f                                                                                      DAVIS—51\ninvestigation, nor did he renew his request for a continuance. Moreover, defense counsel conceded\n\nthat the testimony relevant to the November motion could only come from Davis himself. And when\n\nDavis took the stand in his own defense, he testified that he was “raped” by his grandfather and his\n\n“mentally retarded brother.” The defense also offered other evidence documenting sexual abuse in\n\nDavis’s childhood home.\n\n       Under the circumstances, Davis has not demonstrated that he was deprived of due process\n\nor the effective assistance of counsel. We conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion\n\nin denying this motion for continuance, and we overrule Davis’s sixth point of error.\n\n\n\n\n                      DENIAL OF MOTIONS TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE\n\n                                         Search Warrants\n\n       In his seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth points of error, Davis contends that the trial judge\n\nerred in denying his motions to suppress evidence obtained as a result of four search warrants for:\n\n(1) photographs and a DNA buccal swab from Davis; (2) items from Arrington’s 2005 Dodge\n\nStratus; (3) items from Davis and Arrington’s apartment in Irving, Texas; and (4) digital information\n\nfrom Davis’s T-Mobile phone.\n\n       On September 8, 2012, a magistrate signed three search warrants authorizing the search of\n\nDavis’s body for a DNA sample and photographs, Arrington’s Dodge Stratus (which had been driven\n\nby Davis), and Davis and Arrington’s apartment. At this time, officers had not yet found Gray’s\n\nbody and were investigating her disappearance as a kidnapping rather than a murder. Thus, the\n\nsearch warrants alleged the penal offense of kidnapping. These three search warrant affidavits\n\ncontained the following factual allegations:\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—52\n       On Thursday, September 6, 2012, Shania Ambriehl Gray was last seen at Hebron\n       High School at 4207 Plano Parkway, Carrollton, Denton County, Texas. She was\n       attending an after school tutoring class and had received a telephone call from her\n       mother. Shania Ambriehl Gray told her teacher that she was going to meet her\n       mother, Sherry James. Shania left the classroom to walk out of the school and meet\n       her mother, who was waiting in a car. Shania Ambriehl Gray never arrived at her\n       mother’s car and has not been seen since her tutoring class . . . .\n\n       During the course of the investigation, Officers discovered that in 2011, Shania\n       Ambriehl Gray had reported several Sexual Assault cases to the Mesquite Police\n       Department. The suspect, Franklin Davis, . . . was arrested and is currently awaiting\n       trial for these offenses . . . .\n\n       Officers obtained Shania Ambriehl Gray’s cellular telephone information due to\n       exigent circumstances. While investigating the activity on Shania Ambriehl Gray’s\n       cellular telephone, officers found the telephone number 903-603-8786. During the\n       time period from September 5, 2012 to September 6, 2012, several calls and texts\n       were made from Shania Ambriehl Gray’s cellular telephone to cellular telephone\n       number 903-603-8786.\n\n       Officers obtained the cell data for 903-603-8786 due to exigent circumstances. One\n       of the numbers called by 903-603-8786 was 214-909-8567. Officers called 214-909-\n       8567 and spoke to Shakeema Morsley. Officers asked Shakeema Morsley if she\n       could tell them who had been calling her from 903-603-8786. Shakeema Morsley\n       said that she believed this person was Franklin Davis. Shakeema Morsley knows\n       Franklin Davis through her friend and work associate, Jawanna Arrington, who is in\n       a dating relationship with Franklin Davis. Shakeema stated that she strongly\n       believed this was Franklin Davis due to the content of the communications, which\n       would only be known to Franklin Davis.\n\n       Officers looked at the cellular telephone data for Shania Ambriehl Gray and the 903-\n       603-8786 [sic], which is believed to belong to Franklin Davis, and found that they\n       had been in proximity with each other during the same time frame on September 6,\n       2012. After 5:17 p.m. CST on September 6, 2012 it appears that Shania Ambriehl\n       Gray’s telephone was turned off.\n\nThe affiant further stated that Gray’s mother said Gray had never run away from home, was not\n\ndefiant or rebellious, and had indicated that she wanted to attend future school events and to “attain\n\ngoals with her family,” suggesting that it was unlikely that Gray had voluntarily left the school and\n\nrun away without contacting her mother.\n\n       Officers executed the search warrant for Davis and Arrington’s apartment on September 8,\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—53\n2012. They seized two plastic bags of household trash, a black spiral notebook containing personal\n\nwritings, miscellaneous paperwork, a black Adidas shirt, black basketball shorts, and a pair of\n\nweightlifting gloves. On September 10, 2012, officers executed the search warrant for the Dodge\n\nStratus, seizing a bank withdrawal receipt, some trace evidence, fingerprints, and DNA swabs.\n\nOfficers executed the warrant for Davis’s DNA sample and photos on September 11, 2012. They\n\nobtained two buccal swabs and several photographs of Davis, including photos taken at the jail of\n\nan injury to his arm and his shirtless chest displaying a “Wish” tattoo.\n\n       The fourth search warrant affidavit was signed by Detective Williams on September 12,\n\n2012, after officers found Gray’s body and after Davis confessed to murdering Gray. Williams\n\nstated in the affidavit that Davis voluntarily gave his T-Mobile phone to officers at the Carrollton\n\nPolice Department. Williams relied in large part on statements Davis had made during his interview\n\nwith Detective Chevallier, in which Davis admitted taking Gray from her school, shooting her, and\n\nkilling her. Williams said that Davis admitted in this interview that he adopted a false identity, used\n\na prepaid cell phone to talk to Gray, and recorded those conversations on his T-Mobile phone. This\n\nwarrant was used to obtain the contents of Davis’s T-Mobile phone, including digital images,\n\nrecordings, and internet search history.\n\n       Davis filed four motions to suppress all the evidence obtained through the four search\n\nwarrants. He argued that the warrants, the associated affidavits, and the execution and return of the\n\nwarrants violated his constitutional and statutory rights “under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments\n\nto the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 9 of the Texas Constitution, and Article 38.23”\n\nbecause the affidavits did not show probable cause to conclude that “the alleged contraband would\n\nbe found in a particular place.”\n\n       In the hearing on Davis’s motions to suppress, Davis’s counsel maintained that the search\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—54\nwarrant affidavits were deficient because they did not allege facts showing that a crime had been\n\ncommitted and did not allege that there was anything that could be used for comparison with Davis’s\n\nDNA. Further, Davis’s counsel argued that the affidavits did not establish any basis for the police\n\n“to believe that this individual, Shamica Mosley [sic], is credible or that what they [sic] tell them\n\nactually helps them in any way.” He argued that the facts stated in the affidavits did not collectively\n\namount to probable cause. Finally, he argued, without elaboration, that the fourth warrant affidavit\n\nrelied on information unlawfully obtained through the first three search warrants.\n\n       The State responded that the affidavits alleged facts showing a kidnapping and that\n\ninvestigators reasonably expected to compare Davis’s DNA to evidence obtained in the future. The\n\nprosecutor pointed out that Shakeema Morsley personally knew Davis and “strongly believe[d]” that\n\nhe was the person who was using the 903 area-code number to contact her in September 2012. In\n\nthe event that the trial judge felt that the motions to suppress had merit, the prosecutor asked to be\n\nallowed to call Arrington to testify that she gave consent to the searches of her Dodge Stratus and\n\ntheir apartment. At trial, Arrington testified that she consented to allowing the police to retain her\n\nDodge Stratus for processing, but there is no indication that evidence establishing her consent to the\n\nsearch was before the magistrate when he signed the warrants or the trial judge when he ruled on the\n\nmotions to suppress.\n\n       The trial judge entered findings of fact regarding Davis’s motions to suppress evidence,\n\nincluding the following:\n\n       3. . . . . Detective D. Williams, who investigated the victim’s disappearance,\n       determined that the victim had previously reported several sexual assault cases to the\n       Mesquite Police Department by the Defendant, Franklin B. Davis. Based on the\n       existence of these charges, Detective D. Williams contacted Detective Cook to assist\n       with the investigation.\n\f                                                                                         DAVIS—55\n        4. The victim’s mother informed the officers that the victim has never before run\n        away from home, even during the time that led up to her outcry about the alleged\n        sexual assaults by the Defendant. Her mother also indicated that she has never been\n        defiant or rebellious and that she had plans to attend future school events and to\n        attain goals with her family. Based on this information, the officers surmised that the\n        victim did not leave the school voluntarily.\n\n        5. Detective Cook, an experienced and seasoned officer, along with other officers\n        then obtained the cell phone records of the victim, including those calls made or\n        received the day before and the day of her disappearance. On both the day before\n        and the day of her disappearance the victim made several calls and texts to a cellular\n        number with a 903 area code. Officers then obtained the cell phone data for the cell\n        phone with the 903 area code and found that this phone had made phone calls to a\n        214 phone number. The Officers contacted the owner of the 214 area code cell and\n        determined that Shakeema Morsley, [sic] was the owner of the 214 area code phone.\n        Ms. Morsley informed officers that she had been receiving phone calls from Franklin\n        Davis on the 903 area code phone. Ms. Morsley knew the identity of Franklin Davis\n        because, at the time, he was dating a friend and work associate of Ms. Morsley. Ms.\n        Morsley based her identification of the Defendant on the content of the\n        communications with him.\n\n        6. Officers, while looking at the cellular phone data for the cell phone of the victim\n        and that of the Defendant, determined that the phones were in close proximity to each\n        other during the same time frame on the date of the victim’s disappearance.\n\nConcluding that the affidavits stated probable cause supporting the search warrants, the judge denied\n\nthe motions to suppress the photographs of Davis, the items seized from the Dodge Stratus, the items\n\nseized from the apartment, and the contents of Davis’s T-Mobile phone. The judge found that the\n\naffidavit for the search warrant for Davis’s DNA sample did not provide probable cause for\n\nobtaining the buccal swabs specifically, though the judge found that the affidavit did set forth\n\n“sufficient facts to establish probable cause to show that . . . a specific offense had been committed.”\n\nThus, the judge ruled that the DNA buccal swab evidence would not be admitted at trial.\n\n        We have recently set out the law relating to the probable cause required for the issuance of\n\na search warrant:\n\n        The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution mandates that “no\n        Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—56\n       particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\n       seized.” Probable cause exists when, under the totality of the circumstances, there\n       is a fair probability or substantial chance that contraband or evidence of a crime will\n       be found at the specified location. It is a flexible and nondemanding standard.66\n\nWe also set forth the standard of review applicable to a trial judge’s ruling on a motion to suppress\n\nevidence:\n\n       While an appellate court typically reviews a trial judge’s motion-to- suppress ruling\n       under a bifurcated standard, a trial court’s determination whether probable cause\n       exists to support a search warrant’s issuance is constrained solely to the affidavit’s\n       four corners. When we review a magistrate’s decision to issue a warrant, we apply\n       a highly deferential standard of review because of the constitutional preference for\n       searches conducted pursuant to a warrant over warrantless searches. Provided the\n       magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed, we will\n       uphold the magistrate’s probable-cause determination. The magistrate may interpret\n       the affidavit in a non-technical, common-sense manner and may draw reasonable\n       inferences solely from the facts and circumstances contained within the affidavit’s\n       four corners. Appellate courts should not invalidate a warrant by interpreting the\n       affidavit in a hypertechnical, rather than a common-sense, manner. When in doubt,\n       the appellate court should defer to all reasonable inferences that the magistrate could\n       have made.67\n\nIf a trial judge’s ruling regarding a motion to suppress is reasonably supported by the record and is\n\ncorrect under any theory of law applicable to the case, the reviewing court must affirm it.68\n\n       Davis contends on appeal that the affidavits associated with the search warrants for the DNA\n\nsample and photographs, the Dodge Stratus, and the apartment did not set out sufficient facts\n\nconnecting him to Gray’s disappearance. He argues that the only connection between him and\n\nGray’s disappearance found in the four corners of the affidavits, other than the ongoing sexual\n\nassault case, was the statement of Shakeema Morsley, a coworker of Arrington.

He complains Morsley merely deduced that he was the person who contacted her based\n\non the content of their “communications.”\n\n       Davis analogizes the information Morsley provided to a tip from an anonymous informant.\n\nHe emphasizes that the affidavit refers to a single telephone conversation between police and\n\nMorsley in which “no one has any knowledge of who the person is that identifies themselves as Ms.\n\nMorsley.” He contends that the information she provided must be corroborated because the record\n\nsuggests that she was not truthful, accurate, or reliable. Specifically, Davis points to the fact that\n\nMorsley described his relationship with Arrington as a “dating relationship,” when he and Arrington\n\nwere actually married. Therefore, he argues, the trial judge should have suppressed the evidence\n\nobtained from these three warrants.\n\n       Tips obtained “from anonymous or first-time confidential informants of unknown reliability\n\nmust be coupled with facts from which an inference may be drawn that the informant is credible or\n\nthat his information is reliable.”69 However, this requirement does not apply to information obtained\n\nfrom citizens who freely share the information with police without withholding their names.70 The\n\nlatter type of witness, sometimes referred to as a “citizen-informer,” is “presumed to speak with the\n\nvoice of honesty and accuracy.”71\n\n\n       69\n            State v.

App. 1986) (“We decline the\ninvitation to view with the same suspicion usually reserved for anonymous police informants\nwith an unproven record of reliability information given by citizens who report a crime then\nfreely share what information they have with police without withholding their own names.”).\n       71\n        Duarte, 389 S.W.3d at 356; see also Esco v.

Her involvement with this case was happenstance, based on the fact that Davis\n\nchose to contact her, on or near the day Gray was abducted and killed, using the same phone with\n\nwhich he contacted Gray. Morsley did not insist on remaining anonymous and, in fact, freely\n\nidentified herself by name when an officer called her on her phone. The affidavit contains her name\n\nand her phone number. Davis has pointed to no evidence suggesting that Morsley had any motive\n\nto falsely identify herself, to falsely implicate him, or to mislead police in their investigation.\n\nTherefore, Morsley is the type of citizen informer to whom we generally accord a presumption of\n\nhonesty and reliability. We see no reason to abandon this presumption in this case.\n\n       Further, contrary to Davis’s assertions, Morsley’s identification of the 903 caller through the\n\ncontent of their conversations, which would be known only to Davis, was not inherently unreliable.\n\nWe have long held that, when the content of a telephone conversation is offered into evidence, “the\n\nidentity of the speaker is sufficiently established if the message reveals that the speaker has\n\nknowledge of facts that only the speaker would be likely to know.”72\n\n       Moreover, Detective Cook’s statement, that Morsley indicated that Davis and Arrington were\n\nin a “dating relationship,” did not render the information that Morsley provided unreliable. The\n\nrecord reflects that Davis and Arrington had only been married for approximately one month when\n\nhe was arrested for the sexual assaults. Evidence elsewhere in the trial record shows that Morsley\n\ntold the detectives about Arrington’s marriage to Davis. This fact suggests that the failure to\n\n\n\n       71\n         (...continued)\ncitizen whose only contact with the police is a result of having witnessed a criminal act\ncommitted by another, the credibility and reliability of the information is inherent.”).\n       72\n            Earnhart v. State, 582 S.W.2d 444, 448-49 (Tex. Crim. App. 1979).\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—59\nmention their marriage in the affidavit was an oversight on the affiant’s part rather than a\n\nmisstatement by Morsley.73 However, this information was not known to the magistrate when he\n\nsigned these warrants, and we do not consider it in our review of the magistrate’s assessment of\n\nprobable cause. In any case, the reference to Arrington and Davis having a dating relationship was\n\nnot integral to the probable-cause determination. The affidavits made it clear that Morsley knew\n\nDavis through her friend and coworker, Arrington, and was able to deduce from the content of their\n\nconversations that he was the person using the 903 phone number.\n\n       In addition to Morsley’s identification of Davis as the 903 caller, the affidavits informed the\n\nmagistrate that Gray had disappeared suddenly from her high school campus, even though her\n\nmother was waiting for her in front of the school. She was not a defiant child and had never before\n\nrun away from home. She had reported to the Mesquite Police Department that Davis had sexually\n\nassaulted her on several occasions. Davis had been arrested on those charges, and he was awaiting\n\ntrial on them when Gray disappeared. Gray communicated through calls and text messages with the\n\n903 number on the day of her disappearance and the previous day. Telephone records also showed\n\nthat the 903 phone and Gray’s phone had been in proximity to each other when some of those\n\ncommunications occurred. Under the circumstances, the magistrate had a substantial basis for\n\nconcluding that probable cause existed to suspect that Gray had been kidnapped, that Davis was\n\ninvolved in her abduction, and that evidence of that crime might be found in his apartment or in the\n\nvehicle he drove. We conclude that the trial judge did not err in finding that these search warrant\n\naffidavits stated probable cause.\n\n\n\n       73\n          See Dancy v. State, 728 S.W.2d 772, 783 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987) (“A misstatement in\nan affidavit that is merely the result of simple negligence or inadvertence, as opposed to reckless\ndisregard for the truth, will not render invalid the warrant based on it.”).\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—60\n        Further, the only evidence obtained through the execution of the search warrant for the DNA\n\nsample and photos was the buccal swabs and the photographs of Davis that were taken in the jail.\n\nThe trial judge granted Davis’s motion to suppress the buccal swab evidence, and defense counsel\n\naffirmatively stated “no objection” when the State offered the photographs of Davis at trial. Even\n\nwhen the witness described the particular photographs, defense counsel did not object or refer to his\n\npretrial motion to suppress. Under these circumstances, Davis has waived any error in their\n\nadmission.74\n\n        After Gray’s body was recovered, authorities obtained a search warrant for the digital\n\ncontents of Davis’s T-Mobile phone.          Davis argues this warrant was invalid because the\n\naccompanying affidavit was based on officers’ conversations with him which “pertained directly to”\n\nevidence secured through executing the first three warrants. Davis, however, specifies no particular\n\nfacts or evidence, and provides no further explanation of what information in this affidavit was\n\nallegedly derived from evidence seized in the first three searches. Thus, he has not adequately\n\nbriefed this claim.75\n\n        In any event, the warrant affidavit contains ample probable cause independent of any\n\nevidence obtained through the execution of the first three warrants.76 The affiant, Detective\n\n\n        74\n           See Thomas v.

In these\n\ninterviews, Davis described the text messages on his T-Mobile phone—later shown to have been\n\ngenerated by the fake text message application—and stated that he used his phone to record\n\nconversations he had with Gray. In subsequent interviews, Davis confessed that he took Gray from\n\nHebron High School, shot her twice, and stepped on her neck. Therefore, the magistrate reasonably\n\nsurmised that Davis had murdered Gray and that evidence relevant to the murder would be found\n\non his T-Mobile phone.\n\n        The trial judge did not err in denying Davis’s motions to suppress the evidence obtained\n\nthrough the execution of these search warrants. We overrule Davis’s seventh, eighth, ninth, and\n\ntenth points of error.\n\n                                        Photographs of Gray’s Body\n\n        In Davis’s twelfth point of error, he complains that the trial judge erred in overruling his\n\nobjections to State’s Exhibits 40 and 41, which are photographs of Gray’s body. When the State\n\noffered these exhibits, counsel argued that they were prejudicial and did not have probative value.\n\nCounsel asked the trial judge to “do a 403 balancing test” with regard to these two photos.77 The\n\njudge viewed the photos, stated that he found that their probative value substantially outweighed\n\ntheir prejudicial effect, and overruled counsel’s objection.\n\n        Davis argues on appeal that these two photographs, which depict Gray’s body floating in the\n\nriver face down, were “extremely gruesome.” He asserts that the trial judge erred in allowing the\n\n\n        76\n           (...continued)\nsearch warrants have been issued on the basis of an affidavit that included tainted information,\n. . . the warrant is nonetheless valid if it clearly could have been issued on the basis of the\nuntainted information in the affidavit.”).\n        77\n             See TEX .

Nevertheless, his plea of “not guilty” to capital murder placed every\n\nelement of the offense in issue.81 Despite a defendant’s admission of various elemental facts, when\n\nhe pleads “not guilty,” the State retains the right—and indeed the burden—to endeavor to prove the\n\nessential elements of the offense, including the victim’s cause of death, beyond a reasonable doubt.82\n\n       At the time of trial, Rule 403 provided, “[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if\n\nits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the\n\nissues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of\n\n\n\n       78\n            Sonnier v.

These factors include the\n\nnumber of exhibits offered, their gruesomeness, their detail, their size, whether they are black and\n\nwhite or color, whether they are close-up, whether the body depicted is naked or clothed, and the\n\navailability of other means of proof.85 Testimony and photographs of the crime scene can aid the\n\njurors in determining facts such as the manner and means of the victim’s death and the force used.86\n\n       The two photographs at issue appear to be approximately eight by ten inches in size. They\n\nreveal the condition of Gray’s torso, her hair braids, and the clothes she was wearing when the\n\nofficer discovered her floating face down in the river. These photos are not unduly bloody or\n\ngruesome. Gray is clothed and the photos do not show any part of her face or provide a close-up\n\nperspective of her wounds. These two photographs essentially illustrate factual details concerning\n\nGray’s appearance, circumstances, location, and cause of death that the State also introduced through\n\nthe testimony of the officer who found the body and various other witnesses.87 Davis argued that\n\ntwo other photos (State’s Exhibits 38 and 39), which were admitted without objection, adequately\n\n\n       83\n            Montgomery v.

State,88 but Wyatt does not support his contentions.\n\nIn Wyatt, we held that a trial judge did not err in admitting two pictures of the deceased child\n\nvictim’s anus. We noted that the photos showed the victim’s injuries and corroborated the\n\nappellant’s confession.89 In this case, the complained-of photos similarly corroborated both the\n\ninvestigating officers’ testimony and Davis’s confession, in which he admitted shooting Gray in a\n\npark along the river and then rolling her into the river.\n\n       To the extent that Gray’s gunshot wound is visible and her body appears bloated in these\n\nimages, these aspects of the condition of the body were the direct result of Davis’s actions. We have\n\nheld that, “when the power of the visible evidence emanates from nothing more than what the\n\ndefendant has himself done we cannot hold that the trial court has abused its discretion merely\n\nbecause it admitted the evidence.”90\n\n       Under the circumstances, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in deciding that the\n\nprobative value of the photographs substantially outweighed any danger of unfair prejudice.

(Davis does not contest the trial judge’s exclusion of\n\nDefense Exhibit D.) Before Davis’s counsel offered these exhibits, the State had offered into\n\nevidence—and played for the jury—a recording of a telephone conversation between Davis, posing\n\nas a young man known as “D,” and Gray (State’s Exhibit 19A). Davis had secretly recorded the\n\nconversation using his T-Mobile phone while speaking with Gray on the go phone he had purchased.\n\nIn State’s Exhibit 19A, “D” and Gray discussed the sexual assaults committed against Gray and their\n\nimpact on Gray’s life. Defense Exhibits A, B, C, E, F, and G were other surreptitiously-recorded\n\ntelephone conversations between Gray and Davis (pretending to be “D”) that were stored on Davis’s\n\nT-Mobile phone. Davis argues that the judge’s refusal to admit these exhibits denied him his\n\nconstitutional right to due process and a fair trial.\n\n        The record initially received by this Court did not contain any exhibits labeled as Defense\n\nExhibits A, B, C, E, F, and G that matched the descriptions of the complained-of recordings in the\n\nparties’ briefs and the reporter’s record. Upon a request by this Court for the exhibits at issue, the\n\nDallas County Clerk’s Office submitted State’s Exhibit 18, a DVD which was admitted by the trial\n\njudge “for record purposes” only at trial. State’s Exhibit 18 contains an electronic file folder of\n\nrecordings that match the descriptions of the complained-of defense exhibits, though the recordings\n\nare not labeled as Defense Exhibits A, B, C, E, F, or G. We will assume that the recordings\n\ncontained in State’s Exhibit 18 are the exhibits Davis complains were erroneously excluded from\n\nevidence.91\n\n\n        91\n           See TEX . R. APP.

Defense counsel\n\nresponded that the recordings were relevant to statements made by Gray during the DCAC interview\n\nthat “the first time she ever had sex was with Franklin Davis.” The prosecutor disputed this\n\nassertion.

Morever, because the conversations in the recordings\n\ntouched on Gray’s other sexual partners, her family life, and personal matters unrelated to the\n\noffense at bar, the judge could have reasonably concluded that the danger of unfair prejudice,\n\nconfusing the issues, misleading the jury, and undue delay was high. Davis essentially admitted\n\nduring cross-examination that a key purpose for offering these recordings was to impugn Gray’s\n\ncharacter by revealing to the jury her sexual conduct with other men. The inflammatory and\n\nprejudicial nature of this evidence substantially outweighed any minimal probative value it may have\n\nhad.\n\n        Davis also cites Saunders v. State,97 in which the Dallas Court of Appeals held under the\n\npredecessor statute to Article 38.36 that the trial judge erred in excluding evidence of aggressive\n\nconduct by the deceased against the defendant and words exchanged between them immediately\n\nbefore the killing. Saunders offered that evidence at the punishment phase of the trial to explain the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the murder. Davis suggests that, like Saunders, he did not offer Gray’s\n\nstatements in the recordings for the truth of the matters asserted therein, but rather as proof that she\n\nmade the statements and to explain the circumstances surrounding the killing. Again, Davis did not\n\ncite this case or the referenced statute as a ground for admitting the evidence at trial. Therefore, he\n\nfailed to preserve error.98\n\n        Additionally, Saunders is markedly distinguishable from the case at hand. The recordings\n\nat issue were made weeks before Davis killed Gray. They do not include any discussion of Gray’s\n\nrelationship with Davis, evidence of an altercation between Davis and Gray, or any motive or bias\n\n\n        97\n             687 S.W.2d 60 (Tex.

In short, the statements made by Gray in these recordings do not\n\nilluminate the immediate circumstances surrounding Gray’s murder. Further, Davis’s testimony at\n\ntrial suggests that he intended to offer at least some of the remarks in the recordings for the truth of\n\nthe matters asserted. For example, he wanted the jury to believe the statements in these recordings\n\nthat Gray had sexual relationships with other men.            By definition, the exhibits contained\n\ninadmissible hearsay.99\n\n        With regard to Exhibit A, Davis insists that the exhibit was not submitted for the truth of the\n\nmatters asserted, but to show “[Gray’s] state of mind concerning her mindset as to its preoccupation\n\nwith sexual activity and contributed to show how she fabricated the accusations of sexual\n\nmisconduct” against him. Other than Gray’s pre-recorded voicemail greeting, Davis’s statement\n\nannouncing that he was calling Gray in order to “pretty much prove [his] innocence in this charge”\n\ncomprises the only substantive spoken content on this recording. As such, this exhibit consisted\n\nprimarily of a self-serving, out-of-court statement by Davis offered for the truth of the matter\n\nasserted, i.e., his assertion that he was innocent of the sexual assault charges. The recording does\n\nnot contain any statement by Gray about her “then-existing state of mind” or her “emotional,\n\nsensory, or physical condition.”100 Also, defense counsel did not respond to the State’s hearsay\n\nobjection by informing the trial judge that he was not offering the exhibit for the truth of the matter\n\nasserted. Davis’s claim on appeal again does not comport with his argument at trial.101\n\n        With respect to the other exhibits at issue, Davis simply reproduces verbatim several pages\n\n\n\n        99\n             See TEX .

To the extent that\n\nDavis repeats trial counsel’s objections without further argument or citation, these claims are\n\ninadequately briefed.102\n\n       We conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the recordings and\n\nDavis has not demonstrated any due process violation. However, even if the trial judge had erred\n\nin excluding this evidence, Davis was not harmed by the judge’s ruling because the information\n\nDavis sought to impart to the jury was admitted elsewhere.103 During cross-examination, the\n\nprosecutor invited Davis to inform the jury of the “important” content of the excluded recordings.\n\nDavis then testified without objection that Gray had sex with a boy while she was supposed to be\n\nat a track meet, had a sexual relationship with a twenty-year-old man who was in the Army, and had\n\nsex when she was thirteen years old. We overrule Davis’s thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth,\n\nseventeenth, and eighteenth points of error.\n\n       In Davis’s nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first points of error, he argues that the trial judge\n\nerred in sustaining the State’s objections to testimony from defense witnesses Pastor Arty Hayes,\n\nAshlye Sams, and Lamar Leggiton. Davis complains that the trial judge abused his discretion in\n\npreventing these witnesses from testifying about his prior consistent statements. Davis contends that\n\n\n       102\n          TEX .

State.110 With regard to the fourth prong, he specifically argued that\n\nthe prior consistent statements were made “prior to the time that the supposed motive to falsify arose,\n\nwhich was the murder charge.”\n\n\n        106\n              Id. at 808.\n        107\n              Haughton v.

The trial judge overruled the State’s relevance objection and\n\nallowed Hayes to testify about providing counseling to Davis. However, he sustained the State’s\n\npredicate objection and ruled that Hayes would not be permitted to testify about Davis’s prior\n\nconsistent statements.\n\n       The judge allowed the defense to put on an offer of proof showing the prior consistent\n\nstatement that Hayes would have recounted. Hayes testified outside the presence of the jury that he\n\nwas Davis’s sister’s husband. He said he had counseled Davis when Davis came to him for guidance\n\nafter being accused of four counts of sexual assault. Hayes said Davis told him that he did not\n\ncommit the sexual assaults. The trial judge warned Hayes not to testify before the jury about Davis’s\n\nclaims that he was innocent of the sexual assault charges.\n\n       However, Hayes then testified before the jury not only about providing counseling to Davis\n\nconcerning the pending sexual assault charges, but also about Davis’s claims of innocence.\n\nSpecifically, Hayes testified that, when Davis came to him for counseling after being accused of the\n\nsexual assaults, “he was very disturbed about the situation and . . . just wanted to speak with us on\n\nit and—and let us know, you know that[, ‘]I—I’m innocent[,] man. I’m innocent.’” The State did\n\nnot object to this testimony. The trial judge reprimanded the witness for testifying to matters he had\n\nbeen warned not to speak about and cautioned him not to “do it again,” but did not instruct the jury\n\nto disregard this testimony. Hayes went on to testify that he and another pastor had prayed with\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—74\nDavis and his wife over this difficult situation and indicated that he felt sorry for Davis.\n\n       Ashlye Sams testified outside the presence of the jury that she had known Davis all of her\n\nlife. She said that Davis told her that he did not commit the sexual assaults. Lamar Leggiton\n\ntestified outside the presence of the jury that Davis was his best friend. He said that Davis told him\n\nhe was not guilty of the sexual assault charges. Leggiton further stated that Davis seemed more and\n\nmore distraught as time progressed. Davis could not find a job due to the pending sexual assault\n\ncharges and he was afraid of losing his wife. The prosecutor objected that the defense had failed to\n\nlay a proper predicate for the prior consistent statements.\n\n       The judge sustained the State’s objections to Sams’s testimony in total and to the prior\n\nconsistent statements that Leggiton proposed to relay. The judge ruled that the defense would be\n\npermitted to offer Leggiton’s other testimony concerning Davis’s increasingly distraught mental state\n\nand his various stressors, noting that this evidence supported the defensive theory in the case. The\n\ntrial judge then granted defense counsel’s request for time to confer. Following an off-the-record\n\ndiscussion, the defense proceeded with the presentation of unrelated evidence and then rested\n\nwithout calling Leggiton to testify.\n\n       None of these proffered statements met the fourth prong of the Hammons test because they\n\nwere not made “prior to the time that the supposed motive to falsify arose.”111 First, the proffered\n\nstatements from these three witnesses were self-serving protestations by Davis that he was innocent\n\nof the sexual-assault charges, not the murder charge. Thus, the relevant motive to fabricate arose\n\nwhen Davis became aware of the sexual-assault allegations against him, not when he was charged\n\nwith murder. The record reflects that Davis made the statements to Hayes, Sams, and Leggiton after\n\n\n       111\n             See Haughton, 805 S.W.2d at 408.\n\f                                                                                      DAVIS—75\nhe was charged with the four sexual assaults, not after he was charged with the murder—the event\n\nthat Davis relies upon to define when the motive to fabricate arose.\n\n       Morever, even assuming that the trial judge erred in excluding the proffered testimony, that\n\nerror was effectively cured when Hayes violated the judge’s instructions and informed the jury of\n\nDavis’s protestations of innocence. Hayes’s testimony before the jury, which was admitted without\n\nobjection, was substantially equivalent to the testimony Hayes gave outside the jury’s presence and\n\nwas very similar to the prior consistent statements that the defense anticipated eliciting from Sams\n\nand Leggiton. Under the circumstances, any error in excluding the testimony from these witnesses\n\nwas harmless.112\n\n       We overrule Davis’s nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first points of error.\n\n                           “ANTI-SPECULATION” JURY CHARGE\n\n       In his twenty-second point of error, Davis contends that the trial judge erred in refusing his\n\nrequest for a charge on “anti-speculation” during the guilt-innocence stage of the trial. He argues\n\nthat his proposed charge was a correct statement of the law prohibiting jurors from reaching their\n\nverdict based on speculation and contends the judge violated his due process rights in denying his\n\nrequest. Davis argues that the specific “anti-speculation” language that he requested was necessary\n\nto accurately guide the jury in its deliberations. He relies on this Court’s decision in Hooper v.\n\n\n\n\n       112\n           See Mosley v. State, 983 S.W.2d 249, 258 (Tex. Crim.

The trial judge’s instructions cautioned jurors to\n\nconsider only the evidence presented from the witness stand, to not consider any matters or opinions\n\nnot in evidence in their deliberations, and to avoid engaging in “conjecture” in their deliberations.\n\nThese instructions effectively communicated to the jury the same message that Davis\n\nrequested—that the jury must base its verdict on the evidence presented to them from the witness\n\nstand and must not rely upon mere guesswork. As such, the judge’s instructions were consistent with\n\nthe prohibition we stated in Hooper against speculation or factually unsupported inferences or\n\npresumptions.119 Moreover, defense counsel in his closing arguments explained to the jury the\n\nmeaning of this language in the jury charge:\n\n\n\n       118\n          See “Speculation” and “Conjecture.” Merriam-Webster.com.

They want you to look everywhere but\n        [at] what happened on the shores of the Trinity River.\n\n        Davis contends that the above argument, made by the prosecutor in final closing arguments\n\nat the guilt-innocence phase of trial, improperly struck at him “over the shoulders of his counsel.”\n\nHe maintains that, if the prosecutor believed that defense counsel was attempting to mislead the jury\n\nregarding applicable principles of law, then he should have objected to defense counsel’s argument\n\nwhen defense counsel stated it. He asserts that the State acted improperly in refraining from\n\ncontemporaneously objecting to the defense argument at issue and then later accusing defense\n\ncounsel of trying to mislead the jury. He argues the trial judge compounded the problem by\n\noverruling his objection. Davis refers this Court to Fuentes v. State123 and Gomez v. State,124 in\n\nwhich this Court found a prosecutor’s closing arguments to be manifestly improper and harmful.\n\n        Davis also includes portions of our unpublished opinion in York v.

Prior to the prosecutor making these arguments, defense\n\ncounsel, in his closing arguments, had discussed several matters in an apparent attempt to\n\ndraw the jury’s attention away from the facts of the murder and to evoke sympathy for Davis.\n\nFor example, defense counsel informed the jury that Davis had learned gruesome details\n\nsurrounding the murder of his mother when he was fourteen years old. Counsel discussed\n\nthe allegedly flawed representation Davis received in the sexual-assault case, his loss of\n\nincome, the holes in his “baby girl’s” shoes because he could not provide for her, and the fact\n\nthat he had been sexually assaulted as a child. Defense counsel further told the jury that\n\nDavis cooperated with police and freely admitted that he killed Gray, but he never admitted\n\n       132\n          (...continued)\na reasonable deduction from the evidence and an answer to the argument of opposing counsel);\nGarcia v.

State, 991 S.W.2d 267, 274 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (when the\nprosecutor argued that the defense attorney’s cross examination of a State’s witness was an effort\nto “[k]ill the messenger” and that the witness was “one of the strongest pieces of evidence\nagainst their client and they’re bound to try to destroy him in front of you to save his neck,” this\nCourt held “the State’s comments do not attack the veracity or morals of defense counsel but\nrespond to the defense strategy of discrediting the State’s key witness”).\n       134\n           Brown, 270 S.W.3d at 572 (noting that the prosecutor’s argument was improper where\nhe failed to limit himself to the misstatements of opposing counsel, and instead delved into\nmatters outside the record and directly impugned the veracity of opposing counsel).\n\f                                                                                  DAVIS—82\n\nthat he committed the sexual assaults against Gray or that he killed her to prevent her from\n\ntestifying against him. Counsel argued that Davis would not have independently investigated\n\nGray if he were guilty of the sexual assaults. Counsel said Davis was prepared and eager to\n\ngo to trial on the sexual assault charges and “there was no reason for him to kill [Gray] to\n\nprevent her from going to court.” Counsel urged the jury to find Davis guilty only of first-\n\ndegree murder and not capital murder, because the State had not proven that his motive in\n\nmurdering Gray was to keep her from testifying. He also informed the jury that they could\n\ngive Davis “up to a life sentence” for murder.\n\n       The prosecutor’s statements—that Davis “wants you to give him credit and find him\n\nguilty of the lesser[-]included offense of murder. They keep bringing up the punishment\n\nrange. They want you to think about the punishment range”—were a direct response to\n\ndefense counsel’s arguments that urged that jury to choose the lesser-included offense of\n\nmurder, attempted to inspire sympathy for Davis, and reminded the jury that Davis could\n\nreceive a life sentence if convicted of murder. Similarly, the prosecutor’s statement that the\n\ndefense wanted the jurors to “feel better about doing something that’s not supported by what\n\n[Davis] says” was a reasonable deduction from the evidence—including Davis’s\n\ntestimony—and a response to opposing counsel’s arguments.\n\n       Davis testified at trial and admitted that he had created false text messages to offer in\n\nevidence at his sexual-assault trial and had lied in interviews. The prosecutor appears to have\n\nbeen attempting to communicate to the jurors that, despite defense counsel’s arguments\n\f                                                                                   DAVIS—83\n\nurging sympathy for Davis and pressing the jury to consider the lesser offense, Davis’s own\n\nstatements demonstrated that he had been dishonest and was, in fact, so concerned about his\n\nupcoming trial that he was willing to try to intimidate the primary witness (Gray) and\n\nfabricate evidence. In other words, rather than impugning defense counsel’s character, the\n\nprosecutor was suggesting that Davis himself lacked credibility.135\n\n       After the trial judge overruled defense counsel’s objection, the prosecutor then stated,\n\n“That’s why they do that. They want you to look everywhere but [at] what happened on the\n\nshores of the Trinity River.” A logical interpretation of this comment was to suggest that\n\nDavis’s attorneys were trying to misdirect the jury away from the facts of the murder that\n\noccurred on the shores of the Trinity River. Arguably, this remark improperly impugned\n\ndefense counsel’s veracity. But defense counsel did not renew his objection after the\n\nprosecutor made the Trinity River remark. Therefore, Davis did not properly preserve this\n\nparticular complaint for our review.136\n\n       Even if any error regarding this remark had been properly preserved, it would have\n\nbeen non-constitutional error.137 Thus, we would apply the harm standard set out in Texas\n\n\n\n\n       135\n            See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 823 (concluding that prosecutor’s references to appellant as\na con man who was trying to con the jury with his lengthy testimony was a reasonable deduction\nfrom the evidence and an answer to argument of opposing counsel; prosecutor did not strike over\nthe shoulders of counsel, instead he directly attacked the credibility of appellant, who had\ntestified).\n       136\n             See TEX .

Rule 44.2(b) provides that a non-constitutional error\n\n“that does not affect substantial rights must be disregarded.”138 To determine if any error\n\naffected an appellant’s substantial rights, we evaluate three factors: (1) the severity of the\n\nmisconduct (the magnitude of the prejudicial effect of the prosecutor’s remarks); (2) the\n\nmeasures adopted to cure the misconduct (the efficacy of any cautionary instruction by the\n\njudge); and (3) the certainty of conviction absent the misconduct (the strength of the evidence\n\nsupporting the conviction).139\n\n       The prosecutor’s argument implying that the defense attorney was attempting to\n\ndistract the jury, even if improper, was not particularly egregious when compared to the\n\nimproper remarks that constituted reversible error in Gomez and Fuentes. In those cases,\n\nprosecutors accused defense attorneys of manufacturing evidence and of acting in “bad faith\n\nlike usual.”140 We have held remarks similar to those at issue in this case, such as comments\n\nsuggesting that defense attorneys were trying to confuse jurors or lead them down a “rabbit\n\ntrail,” were not harmful to defendants.141 Further, the State’s evidence in this case, including\n\n\n       138\n             TEX .

He also “moves this Court to reconsider prior\n\nrulings on each requested jury charge instruction [or] objection as it applies to the case at\n\nbar.”\n\n        Davis does not provide us with any citations to the complained-of punishment jury\n\ninstructions in the trial record, and refers us occasionally to “page [blank]” for the relevant\n\ncharge language at issue in his sub-points.

He urges us to hold that\n\nthe jury instead be instructed using some form of the word “consider.” He does not cite any\n\nconstitutional right or legal authority supporting his position.

The trial judge instructed\n\nthe jury as authorized by Article 37.071, and did not invite the jurors to render a general\n\nverdict.152 Davis does not cite any constitutional right or legal authority supporting his\n\nposition.153\n\n       In sub-point (7)(c), Davis objects to the instruction that the jury should consider\n\nevidence that “militates for or mitigates against the imposition of the death penalty” because\n\nArticle 37.071 only authorizes the use of this instruction regarding the future dangerousness\n\nspecial issue and does not authorize the use of this instruction with respect to the jury’s\n\nconsideration of the mitigation special issue. However, the record does not support Davis’s\n\ncontentions, as the trial judge gave this instruction with regard to the jury’s consideration of\n\nthe future-dangerousness special issue, and not regarding the mitigation special issue.\n\n\n\n\n       151\n           See Cantu v.

The jury is entitled to consider the defendant’s character,\n\nbackground, and the circumstances of the capital murder he committed in answering the\n\nfuture dangerousness special issue.154 Further, the circumstances of the offense may be\n\nsufficient in egregious cases to sustain a “yes” answer to the future dangerousness special\n\nissue.155\n\n        In sub-point (10), Davis argues that the trial judge erred in wording the instructions\n\nso that the “death option” was always listed first, because this implied that death is the\n\npreferred or default punishment, when the default punishment is actually life imprisonment.\n\nDavis refers us to Texas Penal Code § 12.31(a), which provides: “[a]n individual adjudged\n\nguilty of a capital felony in a case in which the state seeks the death penalty shall be punished\n\n\n\n        154\n           See Young, 283 S.W.3d at 863; see also Gardner v.

He faults the trial judge for refusing to\n\ngive the instruction he requested: “None of you have to agree on why you vote “NO” on\n\nSpecial Issue No. 1 or why you vote “YES” on Issue No. 2 (the mitigation issue).” In this\n\n\n\n       156\n             TEX .

Davis has not\n\ndemonstrated that the trial judge’s instruction was erroneous, nor that his proposed\n\ninstruction was necessary. This sub-point is inadequately briefed and lacks merit.159\n\n       In sub-point (13), Davis objects to the trial judge’s instruction that the State’s proof\n\nmust exclude “all reasonable doubt” because Article 37.071 and the Eighth Amendment\n\nrequire the State to prove the future-dangerousness special issue “beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.” Davis’s punishment charge did not contain the phrase “all reasonable doubt” and\n\ninstead instructed the jurors that the State’s burden of proof on this special issue was “beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.” This sub-point is not supported by the record.\n\n       In sub-point (14), Davis complains that the trial judge did not give his requested\n\ninstruction that each of the jurors, individually, must determine what “a reasonable doubt”\n\nmeans to him.

This sub-point is inadequately briefed and lacks merit.160\n\n       In sub-point (18), Davis argues that the trial judge erred in failing to give an\n\ninstruction he requested which would have forbidden jurors from bullying, harassing, or\n\nintimidating one another, required jurors to pass a note to the bailiff if any juror felt\n\nintimidated, and placed the foreperson in charge of preventing bullying among the jurors.\n\nDavis has not cited any legal authority mandating such an instruction; therefore, this claim\n\nis inadequately briefed.161\n\n       We overrule Davis’s point of error twenty-five.\n\n       Davis does not include any specific claim or argument with regard to point of error\n\ntwenty-six. This point is overruled due to inadequate briefing.162\n\n       In his twenty-seventh point of error, Davis argues that the trial judge erred in giving\n\nthe jury the future-dangerousness special issue because the indictment did not allege that\n\nthere was a probability that he would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute\n\na continuing threat to society. He cites four United States Supreme Court cases in support\n\nof this claim, but he provides no argument explaining the holdings or import of these cases.163\n\nThis Court has previously rejected substantially similar claims that the future dangerousness\n\n\n\n       160\n             See id.\n       161\n             See id.\n       162\n             See id.\n       163\n          Jones v.

We overrule his twenty-seventh point of\n\nerror.\n\n         Davis’s point of error twenty-eight contains eleven sub-points alleging that the trial\n\njudge erred in failing to instruct the jury concerning the meaning of the word “probability,”\n\nas used in the future-dangerousness special issue.

We have decided these claims adversely to Davis’s position and he does not offer any\n\nargument persuading us to change our stance on this issue.167 We overrule point of error\n\ntwenty-nine.\n\n       In his thirtieth point of error, Davis presents four sub-points concerning the phrase\n\n“continuing threat to society,” as used in the future-dangerousness special issue. He\n\ncomplains that the trial judge denied his request to instruct the jury that “continuing threat\n\nto society” does not mean “any threat of harm or death, no matter how minor or remote, that\n\nmight hypothetically be posted, in any place, in or out of prison, for any length of time after\n\nthe jury verdict, no matter how short,” and instead means “a clear and present threat of\n\nserious bodily injury or death to others while in prison, if serving a life sentence” or means\n\nhe “will be so incorrigible that his acts of violence will continue throughout his life.” He\n\nobjects to the trial judge refusing to define “continuing threat to society” and “probability”\n\nso as to select only the “worst of the worst,” because the failure to define the terms may be\n\ninterpreted by jurors to imply that death is the preferred sentence, amounts to a comment on\n\nthe weight of the evidence, and conditions the consideration of mitigating evidence upon the\n\n\n\n       167\n           See Blue, 125 S.W.3d at 504 (overruling complaints about trial judge failing to instruct\nthe jury that “criminal acts of violence” means “an act that resulted in serious bodily injury or\ndeath and not one that was trivial, accidental, reckless, or highly provoked acts” and does not\nmean “mere property crimes not in conjunction or combination with crimes against the person”);\nsee also Earhart, 877 S.W.2d at 767.\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—97\n\ndetermination of future dangerousness.\n\n       Davis offers no further argument in support of these assertions and no citation to legal\n\nauthority. This point of error is not adequately briefed.168 Further, we have consistently held\n\nthat the terms “probability” and “continuing threat to society” do not necessitate special\n\ndefinitions.169 Davis’s point of error thirty is overruled.\n\n       In his thirty-first point of error, Davis presents four sub-points concerning victim-\n\nimpact evidence and the future-dangerousness special issue. He argues that the trial judge\n\nerred in refusing to instruct the jury to not consider victim-impact evidence in connection\n\nwith the future-dangerousness special issue; to hold the State to its burden of proving the\n\nfuture-dangerousness special issue beyond a reasonable doubt; to refrain from engaging in\n\na comparative worth analysis; and to disregard victim-impact evidence that was not shown\n\nto be within Davis’s knowledge or reasonable expectation. He cites Will v. State 170 and\n\nEspada v. State,171 both of which are unpublished opinions and do not support his position.172\n\n\n       168\n             See TEX . R. APP .

He argues the trial judge should have required the State to negate,\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of a mitigating circumstance that would justify a\n\nlife sentence. He complains that the judge did not provide a reasoned and rational moral\n\nprocess for considering mitigating circumstances because the judge provided no burden of\n\nproof or guidance to the jury on this issue. Davis further complains that the trial judge\n\nrefused to grant his request to instruct the jurors that their finding of guilt in the first phase\n\nof the trial did not foreclose consideration of mitigating evidence. He objects that the\n\nreference to “sufficient mitigating circumstance or circumstances” is confusing because one\n\ncircumstance is enough to merit a life sentence.

Lynaugh 175 and Penry v.\n\nJohnson.176 Finally, he objects to the punishment charge as a whole because it fails to permit\n\na discretionary grant of mercy not tied to the requirements of the special issues.\n\n       Davis has included within this point of error multiple distinct legal arguments.\n\nTherefore, the entire point is multifarious and inadequately briefed.177 Further, in light of the\n\nfact that the trial judge instructed the jury in a manner consistent with the requirements set\n\nout in Article 37.071, §§ 2(e) and 2(f), our prior holdings do not support Davis’s claims on\n\nany of his nine sub-points.178 Davis does not provide any reason for us to reconsider our\n\n\n\n\n       175\n             492 U.S. 302 (1989) (Penry I).\n       176\n             532 U.S. 782 (2001) (Penry II).\n       177\n             TEX .

State, 934 S.W.2d 113, 128 (Tex. Crim. App. 1996).\n\f                                                                                    DAVIS—100\n\nposition on these claims.179 We overrule his thirty-second point of error.\n\n         In point of error thirty-three, Davis brings two sub-points complaining of the trial\n\njudge’s failure to inform the jury of applicable law concerning the effect of a “holdout juror”\n\nand the fact that no mistrial will result from their deliberations. Davis argues that he may\n\nassert the jurors’ right to equal protection of the law and due process for them, and the jurors’\n\nconstitutional rights dictate that they should be informed of the legal effect of a holdout juror.\n\nComparing this situation to the judicially-crafted nullification charge at issue in Penry II,180\n\nhe argues that the jurors in his case were likely to give a false answer to the mitigation\n\nquestion “because a juror would feel it [was] impossible to convince nine (9) other jurors to\n\nvote with them.” He further contends that the trial judge’s charge concealed important\n\ninformation from the jurors and thereby violated the requirement in Article 36.14 that the\n\njudge give a charge that “distinctly” sets forth the “law applicable to the case,” the “due\n\ncourse of law” clause of the Texas Constitution, and the Due Process Clause of the United\n\nStates Constitution. He also refers us to Simmons v. South Carolina 181 with regard to this\n\nclaim.\n\n         Article 36.14 requires the trial judge to deliver to the jury “a written charge distinctly\n\nsetting forth the law applicable to the case; not expressing any opinion as to the weight of the\n\n\n\n         179\n               See Busby, 253 S.W.3d at 673.\n         180\n               532 U.S. 782.\n         181\n               512 U.S. 154 (1994) (plurality op.).\n\f                                                                                    DAVIS—101\n\nevidence, not summing up the testimony, discussing the facts or using any argument in his\n\ncharge calculated to arouse the sympathy or excite the passions of the jury.” Article 37.071,\n\n§ 2(a)(1) provides in relevant part that the trial judge, the defendant, and counsel “may not\n\ninform a juror or a prospective juror of the effect of a failure of a jury to agree” on the\n\npunishment special issues.      In this case, the trial judge complied with this statutory\n\nrequirement and refrained from informing the jury of the potential effect of a failure to agree.\n\nDavis has not shown that the judge improperly expressed any opinion as to the weight of the\n\nevidence, discussed the facts of the case, or used any argument “calculated to arouse the\n\nsympathy or excite the passions of the jury.” Thus, he has not demonstrated that the trial\n\njudge violated Article 36.14.\n\n       We have repeatedly upheld the validity of the requirement in Article 37.071, § 2 that\n\nprohibits revealing to jurors the effect of capital jurors’ failure to agree.182          Davis’s\n\napplication of Penry II and Simmons to this statutory requirement combines constitutional\n\narguments we have previously addressed, and does not persuade us to change our position\n\non this matter. In Penry II, the Supreme Court held that a former supplemental “nullification\n\ninstruction” directed capital jurors to return a false answer to one of the special issues and\n\nto ignore the verdict form instructions, if they found a mitigating circumstance that justified\n\n\n       182\n           See Prystash v. State, 3 S.W.3d 522, 532 (Tex. Crim. App. 1999) (“There is no\nconstitutional prohibition to concealing from the jurors the consequences of their deliberations so\nlong as they are not misled into believing that ultimate responsibility for the verdict rests\nelsewhere.”) (internal citations omitted); Shannon v. State, 942 S.W.2d 591, 600 (Tex. Crim.\nApp. 1996) (noting that this Court has “previously addressed and rejected constitutional\nchallenges” to this statutory language “on numerous occasions”).\n\f                                                                                DAVIS—102\n\na life sentence.183 The Supreme Court emphasized that the sentencing jury must be provided\n\nwith “a vehicle for expressing its reasoned moral response” to a defendant’s mitigating\n\nevidence.184 In contrast, the complained-of statutory language did not require the jurors to\n\ndisregard the court’s instructions and give a false answer to a special issue. Further, we have\n\ndetermined that the version of Article 37.071 under which Davis was tried provides a\n\nsufficient vehicle by which the jury can consider and give effect to mitigating evidence.185\n\n       In Simmons, the Supreme Court held that, where the jury must decide the question of\n\nfuture dangerousness, due process principles require a sentencing jury to be informed when\n\na defendant is ineligible for parole.186 Under South Carolina law, Simmons could never be\n\nreleased on parole, and yet the trial judge prohibited the defense from revealing that fact to\n\nthe jury and thereby prevented the defense from rebutting information the sentencing\n\nauthority considered in imposing his death sentence.187 Davis’s punishment charge correctly\n\ninformed the jury that Davis was “ineligible for release on parole.” The instruction at issue\n\ndid not prevent him from rebutting the State’s evidence. Point of error thirty-three is\n\noverruled.\n\n       The heading of Davis’s thirty-fourth point of error refers to “Jones, Apprendi, Ring\n\n\n       183\n             Penry II, 532 U.S. at 799-800.\n       184\n             Id. at 797.\n       185\n             Threadgill v.

He argues that the trial judge erred in failing to include a verbatim copy of the\n\nindictment in the jury charge and failing to instruct the jury to disregard any fact militating\n\nin favor of death that was not alleged in the indictment. He also contends that the judge\n\nshould not have submitted the future-dangerousness special issue to the jury because the\n\nindictment did not allege a probability that Davis would commit criminal acts of violence that\n\nwould constitute a continuing threat to society. The majority of the arguments contained in\n\nthis point of error echo those raised in Davis’s twenty-seventh point of error, which we have\n\noverruled.188 Davis does not provide any additional argument or authority that persuades us\n\nto alter our position. In addition, Davis does not provide any argument or authority\n\nsubstantiating his claim that the trial judge erred in failing to include a verbatim copy of the\n\nindictment in the punishment jury charge.189 We overrule his thirty-fourth point of error.\n\n       In his thirty-fifth point of error, Davis complains that the trial judge erroneously\n\nrefused to grant his request to instruct the jury that: there is no presumption in favor of\n\ndeath; even if they were to find him to be a “future danger,” state law presumes life; and the\n\nlaw is always satisfied with a life verdict.

Dretke,192 which holds that relevant\n\nmitigating evidence is “evidence which tends logically to prove or disprove some fact or\n\ncircumstance which a fact finder could reasonably deem to have mitigating value.” He\n\nacknowledges that this Court has previously rejected his arguments.193 He requests that we\n\nreview these issues again and reverse our position, but he provides no new argument or\n\nauthority in support of his request. Further, he does not explain how the jury instructions that\n\nwere given in this case prevented the jury from giving effect to any of his mitigating\n\nevidence.194 Without more, we decline to overrule our precedent. We overrule these points\n\n\n       190\n           See Russeau, 291 S.W.3d at 436 (holding that “[n]othing in our law” required the trial\njudge to instruct the jury that “there is no presumption in favor of death”); Saldano, 232 S.W.3d\nat 106 (rejecting argument that trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that there is no\npresumption in favor of death).\n       191\n          See TEX .

Error in denying pretrial motion to preclude death as a\n       sentencing option and to declare Article 37.071 unconstitutional because of\n       jurors’ inability to predict future dangerousness;\n\n       Point of Error 43. Error in denying pretrial motion to declare Article 37.071\n       unconstitutional because it has become a de facto mandatory death penalty\n       statute;\n\n       Point of Error 44.

Error in denying pretrial motion to declare Article 37.071,\n       § 2(a) unconstitutional on its face for lack of standards;\n\n       Point of Error 47. Error in denying pretrial motion to hold statutory definition\n       of mitigating evidence unconstitutional as applied because it imposes a\n       “nexus” limitation and to grant Davis’s requested voir dire, instruction,\n       argument, and motion in limine; and\n\n       Point of Error 48.

Gray began babysitting Dibrell’s three children after school. One of those\n\nthree children was Davis and Dibrell’s daughter, Dezire. Gray-James would drop Gray off\n\nat Dibrell’s apartment each time she was scheduled to babysit. In March 2011, Gray-James\n\nnoticed some text messages on Gray’s phone from a person named “Wish.” Gray-James had\n\nmet Davis and knew that “Wish” was his nickname. In one of the text messages, Wish asked\n\nGray why she was not coming to babysit anymore. In another message, Wish stated, “That’s\n\n\n\n       2\n           See TEX . CODE CRIM .

So I’m supposed to sit around and wait? Man. Whatever.” Gray responded, “Nope.\n\nYou[’re] getting mad for what?      You got two for the price of one. What [are] you\n\ncomplaining for? Tryna [sic] have your cake and eat it too.” Davis answered, “Just want you\n\nbut can’t fully have you yet.” When Gray-James asked Gray about the messages, Gray\n\nbecame very upset and began crying.\n\n       Gray-James then drove to Dibrell’s apartment with Gray and showed Dibrell the\n\nmessages. Dibrell called Davis and told him that Gray-James was upset about the text\n\nmessages. Gray-James felt that Dibrell reacted in a “nonchalant” manner, and she demanded\n\nto speak with Davis herself. Dibrell instructed her to call him the next day. When Gray-\n\nJames sent Davis a text message the next morning, he responded that Gray was lying. He\n\nclaimed that, when he sent the messages to Gray, he thought that someone was playing a\n\nprank with the phone and did not know he was corresponding with Gray. Gray-James told\n\nDavis that he was the liar and she would go to the police.\n\n       Davis preemptively called the police himself. He told the responding officer that,\n\nwhen Gray texted him, he did not know who it was and he “did not know Shania had a cell\n\nphone.” He said that he was just “playing around” with an unknown correspondent.\n\nHowever, in a later interview with Detective Brandon Snyder, Davis changed his story and\n\nadmitted he knew he was corresponding with Gray. He said that his text message to Gray,\n\nstating that he wanted her, was really intended to inform her that she was “too young” and\n\nthat was why he could not “see her.”\n\f                                                                                   DAVIS—4\n\n       The day after Gray-James talked to Dibrell, Gray was visibly upset and crying at\n\nschool. She confided in two sisters who were her close friends. She told them that she had\n\nbeen babysitting and this “guy” started “messing with her, touching her and stuff like that.”\n\nGray told the older sister that the sexual encounters had started out “as a habit,” but the man\n\nhad gotten “rough” with her. She told her that he threw her on the bed, threatened her with\n\na “[s]amurai sword,” and told her “If you tell, I’m going to kill you and your family.” The\n\nsisters convinced her to come home with them after school and tell their mother what had\n\nhappened. Gray then revealed to their mother that she had been sexually assaulted multiple\n\ntimes while she was babysitting. Their mother convinced her that she needed to tell her own\n\nmother. Gray then told Gray-James about the sexual assaults.\n\n       Gray-James contacted the school resource officer at Gray’s school, Horn High School.\n\nShe also took Gray to the Mesquite Police Department and met with Detective Snyder.\n\nSubsequently, she took Gray to the Dallas Children’s Advocacy Center (DCAC) for a\n\nvideotaped interview and then to the Children’s Medical Center for a physical examination.\n\n       In the DCAC interview, Gray described four separate sexual assaults in which Davis\n\npenetrated her vagina when she fourteen years old—three at Dibrell’s apartment and one at\n\nDavis’s apartment.    Snyder obtained an analysis of the content of Gray’s phone and\n\ndiscovered that she had Davis’s birthday listed in her phone’s calendar. He also viewed the\n\ntext message exchange between Wish and Gray that had distressed Gray-James.\n\n       Later, Davis was arrested for sexual assault and began having scheduled court dates.\n\f                                                                                 DAVIS—5\n\nGray was planning to testify against Davis in his trial. Several months passed, during which\n\nGray’s family prepared to move from Mesquite to Carrollton, Texas, and Gray started\n\nattending Hebron High School in Carrollton.\n\n       On September 6, 2012, Gray informed her mother that she was going to attend after-\n\nschool tutoring for her physics class, and Gray-James planned to pick her up at school after\n\nthe tutoring. During the tutoring session, Gray sent a text message to her mother telling her\n\nthat she was almost done. Gray-James parked in front of the school at around 4:00 p.m. and\n\nwaited for Gray, but Gray never came out to meet her. Gray-James called and sent text\n\nmessages to Gray repeatedly. She went to a nearby Starbucks and used her laptop to try to\n\nlocate Gray’s phone with no success. She returned to the school and found that the physics\n\nclassroom where Gray had gone for tutoring was locked and dark. She contacted the physics\n\nteacher, who stated that Gray had left tutoring when it ended at 4:15 p.m. A group of\n\nteachers and coaches helped Gray-James search the school and the nearby football stadium,\n\nbut they found no sign of Gray.\n\n       Gray-James contacted the Hebron High School resource officer, Officer Forest Cole\n\nLangston. Officer Langston became very concerned when he spoke to the Horn High School\n\nresource officer and learned that Gray was the named victim on four sexual assault\n\nindictments and Davis was the defendant charged in those cases. Officer Langston reviewed\n\nsurveillance footage showing that Gray had exited Hebron High School through a back door\n\nnormally used by coaches. A still photo from a surveillance camera showed a gray Dodge\n\f                                                                                DAVIS—6\n\nStratus parked nearby. Further investigation indicated that this car matched the description\n\nof a vehicle owned by Davis’s wife, Jawanna Arrington Davis (hereafter “Arrington”).\n\n       Meanwhile, on the evening of September 6th, Davis picked Arrington up after work\n\ndriving her Stratus. She noticed a strong smell of cologne in the car and wondered if Davis\n\nwas trying to cover up the smell of a woman. They drove to the hospital because Davis said\n\nthat he had injured his arm at the gym. However, he only waited about ten minutes and then\n\nleft before seeing a doctor. They went home and took a bubble bath together. Arrington said\n\nDavis was being more affectionate than normal and they “were intimate” that night.\n\n       The missing person case was assigned to Detective Dena Williams of the Carrollton\n\nPolice Department. Gray-James gave Williams access to Gray’s cell phone records and the\n\npasswords to her social media accounts. Officers discovered that the phone number that\n\nGray had communicated with immediately before and after she sent the last text message to\n\nher mother had a 903 area code. Gray-James did not recognize this number. Williams\n\nobtained call records for both Gray’s phone and the 903 phone number.\n\n       Detective Snyder testified that he tried to determine who had purchased the phone\n\nwith the 903 number but could not uncover this information. However, he determined that\n\nthe 903 phone number had contacted another number on the day of Gray’s disappearance.\n\nOfficers called this number and discovered that it belonged to Shakeema Morsley, a\n\ncoworker and friend of Arrington’s. Morsley gave police full access to her phone and text\n\nmessages. They discovered that the person using the 903 phone number had asked Morsley\n\f                                                                                 DAVIS—7\n\nto tell him where her new apartment was located. He had refused to tell Morsley his name,\n\nbut provided hints to his identity. Based on the various contextual clues, Morsley deduced\n\nthat this person was Davis. She refused to give him her new address.\n\n       Morsley also gave Arrington’s phone number to Detective Williams. Williams called\n\nArrington. Within a few minutes, Arrington handed the phone to Davis and he spoke with\n\nWilliams. Williams told him she was investigating a missing child. Davis acted very\n\nconcerned. Williams asked Davis if he knew anything about the 903 phone number. He\n\ndenied any knowledge of it.\n\n       Officers conducted surveillance on Davis and Arrington’s apartment and the Dodge\n\nStratus, which was parked in the apartment complex parking lot. While officers were\n\nwatching, Davis exited the apartment and began walking toward the officers.            They\n\nhandcuffed him for their safety because he was known to be a bodybuilder and to carry a\n\npistol. They walked with him back to the apartment because he said his knees were hurting\n\nand mosquitoes were biting him. They removed the handcuffs and requested that he follow\n\nthem to the police department to discuss Gray. Davis agreed to come with them and,\n\naccompanied by Arrington, he drove to the police department in the Dodge Stratus.\n\n       Williams interviewed Davis at the police department. Davis said that he felt that Gray\n\nhad falsely accused him of sexual assault. He told Williams that he had text messages from\n\nGray on his phone proving that she had lied about the sexual assaults. He denied having any\n\nknowledge of the 903 phone number or Gray’s current location and denied having any recent\n\f                                                                                DAVIS—8\n\ncommunications with Morsley.\n\n       While Davis was being interviewed, Arrington gave consent for the police to retain\n\nher Dodge Stratus for processing. Canine handlers brought a “cadaver dog” (trained to\n\nsearch for the scent of a decaying body) and a dog trained to alert to Gray’s scent to the\n\nparking lot at the police station. Both dogs displayed a positive reaction to the Dodge\n\nStratus. At some point after the interview with Williams, Davis was arrested on the basis of\n\noutstanding traffic ticket warrants.\n\n       Detectives Edward Teniente and Jeremy Chevallier also assisted with the\n\ninvestigation. They received cell phone tower data for Davis’s T-Mobile phone, which\n\nshowed that his phone was at or near Hebron High School at 4:01 p.m. on September 6th,\n\nwhich was around the time that Gray had disappeared. Davis indicated to officers at the jail\n\nthat he wished to speak with detectives. Teniente and Chevallier brought Davis into an\n\ninterview room and read him his Miranda5 rights. In this interview, the detectives informed\n\nDavis about the cell tower data. Davis admitted that he had been speaking with Gray on the\n\nphone and recording their conversations to document discrepancies between what she said\n\non the phone and what she said in the police reports. He continued to deny having had any\n\ncontact with Gray on the day she disappeared. Davis was returned to the jail after this\n\ninterview.\n\n       About an hour and a half later, Davis indicated that he wanted to talk to Detective\n\n\n\n       5\n           Miranda v. Arizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966).\n\f                                                                                    DAVIS—9\n\nChevallier again. Chevallier and Teniente retrieved Davis from the jail for a third recorded\n\ninterview.   They asked him if he remembered the rights Chevallier had read to him\n\npreviously. Davis said he did and then stated:\n\n       A lot of the information that y’all say y’all have, it’s not correct . . . .\n       Honestly, I felt like that with a lot of the information that you was [sic] saying\n       to me, that I would have been able to, been able to walk but I wouldn’t be able\n       to live with myself because I done it [sic].\n\n       Davis admitted to the officers that he had met Gray at the high school in the parking\n\nlot on the day of the offense. He explained that, about two and one-half months before the\n\nday he met Gray at the school, he adopted a false identity and began communicating with\n\nGray using a “go phone” with a 903 phone number. Davis had selected a young man’s\n\nprofile photo from Facebook that he thought Gray would like. He told Gray that this was a\n\nphoto of him and his nickname was “D.” Davis told Gray that he (“D”) had seen her on\n\nFacebook and he was “looking for a new friend, someone to get to know.” He assured her\n\nit was “nothing sexual.” Davis told the officers that he used this “D” alias to have telephone\n\nconversations with Gray on the go phone and recorded those conversations using his T-\n\nMobile phone.\n\n       Posing as “D,” Davis persuaded Gray to trust him. He induced her to talk about the\n\nfirst time she had sex and other personal matters. She eventually talked about the sexual\n\nassaults. Davis insisted to the detectives that Gray’s account to “D” of the sexual assaults\n\nwas not the same as the account in the police report. He said that he felt he got what he\n\n“needed” for his trial from the recorded conversations with Gray. He told the officers that\n\f                                                                                    DAVIS—10\n\nhe had not talked to Gray in a while, but then he decided he wanted to talk to her “face-to-\n\nface” and renewed contact with her on September 5th.\n\n       Davis recalled that, when Gray first saw him at the school on September 6th, she said,\n\n“Oh, shit.” He said he reassured her that he was not going to hurt her and she got into the\n\ncar with him voluntarily. He then drove to a park area. He asked her “why she [had] lied and\n\nsaid things that she did to get [him] in trouble.” Davis said Gray responded that her “mama\n\nmade her do it.” He said, “I told her I had been sitting outside her house and my demons was\n\n[sic] weighing on me so bad to where I wanted to kill everybody in that house.” He said that\n\nhe called this part of him “Wish,” which was “the dark side of me that I let go years ago.”\n\n       Davis told the officers that he and Gray got out of the car at the park and started\n\nwalking down a trail. He said that he was “trying to tell her how much she had fucked up\n\n[his] whole life with the lies that she told.” He said they walked off the trail, and he pulled\n\nthe gun out. He shot Gray, but he was not sure where he had hit her. She fell into the water.\n\nHe said Gray lay in the water for a second, “trying to act like she was dead.” He shot her\n\nagain. He said she cried and said, “[W]hy Wish?” He said he threw her jacket down to her\n\nto get her out of the water. He explained: “I wanted to stop but . . . I felt like if I would have\n\nstopped she would have told what had happened . . . . So I told her to lay [sic] down on the\n\ngrass. And she laid [sic] down on the grass . . . . I put my foot on her neck and I pressed\n\ndown.” Davis said Gray grabbed his leg for about three seconds, then let go. He said, “I\n\nasked her to forgive me.” He then rolled her body into the water and left the park. He said\n\f                                                                               DAVIS—11\n\nhe drove out of the parking lot and then pulled back in because he wanted to go to help her,\n\nbut he knew it was too late. He told the detectives that he was sorry for what he had done.\n\n       Detective Teniente asked Davis if he always carried a gun. He shook his head “no.”\n\nDavis said he initially obtained the gun to use it on himself. He was not sure when he\n\ndecided to use it on Gray. Davis said he threw the gun out the window while driving down\n\nthe highway. He said he also threw Gray’s cell phone and the go phone out the window. He\n\nsaid he left Gray’s backpack with her body.\n\n       At the end of the interview, Gray agreed to accompany the officers to locate Gray’s\n\nbody. He rode with the officers in an unmarked vehicle. In the meantime, a bicycle officer\n\nhad already found Gray’s body floating in the Trinity River and found her backpack nearby.\n\nWhen Chevallier and Teniente asked Davis to take them “to where it happened,” he led them\n\nto the place where the crime scene team was already in the process of recovering Gray’s\n\nbody. He also led them to the locations where he had thrown the gun into a pond, where he\n\nhad thrown Gray’s phone into another pond, and where he had disposed of his shoes in a\n\nsewer drain.\n\n       The autopsy revealed that Gray’s body had undergone a substantial amount of\n\ndecomposition while floating in the water. She had been shot once in the shoulder and once\n\nin the back. She had further suffered forceful asphyxia to her neck. The medical examiner\n\nrecovered one bullet lodged in her body. The examiner ruled that the cause of Gray’s death\n\nwas homicidal violence, including the two gunshot wounds, asphyxia due to neck\n\f                                                                                      DAVIS—12\n\ncompression, and possible drowning.\n\n       The police also located a Diamondback .380 pistol at the edge of a pond, Gray’s phone in\n\nanother pond, and Davis’s shoes in a sewer drain, where Davis told them they would be. Davis’s\n\ngo phone was never found. A senior forensic scientist specializing in firearms testified that the\n\nDiamondback .380 pistol was compared to a bullet and two cartridge casings found near Gray’s\n\nbody, as well as the bullet recovered from her body. His analysis showed that the Diamondback .380\n\npistol fired the bullets and ejected the casings.\n\n       On September 9, 2012, after Detective Williams viewed the autopsy, she received a message\n\nthat Davis wanted to speak with detectives again. In this fourth interview, Davis told them where\n\nhe disposed of a soiled “Scarface” blanket from the car, the sweat pants he was wearing at the time\n\nof the shooting, and the magazine for his gun. He again described the killing and how he had\n\ncontacted Gray using his go phone pretending to be a different person. Davis continued to insist that\n\nhe had never had sex with Gray. He said, when he picked Gray up on September 6th, she told him\n\nshe would tell the “truth,” meaning she would recant the sexual assault charges. Williams expressed\n\ndisbelief in Davis’s story. She asked him why he would kill Gray if she was planning to recant the\n\ncharges. Davis simply responded, “That’s what happened.” He asked Williams if “[t]his was a\n\ncapital murder.” After Williams confirmed that the charge would be capital murder, Davis stated,\n\n“It should be.”\n\n       Secret Service Special Agent Jeff Shaffer used a digital forensic tool to analyze Davis’s T-\n\nMobile cell phone. He discovered that the 903 phone number for the go phone used to call Gray and\n\nMorsley on September 6th was listed as a contact called “Throw Away” in Davis’s T-Mobile phone\n\nand then later deleted. The phone also contained a photo of Gray in a bikini top and shorts which\n\f                                                                                      DAVIS—13\nwas downloaded on July 13, 2012, and again on September 5, 2012.\n\n       Forensic analysis revealed that Davis had used his phone to log into Facebook under the\n\nname “Jazmine Brown.” Using the Brown profile, he searched for and located Gray’s Facebook\n\npage. Davis (posing as Brown) sent Gray a message on Facebook on May 1, 2012, saying “Hey,\n\nShania, I’m new in the city and trying to find a cool female to befriend without the drama. I like to\n\nshop my butt off. LOL . . . . Get back at me if we have some things in common.”\n\n       On July 10, 2012, Davis hired a new defense attorney for the sexual assault case. On July\n\n18, 2012, he used his T-Mobile phone to search the Internet for “Can you record a person without\n\nthem knowing in Texas” and “[b]est way to get off of a sexual assault charge.” Also on July 18th,\n\nDavis searched for “with no proof that you did the murder can you still be held in jail[?]” The next\n\nday, he searched for “can you voice record of [sic] minor over the phone in [T]exas” and “can tape\n\nrecorded conversation with a person story changing get you off a charge.” He performed similar\n\nsearches on July 23, 2012. He called and exchanged text messages with Gray hundreds of times\n\nbetween July 17, 2012, and August 1, 2012, using the go phone.\n\n       On August 24, 2012, the trial judge formally scheduled Davis’s sexual-assault trial for\n\nOctober 29, 2012. On August 27th, Davis installed on his T-Mobile phone an application called\n\n“Fake Call & SMS & Call Logs.” On the same day, text messages appearing to be from Gray’s\n\nphone were created on Davis’s phone, including the following messages:\n\n       Sorry I li3d on u but my momma mad3 m3 do it. If we go to court ima t3ll th3m u\n       never touched me. My momma go b3 mad @ m3 but fuck that bitch I can’t stand her\n       no ways. Please 4give me. . . .\n\n       I beli3v3 if I t3ll the truth sh3 will punish m3 for a long tim3 and I want to b3 able\n       to play basketball.\n\nAndrew Hoog, a mobile forensics security expert, testified that he used specialized technology to\n\f                                                                                     DAVIS—14\nanalyze Davis’s T-Mobile phone. Hoog determined that the above application was used to create\n\nthese messages on Davis’s phone.\n\n       On August 28, 2012, Davis used his T-Mobile phone to search for gun shows. On August\n\n29, 2012, he made five calls using his T-Mobile phone to a contact named “Chris.” The next day,\n\nhe used his T-Mobile phone to search for prices on a Diamondback .380 pistol. Police used the\n\nserial number on the Diamondback .380 pistol found in the pond and traced the firearm back to a\n\nregistered owner named Christopher Allen. Allen testified that he is the brother of Davis’s ex-\n\ngirlfriend, Linda Crawford. He said that Davis called him around August 28 or 29, 2012, and asked\n\nabout buying a handgun from him. Allen agreed to sell Davis the Diamondback .380 pistol for just\n\nunder $200. He sold the gun to Davis a few days later. Davis paid him in cash.\n\n       On the evening of September 5, 2012, Davis (posing as “D”) used the go phone to contact\n\nGray again. Phone records showed that, when he initiated these new communications with Gray,\n\nthe go phone was “hitting off” a cell tower close to her home. He told Gray, “I miss you” and “When\n\ncan I see you?” Gray asked for a “pic” of “D,” but Davis did not send her a photo. The next\n\nmorning, Davis and Gray continued exchanging text messages. He asked, “What time do you get\n\nhome from school?” Around lunchtime, Davis told her, “I’m going to be in your area today. I owe\n\nyou something too.” She asked, “Do you?” He responded, “Yep money money yeah yeah lol.” She\n\nresponded, “Lol yay.!!!” Twice, he asked whether Gray and her mother would be dropping off her\n\nstepfather that day. She answered, “Nope.” At 1:53 p.m., Davis used his T-Mobile phone to search\n\nfor “hebron high school” and looked up the address of the school in the map “app” on his T-Mobile\n\nphone. He also used the map app to look up Sam Houston Trail Park, where Gray’s body was\n\neventually found.\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—15\n       Around mid-afternoon, Gray told Davis: “You don’t have to come all inside the school.”\n\nShe sent a message to him at 3:46 p.m. asking, “Where are you?” He responded, “Kids park.” At\n\n4:01 p.m. Davis’s T-Mobile phone “hit off” the cell tower that was right next to Hebron High\n\nSchool, indicating that he was close to the school. At around 5:06 p.m., his phone and Gray’s phone\n\nwere both “hitting off” the cell tower near his apartment. After 5:17 p.m., Gray’s phone stopped\n\nreceiving and sending any data, indicating that it was no longer in contact with the network.\n\nSimilarly, after 5:15 p.m., Davis’s go phone stopped sending and receiving data. An expert testified\n\nthat this could happen when a phone was thrown into water.\n\n       Davis’s T-Mobile phone also contained a recorded conversation between Davis (posing as\n\n“D”) and Gray. In this phone conversation, “D” asked Gray, “What about the person with your big\n\nsecret?” She responded, “He’s permanently locked up . . . . he is permanently in jail. We didn’t talk\n\nin the first place.” He asked, “How did he get in jail if y’all [sic] didn’t talk.” She said, “It’s\n\ncomplicated” and told him to change the subject, but he continued to ask her questions about it. He\n\nasked her how he broke the law and she answered, “he committed a crime against me.” He asked,\n\n“He raped you?” She said, “New subject. Damn it.”\n\n       Gray told “D” about her little brother’s autism and severe disabilities. She discussed her\n\nfeelings about her real father, who had died before she was born. Later, she returned to the subject\n\nof the sexual assaults and their impact on her: “What happened, it fucked my mind up [sic]. It really\n\ndid . . . . He got inside my head.” “D” tried to get her to discuss the matter further. Gray said that\n\nshe was about to start therapy for this incident and she really did not want to talk about it. She told\n\nhim that the man who sexually assaulted her was in his late twenties and,\n\n       [He] got into my head. I mean – at first I was going to cover for him [–] that’s how\n       stupid I was. I don’t know what the hell I was thinking. I was going to cover up and\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—16\n       take all the blame. And then my mama caught us . . . . I had a babysitting job and\n       he was the father of the kids I was babysitting . . . . He think[s] he [is] going to run\n       away from that. Not like that. I was a child.\n\n       Gray explained how Davis would come to the apartment and harass her while she was\n\nbabysitting and Dibrell was not there. Gray said Dibrell did not provide adequate clothing, shoes,\n\nor food for the children, so she started taking the children to the store for food whenever she would\n\nbabysit. She said the kids acted so happy when she came to babysit, that she “kind of felt trapped,\n\nlike, like [the] kids wasn’t [sic] going to have what they needed unless I came. And if I did come\n\nover, I [ran] the risk of running into him again.” “D” asked her, “How many times did he sexually\n\nassault you?” She said, “Probably three or four different times.”\n\n       She explained that she knew she would have to testify at the trial if Davis did not plead\n\nguilty. She said she did not want to be at the trial and she wished that he would plead guilty and\n\nmake the case disappear. She felt that her mom was blaming her for what had happened and she,\n\ntoo, began to think that it was her fault. After “D” prodded her for more detail about the assaults,\n\nshe told him about the first time Davis sexually assaulted her. She said Davis told the children to\n\ngo into the other room and not come out and then he “got what he wanted.” She said she was afraid\n\nof Davis so she did not tell anyone about the sexual assaults. She explained that she was intimidated\n\nby Davis, who was a large, muscular bodybuilder who took out his samurai swords and played with\n\nthem in front of her. She also did not tell anyone because she was afraid that people would blame\n\nher. She said that she was a good student but, around the time of the sexual assaults, she could not\n\nconcentrate at school and her grades dropped.\n\n       “D” told Gray a story about his cousin whom, he claimed, a woman falsely accused of rape.\n\nIn his story, the accuser was eventually charged with “false imprisonment” and “they locked her up\n\f                                                                                          DAVIS—17\nthat day.” He asked Gray if Davis had any information about her that he could use to discredit her\n\nin that way. She said Davis did not. She explained to “D” that she had given depositions. He asked\n\nher why she did not just tell everyone that she had lied, so that they would drop the charges. He said\n\nthat, because she was a minor, they would not be able to do anything to her. She said that her parents\n\nhad wanted her to file the charges, and she could not drop them. He suggested that Davis might have\n\na grudge against her and might come after her after he went to “the pen.” Gray simply responded,\n\n“no.” She added that Davis had lied about some text messages. When the phone conversation\n\nended, Gray had not agreed to recant the charges, nor had she stated that she lied about the sexual\n\nassaults.\n\n        After the State presented its case in chief, Davis took the stand in his own defense. Defense\n\ncounsel started off by asking him, “Frank, why is Shania dead?” Davis responded, “Because I killed\n\nher.” Counsel asked, “Why did you kill her?” Davis answered, “Because she ruined my life.” Davis\n\nsaid that Gray had a crush on him because he is a “charmer,” but he insisted that he never had sexual\n\nrelations with Gray. He described having sex one time with Dibrell after he got engaged to\n\nArrington. He said Dibrell had told Gray about this incident. He claimed that Gray’s text message\n\nthat he was trying to “have [his] cake and eat it too” actually referred to him having sex with his wife\n\nand Dibrell.\n\n        Davis further testified that, after he was charged with sexual assault, he lost his job, he could\n\nnot provide for his family, and his wife looked at him like he was “less than a man.” He blamed this\n\nmisfortune on “Shania’s lies.” He was frustrated with his attorney’s lack of efforts on his behalf and\n\ndecided he needed to conduct his own “investigation.” Davis admitted creating the fake Facebook\n\npage in the name of “Jazmine Brown” to try to access Gray’s Facebook page. Gray did not accept\n\f                                                                                      DAVIS—18\nthe friend request from Jazmine Brown, so Davis asked his nephew, Dominique Elkins, for his\n\nFacebook password. Davis sent a friend request to Gray while logged into Facebook as Elkins. Gray\n\naccepted that friend request. Davis then obtained Gray’s mobile phone number from her Facebook\n\npage. He searched on Facebook for a man with an attractive profile picture with light skin and a\n\nmuscular build. He found a young man meeting this description, then sent the man a message from\n\nhis Jazmine Brown alias telling him that a friend (i.e., Gray) might be trying to contact him but he\n\nshould not have any contact with her because she was too young. That night, Davis started sending\n\ntext messages to Gray using a go phone that he had purchased for this purpose. He told Gray through\n\ntext messages that he was the man with light skin and muscular build from Facebook.\n\n       Davis said he and Gray exchanged text messages for a while and then she began calling him.\n\nHe recorded their phone conversations using his T-Mobile phone by setting the go phone on the\n\n“speaker[ ]phone” setting. He recorded about seven conversations, though two or three of them did\n\nnot have much content. He said Gray made statements in their phone conversations that he believed\n\nwere inconsistent with statements she made in the DCAC interview. For example, he said that, on\n\nthe phone, Gray only described three sexual incidents with him, yet she told the DCAC interviewer\n\nthey had sex four times. Also, Gray told him that, when she had sex with him in his apartment, it\n\noccurred in his bedroom, but she told the DCAC interviewer that it occurred in his bathroom. (The\n\nrecord shows that Gray explained in both interviews that Davis’s bathroom was connected to his\n\nbedroom and he came into the bathroom to get her). He also pointed to her statement in the\n\nrecordings that she had had sex for the first time before her first encounter with him.\n\n       Davis said he took his recordings of the phone conversations to his lawyer, whose “judgment\n\nwas kind of iffy” about them. Davis said he decided he wanted to play the recorded phone calls for\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—19\nGray’s parents. He drove to Gray’s house the next day and sat for a while in his car watching Gray\n\nplaying basketball with her little brother at the nearby park. He debated whether to go inside and talk\n\nto Gray’s parents. He called Linda Crawford, the mother of one of his children, and she told him\n\nabout an application that would generate fake text messages. Instead of talking to Gray’s parents,\n\nhe decided to use the application to make some fake text messages from Gray. He decided this\n\nwould give him a little “extra push” to get the prosecutor to dismiss the case against him. He\n\nadmitted creating the false text messages from Gray presented by the State. He said he also\n\nmentioned to Crawford that he wanted to get a gun so he could go to the shooting range. She put\n\nhim in touch with her brother, Chris Allen. Davis bought the Diamondback .380 from Allen about\n\na week before he shot Gray with it.\n\n       Davis also admitted performing the Internet search asking whether a person would stay in\n\njail on a murder charge if investigators could not find the body. Davis stated that he did the last\n\nsearch because of “the thoughts going through [his] head of wanting to do harm to Shania . . . she\n\nruined my life. I wanted to ruin hers.”\n\n       Davis said he shared his thoughts with his wife, Arrington, and she told him it was too much\n\nfor her to “deal with.” He said that was when it really started “eating at” him. He was “thinking\n\nabout hurting [himself], hurting other people,” specifically Gray. He said he drove out to Gray’s\n\nhome on or around September 5th with his new gun, intending to “kill everybody in the house.” He\n\nsat outside for a while and “couldn’t get the thought out of [his] head.” He got out of his car and\n\nwent into their front yard, but he did not go inside. He thought about Gray’s innocent little brother\n\nwith his health issues. Davis decided against killing them and drove home.\n\n       Davis said he renewed contact with Gray around that time using the go phone and posing as\n\f                                                                                      DAVIS—20\n“D.” Davis explained the gap in their communications by telling Gray that he had been in school\n\nand had turned off his phone to focus on his studies. He said he was “speaking of money so she\n\nwould want to meet up” with him. He arranged to meet her after school at Hebron High School.\n\nThey agreed to meet at the parking lot by the tennis courts. Davis said that, when Gray came out of\n\nthe school and saw him instead of “D,” she “froze up” and said, “Oh, shit.” He approached her and\n\nassured her he was not going to hurt her. She walked with him to his car and got into the passenger\n\nseat. He started the car and pulled away. She objected, saying that her mother was waiting for her\n\non the other side of the school. Davis said he continued driving because he wanted to kill her. He\n\nplaced the gun between his legs while he was driving.\n\n        Davis further testified that he took Gray to Sam Houston Trail Park. He ordered Gray to\n\ndelete the text message exchanges with “D” and then turn her phone off, and she complied. They\n\nsat in the car for a while and he berated her for having a happy life. Davis said he was thinking of\n\nhow he was raped by both his grandfather and his brother and how his youngest daughter had holes\n\nin her shoes because he could not provide for her. He told Gray to leave her phone in the car and\n\nmade her walk down the slope toward the river, and then he shot her. He was aiming for her head.\n\nShe fell into the water, and then he shot her again. He walked down the slope to make sure she was\n\ndead. She asked, “Why, Wish[?]” and told him that the right side of her body was going numb. He\n\nthrew her the end of her jacket and pulled her out of the water, injuring his tricep muscle in the\n\nprocess. He told her to lie down, then he stepped on her neck and held his foot there. She briefly\n\nreached up and touched his ankle and then her hand fell. He rolled her into the water and then he\n\nleft.\n\n        Davis described the four police interviews he gave. He admitted that he lied in the first two\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—21\ninterviews and that he continued to lie about the fake text messages throughout all the interviews.\n\nThe defense presented two recordings of statements Davis made to the media. In these media\n\nrecordings, Davis tearfully admitted that he murdered Gray. He blamed the murders on a part of him\n\ncalled “Wish,” which he described as a kind of evil alter ego. Davis repeatedly denied sexually\n\nassaulting Gray and said he became increasingly obsessed with hurting people as his trial was\n\nrepeatedly delayed. He told one reporter that he had text messages in his phone showing that Gray\n\nadmitted she lied about the sexual assaults. The text messages he described to the reporter matched\n\nthe fake text messages he created to bolster his defense. Davis also told the reporter that he did not\n\nintend to kill Gray when he went to meet her at her school. He said he just wanted to talk with her.\n\nHe said he had the gun with him only because he had owned it for a long time and carried it with him\n\nall the time.\n\n        The State called Dibrell in rebuttal. Dibrell contradicted Davis’s testimony about whether\n\nshe told Gray about her sexual encounter with Davis. She said she never told Gray about it because\n\n“[Gray] was a child, and I don’t discuss stuff like that with children.” Dibrell recalled that she had\n\nargued with Davis about the excessive amount of time he was spending at her apartment when she\n\nwas not home. She was angry with Davis because, although he had refused to babysit the children\n\nfor her, he kept coming over when Gray was there watching the children. She testified that Davis\n\nhad asked her to provide a statement for his sexual assault trial asserting that her children said that\n\nhe was never alone with Gray. She refused to write that statement. Dibrell testified that Davis was\n\nnot always truthful.\n\n        At the punishment stage of trial, Linda Crawford testified that, when she was sixteen years\n\nold and seven or eight months pregnant with Davis’s son, she walked in on Davis and another\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—22\nwoman at his apartment. Davis pushed her out, grabbed her by the throat, picked her up, and held\n\nher against the building. He ordered her to leave and not come back. Later, when she was holding\n\ntheir young son, Davis hit her with a coat hanger and cut her arm.\n\n       Similarly, Dibrell testified that Davis had been violent with her on multiple occasions during\n\ntheir relationship. She said that these incidents had twice resulted in her nose bleeding. Once, Davis\n\n“pulled a knife” on her. On another occasion, he shot her in the leg with a BB gun. When she was\n\npregnant with their daughter, she caught him with another woman and they argued. He grabbed her,\n\npinned her arms, and whispered into her ear that he hoped she would lose the baby.\n\n       Labrena Henderson, the mother of one of Davis’s sons, testified that she lived with Davis\n\nfrom 1999 through 2001. She recalled that Davis once pushed her violently against a wall during\n\nan argument. She also testified that she and Davis would fight when Davis would take her car at\n\nnight and use it to look for girls and break into other people’s cars.\n\n       The State introduced records revealing that Davis received a deferred adjudication in 1999\n\nfor theft of property valued between $1,500 and $20,000, and that his probation had been revoked\n\nin January 2001 due in part to a subsequent burglary of a motor vehicle. Davis’s criminal record also\n\nincluded convictions for evading arrest and failure to identify in February 2001, and fleeing or\n\nattempting to elude a police officer in October 2007.\n\n       Deputy Steven Underwood testified that he was assigned to supervise Davis when Davis was\n\nhospitalized during his incarceration while awaiting in this case. Davis, who was secured to the bed\n\nwith leg restraints and handcuffs, asked Underwood if he could take a shower before he was sent\n\nback to the jail. Underwood agreed. As soon as Underwood unlocked the restraints, Davis said,\n\n“I’m sorry, man,” grabbed Underwood, and backed him into the wall. As the two men struggled,\n\nDavis grasped for Underwood’s gun. Underwood saw that Davis had some sort of sharp object in\n\f                                                                                         DAVIS—23\nhis hand, but could not tell what it was. (Officers later located in the hospital room a Shasta can that\n\nhad been torn and pinched to form a sharp edge.) Underwood heard a “pop” and saw that his holster\n\nhad come off and Davis was holding his gun. Davis pulled away from Underwood and pointed the\n\ngun at him. He pulled the slide back to make sure the gun was loaded and ordered Underwood to\n\n“[g]et on the ground.” Underwood complied.\n\n        Davis then ran out of the hospital. He fled to a nearby residential area, where he tried to\n\nconvince a family to let him inside their home by claiming that someone was shooting at him. The\n\nmother refused to let him in, but she offered to call 911 for him. Davis asked her not to call the\n\npolice, saying that he had “warrants,” and fled again. The family later found Underwood’s gun\n\nstuffed inside a hospital sock in their front yard. They called the police, who came to the house and\n\ndiscovered that there was a round in the pistol’s chamber. Davis was located while hiding in a red\n\nvan in a parking lot near the hospital. Over eighty officers surrounded the parking lot and Davis\n\neventually surrendered.\n\n        Arrington took the stand and testified about her relationship with Davis. She explained that,\n\non at least twenty occasions, he had become extremely angry with her and choked her. This would\n\nusually happen whenever they argued, even over something minor. She said Davis would typically\n\n“tussle” or wrestle with her first, and then push her up against the wall while choking her with both\n\nhands. On approximately three of these occasions, he threatened Arrington with knives and he once\n\nplaced a gun against her head. He also once threw her against a brick fireplace, and she suffered\n\nbruising. After these fights, Davis would apologize. He would talk to Arrington about the fact that\n\nhis mother was murdered and remind her that his family had placed him in foster care. Arrington\n\ntearfully conceded that she did not reveal Davis’s assaultive conduct when initially questioned by\n\nDetective Williams, she never called the police following these assaults, and she did not tell her\n\f                                                                                         DAVIS—24\nfamily. She said that she did not report the assaults because she loved Davis and did not want to\n\nbecome one of the people who had “abandoned him, as he calls it.” Arrington said she felt ashamed\n\nof her failure to report his abuse and intended to divorce him after the trial.\n\n        The defense offered testimony showing that, as a child, Davis lived with his six siblings,\n\nmother, and grandfather in a small apartment in a poverty-stricken, crime-ridden neighborhood in\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri. Davis’s sister testified that their grandfather molested all of the children in the\n\nhouse. Medical records suggested that Davis’s intellectually-disabled older brother had sex with his\n\nyounger siblings. After Davis’s mother shot another resident of the housing complex, Davis and his\n\nsix siblings were placed in foster care. When she was released from prison, Davis’s mother moved\n\nto Texarkana, where the children were then living, and resumed her role as parent. However, she\n\nwas re-arrested for violating her parole and sent back to prison. She was brutally raped and then\n\nmurdered with a shotgun when Davis was a teenager. Davis’s foster mother, who raised him for one\n\nyear when he was fifteen or sixteen years old, testified that he was always obedient and he liked to\n\ntell jokes. However, after Davis left her home and went to live with his sister, his foster mother\n\nstarted hearing about him getting into trouble. Other caretakers who worked with Davis as a\n\nteenager stated that he was respectful and polite. Latrice Brown, the mother of Davis’s oldest\n\ndaughter, Kurstyne, testified that Davis was a good father and took care of their daughter for over\n\nthree years while Brown was incarcerated. Kurstyne testified that she loves her father and has a\n\ngood relationship with him.\n\n        The defense further offered expert witness testimony that Davis would be a vulnerable inmate\n\nlacking “juice” or power in the prison system due to the nature of the offense he committed. Frank\n\nAu Buchon, a retired Texas prison classification official, testified that an offender sentenced to life\n\nwithout parole could never receive a classification any less restrictive than level three in the general\n\f                                                                                         DAVIS—25\npopulation. Because Davis had attempted to escape, the least restrictive classification that Davis\n\nwould receive upon entering prison would be level four. And, because he had committed a violent\n\nact against a staff member within the past year, he could be classified as level five, which is the most\n\nrestrictive general population classification. Moreover, considering the fact that Davis had\n\nphysically assaulted and disarmed an officer using a makeshift weapon during a premeditated escape\n\nattempt, Au Buchon opined that Davis “needs to go to administrative segregation for a long time.”\n\nAu Buchon acknowledged that he could only make an “educated guess” about how the prison system\n\nwould actually classify Davis. Au Buchon agreed that, if an inmate took a gun from a guard on one\n\noccasion, he might be willing to do it again. Au Buchon also stated that Davis would have contact\n\nwith female guards in prison.\n\n        A Texarkana police officer testified that Davis reported to authorities that his uncle, Robert\n\nElkins, had admitted committing a robbery. Davis provided information that aided officers in\n\npreventing Elkins from committing another robbery. On cross-examination, however, the State\n\nelicited testimony that, two days before Davis provided information to police about Elkins, Davis\n\nwas arrested with Elkins for possession of criminal instruments. Further, Davis was a suspect in a\n\nburglary committed during the same time period. After assisting the police, Davis was not\n\nprosecuted for burglary or for possession of criminal instruments.\n\n        Gray-James took the stand again and described the effects of her daughter’s murder on her\n\nfamily. She also described the terror she experienced when she learned that Davis had escaped from\n\ncustody.\n\n                              SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n        In point of error eleven, Davis contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to support\n\nhis conviction for capital murder. When reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence, we consider all\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—26\nof the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict and determine whether any rational trier of\n\nfact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.6 This\n\nstandard “gives full play to the responsibility of the trier of fact fairly to resolve conflicts in the\n\ntestimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate\n\nfacts.”7 Each fact need not point directly and independently to the defendant’s guilt, as long as the\n\ncumulative effect of all the incriminating facts is sufficient to support the conviction.8 Motive is a\n\nsignificant circumstance indicating guilt, and intent may be inferred from a defendant’s acts, words,\n\nand conduct.9 In addition, attempts to conceal incriminating evidence, inconsistent statements, and\n\nimplausible explanations are probative of unlawful acts and circumstances indicative of guilt.10\n\n       Davis argues that the evidence was insufficient to prove the underlying offense of\n\nobstruction. He admits that he intentionally shot and killed Gray, but he disputes the State’s\n\nevidence concerning his motive for killing her. Texas Penal Code § 36.06 provides:\n\n       (a) A person commits an offense if he intentionally or knowingly harms or threatens to harm\n       another by an unlawful act:\n       ...\n\n       (2) to prevent or delay the service of another as a:\n\n                  (A) public servant, witness, prospective witness, or informant; or\n\n                  (B) person who has reported or who the actor knows intends to report the occurrence\n\n\n\n       6\n           Jackson v.

[t]he occurrence of a crime” and was a “prospective witness” in Davis’s upcoming\n\nsexual assault trial. Further, the record indisputably shows that Davis intentionally and knowingly\n\nharmed Gray by an unlawful act. In fact, Davis admitted to police, television reporters, and the jury\n\nthat he intentionally shot Gray twice with a firearm and then stepped on her neck until she stopped\n\nstruggling. And there is no dispute that Davis knew that Gray had accused him of sexually\n\nassaulting her and knew that she intended to serve as a witness against him.\n\n        Thus, the only remaining element of obstruction at issue is whether Davis killed Gray for the\n\npurpose of preventing or delaying her service as a witness, prospective witness, or person who\n\nreported the occurrence of a crime. Davis argues that the State did not prove that he killed Gray in\n\norder to prevent her from testifying, noting that he “never stated that was the reason he murdered her,\n\neven though all the detectives tried to get him to admit this.” Davis emphasizes that he repeatedly\n\n\n        11\n             TEX .

Gray was the\n\nnamed victim and the only eyewitness in the four sexual assault cases. Davis did not react violently\n\nwhen Gray first brought the charges, when he was arrested, or even when he lost his job. Rather, as\n\nDavis’s court date on the sexual assault charges approached, he became singularly focused on\n\ncombating the charges and targeting Gray. He concocted and executed an elaborate ruse whereby\n\nhe pretended to be a young man named “D” in order to gain Gray’s confidence, and he had hundreds\n\nof communications with Gray. Davis claimed that he was confident that the recordings of his phone\n\nconversations with Gray would bolster his defense, because they demonstrated that Gray had lied\n\nabout the sexual assaults. However, the one recorded conversation in which he and Gray discussed\n\nthe sexual assaults does not support his contention. In this conversation, Gray reluctantly described\n\nthe sexual assaults to “D,” explaining how Davis had intimidated and manipulated her. In response,\n\nDavis attempted to cajole and frighten her into telling people that she had lied about the assaults, and\n\nyet she refused. A reasonable juror could have deduced from this evidence that Davis did sexually\n\nassault Gray and, knowing that she was an indispensable witness against him, actively attempted to\n\nconvince her not to participate in the trial and, failing that, murdered her.\n\n        Other evidence in the record suggests that Davis was very concerned about his upcoming\n\nsexual assault trial, and he developed a plan to manufacture evidence and dispose of Gray as his trial\n\ndate approached. Over two weeks before he killed Gray, he used his T-Mobile phone to search for\n\n“[b]est way to get off of a sexual assault charge” and “with no proof that you did the murder can you\n\f                                                                                          DAVIS—29\nstill be held in jail[?]” Three days after the hearing at which the trial judge set his trial date, Davis\n\ndownloaded a fake text message application and used it to create text messages, purportedly from\n\nGray, saying she was sorry that she had lied about the sexual assaults. He additionally asked Dibrell\n\nto manufacture statements (purportedly made by her children) to support his defense. The day after\n\nhe created the bogus text messages, he began actively seeking to purchase a gun. Shortly thereafter,\n\nhe obtained the Diamondback .380 pistol. Less than a week after he bought the gun, he assumed his\n\n“D” persona again and contacted Gray. He began trying to convince her to meet with “D” after\n\nschool, making sure that her stepfather would not be present. He used his phone to search for the\n\nlocation of her school and an isolated park where he would be able to kill her without being seen.\n\nHe enticed her to meet him behind the school by leading her to think that “D” planned to give her\n\nsomething that might be “money money.” Davis brought a loaded gun with him to meet Gray at the\n\nschool. After killing her, he shoved her body in the river, then carefully disposed of the murder\n\nweapon, their phones, and other incriminating evidence. Later that evening, he doused the car with\n\ncologne before picking up his wife from work.\n\n        The jury was charged with weighing any conflicts in the evidence and evaluating the\n\ncredibility of the witnesses. The jurors had the opportunity to evaluate Davis’s credibility as he\n\ntestified at trial concerning his motive for the killing. They were free to believe or disbelieve some\n\nor all of his testimony. They were also free to draw reasonable, yet adverse inferences from his acts,\n\nwords, and conduct, including his attempts to manufacture evidence and his inconsistent statements\n\nand explanations. The jury could have reasonably inferred from the evidence that Davis intentionally\n\nkilled Gray to prevent her service as witness against him.\n\n        We hold that the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, is legally\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—30\nsufficient to support the jury’s verdict that Davis intentionally murdered Gray in the course of\n\ncommitting or attempting to commit the offense of obstruction. Davis’s eleventh point of error is\n\noverruled.\n\n       In point of error twenty-four, Davis challenges the legal sufficiency of the evidence to\n\nsupport the jury’s affirmative answer to the future dangerousness special issue.14 He argues that the\n\nevidence was insufficient because he had no prior violent offense convictions and “the defense\n\nwitnesses testified that he essentially was a low risk for future dangerousness.”\n\n       When reviewing the legal sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury’s answer to the\n\nfuture dangerousness special issue, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\n\nand determine whether any rational trier of fact could have believed beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nthere is a probability that the defendant would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute\n\na continuing threat to society.15 In its determination of this special issue, the jury is entitled to\n\nconsider all of the evidence admitted at both the guilt and punishment phases of trial.16 This Court\n\nhas not required that the record contain evidence of prior violent offense convictions to support a\n\njury’s finding of future dangerousness.17       The circumstances of the offense and the events\n\n\n\n\n       14\n             See TEX .

Armed with a home-made\n\nweapon, he had executed a violent escape from custody in which he overpowered an officer and took\n\nhis firearm. Further, he had demonstrated a pattern of assaulting his intimate partners.

Some of these assaults were committed when young children were\n\npresent. Although Davis asserts that defense punishment witnesses “essentially” testified that he\n\npresented a low risk for violent conduct, Frank Au Buchon testified that Davis might very well\n\nattempt to take an officer’s firearm again and “need[ed] to go to administrative segregation for a long\n\ntime.”19 The jury also heard evidence of Davis’s sexual assaults of Gray and other threatening\n\nconduct towards her when she was only fourteen years old, as well as the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe instant brutal, premeditated murder.

A Batson challenge to the State’s use of a peremptory strike has three steps. First, the\n\nopponent of the strike must establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination.21 Second, if the\n\nopponent makes the requisite showing, the burden shifts to the proponent of the strike to articulate\n\na reason for the strike that is race-neutral on its face.22 Third, if a race-neutral explanation is offered,\n\nthen the trial judge must determine whether the opponent of the strike has shown purposeful\n\ndiscrimination.23 “Whether the opponent satisfies his burden of persuasion to show that the\n\nproponent’s facially race-neutral explanation for his strike is pre-textual, not genuine, is a question\n\nof fact for the trial court.”24\n\n        Although the burden of production shifts after the opponent makes a prima facie case, the\n\nburden of persuasion remains with the opponent of the strike to establish purposeful discrimination.25\n\n\n\n        20\n             </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111662\"><a href=\"/opinion/111662/batson-v-kentucky/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1986).\n        21\n             Nieto v.

Davis notes that Mitchell answered “no” to the\n\nquestion, “Do you have any moral, religious or personal beliefs that would prevent you from\n\nreturning a verdict which would result in the execution of another human being?” while one of the\n\nseated jurors answered this question, “yes.” He points out that Mitchell agreed that intentional\n\nmurder during the course of obstruction should be a capital offense, “as [had] all jurors accepted by\n\nthe State,” and that Mitchell had not heard about the case, “as did sixteen jurors accepted by the\n\nState.” He further observes that Mitchell ranked himself a six out of ten when asked how strongly\n\nhe believed in the death penalty, while five jurors accepted by the State ranked themselves a six or\n\nlower on this question.\n\n       Davis contends that Horsely also had characteristics that would have benefitted the State,\n\nincluding her intelligence, her military service, and her statement that she could make the decision\n\nto assess the death penalty “under the right circumstances.” He states that her answers to certain\n\nquestions were similar to those given by others who were accepted as jurors.

Although the trial judge denied\n\nthe State’s challenge for cause on this basis, Mitchell’s vacillation on this issue was nevertheless a\n\nvalid, race-neutral reason supporting the State’s peremptory strike.32\n\n       Davis has not shown that Mitchell and Horsely were treated differently from non-minority\n\nveniremembers or that the prosecutor’s stated reasons for striking them were a pretext for\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n                                       Veniremember Watson\n\n       Davis emphasizes that, during voir dire, Watson stated that killing a witness to keep her from\n\ntestifying should be capital murder and, when told what the two possible punishments for that crime\n\nwere, Watson stated, “[R]ight.” Similarly, Davis notes that Watson responded, “[R]ight,” as the\n\nprosecutor explained how a person could post bond and the reasons for the bond requirement. Davis\n\nmaintains that Watson’s answers on other questions showed that he was a proponent of the death\n\npenalty.    He asserts that Watson’s answers were similar to the answers of non-minority\n\nveniremembers who were seated on the jury. He submits that the State’s justifications for the\n\nperemptory strike of Watson were implausible and merely a pretext for purposeful discrimination.\n\n       The prosecutor stated at the Batson hearing that he struck Watson for a combination of\n\nreasons. First, on his questionnaire, Watson added a handwritten note after his answer to question\n\nnumber twelve. Question number twelve read:\n\n       The crime of “Obstruction” means harming or threatening to harm another person to\n       prevent or delay the service of that person as a witness or prospective witness.

At this point, both sides had already interviewed Watson, and he\n\nhad stated on his questionnaire that he had not heard anything about the case in the media.\n\n       Third, on a question about the presumption of innocence, Watson added the notation:\n\n“Should be set free until trial is over.” He also asked during voir dire why a defendant could not be\n\nallowed to remain free in the community until the conclusion of his trial, suggesting that the\n\npresumption of innocence should mandate his release. The prosecutor then explained the bond\n\nprocess and the purpose for requiring a bond. At the Batson hearing, the prosecutor said Watson\n\nseemed unsatisfied with this explanation.\n\n       The record shows that, after offering an extensive explanation of the bond process in\n\nresponse to Watson’s concerns, the prosecutor asked Watson, “Is that okay?” Watson responded,\n\n“Yeah, mostly. It answers the question, but it . . . still seems like to me that if a bond is set for a\n\nperson, there are still implications that that person is guilty.” Watson continued to indicate that he\n\nbelieved forcing a defendant to pay a bond meant that the person was being presumed guilty, rather\n\nthan innocent. Thus, the record supports the prosecutor’s claim that Watson was not satisfied with\n\nhis explanation. Watson’s statements arguably indicated a bias against the State and for Davis.\n\n       Additionally, the State asserted at the Batson hearing that Watson was the only one of the\n\nforty-five jurors questioned who wrote, “life without parole would be better for me,” and expressed\n\nconcern about why the defendant would not be released while awaiting the outcome of his trial. The\n\f                                                                                         DAVIS—39\ntrial judge asked defense counsel for a response to the State’s race-neutral explanation. Counsel did\n\nnot respond to or contradict the prosecutor’s assertions. The burden of persuasion remained with\n\nDavis’s counsel to establish that a prohibited motive lay behind the State’s peremptory strike.33 The\n\nrecord supports the prosecutor’s assertions about the race-neutral reasons for the strike, and defense\n\ncounsel did not rebut them. Davis has not demonstrated that the State’s race-neutral reasons were\n\nmerely a pretext for discrimination.\n\n        The trial judge’s rulings denying Davis’s Batson challenges are supported by the record and\n\nwere not clearly erroneous. We overrule Davis’s first, second, and third points of error.\n\n                              DISCHARGE OF DISABLED JUROR\n\n        In his fourth point of error, Davis argues that the trial judge abused his discretion in\n\ndischarging juror John Bigley due to a disability. Davis contends that the record contains “no\n\nevidence” supporting the trial judge’s finding that Bigley suffered an emotional disability justifying\n\nhis discharge under Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 36.29(b), which provides in relevant\n\npart:\n\n        If alternate jurors have been selected in a capital case in which the state seeks the\n        death penalty and a juror dies or becomes disabled from sitting at any time before the\n        charge of the court is read to the jury, the alternate juror whose name was called first\n        under Article 35.26 of this code shall replace the dead or disabled juror.\n\n        On August 29, 2013, with counsel for both parties and Davis present, the trial judge\n\nconvened a hearing regarding Bigley “under the auspices” of Article 36.29(b). The judge explained\n\nthat the trial was originally set for August 19th, but at the request of the defense, he had continued\n\nthe trial to November 4th to allow the defense to develop “certain potentially mitigating evidence.”\n\nBigley had expressed “extreme reluctance” about the new trial date to court staff. The judge stated\n\n\n        33\n             See Camacho, 864 S.W.2d at 529.\n\f                                                                                          DAVIS—40\nthat he called Bigley to discuss the matter. The judge said that Bigley “was adamant that because\n\nof his work situation that he simply did not feel like he would be able to be fair and impartial to both\n\nsides and to carefully weigh the evidence because his mind would be elsewhere.” The judge then\n\ncontacted Bigley’s boss in the Netherlands via email. The boss said that Bigley’s participation at\n\nwork from November 4th through November 18th was critical. Defense counsel objected to the trial\n\njudge excusing Bigley from jury service.\n\n        The trial judge then called Bigley to the stand. Bigley explained that he is the only United\n\nStates employee for a company called In Continuum. He said that, due to the nature of his business,\n\nall of his work setting up partnerships and relationships would be coming to fruition in the last\n\nquarter of the year. Bigley testified that, if he was forced to serve as a juror in November, he would\n\nhave to work early mornings, trial breaks, lunch periods, and late nights during the trial to close deals\n\nand he would be distracted during the trial. He said he would do his best to fulfill his duties as a\n\njuror, but he would be thinking about the work he needed to do and he would be worried about\n\nkeeping his job. The judge asked him, “Is it fair to say that because of your emotional state, you’re\n\nconcerned that you would not be attentive during the trial?” Bigley answered, “That’s correct.” The\n\ntrial judge discharged Bigley from jury service and replaced him with one of the two alternate jurors.\n\nThe jury was subsequently sworn on November 4, 2013.\n\n        Although Article 36.29 was discussed at the pretrial hearing and in Davis’s brief, it was not\n\napplicable in this case because the jury had not yet been sworn when Bigley was removed. This\n\nCourt has held that Article 36.29 applies only after the jury has been sworn.34 In this case, the trial\n\njudge did not swear in the twelve jurors until after Bigley had been discharged and replaced with an\n\n\n        34\n          Broussard v.

Although there is no statutorily defined procedure for discharging jurors that applies\n\nto this particular situation, we have held that a trial judge does not err in following the process set\n\nout in Article 36.29 and replacing a disabled juror with a duly-selected alternate juror.35\n\n        Article 36.29(b) sets out the process for replacing a juror who “becomes disabled from\n\nsitting,” but it does not define the phrase “disabled from sitting.” Under Article 36.29, a trial judge\n\nhas discretion to determine whether a juror has become disabled and to replace that juror with an\n\nalternate juror.36 We have interpreted the phrase “disabled from sitting” in Article 36.29 to require\n\nthat the juror must be suffering from a “physical illness, mental condition, or emotional state that\n\nwould hinder or inhibit the juror from performing his or her duties as a juror.”37 A disability in this\n\ncontext is “not limited to physical disease, but also includes ‘any condition that inhibits a juror from\n\nfully and fairly performing the functions of a juror.’”38\n\n        The trial judge’s decision is subject to a review for abuse of discretion and, absent such an\n\nabuse, no reversible error will be found.39 When reviewing the dismissal of a juror, we will not\n\n\n\n\n       35\n           Id. at 958 (“Faced with the need to complete the jury, and having no specific statutory\ndirective, the trial court chose an acceptable option by replacing the disabled venireman with a\nvenireman who had already been qualified and accepted by both parties . . . .

App. 2009) (“The record in this\ncase clearly shows that appellant had actual notice of the capital charge upon which the State was\nbasing its allegations.”); Kellar, 108 S.W.3d at 314 (“Given the extensive and detailed discovery\nthat occurred prior to trial, the appellant had ample notice in addition to that provided by the\nindictment.”).\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—47\n       Davis’s November 1st motion for continuance stated in relevant part:\n\n       It has come to the attention of defense counsel that the Defendant, Mr. Franklin\n       Davis, has an extensive history of sexual abuse perpetrated upon him. New evidence\n       has come to light as of the afternoon of October 31, 2013. This evidence is\n       paramount to the effective representation of Mr. Davis. This evidence must be\n       investigated for both guilt/innocence issues as well as possible mitigation evidence.\n\nThe November motion did not further explain the nature of the evidence, witnesses, or investigation\n\nneeded, the diligence used to procure the evidence, or why the evidence could not be procured from\n\nanother source, such as Davis himself. The copies of the motion and attached affidavit in the clerk’s\n\nrecord were not signed by counsel or Davis. The only signature on the document is that of a notary\n\npublic who, curiously, certified that defense counsel had signed the unsigned affidavit.\n\n       The trial judge observed that the motion was “filed literally at the 11th hour.” The judge\n\nnoted that nearly fourteen months had passed since the case had been first assigned to his district\n\ncourt and that he had already granted Davis two continuances. The judge said that Davis’s August\n\nmotion for continuance had stated essentially the same grounds as the instant motion: the need to\n\ninvestigate newly discovered mitigating evidence suggesting Davis had been sexually abused as a\n\nchild. The judge also stated that Davis’s latest motion did not comply with Article 29.07, governing\n\nsubsequent motions for continuance by a defendant. The judge commented that the motion appeared\n\nto have been filed for the purpose of obtaining cumulative testimony.\n\n       Defense counsel responded that, on October 31, 2013, he was speaking with Davis during\n\na visit and “things came to light about the defendant’s past which only the defendant could be able\n\nto address specifically,” and these “things” were not contained in the records that were the basis for\n\nthe last motion for continuance. Counsel emphasized that “nobody else can testify directly as to\n\nwhat has happened to Mr. Davis himself . . . . [O]nly he can speak about the acts, about the things\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—48\nthat were done to him by the people who did them to him.” Defense counsel explained that they\n\nwanted to explore the psychological impact of the childhood abuse on Davis.\n\n       The trial judge confirmed that defense counsel intended to direct their investigators to\n\ncontinue to investigate this issue throughout the week. The judge asked for daily reports on the\n\nstatus of that investigation. He then denied the motion for continuance. Subsequently during trial,\n\nbefore the State completed its presentation of evidence, the trial judge asked defense counsel about\n\ntheir progress on this investigation. Defense counsel asked to speak to the judge in camera about\n\nthis matter. The judge then took a short recess. When the judge and parties returned to the\n\ncourtroom, there was no further discussion of the matter on the record and defense counsel did not\n\nrenew the request for a continuance.\n\n       An appellate court reviews a trial judge’s ruling on a motion for continuance for an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.56 To establish an abuse of discretion, an appellant must show that he was actually\n\nprejudiced by the denial of his motion.57 Generally, we will conclude that a trial judge’s denial of\n\na motion for continuance was an abuse of discretion “only if the record shows with considerable\n\nspecificity how the defendant was harmed by the absence of more preparation time than he actually\n\nhad.”58 In determining whether the denial of a motion for continuance is so arbitrary that it violates\n\ndue process, we look at the individual circumstances of each case, especially the reasons presented\n\n\n\n\n       56\n          See TEX .

To prevail on an\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, a defendant must prove: (1) trial counsel’s representation\n\nfell below an objective standard of reasonableness (i.e., deficient performance); and (2) there is a\n\nreasonable probability that, but for counsel’s deficiency, the result of the proceeding would have\n\nbeen different (i.e., prejudice).60 A defendant bears the burden of proving an ineffectiveness claim\n\nby a preponderance of the evidence.61 A reviewing court need not always address both prongs of the\n\ninquiry, because the “[f]ailure to make the required showing of either deficient performance or\n\nsufficient prejudice defeats the ineffectiveness claim.”62\n\n       Texas Code of Criminal Procedure Article 29.08 provides that, “All motions for continuance\n\nmust be sworn to by a person having personal knowledge of the facts relied on for the continuance.”\n\nArticle 29.07 requires that a defendant’s subsequent motion for continuance must comply with all\n\nthe requirements for a first motion for continuance set out in Article 29.06, and further must state:\n\n(1) that the testimony sought by the defense cannot be procured from any other source known to the\n\ndefendant; and (2) that the defendant has a reasonable expectation of procuring the testimony “at the\n\nnext term of the court.” “Mere conclusions and general averments are not sufficient for the court\n\nto determine their materiality, and the motion for continuance must show on its face the materiality\n\n\n       59\n            Rosales v.

Therefore, it did not comply with Article 29.08. In addition, as the trial\n\njudge observed, the motion did not comply with Article 29.07, in that it did not state that the\n\ntestimony sought could not be procured from any other source known to the defendant or that the\n\ndefendant had a reasonable expectation of procuring the evidence “at the next term of the court.”\n\n       Further, the weight of the evidence in this case suggests that Davis did not suffer prejudice\n\nas a result of the denial of his motion for continuance, and no due process violation occurred.\n\nAlthough this case was undeniably complex, defense counsel and the defense investigator had over\n\na year to prepare for trial. Davis had already received two continuances, including a lengthy\n\ncontinuance in part for the purpose of developing childhood sexual-assault evidence. There was no\n\ntestimony establishing that defense counsel’s performance was compromised or defense witnesses\n\nwere inconvenienced by the judge’s refusal to grant the third continuance.

Moreover, defense counsel conceded\n\nthat the testimony relevant to the November motion could only come from Davis himself. And when\n\nDavis took the stand in his own defense, he testified that he was “raped” by his grandfather and his\n\n“mentally retarded brother.” The defense also offered other evidence documenting sexual abuse in\n\nDavis’s childhood home.\n\n       Under the circumstances, Davis has not demonstrated that he was deprived of due process\n\nor the effective assistance of counsel.

At this time, officers had not yet found Gray’s\n\nbody and were investigating her disappearance as a kidnapping rather than a murder. Thus, the\n\nsearch warrants alleged the penal offense of kidnapping. These three search warrant affidavits\n\ncontained the following factual allegations:\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—52\n       On Thursday, September 6, 2012, Shania Ambriehl Gray was last seen at Hebron\n       High School at 4207 Plano Parkway, Carrollton, Denton County, Texas. She was\n       attending an after school tutoring class and had received a telephone call from her\n       mother. Shania Ambriehl Gray told her teacher that she was going to meet her\n       mother, Sherry James. Shania left the classroom to walk out of the school and meet\n       her mother, who was waiting in a car. Shania Ambriehl Gray never arrived at her\n       mother’s car and has not been seen since her tutoring class . . . .\n\n       During the course of the investigation, Officers discovered that in 2011, Shania\n       Ambriehl Gray had reported several Sexual Assault cases to the Mesquite Police\n       Department. The suspect, Franklin Davis, . . . was arrested and is currently awaiting\n       trial for these offenses . . . .\n\n       Officers obtained Shania Ambriehl Gray’s cellular telephone information due to\n       exigent circumstances. While investigating the activity on Shania Ambriehl Gray’s\n       cellular telephone, officers found the telephone number 903-603-8786. During the\n       time period from September 5, 2012 to September 6, 2012, several calls and texts\n       were made from Shania Ambriehl Gray’s cellular telephone to cellular telephone\n       number 903-603-8786.\n\n       Officers obtained the cell data for 903-603-8786 due to exigent circumstances. One\n       of the numbers called by 903-603-8786 was 214-909-8567. Officers called 214-909-\n       8567 and spoke to Shakeema Morsley. Officers asked Shakeema Morsley if she\n       could tell them who had been calling her from 903-603-8786. Shakeema Morsley\n       said that she believed this person was Franklin Davis. Shakeema Morsley knows\n       Franklin Davis through her friend and work associate, Jawanna Arrington, who is in\n       a dating relationship with Franklin Davis. Shakeema stated that she strongly\n       believed this was Franklin Davis due to the content of the communications, which\n       would only be known to Franklin Davis.\n\n       Officers looked at the cellular telephone data for Shania Ambriehl Gray and the 903-\n       603-8786 [sic], which is believed to belong to Franklin Davis, and found that they\n       had been in proximity with each other during the same time frame on September 6,\n       2012. After 5:17 p.m. CST on September 6, 2012 it appears that Shania Ambriehl\n       Gray’s telephone was turned off.\n\nThe affiant further stated that Gray’s mother said Gray had never run away from home, was not\n\ndefiant or rebellious, and had indicated that she wanted to attend future school events and to “attain\n\ngoals with her family,” suggesting that it was unlikely that Gray had voluntarily left the school and\n\nrun away without contacting her mother.\n\n       Officers executed the search warrant for Davis and Arrington’s apartment on September 8,\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—53\n2012. They seized two plastic bags of household trash, a black spiral notebook containing personal\n\nwritings, miscellaneous paperwork, a black Adidas shirt, black basketball shorts, and a pair of\n\nweightlifting gloves. On September 10, 2012, officers executed the search warrant for the Dodge\n\nStratus, seizing a bank withdrawal receipt, some trace evidence, fingerprints, and DNA swabs.\n\nOfficers executed the warrant for Davis’s DNA sample and photos on September 11, 2012. They\n\nobtained two buccal swabs and several photographs of Davis, including photos taken at the jail of\n\nan injury to his arm and his shirtless chest displaying a “Wish” tattoo.\n\n       The fourth search warrant affidavit was signed by Detective Williams on September 12,\n\n2012, after officers found Gray’s body and after Davis confessed to murdering Gray. Williams\n\nstated in the affidavit that Davis voluntarily gave his T-Mobile phone to officers at the Carrollton\n\nPolice Department. Williams relied in large part on statements Davis had made during his interview\n\nwith Detective Chevallier, in which Davis admitted taking Gray from her school, shooting her, and\n\nkilling her. Williams said that Davis admitted in this interview that he adopted a false identity, used\n\na prepaid cell phone to talk to Gray, and recorded those conversations on his T-Mobile phone. This\n\nwarrant was used to obtain the contents of Davis’s T-Mobile phone, including digital images,\n\nrecordings, and internet search history.\n\n       Davis filed four motions to suppress all the evidence obtained through the four search\n\nwarrants. He argued that the warrants, the associated affidavits, and the execution and return of the\n\nwarrants violated his constitutional and statutory rights “under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments\n\nto the United States Constitution, Article I, Section 9 of the Texas Constitution, and Article 38.23”\n\nbecause the affidavits did not show probable cause to conclude that “the alleged contraband would\n\nbe found in a particular place.”\n\n       In the hearing on Davis’s motions to suppress, Davis’s counsel maintained that the search\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—54\nwarrant affidavits were deficient because they did not allege facts showing that a crime had been\n\ncommitted and did not allege that there was anything that could be used for comparison with Davis’s\n\nDNA. Further, Davis’s counsel argued that the affidavits did not establish any basis for the police\n\n“to believe that this individual, Shamica Mosley [sic], is credible or that what they [sic] tell them\n\nactually helps them in any way.” He argued that the facts stated in the affidavits did not collectively\n\namount to probable cause. Finally, he argued, without elaboration, that the fourth warrant affidavit\n\nrelied on information unlawfully obtained through the first three search warrants.\n\n       The State responded that the affidavits alleged facts showing a kidnapping and that\n\ninvestigators reasonably expected to compare Davis’s DNA to evidence obtained in the future. The\n\nprosecutor pointed out that Shakeema Morsley personally knew Davis and “strongly believe[d]” that\n\nhe was the person who was using the 903 area-code number to contact her in September 2012. In\n\nthe event that the trial judge felt that the motions to suppress had merit, the prosecutor asked to be\n\nallowed to call Arrington to testify that she gave consent to the searches of her Dodge Stratus and\n\ntheir apartment. At trial, Arrington testified that she consented to allowing the police to retain her\n\nDodge Stratus for processing, but there is no indication that evidence establishing her consent to the\n\nsearch was before the magistrate when he signed the warrants or the trial judge when he ruled on the\n\nmotions to suppress.\n\n       The trial judge entered findings of fact regarding Davis’s motions to suppress evidence,\n\nincluding the following:\n\n       3. . . . . Detective D. Williams, who investigated the victim’s disappearance,\n       determined that the victim had previously reported several sexual assault cases to the\n       Mesquite Police Department by the Defendant, Franklin B. Davis. Based on the\n       existence of these charges, Detective D. Williams contacted Detective Cook to assist\n       with the investigation.\n\f                                                                                         DAVIS—55\n        4. The victim’s mother informed the officers that the victim has never before run\n        away from home, even during the time that led up to her outcry about the alleged\n        sexual assaults by the Defendant. Her mother also indicated that she has never been\n        defiant or rebellious and that she had plans to attend future school events and to\n        attain goals with her family. Based on this information, the officers surmised that the\n        victim did not leave the school voluntarily.\n\n        5. Detective Cook, an experienced and seasoned officer, along with other officers\n        then obtained the cell phone records of the victim, including those calls made or\n        received the day before and the day of her disappearance. On both the day before\n        and the day of her disappearance the victim made several calls and texts to a cellular\n        number with a 903 area code. Officers then obtained the cell phone data for the cell\n        phone with the 903 area code and found that this phone had made phone calls to a\n        214 phone number. The Officers contacted the owner of the 214 area code cell and\n        determined that Shakeema Morsley, [sic] was the owner of the 214 area code phone.\n        Ms. Morsley informed officers that she had been receiving phone calls from Franklin\n        Davis on the 903 area code phone. Ms. Morsley knew the identity of Franklin Davis\n        because, at the time, he was dating a friend and work associate of Ms. Morsley. Ms.\n        Morsley based her identification of the Defendant on the content of the\n        communications with him.\n\n        6. Officers, while looking at the cellular phone data for the cell phone of the victim\n        and that of the Defendant, determined that the phones were in close proximity to each\n        other during the same time frame on the date of the victim’s disappearance.\n\nConcluding that the affidavits stated probable cause supporting the search warrants, the judge denied\n\nthe motions to suppress the photographs of Davis, the items seized from the Dodge Stratus, the items\n\nseized from the apartment, and the contents of Davis’s T-Mobile phone. The judge found that the\n\naffidavit for the search warrant for Davis’s DNA sample did not provide probable cause for\n\nobtaining the buccal swabs specifically, though the judge found that the affidavit did set forth\n\n“sufficient facts to establish probable cause to show that . . . a specific offense had been committed.”\n\nThus, the judge ruled that the DNA buccal swab evidence would not be admitted at trial.\n\n        We have recently set out the law relating to the probable cause required for the issuance of\n\na search warrant:\n\n        The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution mandates that “no\n        Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and\n\f                                                                                       DAVIS—56\n       particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be\n       seized.” Probable cause exists when, under the totality of the circumstances, there\n       is a fair probability or substantial chance that contraband or evidence of a crime will\n       be found at the specified location. It is a flexible and nondemanding standard.66\n\nWe also set forth the standard of review applicable to a trial judge’s ruling on a motion to suppress\n\nevidence:\n\n       While an appellate court typically reviews a trial judge’s motion-to- suppress ruling\n       under a bifurcated standard, a trial court’s determination whether probable cause\n       exists to support a search warrant’s issuance is constrained solely to the affidavit’s\n       four corners. When we review a magistrate’s decision to issue a warrant, we apply\n       a highly deferential standard of review because of the constitutional preference for\n       searches conducted pursuant to a warrant over warrantless searches. Provided the\n       magistrate had a substantial basis for concluding that probable cause existed, we will\n       uphold the magistrate’s probable-cause determination. The magistrate may interpret\n       the affidavit in a non-technical, common-sense manner and may draw reasonable\n       inferences solely from the facts and circumstances contained within the affidavit’s\n       four corners.

He complains Morsley merely deduced that he was the person who contacted her based\n\non the content of their “communications.”\n\n       Davis analogizes the information Morsley provided to a tip from an anonymous informant.\n\nHe emphasizes that the affidavit refers to a single telephone conversation between police and\n\nMorsley in which “no one has any knowledge of who the person is that identifies themselves as Ms.\n\nMorsley.” He contends that the information she provided must be corroborated because the record\n\nsuggests that she was not truthful, accurate, or reliable. Specifically, Davis points to the fact that\n\nMorsley described his relationship with Arrington as a “dating relationship,” when he and Arrington\n\nwere actually married. Therefore, he argues, the trial judge should have suppressed the evidence\n\nobtained from these three warrants.\n\n       Tips obtained “from anonymous or first-time confidential informants of unknown reliability\n\nmust be coupled with facts from which an inference may be drawn that the informant is credible or\n\nthat his information is reliable.”69 However, this requirement does not apply to information obtained\n\nfrom citizens who freely share the information with police without withholding their names.70 The\n\nlatter type of witness, sometimes referred to as a “citizen-informer,” is “presumed to speak with the\n\nvoice of honesty and accuracy.”71\n\n\n       69\n            State v.

Her involvement with this case was happenstance, based on the fact that Davis\n\nchose to contact her, on or near the day Gray was abducted and killed, using the same phone with\n\nwhich he contacted Gray. Morsley did not insist on remaining anonymous and, in fact, freely\n\nidentified herself by name when an officer called her on her phone. The affidavit contains her name\n\nand her phone number. Davis has pointed to no evidence suggesting that Morsley had any motive\n\nto falsely identify herself, to falsely implicate him, or to mislead police in their investigation.\n\nTherefore, Morsley is the type of citizen informer to whom we generally accord a presumption of\n\nhonesty and reliability. We see no reason to abandon this presumption in this case.\n\n       Further, contrary to Davis’s assertions, Morsley’s identification of the 903 caller through the\n\ncontent of their conversations, which would be known only to Davis, was not inherently unreliable.\n\nWe have long held that, when the content of a telephone conversation is offered into evidence, “the\n\nidentity of the speaker is sufficiently established if the message reveals that the speaker has\n\nknowledge of facts that only the speaker would be likely to know.”72\n\n       Moreover, Detective Cook’s statement, that Morsley indicated that Davis and Arrington were\n\nin a “dating relationship,” did not render the information that Morsley provided unreliable.

In any case, the reference to Arrington and Davis having a dating relationship was\n\nnot integral to the probable-cause determination. The affidavits made it clear that Morsley knew\n\nDavis through her friend and coworker, Arrington, and was able to deduce from the content of their\n\nconversations that he was the person using the 903 phone number.\n\n       In addition to Morsley’s identification of Davis as the 903 caller, the affidavits informed the\n\nmagistrate that Gray had disappeared suddenly from her high school campus, even though her\n\nmother was waiting for her in front of the school. She was not a defiant child and had never before\n\nrun away from home. She had reported to the Mesquite Police Department that Davis had sexually\n\nassaulted her on several occasions. Davis had been arrested on those charges, and he was awaiting\n\ntrial on them when Gray disappeared. Gray communicated through calls and text messages with the\n\n903 number on the day of her disappearance and the previous day. Telephone records also showed\n\nthat the 903 phone and Gray’s phone had been in proximity to each other when some of those\n\ncommunications occurred. Under the circumstances, the magistrate had a substantial basis for\n\nconcluding that probable cause existed to suspect that Gray had been kidnapped, that Davis was\n\ninvolved in her abduction, and that evidence of that crime might be found in his apartment or in the\n\nvehicle he drove.

State’s Exhibit 18 contains an electronic file folder of\n\nrecordings that match the descriptions of the complained-of defense exhibits, though the recordings\n\nare not labeled as Defense Exhibits A, B, C, E, F, or G.

Davis essentially admitted\n\nduring cross-examination that a key purpose for offering these recordings was to impugn Gray’s\n\ncharacter by revealing to the jury her sexual conduct with other men.

Saunders offered that evidence at the punishment phase of the trial to explain the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the murder. Davis suggests that, like Saunders, he did not offer Gray’s\n\nstatements in the recordings for the truth of the matters asserted therein, but rather as proof that she\n\nmade the statements and to explain the circumstances surrounding the killing. Again, Davis did not\n\ncite this case or the referenced statute as a ground for admitting the evidence at trial. Therefore, he\n\nfailed to preserve error.98\n\n        Additionally, Saunders is markedly distinguishable from the case at hand. The recordings\n\nat issue were made weeks before Davis killed Gray.

In short, the statements made by Gray in these recordings do not\n\nilluminate the immediate circumstances surrounding Gray’s murder. Further, Davis’s testimony at\n\ntrial suggests that he intended to offer at least some of the remarks in the recordings for the truth of\n\nthe matters asserted. For example, he wanted the jury to believe the statements in these recordings\n\nthat Gray had sexual relationships with other men.            By definition, the exhibits contained\n\ninadmissible hearsay.99\n\n        With regard to Exhibit A, Davis insists that the exhibit was not submitted for the truth of the\n\nmatters asserted, but to show “[Gray’s] state of mind concerning her mindset as to its preoccupation\n\nwith sexual activity and contributed to show how she fabricated the accusations of sexual\n\nmisconduct” against him. Other than Gray’s pre-recorded voicemail greeting, Davis’s statement\n\nannouncing that he was calling Gray in order to “pretty much prove [his] innocence in this charge”\n\ncomprises the only substantive spoken content on this recording. As such, this exhibit consisted\n\nprimarily of a self-serving, out-of-court statement by Davis offered for the truth of the matter\n\nasserted, i.e., his assertion that he was innocent of the sexual assault charges. The recording does\n\nnot contain any statement by Gray about her “then-existing state of mind” or her “emotional,\n\nsensory, or physical condition.”100 Also, defense counsel did not respond to the State’s hearsay\n\nobjection by informing the trial judge that he was not offering the exhibit for the truth of the matter\n\nasserted. Davis’s claim on appeal again does not comport with his argument at trial.101\n\n        With respect to the other exhibits at issue, Davis simply reproduces verbatim several pages\n\n\n\n        99\n             See TEX .

To the extent that\n\nDavis repeats trial counsel’s objections without further argument or citation, these claims are\n\ninadequately briefed.102\n\n       We conclude that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the recordings and\n\nDavis has not demonstrated any due process violation. However, even if the trial judge had erred\n\nin excluding this evidence, Davis was not harmed by the judge’s ruling because the information\n\nDavis sought to impart to the jury was admitted elsewhere.103 During cross-examination, the\n\nprosecutor invited Davis to inform the jury of the “important” content of the excluded recordings.\n\nDavis then testified without objection that Gray had sex with a boy while she was supposed to be\n\nat a track meet, had a sexual relationship with a twenty-year-old man who was in the Army, and had\n\nsex when she was thirteen years old. We overrule Davis’s thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth,\n\nseventeenth, and eighteenth points of error.\n\n       In Davis’s nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first points of error, he argues that the trial judge\n\nerred in sustaining the State’s objections to testimony from defense witnesses Pastor Arty Hayes,\n\nAshlye Sams, and Lamar Leggiton.

The trial judge overruled the State’s relevance objection and\n\nallowed Hayes to testify about providing counseling to Davis. However, he sustained the State’s\n\npredicate objection and ruled that Hayes would not be permitted to testify about Davis’s prior\n\nconsistent statements.\n\n       The judge allowed the defense to put on an offer of proof showing the prior consistent\n\nstatement that Hayes would have recounted. Hayes testified outside the presence of the jury that he\n\nwas Davis’s sister’s husband. He said he had counseled Davis when Davis came to him for guidance\n\nafter being accused of four counts of sexual assault. Hayes said Davis told him that he did not\n\ncommit the sexual assaults. The trial judge warned Hayes not to testify before the jury about Davis’s\n\nclaims that he was innocent of the sexual assault charges.\n\n       However, Hayes then testified before the jury not only about providing counseling to Davis\n\nconcerning the pending sexual assault charges, but also about Davis’s claims of innocence.\n\nSpecifically, Hayes testified that, when Davis came to him for counseling after being accused of the\n\nsexual assaults, “he was very disturbed about the situation and . . . just wanted to speak with us on\n\nit and—and let us know, you know that[, ‘]I—I’m innocent[,] man. I’m innocent.’” The State did\n\nnot object to this testimony. The trial judge reprimanded the witness for testifying to matters he had\n\nbeen warned not to speak about and cautioned him not to “do it again,” but did not instruct the jury\n\nto disregard this testimony. Hayes went on to testify that he and another pastor had prayed with\n\f                                                                                        DAVIS—74\nDavis and his wife over this difficult situation and indicated that he felt sorry for Davis.\n\n       Ashlye Sams testified outside the presence of the jury that she had known Davis all of her\n\nlife. She said that Davis told her that he did not commit the sexual assaults. Lamar Leggiton\n\ntestified outside the presence of the jury that Davis was his best friend. He said that Davis told him\n\nhe was not guilty of the sexual assault charges. Leggiton further stated that Davis seemed more and\n\nmore distraught as time progressed. Davis could not find a job due to the pending sexual assault\n\ncharges and he was afraid of losing his wife. The prosecutor objected that the defense had failed to\n\nlay a proper predicate for the prior consistent statements.\n\n       The judge sustained the State’s objections to Sams’s testimony in total and to the prior\n\nconsistent statements that Leggiton proposed to relay. The judge ruled that the defense would be\n\npermitted to offer Leggiton’s other testimony concerning Davis’s increasingly distraught mental state\n\nand his various stressors, noting that this evidence supported the defensive theory in the case. The\n\ntrial judge then granted defense counsel’s request for time to confer. Following an off-the-record\n\ndiscussion, the defense proceeded with the presentation of unrelated evidence and then rested\n\nwithout calling Leggiton to testify.\n\n       None of these proffered statements met the fourth prong of the Hammons test because they\n\nwere not made “prior to the time that the supposed motive to falsify arose.”111 First, the proffered\n\nstatements from these three witnesses were self-serving protestations by Davis that he was innocent\n\nof the sexual-assault charges, not the murder charge. Thus, the relevant motive to fabricate arose\n\nwhen Davis became aware of the sexual-assault allegations against him, not when he was charged\n\nwith murder.

Hayes’s testimony before the jury, which was admitted without\n\nobjection, was substantially equivalent to the testimony Hayes gave outside the jury’s presence and\n\nwas very similar to the prior consistent statements that the defense anticipated eliciting from Sams\n\nand Leggiton. Under the circumstances, any error in excluding the testimony from these witnesses\n\nwas harmless.112\n\n       We overrule Davis’s nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first points of error.\n\n                           “ANTI-SPECULATION” JURY CHARGE\n\n       In his twenty-second point of error, Davis contends that the trial judge erred in refusing his\n\nrequest for a charge on “anti-speculation” during the guilt-innocence stage of the trial. He argues\n\nthat his proposed charge was a correct statement of the law prohibiting jurors from reaching their\n\nverdict based on speculation and contends the judge violated his due process rights in denying his\n\nrequest. Davis argues that the specific “anti-speculation” language that he requested was necessary\n\nto accurately guide the jury in its deliberations.

Counsel argued that Davis would not have independently investigated\n\nGray if he were guilty of the sexual assaults. Counsel said Davis was prepared and eager to\n\ngo to trial on the sexual assault charges and “there was no reason for him to kill [Gray] to\n\nprevent her from going to court.” Counsel urged the jury to find Davis guilty only of first-\n\ndegree murder and not capital murder, because the State had not proven that his motive in\n\nmurdering Gray was to keep her from testifying. He also informed the jury that they could\n\ngive Davis “up to a life sentence” for murder.\n\n       The prosecutor’s statements—that Davis “wants you to give him credit and find him\n\nguilty of the lesser[-]included offense of murder. They keep bringing up the punishment\n\nrange. They want you to think about the punishment range”—were a direct response to\n\ndefense counsel’s arguments that urged that jury to choose the lesser-included offense of\n\nmurder, attempted to inspire sympathy for Davis, and reminded the jury that Davis could\n\nreceive a life sentence if convicted of murder. Similarly, the prosecutor’s statement that the\n\ndefense wanted the jurors to “feel better about doing something that’s not supported by what\n\n[Davis] says” was a reasonable deduction from the evidence—including Davis’s\n\ntestimony—and a response to opposing counsel’s arguments.\n\n       Davis testified at trial and admitted that he had created false text messages to offer in\n\nevidence at his sexual-assault trial and had lied in interviews.

In other words, rather than impugning defense counsel’s character, the\n\nprosecutor was suggesting that Davis himself lacked credibility.135\n\n       After the trial judge overruled defense counsel’s objection, the prosecutor then stated,\n\n“That’s why they do that. They want you to look everywhere but [at] what happened on the\n\nshores of the Trinity River.” A logical interpretation of this comment was to suggest that\n\nDavis’s attorneys were trying to misdirect the jury away from the facts of the murder that\n\noccurred on the shores of the Trinity River. Arguably, this remark improperly impugned\n\ndefense counsel’s veracity. But defense counsel did not renew his objection after the\n\nprosecutor made the Trinity River remark. Therefore, Davis did not properly preserve this\n\nparticular complaint for our review.136\n\n       Even if any error regarding this remark had been properly preserved, it would have\n\nbeen non-constitutional error.137 Thus, we would apply the harm standard set out in Texas\n\n\n\n\n       135\n            See Davis, 329 S.W.3d at 823 (concluding that prosecutor’s references to appellant as\na con man who was trying to con the jury with his lengthy testimony was a reasonable deduction\nfrom the evidence and an answer to argument of opposing counsel; prosecutor did not strike over\nthe shoulders of counsel, instead he directly attacked the credibility of appellant, who had\ntestified).\n       136\n             See TEX .

In those cases,\n\nprosecutors accused defense attorneys of manufacturing evidence and of acting in “bad faith\n\nlike usual.”140 We have held remarks similar to those at issue in this case, such as comments\n\nsuggesting that defense attorneys were trying to confuse jurors or lead them down a “rabbit\n\ntrail,” were not harmful to defendants.141 Further, the State’s evidence in this case, including\n\n\n       138\n             TEX .

Davis has not\n\ndemonstrated that the trial judge’s instruction was erroneous, nor that his proposed\n\ninstruction was necessary. This sub-point is inadequately briefed and lacks merit.159\n\n       In sub-point (13), Davis objects to the trial judge’s instruction that the State’s proof\n\nmust exclude “all reasonable doubt” because Article 37.071 and the Eighth Amendment\n\nrequire the State to prove the future-dangerousness special issue “beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.” Davis’s punishment charge did not contain the phrase “all reasonable doubt” and\n\ninstead instructed the jurors that the State’s burden of proof on this special issue was “beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.” This sub-point is not supported by the record.\n\n       In sub-point (14), Davis complains that the trial judge did not give his requested\n\ninstruction that each of the jurors, individually, must determine what “a reasonable doubt”\n\nmeans to him.

Davis argues that he may\n\nassert the jurors’ right to equal protection of the law and due process for them, and the jurors’\n\nconstitutional rights dictate that they should be informed of the legal effect of a holdout juror.\n\nComparing this situation to the judicially-crafted nullification charge at issue in Penry II,180\n\nhe argues that the jurors in his case were likely to give a false answer to the mitigation\n\nquestion “because a juror would feel it [was] impossible to convince nine (9) other jurors to\n\nvote with them.” He further contends that the trial judge’s charge concealed important\n\ninformation from the jurors and thereby violated the requirement in Article 36.14 that the\n\njudge give a charge that “distinctly” sets forth the “law applicable to the case,” the “due\n\ncourse of law” clause of the Texas Constitution, and the Due Process Clause of the United\n\nStates Constitution. He also refers us to Simmons v.

In this case, the trial judge complied with this statutory\n\nrequirement and refrained from informing the jury of the potential effect of a failure to agree.\n\nDavis has not shown that the judge improperly expressed any opinion as to the weight of the\n\nevidence, discussed the facts of the case, or used any argument “calculated to arouse the\n\nsympathy or excite the passions of the jury.” Thus, he has not demonstrated that the trial\n\njudge violated Article 36.14.\n\n       We have repeatedly upheld the validity of the requirement in Article 37.071, § 2 that\n\nprohibits revealing to jurors the effect of capital jurors’ failure to agree.182          Davis’s\n\napplication of Penry II and Simmons to this statutory requirement combines constitutional\n\narguments we have previously addressed, and does not persuade us to change our position\n\non this matter. In Penry II, the Supreme Court held that a former supplemental “nullification\n\ninstruction” directed capital jurors to return a false answer to one of the special issues and\n\nto ignore the verdict form instructions, if they found a mitigating circumstance that justified\n\n\n       182\n           See Prystash v.

Further, we have\n\ndetermined that the version of Article 37.071 under which Davis was tried provides a\n\nsufficient vehicle by which the jury can consider and give effect to mitigating evidence.185\n\n       In Simmons, the Supreme Court held that, where the jury must decide the question of\n\nfuture dangerousness, due process principles require a sentencing jury to be informed when\n\na defendant is ineligible for parole.186 Under South Carolina law, Simmons could never be\n\nreleased on parole, and yet the trial judge prohibited the defense from revealing that fact to\n\nthe jury and thereby prevented the defense from rebutting information the sentencing\n\nauthority considered in imposing his death sentence.187 Davis’s punishment charge correctly\n\ninformed the jury that Davis was “ineligible for release on parole.” The instruction at issue\n\ndid not prevent him from rebutting the State’s evidence.

He argues that the trial judge erred in failing to include a verbatim copy of the\n\nindictment in the jury charge and failing to instruct the jury to disregard any fact militating\n\nin favor of death that was not alleged in the indictment. He also contends that the judge\n\nshould not have submitted the future-dangerousness special issue to the jury because the\n\nindictment did not allege a probability that Davis would commit criminal acts of violence that\n\nwould constitute a continuing threat to society. The majority of the arguments contained in\n\nthis point of error echo those raised in Davis’s twenty-seventh point of error, which we have\n\noverruled.188 Davis does not provide any additional argument or authority that persuades us\n\nto alter our position. In addition, Davis does not provide any argument or authority\n\nsubstantiating his claim that the trial judge erred in failing to include a verbatim copy of the\n\nindictment in the punishment jury charge.189 We overrule his thirty-fourth point of error.\n\n       In his thirty-fifth point of error, Davis complains that the trial judge erroneously\n\nrefused to grant his request to instruct the jury that: there is no presumption in favor of\n\ndeath; even if they were to find him to be a “future danger,” state law presumes life; and the\n\nlaw is always satisfied with a life verdict.

Dretke,192 which holds that relevant\n\nmitigating evidence is “evidence which tends logically to prove or disprove some fact or\n\ncircumstance which a fact finder could reasonably deem to have mitigating value.” He\n\nacknowledges that this Court has previously rejected his arguments.193 He requests that we\n\nreview these issues again and reverse our position, but he provides no new argument or\n\nauthority in support of his request. Further, he does not explain how the jury instructions that\n\nwere given in this case prevented the jury from giving effect to any of his mitigating\n\nevidence.194 Without more, we decline to overrule our precedent.
