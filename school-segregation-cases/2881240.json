The lawsuit alleges the Minneapolis public schools are\nsegregated on the basis of race and socioeconomic status. The claims against the\nMetropolitan Council assert the alleged segregation is the product, in part, of the\nCouncil's housing and transportation policies and practices. The Metropolitan Council\nremoved the case to federal district court under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651(a),\nwhich gives federal courts power \"to effectuate and prevent the frustration of orders it\nhas previously issued in its exercise of jurisdiction otherwise obtained.\" United States\nv. New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. 159, 172 (1977). The Metropolitan Council asserted\nthe plaintiffs' claims against it were identical to claims brought, settled, and released\nby \"plaintiffs and/or their privies\" in an earlier action called Hollman v. Cisneros. The\nconsent decree in Hollman bars all parties from relitigating any matters alleged in that\naction, and the federal district court in Hollman retained jurisdiction to supervise\ncompliance with the decree's provisions until the year 2002. The Metropolitan Council\nasserted that removal to federal court is necessary to prevent frustration of the Hollman\nconsent decree and thus is permissible under § 1651(a).\n\n       The plaintiffs moved to remand to state court, asserting their claims against the\nMetropolitan Council differ from the claims asserted in Hollman in a variety of ways.\nThe district court concluded that the plaintiffs' \"claims in this case are identical to those\nsettled and released in Hollman,\" but concluded § 1651 removal was improper anyway.\nThe district court acknowledged our contrary conclusions about the propriety of\nremoval in NAACP v. Metropolitan Council, 125 F.3d 1171, 1173-75 (8th Cir. 1997)\n(NAACP I), vacated and remanded for reconsideration, 118 S. Ct. 1162 (1998),\nreinstated after remand, 144 F.3d 1168 (8th Cir. 1998) (NAACP II). In those cases,\nas in this one, the plaintiffs sought state injunctive relief against the Metropolitan\nCouncil \"concerning the very matters the Hollman decree governs.\" NAACP I, 125\nF.3d at 1173. We held that under § 1651, the district court had jurisdiction to prevent\nfrustration of the consent decree in Hollman, over which the district court had\nindependent jurisdiction. See NAACP I, 125 F.3d at 1173; NAACP II, 144 F.3d at\n\n                                            -3-\n\f1171. The district court in this case rejected our holdings in NAACP I and NAACP\nII, noting a petition for writ of certiorari was pending. Disregarding our controlling\nprecedent and coming to the opposite conclusion that § 1651 did not permit the\nexercise of jurisdiction over the case, the district court granted the plaintiffs' motion to\nremand all claims against all defendants. Three weeks later, contrary to the district\ncourt's apparent expectation, the Supreme Court denied the plaintiff's petition for writ\nof certiorari in NAACP II. See 119 S. Ct. 73 (1998).\n\n      The Metropolitan Council appeals the remand order. See In re Otter Tail Power\nCo., 116 F.3d 1207, 1212 n.4 (8th Cir. 1997) (remand reviewed on direct appeal rather\nthan by mandamus). The plaintiffs move to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\nWe conclude we have jurisdiction to review the district court's order and reverse.\n\n       To support their assertion that we lack jurisdiction to review the remand order,\nthe plaintiffs rely on 28 U.S.C. § 1447(d). This section forecloses our review of an\norder remanding a case to state court based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction at\nthe time of removal. See Things Remembered, Inc. v. Petrarca, 516 U.S. 124, 127-28\n(1995); In re Otter Tail Power Co., 116 F.3d at 1212 n.5; Trans Penn Wax Corp. v.\nMcCandless, 50 F.3d 217, 223 (3d Cir. 1995). When a district court remands a\nproperly removed case on grounds the court lacks authority to consider, however, §\n1447(d) does not bar review. See Thermtron Prods., Inc. v. Hermansdorfer, 423 U.S.\n336, 351 (1976). In deciding whether a remand order is reviewable, we look beyond\nthe district court's stated reasons for the remand and independently examine the record\nto determine the actual grounds or basis. See Transit Cas. Co. v. Certain Underwriters\nat Lloyd's of London, 119 F.3d 619, 624 (8th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, 118 S. Ct. 852\n(1998); In re Otter Tail Power Co., 116 F.3d at 1212-14.\n\n        In its remand decision, the district court recognized the issue was \"whether a\nfederal court can exercise jurisdiction over a state action pursuant to the All Writs Act\nif the state action frustrates a previous order by the federal court.\" Although we had\n\n                                            -4-\n\falready answered the question affirmatively in NAACP I and NAACP II, the district\ncourt ignored this controlling precedent and made its own directly conflicting\ndetermination that removal was improper under the All Writs Act and that the court\nthus \"lack[ed] jurisdiction to hear [the] case.\" The district court had no power to\nreplace governing circuit law with its own view. See BPS Guard Servs. v. NLRB, 942\nF.2d 519, 524 (8th Cir. 1991) (Eighth Circuit holdings on issues bind all district courts\nin the circuit and district courts must follow those holdings until reversed by the Eighth\nCircuit en banc or the United States Supreme Court); see also Thermtron, 423 U.S. at\n351 (district courts cannot remand contrary to federal law governing removal then\navoid review of remand order). Given our decisions in NAACP I and NAACP II, there\nwas simply no jurisdictional question to be resolved once the district court decided the\nplaintiffs' claims were identical to those settled and released in Hollman. See Aliota\nv. Graham, 984 F.2d 1350, 1357 (3d Cir. 1993). At that point, our case law dictated\nthat jurisdiction was proper at the time of removal. Because the district court remanded\na properly removed cause on grounds the court lacked authority to consider, the remand\norder is reviewable on appeal. See Thermtron, 423 U.S. at 351. We thus deny the\nmotion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n       Turning to the merits, we conclude the district court committed error in\nremanding the claims against the Metropolitan Council because federal court control\nof the current case is necessary to effectuate and prevent the frustration of the earlier\nfederal consent decree in Hollman. See New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. at 172. We held\nin NAACP I and NAACP II that removal of the same claims was appropriate under the\nAll Writs Act to protect the integrity of the Hollman consent decree. The plaintiffs\nassert their claims are different from those raised in Hollman because, among other\nthings, the claims allege violations over a later time period. We agree with the district\ncourt that the alleged differences are immaterial and the plaintiffs' claims against the\nMetropolitan Council in this case \"are identical to those settled and released in\nHollman.\" Because the Hollman court issued a decree redressing those claims and\nretaining jurisdiction to supervise compliance until the year 2002, federal courts have\n\n                                           -5-\n\fauthority over the claims, even if based on later occurrences, until the consent decree\nexpires.\n\n      We thus reverse the district court's order remanding the plaintiffs' claims against\nthe Metropolitan Council and remand with directions to dismiss those claims with\nprejudice.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f",

When a district court remands a\nproperly removed case on grounds the court lacks authority to consider, however, §\n1447(d) does not bar review. See Thermtron Prods., Inc. v.

In deciding whether a remand order is reviewable, we look beyond\nthe district court's stated reasons for the remand and independently examine the record\nto determine the actual grounds or basis.

Certain Underwriters\nat Lloyd's of London, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744107\"><a href=\"/opinion/744107/transit-casualty-company-in-receivership-v-certain-underwriters-at/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">619</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 624 (8th Cir. 1997), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1998); In re Otter Tail Power Co., 116 F.3d at 1212-14.\n\n        In its remand decision, the district court recognized the issue was \"whether a\nfederal court can exercise jurisdiction over a state action pursuant to the All Writs Act\nif the state action frustrates a previous order by the federal court.\" Although we had\n\n                                            -4-\n\falready answered the question affirmatively in NAACP I and NAACP II, the district\ncourt ignored this controlling precedent and made its own directly conflicting\ndetermination that removal was improper under the All Writs Act and that the court\nthus \"lack[ed] jurisdiction to hear [the] case.\" The district court had no power to\nreplace governing circuit law with its own view. See BPS Guard Servs. v. NLRB, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"566875\"><a href=\"/opinion/566875/bps-guard-services-inc-dba-burns-international-security-services-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">519</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 524 (8th Cir. 1991) (Eighth Circuit holdings on issues bind all district courts\nin the circuit and district courts must follow those holdings until reversed by the Eighth\nCircuit en banc or the United States Supreme Court); see also Thermtron, 423 U.S. at\n351 (district courts cannot remand contrary to federal law governing removal then\navoid review of remand order). Given our decisions in NAACP I and NAACP II, there\nwas simply no jurisdictional question to be resolved once the district court decided the\nplaintiffs' claims were identical to those settled and released in Hollman. See Aliota\nv. Graham, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599262\"><a href=\"/opinion/599262/louis-j-aliota-and-paulette-aliota-v-jack-d-graham-william-d-shoemake/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1350</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1357 (3d Cir. 1993). At that point, our case law dictated\nthat jurisdiction was proper at the time of removal. Because the district court remanded\na properly removed cause on grounds the court lacked authority to consider, the remand\norder is reviewable on appeal. See Thermtron, 423 U.S. at 351. We thus deny the\nmotion to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n       Turning to the merits, we conclude the district court committed error in\nremanding the claims against the Metropolitan Council because federal court control\nof the current case is necessary to effectuate and prevent the frustration of the earlier\nfederal consent decree in Hollman. See New York Tel. Co., 434 U.S. at 172. We held\nin NAACP I and NAACP II that removal of the same claims was appropriate under the\nAll Writs Act to protect the integrity of the Hollman consent decree. The plaintiffs\nassert their claims are different from those raised in Hollman because, among other\nthings, the claims allege violations over a later time period. We agree with the district\ncourt that the alleged differences are immaterial and the plaintiffs' claims against the\nMetropolitan Council in this case \"are identical to those settled and released in\nHollman.\" Because the Hollman court issued a decree redressing those claims and\nretaining jurisdiction to supervise compliance until the year 2002, federal courts have\n\n                                           -5-\n\fauthority over the claims, even if based on later occurrences, until the consent decree\nexpires.\n\n      We thus reverse the district court's order remanding the plaintiffs' claims against\nthe Metropolitan Council and remand with directions to dismiss those claims with\nprejudice.\n\n      A true copy.\n\n             Attest:\n\n                     CLERK, U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, EIGHTH CIRCUIT.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f</pre>",
