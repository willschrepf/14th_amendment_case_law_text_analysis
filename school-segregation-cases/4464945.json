(“F&A”), and George Fleming (collectively, “the Fleming\n\nAppellants”) supplement their motions for rehearing filed on November 13, 2015\n\nin Appeal Nos. 14-15-00238-CV and 14-15-00369-CV. See TEX. R. APP. P. 49.1.\n\n          INTRODUCTION: REASONS FOR THE SUPPLEMENT\n\n      The Fleming Appellants file their supplement to make this Court aware of\n\nthe following facts:       the Kirklin Appellees blatantly ignored the Court’s\n\njurisdiction, and improperly filed and scheduled a hearing on a motion for\n\nrehearing in the 234th District Court (No. 2014-53135).      This Court does not\n\nknow that on November 12, 2015, the Kirklin Appellees had moved for rehearing\n\nat the trial court of its denial of their requested trial attorneys’ fees and set a\n\nhearing for Monday, November 23, 2015. Their motion was filed despite both\n\nsides’ full briefing on the issue at this Court.\n\n      At their unilaterally-set hearing, the Kirklin Appellees made false legal\n\nrepresentations to the trial court. First, they argued that this Court no longer\n\nretains jurisdiction over either of the above appeals because the Court ordered the\n\nappeals dismissed as interlocutory. In so doing the Kirklin Appellees consciously\n\ndisregarded the two pending motions for rehearing that the Fleming Appellants\n\nfiled, as well as the Court’s request for their response. Second, they based their\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\fposition on TEX. R. CIV. P. 329b, a rule they do not understand, and that is\n\nimmaterial to the jurisdiction issue.\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n      To inform this Court of the Kirklin Appellees’ ill-advised conduct, the\n\nFleming Appellants begin with the following chronology:\n\n   • 10.29.15        This Court’s dismissal of Appeal Nos. 14-15-00238-CV and\n                     14-15-00369-CV as interlocutory.\n\n   • 11.12.15        Jackson Defendants’ R. 162 notice of dismissal of their claims\n                     in No. 2014- 53135, including sanctions and attorneys’ fees;\n                     filed and served 11.12.15.\n\n   • 11.12.15        Kirklin Appellees’ trial court motion for rehearing of the\n                     denial of attorneys’ fees; filed and served on 11.12.15. A copy\n                     of their motion for rehearing is attached as Ex. 1.\n\n   • 11.13.15        Fleming Appellants’ motion for rehearing, including the R.\n                     162 notice of dismissal; filed and served 11.13.15.\n\n   • 11.17.15        This Court’s request for a response from the Kirklin Appellees\n                     to the motion for rehearing in both appeals; due 11.30.15.\n\n   • 11.18.15        Fleming Appellants’ opposition to the Kirklin Appellees’\n                     motion. A copy of the opposition to rehearing (excluding\n                     exhibits) is attached as Ex. 2.\n\n   • 11.23.15        Oral hearing at the trial court on the Kirklin Appellees’ motion\n     (9:30 a.m.)     for rehearing on the denial of their trial attorneys’ fees; second\n                     evidentiary hearing on motion set for 12.07.15.\n\n   • 11.23.15    Kirklin Appellees’ unilateral expansion of 12.07.15 hearing;\n     (1:23 p.m.) summary judgment attorneys’ fees and sanctions, both passed\n                 earlier. A copy of the notice of hearing is attached as Ex. 3.\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                                    ARGUMENT\n\n       The Kirklin Appellees erroneously misled the trial court—most likely\n\ndeliberately, or perhaps due to their own lack of knowledge of the rules. They\n\nmaintained to the lower court that this Court lacked jurisdiction after it dismissed\n\nthe two appeals as interlocutory. Further, they refused to take into consideration\n\nthe pending motions for rehearing and the Court’s request for their responses by\n\nNovember 30, 2015. And to compound their error, the Kirklin Appellees insisted\n\nto the trial court that it has plenary power to rehear their motion opposing the\n\ndenial of attorneys’ fees. 1\n\n       Judge Ward noted at the hearing that he was “troubled” by the pendency of\n\nthe rehearing motions at this Court. 2 Nonetheless, he set a hearing (evidentiary,\n\napparently) for Monday December 7, 2015 (one week after the response deadline\n\nat this Court); stated he would do some research; and asked for the parties’\n\nbriefing. But any hearing held by the trial court would be improper, since it has no\n\njurisdiction to hear the Kirklin Appellees’ motion.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  In fact, the contents of the motion for rehearing (Ex. 1) improperly uses argument\nand evidence in response to the Fleming Appellants’ appellate briefing on\nattorneys’ fees.\n2\n  Unfortunately, no transcript was made.\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      In short, the Kirklin Appellees have jurisdiction backwards. The trial court’s\n\nlack of jurisdiction and this Court’s plenary power are clear, and both are\n\nsupported legally and by the record.\n\n      First, on March 30, 2015, the trial court signed an order denying the trial\n\ncourt fees and sanctions that the Kirklin Appellees had requested last year.\n\nTherefore, some eight months ago, the Kirklin Appellees had 30 days from the\n\ndate of judgment to file some type of motion to have the ruling changed (e.g., a\n\nmotion for new trial or to modify the judgment). See TEX. R. CIV. P. 329b. The\n\nfiling of that type of motion in March or April 2015 would have extended the trial\n\ncourt’s plenary power over the judgment of fee/sanctions denial for 30 days, even\n\nif they had filed a notice of appeal. Id. at 329b(d).\n\n      But not only did the Kirklin Appellees file no such motion, their legal error\n\ncannot be corrected. That is because on the very next day, March 31, 2015, they\n\nfiled a notice of cross-appeal. By perfecting their cross-appeal, they properly\n\ninvoked this Court’s jurisdiction. See Sweed v. Nye, 323 S.W.3d 873, 875 (Tex.\n\n2010) (per curiam); Approximately $58,641.00 and One 2005 Acura TL v. State,\n\n331 S.W.3d 579, 582 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Court] 2011, no pet.). Hence, the\n\ncase is not pending at the 234th District Court, despite the Kirklin Appellees’\n\nmisguided argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f      Moreover, the Kirklin Appellees’ position is additionally erroneous, because\n\nthis Court retains plenary power at this juncture. They either decided to mislead\n\nthe trial court as to the law on the subject, or do not know the law.\n\n      The Fleming Appellants filed timely motions for rehearing under TEX. R.\n\nAPP. P. 49. Responses were requested, but appellate rulings have yet to issue.\n\nTherefore, appellate plenary power over the October 29, 2015 judgments of\n\ndismissal will not expire until “30 days after the court overrules all timely filed\n\nmotions for rehearing or en banc reconsideration, and all timely filed motions to\n\nextend time to file such a motion.” TEX. R. APP. P. 19.1. Nor, obviously, has the\n\ntime begun to run on the issuance of a mandate. Id. at R. 18.\n\n      As a final note, the Kirklin Appellees continue to flout the rules.   A few\n\nhours after the November 23        hearing, they went even farther by improperly\n\nmoving for rehearing on the following: “The Rule 13 Motion for Sanctions and\n\nAttorneys’ Fees contained in Defendants’ Motion for Summary judgment which\n\nwas filed on December 16, 2014.”\n\n      First, for the same reasons provided above they are not legally permitted to\n\ndo so. And second, as the Fleming Appellants pointed out in their motion for\n\nrehearing at 5-6 and Tabs 2 and 3, the Kirklin Appellees moved for summary\n\njudgment and sanctions. But even if they had requested attorneys’ fees and costs\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fand expenses in one line of their motion (3 CR 752) the record proves they waived\n\nboth fees and sanctions under their summary judgment motion.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n      For reasons argued earlier, the Court should grant the Fleming Appellants’\n\nmotions for rehearing and reinstate Nos. 14-15-00238-CV and 14-15-00369-CV as\n\nappeals from final judgments.\n\n      Additionally, the Court should take into consideration the Kirklin Appellees’\n\ndisregard for this Court’s continuing jurisdiction/plenary power; and its attempt to\n\nmislead the trial court by insisting it has plenary power. The Fleming Appellants\n\nleave to the Court’s discretion any actions it may wish to take, but will apprise the\n\ntrial court of the Kirklin Appellees’ actions.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nFLEMING, NOLEN & JEZ, L.L.P.\n\n\nBy: /s/Sylvia Davidow\n     J.

BACKGROUND\n\nThis case has been on an ill-fated appeal by George Fleming (\"Fleming\") which\n\nhas been dismissed for want of jurisdiction by the Court of Appeals. The reason it\n\nwas sent back from the Court of Appeals is that George Fleming despite being told\n\nto do so by the Court of Appeals, failed and refused to seek an order from this\n\nCourt declaring that the Order granting summary judgment dated April 6, 2015\n\nwas intended to be a final appealable order. In its July 21, 2015 Abatement Order,\n\nthe Court of Appeals stated \"It is the responsibility of any party seeking\n\nreinstatement (of the appeal) to request a hearing date from the trial court and to\n\n                                         1\n\fschedule a hearing...\" Since Fleming refused to request a hearing, the Court of\n\nAppeals had no choice but to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. This conduct by\n\nFleming is further evidence that Fleming is proceeding in bad faith in this litigation\n\nand had no real intention of prosecuting his appeal. This caused the Kirklin\n\nDefendants to incur the considerable expense of fully briefing the issues only to\n\nhave to now start all over again if Fleming files yet another bogus appeal. This\n\ncomes on the heals of Fleming's dismissal of his appeal of this Court's ruling\n\ndismissing the Ware Jackson Defendants within days of filing that appeal. This\n\ntype of dilatory tactics by Fleming should be sanctioned by the courts.\n\n      The appellate briefing revealed that the primary objection that Fleming was\n\nraising as to the trial attorneys' fees was that the Charles Kirklin, Paul Kirklin,\n\nStephen Kirklin and The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. (\"Kirklin Defendants\") were\n\nappearing pro se and therefore had not \"incurred\" any attorneys' fees. Also, this\n\nCourt made a reference to a case (Beckstrom v. Gilmore, 886 S.W.2d 845\n\n(Tex.App.--Eastland, pet. denied) that raised the same issue at the previous hearing\n\nin this Court on attorneys' fees as required by TCPA. This Motion for rehearing\n\nrelies on the previous evidence offered by the Defendants and new additional\n\nevidence proving that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. is not appearing pro se and has\n\nincurred the attorneys' fees being sought.\n\n        B.     Attorneys' Fees Incurred by The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       George Fleming contends that defendants The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.,\n\nCharles Kirklin, Stephen Kirklin, and Paul Kirklin defended themselves pro se, and\n\nthat because they defended themselves pro se, they didn't \"incur\" any attorneys'\n\nfees as is required by the TCPA. This argument is correct in the case of defendants\n\nCharles Kirklin, Stephen Kirklin, and Paul Kirklin, but it's incorrect in the case of\n\ndefendant The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\n       In Texas, a corporation cannot defend itself pro se.1 It must be represented\n\nby a licensed attorney,2 and a corporation cannot be a licensed attorney. In this\n\ncase, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. (a corporation) was represented by Charles\n\nKirklin, Paul Kirklin and Stephen Kirklin (a sole practitioner), (all licensed\n\nattorneys), The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. entered into a written Attorneys' Fees\n\nContract with Charles, Paul and Stephen Kirklin which is attached hereto as\n\nExhibit A to this Motion and incorporated herein the same as if set out fully. This\n\nAttorneys' Fees Contract legally obligated The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. to pay each\n\nof the attorneys for representing it in this case on an hourly basis. Each of the\n\nattorneys performed legal services for the Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. in prosecuting its\n\n\n1\n  Dell Dev. Corp. v. Best Indus. Unif.

Further,\n\neach attorney submitted invoices to The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. which are attached\n\nhereto as Exhibit B to this Motion and incorporated herein the same as if fully set\n\nout. Also, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. paid the invoices as evidenced by the\n\nchecks which are attached hereto as Exhibit C and incorporated herein the same as\n\nif fully set forth.\n\n       At the previous hearing on March 30, 2015 The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\noffered additional undisputed evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. incurred\n\nattorneys' fees to them:\n\n       The reasonable, usual and customary value of the reasonable and\n       necessary legal services of Charles Kirklin, Stephen R. Kirklin and\n       Paul Kirklin incurred by the Kirklin Defendants in defending the\n       Kirklin Defendants [defined to include The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. @\n       7 RR 2584] against this legal action brought by George Fleming is\n       $53,950.00 through March 30, 2015....3\n\n       The Kirklin Defendants then itemized these incurred attorneys' fees,\n\nbeginning with the following statement:\n\n       The following represents reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees\n       incurred by the Kirklin Defendants in defending against the legal\n       action....4\n\n\n\n\n3\n  1 RR 92 (March 30, 2015 Hearing) (emphasis added). The Reporter's Record is attached as\nExhibit D to this Motion and incorporated herein as if fully set out.\n4\n  1 RR 92 - 96 (March 30, 2015 Hearing) (emphasis added)\n                                              4\n\f        After itemizing the hourly charges, Charles Kirklin confirmed that The\n\nKirklin Law Firm, P.C. agreed to pay their attorneys' an hourly fee: \"...the fee is a\n\nfixed hourly fee as shown above.\"5\n\n        Charles Kirklin testified in detail that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. was billed\n\nfor the charges listed in the itemization.6 He concluded by testifying that \"...we\n\nbilled what time we took on each of these projects, yes.\"7\n\n        Texas courts have held that the foregoing evidence is more than sufficient to\n\nprove that attorneys' fees were incurred by a party. For example, in the American\n\nHeritage Capital case, a litigant offered the following affidavit evidence from the\n\nrepresenting attorney:\n\n        My services and the services of [his firm] were and are necessary and\n        the expenses incurred are reasonable in that Plaintiff ... filed suit\n        against Defendants and it was reasonable and necessary for\n        Defendants to retain legal counsel to represent and defend them in this\n        action, as well as to assert their statutory rights under the Texas Anti-\n        SLAPP statute....8\n\nThe court held that the following was evidence that the litigants incurred attorneys'\n\nfees:\n\n        To this evidence we may add [the attorney's] subsequent description\n        of the legal work he and others actually performed on the case and the\n\n5\n  1 RR @ 93 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n6\n  See, for example, 1 RR 107 (March 30, 2015 Hearing); 1 RR 36 (March 30, 2015 Hearing) @\n14 – 17; 1 RR 39 (March 30, 2015 Hearing ) @ 12 – 14; 1 RR 41 – 42 (March 30, 2015\nHearing); 1 RR 44 (March 30, 2015 Hearing) @ 16 – 18; 1 RR 44 – 45 (March 30, 2015\nHearing); 1 RR 45 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n7\n  1 RR 58 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n8\n  Am. Heritage Capital, LP v. Gonzalez, 436 S.W.3d 865, 878 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2014, no pet.)\n                                             5\n\f       existence of the invoices directed to [the litigants]. The evidence,\n       viewed as a whole, gives rise to a reasonable inference that [the\n       litigants] did in fact \"retain,\" i.e., make an agreement to pay, [the\n       attorney and his firm] for their legal services.\n\n       We also agree...that the evidence adequately supports the proposition\n       that [the litigant] also incurred liability for and paid for the legal\n       services of [the attorney and his firm]. In his affidavit, [the attorney]\n       explains what services were performed by members of his law firm,\n       how much time was spent on those services, and what the relevant\n       hourly rates were. Coupled with his previous testimony indicating that\n       [the litigants] retained [the attorney and his firm] to furnish those\n       services, [the attorney's] testimony is some evidence that [the litigant]\n       actually incurred—became liable to pay—fees for those services.9\n\n       Like the litigants in American Heritage Capital, after offering evidence that\n\nit incurred attorneys' fees to its attorneys, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. offered\n\nevidence that explained what services were performed by its attorneys,10 how much\n\ntime was spent on those services,11 and what the relevant hourly rates were.12 This\n\nconstituted evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. incurred attorneys' fees and\n\nin what amounts.\n\n       Fleming cross-examined Charles Kirklin about the number of hours that\n\nwere performed in carrying out various tasks for which The Kirklin Law Firm,\n\nP.C. was billed, but he failed to cross-examine Charles Kirklin on The Kirklin Law\n\nFirm, P.C.'s evidence of the basic fact that it incurred attorneys' fees, at least in\n\n\n9\n  Id.\n10\n   1 RR 94 – 96 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n11\n   Id.\n12\n   Id.\n                                           6\n\fsome amount. He also failed to offer any evidence that would prove otherwise.\n\nThus, the evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. incurred attorneys' fees stands\n\nunchallenged.\n\n         Even if The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. had not submitted the foregoing\n\nevidence, the Texas Supreme Court has held that trial courts can infer that\n\nattorneys' fees were incurred from circumstantial evidence:\n\n         The record reflects...that services were performed on the doctor's\n         behalf. The attorney filed an answer, a plea in abatement, a motion to\n         dismiss, and a notice of appeal. The attorney also appeared, argued,\n         and gave testimony regarding the motion to dismiss. While there is no\n         evidence about what Dr. Garcia (or perhaps his insurance carrier)\n         agreed to pay for these services, it blinks reality to assume that the\n         attorney was a volunteer or that Dr. Garcia did not incur attorney's\n         fees for this work.... Because there is some evidence in this case that\n         attorney's fees were both incurred and reasonable, the trial court\n         should have awarded attorney's fees to Dr. Garcia.13\n\n         In this case, there is direct evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nincurred and paid attorneys' fees as explained above, but there is also plenty of\n\ncircumstantial evidence from which attorneys' fees can be inferred as well. Just as\n\nin the Garcia case, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.'s attorneys filed an answer, a\n\nmotion to dismiss, and took other actions on behalf of their client. According to the\n\nGarcia case, this circumstantial evidence alone is evidence that The Kirklin Law\n\nFirm, P.C. incurred attorneys' fees.\n\nC.       THE ATTORNEYS' FEES ARE REASONABLE AND MANDATORY\n\n13\n     Garcia v. Gomez, 319 S.W.3d 638, 643 (Tex. 2010)\n                                               7\n\fThe $53,950 in attorneys' fees sought by The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. is a\n\nreasonable amount. Charles Kirklin testified in support of these attorneys' fees in\n\ndetail, and the trial court held that \"$53,950 appears to me to be a reasonable and\n\nnecessary fee.\"14 Nevertheless, this Court awarded The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nzero in attorneys' fees at the trial level.\n\n         This was an abuse of discretion because Texas courts have held that when a\n\ncase is dismissed under the TCPA, if any attorneys' fees were incurred (as has been\n\nproven in this case), the trial court must award attorneys' fees to the prevailing\n\nparty in an amount above zero:\n\n         Certain of our sister courts have reached the conclusion that an award\n         of court costs, attorney's fees, and other expenses incurred in\n         defending against the action is mandatory under section 27.009(a)(1)\n         of the TCPA.

(award of court costs, attorney's fees, and expenses mandatory\n      under section 27.009(a) of the TCPA)....15\n\n\n      The plain language of section 27.009(a)(1) mandates that appellants,\n      as successful movants for dismissal, are entitled to an award of\n      reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses incurred in defending\n      against the action that is supported by the evidence. See Cruz, 452\n      S.W.3d at 522. While the statute affords the trial court discretion\n      to adjust downward reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses\n      incurred in defending against the action as justice and equity may\n      require, the statute does not afford discretion to award no\n      attorney's fees and other expenses when the amount of reasonable\n      fees and other expenses incurred in defending against the action\n      are supported by record evidence. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code\n      Ann. § 27.009(a)(1). On this record, we conclude the trial court\n      abused its discretion by awarding no attorney's fees and other\n      expenses incurred in defending against the action to appellants.16\n\n      This Court stated that $53,950 in attorneys' fees was a reasonable and\n\nnecessary fee. It had the discretion to award that amount, or something less than\n\nthat, but it was an abuse of discretion to award no attorneys' fees.\n\n     D.    Segregation of attorneys' fees as between the Kirklin Defendants\n\n      It was unnecessary to segregate the attorneys' fees as between each of the\n\nKirklin Defendants because all attorneys' fees at issue were for legal services\n\nperformed on behalf of all the Kirklin Defendants, including The Kirklin Law\n15\n   Avila v. Larrea, 05-14-00631-CV, 2015 WL 3866778, at *3 (Tex. App.—Dallas June 23,\n2015, pet. filed)\n16\n   Avila @ 5 (emphasis added)\n                                            9\n\fFirm, P.C. Thus, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.'s claims for attorneys' fees were\n\n\"inextricably intertwined\" as between each of the Kirklin Defendants. As stated by\n\nthe 14th Court of Appeals:\n\n       ...if a party proves that the claims arise out of the same transaction and\n       are so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails proof or\n       denial of essentially the same facts, then the fees are deemed to be\n       \"intertwined to the point of being inseparable,\" and the party seeking\n       attorney's fees may recover the entire amount of fees covering all\n       claims.17\n\n       At the trial level, all the legal issues and proof of facts applied to all the\n\nKirklin Defendants equally (same transaction), and they offered evidence that\n\nevery single one of the itemized attorneys' fees entries were performed on behalf of\n\nall the Kirklin Defendants.18\n\n       It would be impossible to segregate these \"inextricably intertwined\"\n\nattorneys' fees as between the Kirklin Defendants, and Texas law doesn't require\n\nsegregation between the parties that are seeking attorneys' fees in such a situation.\n\n     E.     Segregation of Attorneys' Fees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs\n\n       There were two plaintiffs in this litigation at the trial level, Fleming and\n\nFleming & Associates, LLP (\"F&A\") (or collectively \"Fleming Plaintiffs\"). But\n\nonly Fleming is still a plaintiff , and the Kirklin Defendants are seeking attorneys'\n\nfees against only him. The Kirklin Defendants' attorneys did engage in activities\n\n17\n   Air Routing Intern. Corp. (Canada) v. Britannia Airways, Ltd., 150 S.W.3d 682, 693 (Tex.\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.)\n18\n   1 RR 92 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n                                              10\n\fthat related to only Fleming and not to Fleming & Associates, LLP and vice versa.\n\nThus, the Kirklin Defendants were required to segregate their attorneys' fees as\n\nbetween George Fleming and Fleming & Associates, LLP, and they did.\n\n         But Fleming argues that the Kirklin Defendants failed to segregate attorneys'\n\nfees as between the George Fleming and Fleming & Associates, L.L.P. (\"Fleming\n\nPlaintiffs\"):\n\n         Last, despite losing one of the two TCPA motions they copied, the\n         Kirklins still sought almost $54,000 in trial-level fees at higher hourly\n         rates than the other attorneys had billed. Overall, the Kirklins' times\n         sheets demonstrate their lack of \"a good faith effort to exclude from a\n         fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise\n         unnecessary.19\n\n         With respect to factor (4), the U.S. Supreme Court has held \"the most\n         critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award is the\n         degree of success obtained....\" Little need be said on the subject. Even\n         with the benefit of copying other attorneys' ideas and work product,\n         the Kirklins managed to succeed in just one of the two motions they\n         filed.... Therefore, if the Court does not affirm the denial of attorneys'\n         fees due to the Kirklins' pro se attorney status...It should begin with a\n         50% fee reduction to reflect the Kirklins' limited success.20\n\n         This argument is misleading and incorrect. The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nsegregated the attorneys' fees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs, and it is only\n\nseeking the attorneys' fees attributable to work performed in connection with\n\nGeorge Fleming's claims (on which they were successful). The Kirklin Law Firm,\n\nP.C. specifically excluded the attorneys' fees attributable to work performed in\n\n19\n     Brief of Cross-Appellee @ 23\n20\n     Id. @ 26\n                                            11\n\fconnection with F&A's claims (on which they were initially unsuccessful in their\n\nanti-SLAPP motion, but ultimately successful in summary judgment).\n\n         This segregation was laid out clearly in Charles Kirklins' declaration when\n\nthe attorneys' fees were separated into two categories:\n\n         (1) \"LEGAL SERVICES RE: FLEMING & ASSOCIATES,\n         LLP,\"21 and\n\n         (2) \"LEGAL SERVICES RELATED TO MOTION TO DISMISS\n         CLAIMS BY GEORGE FLEMING\"22\n\n         The Kirklin Defendants excluded the first category from their attorneys' fees\n\ndamages calculation, as can be seen at 1 RR 96 (March 30, 2015 Hearing), which\n\ncalculates only the \"TOTALS FOR LEGAL SERVICES RELATED TO MOTION\n\nTO DISMISS CLAIMS OF GEORGE FLEMING 1/12/15 – 3/30/15\" at\n\n$53,950.00. This is the total amount that The Kirklin law Firm, P.C. is seeking for\n\nattorneys' fees at the trial level.\n\n         Thus, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. segregated its calculation of attorneys'\n\nfees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs, and it is only seeking attorneys' fees for\n\nwork performed in connection with the claims asserted by Fleming, individually.\n\n         WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nprays for an award of $53,950.00 in trial attorney's fees.\n\n\n21\n     1 RR 93 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n22\n     1 RR 94 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n\n\n                                           12\n\f                                       Respectfully Submitted,\n\n                                       THE KIRKLIN LAW FIRM, P.C.\n\n\n                                       By: /s/ Paul S.

(n/k/a Fleming, Nolen & Jez,\n\nL.L.P.) and George Fleming (collectively, the Fleming Plaintiffs) oppose the motion for\n\nrehearing filed by Defendants Charles Kirklin, Stephen Kirklin, Paul Kirklin, The Kirklin\n\nLaw Firm, P.C. (n/k/a Kirklin Soh, L.L.P.) (the Kirklin Defendants).\n\n       The Fleming Plaintiffs’ opposition does not address the merits of the Kirklin\n\nDefendants’ motion for rehearing, but rather establishes the Court’s lack of jurisdiction to\n\nentertain it. The Fleming Plaintiffs therefore respectfully request that the Court dismiss\n\nor summarily deny the Kirklin Defendants’ motion for lack of jurisdiction, and order the\n\nrehearing postponed indefinitely:\n\f       1.      The Kirklin Defendants have not only filed a jurisdictionally improper\n\nmotion for rehearing of this Court’s denial of trial attorneys’ fees, but also have\n\nunilaterally set a hearing on the motion for a date the Fleming Plaintiffs’ trial counsel is\n\nunavailable.\n\n       2.      This Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion for rehearing for two\n\nreasons, both of which the Kirklin Defendants ignore:\n\n       First, Defendants divested the Court of jurisdiction by filing a notice of\n\ncross-appeal from the fee denial one day after the order; and\n\n       Second, the Fleming Plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing from the dismissal of appeals\n\nfrom this Court’s (allegedly interlocutory) Orders, and the Kirklin Defendants’\n\ncross-appeal, is presently pending at the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, as is the appellate\n\ncourt’s request for Defendants’ responses.\n\n       3.      The procedural facts establishing lack of jurisdiction follow:\n\n               • This Court denied the Kirklin Defendants’ trial attorneys’ fees and\n                  sanctions motion in an Order signed March 30, 2015.\n\n               • The Kirklin Defendants did not move for rehearing before this Court, as\n                  they were permitted to do. Instead, the next day—March 31, 2015—\n                  they filed a notice of cross-appeal in pending Appeal No. 14-15-00238-\n                  CV (from the anti-SLAPP dismissal), seeking reversal of the denial of\n                  fees and sanctions. Therefore, they are not allowed to move for\n                  rehearing months later, as rehearing has been waived.\n\n               • On October 29, 2015, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals dismissed\n                  Appeal No. 14-15-00238-CV, holding the appeal was not taken from a\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f   final Order.   The dismissal included the Kirklin Defendants’ cross-\n   appeal. It also dismissed a companion appeal, No. 14-15-00369-CV\n   (summary judgment) for the same reason.\n\n• The deadline for a motion for rehearing at the appellate court was\n   Friday, November 13, 2015.\n\n• On November 12, 2015, at 3:43 p.m., co-Defendants Don Jackson,\n   Jeffrey W. Chambers, and Ware, Jackson, Lee & Chambers L.L.P. (the\n   Jackson Defendants) filed a Rule 162 notice of dismissal with this\n   Court.   Effective immediately, therefore, all claims related to the\n   Jackson Defendants were dismissed.        See, e.g., Univ. of Tex. Med.\n   Branch v. Estate of Blackmon, 195 S.W.3d 98, 100 (Tex. 2006).\n\n• 45 minutes later, at 4:33 p.m., the Kirklins improperly filed their motion\n   for rehearing in this Court. But despite certifying that service took place\n   on November 12, they deliberately delayed serving counsel until\n   today—November 18, 2015. Hence, this opposition.\n\n• On November 13, 2015, the Fleming Plaintiffs filed two motions for\n   rehearing at the Court of Appeals, attaching the Jackson Defendants’\n   R. 162 notice of dismissal. A copy of the motion for No. 14-15-00238-\n   CV (without exhibits), which is a duplicate of the motion for No. 14-15-\n   00369-CV, is attached to this opposition as Ex. 1.\n\n• The motions for rehearing are still pending at the Fourteenth Court of\n   Appeals. Therefore, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider and rule on\n   the Kirklin Defendants’ motion for rehearing, and to hear argument on\n   the motion.\n\n• Further, on November 17, 2015, the Court of Appeals requested\n   responses from the Kirklin Defendants to the Fleming Plaintiffs’\n\n\n                              3\n\f                   motions for rehearing. Copies of the appellate court’s requests are\n                   attached to this opposition as Ex. 2. That is because under the R. 49.2\n                   of the Rules of Appellate Procedure:\n\n                      No response to a motion for rehearing need be filed\n                      unless the court so requests. A motion will not be\n                      granted unless a response has been filed or requested\n                      by the court.\n\nTherefore, the Kirklin Defendants should respond to the Court of Appeals’ request, as it\n\nobviously retains jurisdiction. They may not file a motion in this Court, which lacks\n\njurisdiction to consider it.\n\n         4.    Last, the Kirklin Defendants set a hearing without consulting with the\n\nFleming Plaintiffs’ trial counsel as to his schedule. Ken Johnson, trial counsel for the\n\nFleming Plaintiffs, will be unavailable for a hearing on Monday, November 23, 2015. A\n\ncopy of his declaration accompanies this opposition as Ex. 3.\n\n\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n         For all reasons above, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider any submission from\n\nthe Kirklin Defendants, including a motion for rehearing—which was waived in any\n\nevent. The Court should therefore deny or dismiss the Kirklin Defendants’ motion for\n\nrehearing for lack of jurisdiction. Further, the Court should order the hearing continued\n\nindefinitely, to be reset only if the Kirklin Defendants’ motion is properly before the\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f    Respectfully submitted,\n\n    /s/ J.

(“F&A”), and George Fleming (collectively, “the Fleming\n\nAppellants”) supplement their motions for rehearing filed on November 13, 2015\n\nin Appeal Nos. 14-15-00238-CV and 14-15-00369-CV. See TEX. R. APP. P. 49.1.\n\n          INTRODUCTION: REASONS FOR THE SUPPLEMENT\n\n      The Fleming Appellants file their supplement to make this Court aware of\n\nthe following facts:       the Kirklin Appellees blatantly ignored the Court’s\n\njurisdiction, and improperly filed and scheduled a hearing on a motion for\n\nrehearing in the 234th District Court (No. 2014-53135).      This Court does not\n\nknow that on November 12, 2015, the Kirklin Appellees had moved for rehearing\n\nat the trial court of its denial of their requested trial attorneys’ fees and set a\n\nhearing for Monday, November 23, 2015. Their motion was filed despite both\n\nsides’ full briefing on the issue at this Court.\n\n      At their unilaterally-set hearing, the Kirklin Appellees made false legal\n\nrepresentations to the trial court. First, they argued that this Court no longer\n\nretains jurisdiction over either of the above appeals because the Court ordered the\n\nappeals dismissed as interlocutory. In so doing the Kirklin Appellees consciously\n\ndisregarded the two pending motions for rehearing that the Fleming Appellants\n\nfiled, as well as the Court’s request for their response. Second, they based their\n\n\n\n                                             1\n\fposition on TEX. R. CIV. P. 329b, a rule they do not understand, and that is\n\nimmaterial to the jurisdiction issue.\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n      To inform this Court of the Kirklin Appellees’ ill-advised conduct, the\n\nFleming Appellants begin with the following chronology:\n\n   • 10.29.15        This Court’s dismissal of Appeal Nos. 14-15-00238-CV and\n                     14-15-00369-CV as interlocutory.\n\n   • 11.12.15        Jackson Defendants’ R. 162 notice of dismissal of their claims\n                     in No. 2014- 53135, including sanctions and attorneys’ fees;\n                     filed and served 11.12.15.\n\n   • 11.12.15        Kirklin Appellees’ trial court motion for rehearing of the\n                     denial of attorneys’ fees; filed and served on 11.12.15. A copy\n                     of their motion for rehearing is attached as Ex. 1.\n\n   • 11.13.15        Fleming Appellants’ motion for rehearing, including the R.\n                     162 notice of dismissal; filed and served 11.13.15.\n\n   • 11.17.15        This Court’s request for a response from the Kirklin Appellees\n                     to the motion for rehearing in both appeals; due 11.30.15.\n\n   • 11.18.15        Fleming Appellants’ opposition to the Kirklin Appellees’\n                     motion. A copy of the opposition to rehearing (excluding\n                     exhibits) is attached as Ex. 2.\n\n   • 11.23.15        Oral hearing at the trial court on the Kirklin Appellees’ motion\n     (9:30 a.m.)     for rehearing on the denial of their trial attorneys’ fees; second\n                     evidentiary hearing on motion set for 12.07.15.\n\n   • 11.23.15    Kirklin Appellees’ unilateral expansion of 12.07.15 hearing;\n     (1:23 p.m.) summary judgment attorneys’ fees and sanctions, both passed\n                 earlier. A copy of the notice of hearing is attached as Ex. 3.\n\n\n                                           2\n\f                                    ARGUMENT\n\n       The Kirklin Appellees erroneously misled the trial court—most likely\n\ndeliberately, or perhaps due to their own lack of knowledge of the rules. They\n\nmaintained to the lower court that this Court lacked jurisdiction after it dismissed\n\nthe two appeals as interlocutory. Further, they refused to take into consideration\n\nthe pending motions for rehearing and the Court’s request for their responses by\n\nNovember 30, 2015. And to compound their error, the Kirklin Appellees insisted\n\nto the trial court that it has plenary power to rehear their motion opposing the\n\ndenial of attorneys’ fees. 1\n\n       Judge Ward noted at the hearing that he was “troubled” by the pendency of\n\nthe rehearing motions at this Court. 2 Nonetheless, he set a hearing (evidentiary,\n\napparently) for Monday December 7, 2015 (one week after the response deadline\n\nat this Court); stated he would do some research; and asked for the parties’\n\nbriefing. But any hearing held by the trial court would be improper, since it has no\n\njurisdiction to hear the Kirklin Appellees’ motion.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  In fact, the contents of the motion for rehearing (Ex. 1) improperly uses argument\nand evidence in response to the Fleming Appellants’ appellate briefing on\nattorneys’ fees.\n2\n  Unfortunately, no transcript was made.\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      In short, the Kirklin Appellees have jurisdiction backwards. The trial court’s\n\nlack of jurisdiction and this Court’s plenary power are clear, and both are\n\nsupported legally and by the record.\n\n      First, on March 30, 2015, the trial court signed an order denying the trial\n\ncourt fees and sanctions that the Kirklin Appellees had requested last year.\n\nTherefore, some eight months ago, the Kirklin Appellees had 30 days from the\n\ndate of judgment to file some type of motion to have the ruling changed (e.g., a\n\nmotion for new trial or to modify the judgment). See TEX. R. CIV. P. 329b. The\n\nfiling of that type of motion in March or April 2015 would have extended the trial\n\ncourt’s plenary power over the judgment of fee/sanctions denial for 30 days, even\n\nif they had filed a notice of appeal.

Hence, the\n\ncase is not pending at the 234th District Court, despite the Kirklin Appellees’\n\nmisguided argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                           4\n\f      Moreover, the Kirklin Appellees’ position is additionally erroneous, because\n\nthis Court retains plenary power at this juncture. They either decided to mislead\n\nthe trial court as to the law on the subject, or do not know the law.\n\n      The Fleming Appellants filed timely motions for rehearing under TEX. R.\n\nAPP. P. 49. Responses were requested, but appellate rulings have yet to issue.\n\nTherefore, appellate plenary power over the October 29, 2015 judgments of\n\ndismissal will not expire until “30 days after the court overrules all timely filed\n\nmotions for rehearing or en banc reconsideration, and all timely filed motions to\n\nextend time to file such a motion.” TEX. R. APP. P. 19.1. Nor, obviously, has the\n\ntime begun to run on the issuance of a mandate. Id. at R. 18.\n\n      As a final note, the Kirklin Appellees continue to flout the rules.   A few\n\nhours after the November 23        hearing, they went even farther by improperly\n\nmoving for rehearing on the following: “The Rule 13 Motion for Sanctions and\n\nAttorneys’ Fees contained in Defendants’ Motion for Summary judgment which\n\nwas filed on December 16, 2014.”\n\n      First, for the same reasons provided above they are not legally permitted to\n\ndo so. And second, as the Fleming Appellants pointed out in their motion for\n\nrehearing at 5-6 and Tabs 2 and 3, the Kirklin Appellees moved for summary\n\njudgment and sanctions. But even if they had requested attorneys’ fees and costs\n\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\fand expenses in one line of their motion (3 CR 752) the record proves they waived\n\nboth fees and sanctions under their summary judgment motion.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n      For reasons argued earlier, the Court should grant the Fleming Appellants’\n\nmotions for rehearing and reinstate Nos. 14-15-00238-CV and 14-15-00369-CV as\n\nappeals from final judgments.\n\n      Additionally, the Court should take into consideration the Kirklin Appellees’\n\ndisregard for this Court’s continuing jurisdiction/plenary power; and its attempt to\n\nmislead the trial court by insisting it has plenary power. The Fleming Appellants\n\nleave to the Court’s discretion any actions it may wish to take, but will apprise the\n\ntrial court of the Kirklin Appellees’ actions.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\fRespectfully submitted,\n\nFLEMING, NOLEN & JEZ, L.L.P.\n\n\nBy: /s/Sylvia Davidow\n     J.

BACKGROUND\n\nThis case has been on an ill-fated appeal by George Fleming (\"Fleming\") which\n\nhas been dismissed for want of jurisdiction by the Court of Appeals. The reason it\n\nwas sent back from the Court of Appeals is that George Fleming despite being told\n\nto do so by the Court of Appeals, failed and refused to seek an order from this\n\nCourt declaring that the Order granting summary judgment dated April 6, 2015\n\nwas intended to be a final appealable order. In its July 21, 2015 Abatement Order,\n\nthe Court of Appeals stated \"It is the responsibility of any party seeking\n\nreinstatement (of the appeal) to request a hearing date from the trial court and to\n\n                                         1\n\fschedule a hearing...\" Since Fleming refused to request a hearing, the Court of\n\nAppeals had no choice but to dismiss for want of jurisdiction. This conduct by\n\nFleming is further evidence that Fleming is proceeding in bad faith in this litigation\n\nand had no real intention of prosecuting his appeal. This caused the Kirklin\n\nDefendants to incur the considerable expense of fully briefing the issues only to\n\nhave to now start all over again if Fleming files yet another bogus appeal. This\n\ncomes on the heals of Fleming's dismissal of his appeal of this Court's ruling\n\ndismissing the Ware Jackson Defendants within days of filing that appeal. This\n\ntype of dilatory tactics by Fleming should be sanctioned by the courts.\n\n      The appellate briefing revealed that the primary objection that Fleming was\n\nraising as to the trial attorneys' fees was that the Charles Kirklin, Paul Kirklin,\n\nStephen Kirklin and The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. (\"Kirklin Defendants\") were\n\nappearing pro se and therefore had not \"incurred\" any attorneys' fees. Also, this\n\nCourt made a reference to a case (Beckstrom v. Gilmore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1529345\"><a href=\"/opinion/1529345/beckstrom-v-gilmore/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">845</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(Tex.App.--Eastland, pet. denied) that raised the same issue at the previous hearing\n\nin this Court on attorneys' fees as required by TCPA. This Motion for rehearing\n\nrelies on the previous evidence offered by the Defendants and new additional\n\nevidence proving that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. is not appearing pro se and has\n\nincurred the attorneys' fees being sought.\n\n        B.     Attorneys' Fees Incurred by The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\n\n                                             2\n\f       George Fleming contends that defendants The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.,\n\nCharles Kirklin, Stephen Kirklin, and Paul Kirklin defended themselves pro se, and\n\nthat because they defended themselves pro se, they didn't \"incur\" any attorneys'\n\nfees as is required by the TCPA. This argument is correct in the case of defendants\n\nCharles Kirklin, Stephen Kirklin, and Paul Kirklin, but it's incorrect in the case of\n\ndefendant The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\n       In Texas, a corporation cannot defend itself pro se.1 It must be represented\n\nby a licensed attorney,2 and a corporation cannot be a licensed attorney. In this\n\ncase, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. (a corporation) was represented by Charles\n\nKirklin, Paul Kirklin and Stephen Kirklin (a sole practitioner), (all licensed\n\nattorneys), The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. entered into a written Attorneys' Fees\n\nContract with Charles, Paul and Stephen Kirklin which is attached hereto as\n\nExhibit A to this Motion and incorporated herein the same as if set out fully. This\n\nAttorneys' Fees Contract legally obligated The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. to pay each\n\nof the attorneys for representing it in this case on an hourly basis. Each of the\n\nattorneys performed legal services for the Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. in prosecuting its\n\n\n1\n  Dell Dev. Corp. v. Best Indus. Unif.

Kirklin and\n       Paul Kirklin incurred by the Kirklin Defendants in defending the\n       Kirklin Defendants [defined to include The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. @\n       7 RR 2584] against this legal action brought by George Fleming is\n       $53,950.00 through March 30, 2015....3\n\n       The Kirklin Defendants then itemized these incurred attorneys' fees,\n\nbeginning with the following statement:\n\n       The following represents reasonable and necessary attorneys' fees\n       incurred by the Kirklin Defendants in defending against the legal\n       action....4\n\n\n\n\n3\n  1 RR 92 (March 30, 2015 Hearing) (emphasis added).

For example, in the American\n\nHeritage Capital case, a litigant offered the following affidavit evidence from the\n\nrepresenting attorney:\n\n        My services and the services of [his firm] were and are necessary and\n        the expenses incurred are reasonable in that Plaintiff ... filed suit\n        against Defendants and it was reasonable and necessary for\n        Defendants to retain legal counsel to represent and defend them in this\n        action, as well as to assert their statutory rights under the Texas Anti-\n        SLAPP statute....8\n\nThe court held that the following was evidence that the litigants incurred attorneys'\n\nfees:\n\n        To this evidence we may add [the attorney's] subsequent description\n        of the legal work he and others actually performed on the case and the\n\n5\n  1 RR @ 93 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n6\n  See, for example, 1 RR 107 (March 30, 2015 Hearing); 1 RR 36 (March 30, 2015 Hearing) @\n14 – 17; 1 RR 39 (March 30, 2015 Hearing ) @ 12 – 14; 1 RR 41 – 42 (March 30, 2015\nHearing); 1 RR 44 (March 30, 2015 Hearing) @ 16 – 18; 1 RR 44 – 45 (March 30, 2015\nHearing); 1 RR 45 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n7\n  1 RR 58 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n8\n  Am.

The evidence,\n       viewed as a whole, gives rise to a reasonable inference that [the\n       litigants] did in fact \"retain,\" i.e., make an agreement to pay, [the\n       attorney and his firm] for their legal services.\n\n       We also agree...that the evidence adequately supports the proposition\n       that [the litigant] also incurred liability for and paid for the legal\n       services of [the attorney and his firm]. In his affidavit, [the attorney]\n       explains what services were performed by members of his law firm,\n       how much time was spent on those services, and what the relevant\n       hourly rates were. Coupled with his previous testimony indicating that\n       [the litigants] retained [the attorney and his firm] to furnish those\n       services, [the attorney's] testimony is some evidence that [the litigant]\n       actually incurred—became liable to pay—fees for those services.9\n\n       Like the litigants in American Heritage Capital, after offering evidence that\n\nit incurred attorneys' fees to its attorneys, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. offered\n\nevidence that explained what services were performed by its attorneys,10 how much\n\ntime was spent on those services,11 and what the relevant hourly rates were.12 This\n\nconstituted evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. incurred attorneys' fees and\n\nin what amounts.\n\n       Fleming cross-examined Charles Kirklin about the number of hours that\n\nwere performed in carrying out various tasks for which The Kirklin Law Firm,\n\nP.C. was billed, but he failed to cross-examine Charles Kirklin on The Kirklin Law\n\nFirm, P.C.'s evidence of the basic fact that it incurred attorneys' fees, at least in\n\n\n9\n  Id.\n10\n   1 RR 94 – 96 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n11\n   Id.\n12\n   Id.\n                                           6\n\fsome amount. He also failed to offer any evidence that would prove otherwise.\n\nThus, the evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. incurred attorneys' fees stands\n\nunchallenged.\n\n         Even if The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. had not submitted the foregoing\n\nevidence, the Texas Supreme Court has held that trial courts can infer that\n\nattorneys' fees were incurred from circumstantial evidence:\n\n         The record reflects...that services were performed on the doctor's\n         behalf. The attorney filed an answer, a plea in abatement, a motion to\n         dismiss, and a notice of appeal. The attorney also appeared, argued,\n         and gave testimony regarding the motion to dismiss. While there is no\n         evidence about what Dr. Garcia (or perhaps his insurance carrier)\n         agreed to pay for these services, it blinks reality to assume that the\n         attorney was a volunteer or that Dr. Garcia did not incur attorney's\n         fees for this work.... Because there is some evidence in this case that\n         attorney's fees were both incurred and reasonable, the trial court\n         should have awarded attorney's fees to Dr. Garcia.13\n\n         In this case, there is direct evidence that The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nincurred and paid attorneys' fees as explained above, but there is also plenty of\n\ncircumstantial evidence from which attorneys' fees can be inferred as well. Just as\n\nin the Garcia case, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.'s attorneys filed an answer, a\n\nmotion to dismiss, and took other actions on behalf of their client. According to the\n\nGarcia case, this circumstantial evidence alone is evidence that The Kirklin Law\n\nFirm, P.C. incurred attorneys' fees.\n\nC.

Charles Kirklin testified in support of these attorneys' fees in\n\ndetail, and the trial court held that \"$53,950 appears to me to be a reasonable and\n\nnecessary fee.\"14 Nevertheless, this Court awarded The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nzero in attorneys' fees at the trial level.\n\n         This was an abuse of discretion because Texas courts have held that when a\n\ncase is dismissed under the TCPA, if any attorneys' fees were incurred (as has been\n\nproven in this case), the trial court must award attorneys' fees to the prevailing\n\nparty in an amount above zero:\n\n         Certain of our sister courts have reached the conclusion that an award\n         of court costs, attorney's fees, and other expenses incurred in\n         defending against the action is mandatory under section 27.009(a)(1)\n         of the TCPA.

See Cruz, 452\n      S.W.3d at 522. While the statute affords the trial court discretion\n      to adjust downward reasonable attorney's fees and other expenses\n      incurred in defending against the action as justice and equity may\n      require, the statute does not afford discretion to award no\n      attorney's fees and other expenses when the amount of reasonable\n      fees and other expenses incurred in defending against the action\n      are supported by record evidence. See Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.Code\n      Ann. § 27.009(a)(1). On this record, we conclude the trial court\n      abused its discretion by awarding no attorney's fees and other\n      expenses incurred in defending against the action to appellants.16\n\n      This Court stated that $53,950 in attorneys' fees was a reasonable and\n\nnecessary fee. It had the discretion to award that amount, or something less than\n\nthat, but it was an abuse of discretion to award no attorneys' fees.\n\n     D.    Segregation of attorneys' fees as between the Kirklin Defendants\n\n      It was unnecessary to segregate the attorneys' fees as between each of the\n\nKirklin Defendants because all attorneys' fees at issue were for legal services\n\nperformed on behalf of all the Kirklin Defendants, including The Kirklin Law\n15\n   Avila v.

Thus, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.'s claims for attorneys' fees were\n\n\"inextricably intertwined\" as between each of the Kirklin Defendants. As stated by\n\nthe 14th Court of Appeals:\n\n       ...if a party proves that the claims arise out of the same transaction and\n       are so interrelated that their prosecution or defense entails proof or\n       denial of essentially the same facts, then the fees are deemed to be\n       \"intertwined to the point of being inseparable,\" and the party seeking\n       attorney's fees may recover the entire amount of fees covering all\n       claims.17\n\n       At the trial level, all the legal issues and proof of facts applied to all the\n\nKirklin Defendants equally (same transaction), and they offered evidence that\n\nevery single one of the itemized attorneys' fees entries were performed on behalf of\n\nall the Kirklin Defendants.18\n\n       It would be impossible to segregate these \"inextricably intertwined\"\n\nattorneys' fees as between the Kirklin Defendants, and Texas law doesn't require\n\nsegregation between the parties that are seeking attorneys' fees in such a situation.\n\n     E.     Segregation of Attorneys' Fees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs\n\n       There were two plaintiffs in this litigation at the trial level, Fleming and\n\nFleming & Associates, LLP (\"F&A\") (or collectively \"Fleming Plaintiffs\"). But\n\nonly Fleming is still a plaintiff , and the Kirklin Defendants are seeking attorneys'\n\nfees against only him.

(\"Fleming\n\nPlaintiffs\"):\n\n         Last, despite losing one of the two TCPA motions they copied, the\n         Kirklins still sought almost $54,000 in trial-level fees at higher hourly\n         rates than the other attorneys had billed. Overall, the Kirklins' times\n         sheets demonstrate their lack of \"a good faith effort to exclude from a\n         fee request hours that are excessive, redundant, or otherwise\n         unnecessary.19\n\n         With respect to factor (4), the U.S. Supreme Court has held \"the most\n         critical factor in determining the reasonableness of a fee award is the\n         degree of success obtained....\" Little need be said on the subject. Even\n         with the benefit of copying other attorneys' ideas and work product,\n         the Kirklins managed to succeed in just one of the two motions they\n         filed.... Therefore, if the Court does not affirm the denial of attorneys'\n         fees due to the Kirklins' pro se attorney status...It should begin with a\n         50% fee reduction to reflect the Kirklins' limited success.20\n\n         This argument is misleading and incorrect. The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nsegregated the attorneys' fees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs, and it is only\n\nseeking the attorneys' fees attributable to work performed in connection with\n\nGeorge Fleming's claims (on which they were successful). The Kirklin Law Firm,\n\nP.C. specifically excluded the attorneys' fees attributable to work performed in\n\n19\n     Brief of Cross-Appellee @ 23\n20\n     Id. @ 26\n                                            11\n\fconnection with F&A's claims (on which they were initially unsuccessful in their\n\nanti-SLAPP motion, but ultimately successful in summary judgment).\n\n         This segregation was laid out clearly in Charles Kirklins' declaration when\n\nthe attorneys' fees were separated into two categories:\n\n         (1) \"LEGAL SERVICES RE: FLEMING & ASSOCIATES,\n         LLP,\"21 and\n\n         (2) \"LEGAL SERVICES RELATED TO MOTION TO DISMISS\n         CLAIMS BY GEORGE FLEMING\"22\n\n         The Kirklin Defendants excluded the first category from their attorneys' fees\n\ndamages calculation, as can be seen at 1 RR 96 (March 30, 2015 Hearing), which\n\ncalculates only the \"TOTALS FOR LEGAL SERVICES RELATED TO MOTION\n\nTO DISMISS CLAIMS OF GEORGE FLEMING 1/12/15 – 3/30/15\" at\n\n$53,950.00. This is the total amount that The Kirklin law Firm, P.C. is seeking for\n\nattorneys' fees at the trial level.\n\n         Thus, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C. segregated its calculation of attorneys'\n\nfees as between the Fleming Plaintiffs, and it is only seeking attorneys' fees for\n\nwork performed in connection with the claims asserted by Fleming, individually.\n\n         WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, The Kirklin Law Firm, P.C.\n\nprays for an award of $53,950.00 in trial attorney's fees.\n\n\n21\n     1 RR 93 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n22\n     1 RR 94 (March 30, 2015 Hearing)\n\n\n                                           12\n\f                                       Respectfully Submitted,\n\n                                       THE KIRKLIN LAW FIRM, P.C.\n\n\n                                       By: /s/ Paul S.

(n/k/a Fleming, Nolen & Jez,\n\nL.L.P.) and George Fleming (collectively, the Fleming Plaintiffs) oppose the motion for\n\nrehearing filed by Defendants Charles Kirklin, Stephen Kirklin, Paul Kirklin, The Kirklin\n\nLaw Firm, P.C. (n/k/a Kirklin Soh, L.L.P.) (the Kirklin Defendants).\n\n       The Fleming Plaintiffs’ opposition does not address the merits of the Kirklin\n\nDefendants’ motion for rehearing, but rather establishes the Court’s lack of jurisdiction to\n\nentertain it. The Fleming Plaintiffs therefore respectfully request that the Court dismiss\n\nor summarily deny the Kirklin Defendants’ motion for lack of jurisdiction, and order the\n\nrehearing postponed indefinitely:\n\f       1.      The Kirklin Defendants have not only filed a jurisdictionally improper\n\nmotion for rehearing of this Court’s denial of trial attorneys’ fees, but also have\n\nunilaterally set a hearing on the motion for a date the Fleming Plaintiffs’ trial counsel is\n\nunavailable.\n\n       2.      This Court lacks jurisdiction to consider the motion for rehearing for two\n\nreasons, both of which the Kirklin Defendants ignore:\n\n       First, Defendants divested the Court of jurisdiction by filing a notice of\n\ncross-appeal from the fee denial one day after the order; and\n\n       Second, the Fleming Plaintiffs’ motion for rehearing from the dismissal of appeals\n\nfrom this Court’s (allegedly interlocutory) Orders, and the Kirklin Defendants’\n\ncross-appeal, is presently pending at the Fourteenth Court of Appeals, as is the appellate\n\ncourt’s request for Defendants’ responses.\n\n       3.      The procedural facts establishing lack of jurisdiction follow:\n\n               • This Court denied the Kirklin Defendants’ trial attorneys’ fees and\n                  sanctions motion in an Order signed March 30, 2015.\n\n               • The Kirklin Defendants did not move for rehearing before this Court, as\n                  they were permitted to do. Instead, the next day—March 31, 2015—\n                  they filed a notice of cross-appeal in pending Appeal No. 14-15-00238-\n                  CV (from the anti-SLAPP dismissal), seeking reversal of the denial of\n                  fees and sanctions. Therefore, they are not allowed to move for\n                  rehearing months later, as rehearing has been waived.\n\n               • On October 29, 2015, the Fourteenth Court of Appeals dismissed\n                  Appeal No. 14-15-00238-CV, holding the appeal was not taken from a\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f   final Order.   The dismissal included the Kirklin Defendants’ cross-\n   appeal. It also dismissed a companion appeal, No. 14-15-00369-CV\n   (summary judgment) for the same reason.\n\n• The deadline for a motion for rehearing at the appellate court was\n   Friday, November 13, 2015.\n\n• On November 12, 2015, at 3:43 p.m., co-Defendants Don Jackson,\n   Jeffrey W. Chambers, and Ware, Jackson, Lee & Chambers L.L.P. (the\n   Jackson Defendants) filed a Rule 162 notice of dismissal with this\n   Court.   Effective immediately, therefore, all claims related to the\n   Jackson Defendants were dismissed.        See, e.g., Univ. of Tex. Med.\n   Branch v. Estate of Blackmon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894732\"><a href=\"/opinion/894732/university-of-texas-v-estate-of-blackmon/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (Tex. 2006).\n\n• 45 minutes later, at 4:33 p.m., the Kirklins improperly filed their motion\n   for rehearing in this Court. But despite certifying that service took place\n   on November 12, they deliberately delayed serving counsel until\n   today—November 18, 2015. Hence, this opposition.\n\n• On November 13, 2015, the Fleming Plaintiffs filed two motions for\n   rehearing at the Court of Appeals, attaching the Jackson Defendants’\n   R. 162 notice of dismissal. A copy of the motion for No. 14-15-00238-\n   CV (without exhibits), which is a duplicate of the motion for No. 14-15-\n   00369-CV, is attached to this opposition as Ex. 1.\n\n• The motions for rehearing are still pending at the Fourteenth Court of\n   Appeals. Therefore, this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider and rule on\n   the Kirklin Defendants’ motion for rehearing, and to hear argument on\n   the motion.\n\n• Further, on November 17, 2015, the Court of Appeals requested\n   responses from the Kirklin Defendants to the Fleming Plaintiffs’\n\n\n                              3\n\f                   motions for rehearing. Copies of the appellate court’s requests are\n                   attached to this opposition as Ex. 2. That is because under the R. 49.2\n                   of the Rules of Appellate Procedure:\n\n                      No response to a motion for rehearing need be filed\n                      unless the court so requests. A motion will not be\n                      granted unless a response has been filed or requested\n                      by the court.\n\nTherefore, the Kirklin Defendants should respond to the Court of Appeals’ request, as it\n\nobviously retains jurisdiction. They may not file a motion in this Court, which lacks\n\njurisdiction to consider it.\n\n         4.    Last, the Kirklin Defendants set a hearing without consulting with the\n\nFleming Plaintiffs’ trial counsel as to his schedule. Ken Johnson, trial counsel for the\n\nFleming Plaintiffs, will be unavailable for a hearing on Monday, November 23, 2015. A\n\ncopy of his declaration accompanies this opposition as Ex. 3.\n\n\n\n                                      CONCLUSION\n\n         For all reasons above, the Court lacks jurisdiction to consider any submission from\n\nthe Kirklin Defendants, including a motion for rehearing—which was waived in any\n\nevent. The Court should therefore deny or dismiss the Kirklin Defendants’ motion for\n\nrehearing for lack of jurisdiction. Further, the Court should order the hearing continued\n\nindefinitely, to be reset only if the Kirklin Defendants’ motion is properly before the\n\nCourt.\n\n\n\n\n                                              4\n\f    Respectfully submitted,\n\n    /s/ J.
