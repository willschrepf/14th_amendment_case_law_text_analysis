Humphrey, 512 U.S.\n477 (1994). Because plaintiff is no longer in custody, federal habeas relief is unavailable\nto him. Under the law of this Circuit, plaintiff must have access to a federal remedy,\neither under the habeas statute or under § 1983. As plaintiff cannot avail himself of\nhabeas relief, he must be allowed to pursue his claims under § 1983. Accordingly,\nHeck’s exception to § 1983’s broad coverage does not apply to his claims. We therefore\nVACATE the decision of the district court and REMAND for further proceedings.\n\n       Chief Judge Jacobs dissents in a separate opinion\n\n                                  JOEL B.

He was sentenced to\n\n10 to 20 years in prison.     Poventud ultimately succeeded in having his conviction\n\nvacated, but the prosecution appealed, and Poventud was denied bail. Rather than\n\nawait a new trial in custody, Poventud pled guilty to a lesser charge for which the\n\npenalty was a one-year sentence—a jail term that Poventud had already served.\n\n      In May 2007, Poventud brought the instant action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nalleging Brady violations against the officials who conducted his original investigation\n\nand prosecution. In July 2009, Poventud stayed this proceeding pending the outcome\n\nof a state-court motion to invalidate his guilty plea. Poventud later withdrew the state\n\nmotion without prejudice and resumed this suit. In June 2011, defendants moved for\n\nsummary judgment. The District Court (Batts, J.) granted the motion in March 2012,\n\nruling that Poventud’s § 1983 claims are barred under Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477\n\n(1994). See Poventud v. City of New York, No. 07 Civ. 3998 (DAB), 2012 WL 727802, at\n\n*3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 2012).\n\n      We disagree. Because Poventud is no longer in custody, and therefore can no\n\nlonger bring a federal habeas suit, Heck’s narrow exception to § 1983’s otherwise broad\n\ncoverage does not apply. Poventud may bring suit under § 1983 regardless of any\n\ndefenses which might arise based on his subsequent guilty plea to the lesser charge.\n\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fAccordingly, we vacate the District Court’s decision granting summary judgment and\n\nremand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n      The parties dispute various points in the factual record. When, as here, we\n\nreview a grant of summary judgment dismissing a complaint, “we construe the evidence\n\nin the light most favorable to the plaintiff, drawing all reasonable inferences and\n\nresolving all ambiguities in his favor.” Colavito v. N.Y. Organ Donor Network, Inc., 438\n\nF.3d 214, 217 (2d Cir. 2006).\n\n      In March 1997, Younis Duopo was robbed and shot in the head or neck by two\n\nmen sitting in the back seat of a livery cab that Duopo was driving through the Bronx.\n\nLater, Frankie Rosado, a detective, found a wallet on the floor of the cab by the front\n\npassenger seat. Somehow the NYPD Crime Scene Unit had missed the wallet. The\n\nwallet contained a pair of old photo I.D. cards belonging to Francisco Poventud, brother\n\nof the plaintiff-appellant. When investigators showed Duopo a photo array containing\n\none of the photos of Francisco Poventud (who allegedly looks nothing like his brother),\n\nDuopo positively identified it as a picture of his assailant.     At the time, however,\n\nFrancisco Poventud was incarcerated and could not possibly have committed the crime.\n\nDetectives then showed Duopo photo arrays containing a picture of Marcos Poventud.\n\nOnly upon seeing Marcos’s photo for the fourth time did Duopo identify Marcos as the\n\nshooter. Marcos was arrested, identified (by Duopo) at a line-up, and indicted, along\n\nwith a co-defendant, Robert Maldonado, whom Duopo also identified. Investigators left\n\nno record of the false identification of Francisco Poventud; they also did not disclose it\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fto defense counsel or to the Bronx County prosecutors; and they did not preserve the\n\nphoto array.\n\n      Marcos Poventud learned all of this only during the 2003 retrial of Robert\n\nMaldonado. In December 2004, Poventud filed a motion under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 440.10\n\nto vacate his conviction on the ground that the prosecution withheld exculpatory\n\nevidence. The New York Supreme Court for Bronx County granted this motion in\n\nOctober 2005.    The prosecution filed a notice of appeal; successfully argued that\n\nPoventud be denied bail; and offered him immediate release in exchange for a guilty\n\nplea to a non-violent, Class E felony charge of third-degree attempted robbery. By this\n\ntime, Poventud had been incarcerated for nearly nine years. Poventud testifies that\n\nduring his imprisonment he endured gruesome and repetitive physical and sexual\n\nabuse; that he attempted suicide; and that he suffered from depression and post-\n\ntraumatic stress disorder. In January 2006, Poventud accepted the terms of the plea\n\nbargain and went home.\n\n      Poventud now contends that he was deceived into pleading guilty. He alleges that\n\nthe assistant district attorney knew, but did not disclose, that the district attorney’s\n\noffice had decided not to perfect its appeal. Poventud alleges further that the ADA\n\nwithheld crucial information from the defense. When he learned of these omissions,\n\nPoventud stayed the instant federal suit and moved in state court to have his guilty plea\n\nvacated as involuntarily given. The New York Supreme Court for Bronx County granted\n\nan evidentiary hearing on the question of voluntariness, but Poventud withdrew his\n\nmotion without prejudice. He says he did this after learning that he had multiple\n\nmyeloma, after nearly dying from kidney failure, and after undergoing bone and stem\n\ncell transplants and chemotherapy. Poventud asserts that he thought the stress and\n\n\n                                           4\n\finfection risks of a new trial, together with the possibility, however remote, of returning\n\nto jail, would kill him. After withdrawing his state motion, Poventud resumed this\n\nfederal action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in which he alleges violations of his federal due\n\nprocess and fair trial rights under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963). He also sues\n\nthe City of New York for failing properly to train its officers.\n\n       The district court found that, because plaintiff’s guilty plea was to conduct that\n\n“necessarily required his presence at the scene of the crime,” success on a § 1983 claim\n\narising out of the suppression of evidence relevant to his alleged misidentification would\n\n“logically imply the invalidity” of his guilty plea. Poventud, 2012 WL 727802, at *3. This\n\nbeing so, the court continued, Poventud could survive summary judgment under Heck\n\nonly by showing “that the challenged conviction has been reversed, expunged,\n\ninvalidated, or called into question.” Id. Poventud could do none of this, the court\n\nconcluded, either as to his first conviction or to his guilty plea. Moreover, Poventud’s\n\n“decision not to pursue in the state court an available remedy by which he could\n\ninvalidate his [guilty plea] does not relieve him of his obligation to demonstrate its\n\ninvalidity if he is to avoid the bar established in Heck.” Id. at *4. The district court\n\ngranted defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and this appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n       We review grants of summary judgment de novo.               See Anemone v. Metro.\n\nTransp. Auth., 629 F.3d 97, 113 (2d Cir. 2011).\n\n       We conclude that Heck does not bar Poventud’s § 1983 claims. Under the law of\n\nthis Circuit, a plaintiff asserting the unconstitutionality of his conviction or\n\nincarceration must have access to a federal remedy. Normally that remedy is through a\n\n\n                                              5\n\f§ 1983 action. If, however, the plaintiff is in custody, Heck may apply and require that\n\nthe plaintiff assert his claim first in a habeas petition. As Poventud is no longer in\n\ncustody, Heck does not bar his claims under § 1983. The district court erred, then, in\n\ngranting summary judgment against him on the basis of Heck. The law of this Circuit in\n\nthis matter derives from the interplay of two Supreme Court decisions: Heck v.\n\nHumphrey itself, and the subsequent Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1 (1998).\n\n\n\nHeck and Spencer\n\n      The petitioner in Heck was a state prisoner who sought relief under § 1983.\n\nEarlier, Heck had twice sought and failed to secure relief under the federal habeas\n\nstatute. In upholding the dismissal of Heck’s § 1983 claims, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat when the success of a § 1983 claim would “necessarily require the plaintiff to prove\n\nthe unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement,” the complaint must be dismissed\n\nunless the plaintiff can “prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on\n\ndirect appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal\n\nauthorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court’s\n\nissuance of a writ of habeas corpus.” Heck, 512 U.S. at 486-87. In other words, the\n\nCourt continued,\n\n\n\n      when a state prisoner seeks damages in a § 1983 suit, the district court\n\n      must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would\n\n      necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would,\n\n      the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that\n\n      the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\n\n\n                                           6\n\fId. at 487. This statement tracked the fact pattern in Heck, which involved “a state\n\nprisoner”—that is, someone still in custody. In a footnote, and in dicta, the Court\n\nsuggested, however, that the rule should similarly apply to plaintiffs no longer in\n\ncustody: “We think the principle barring collateral attacks . . . is not rendered\n\ninapplicable by the fortuity that a convicted criminal is no longer incarcerated.” Id. at\n\n490 n.10.\n\n      In a concurrence, Justice Souter, joined by three colleagues, expressed\n\nreservations about denying relief to plaintiffs seeking damages under § 1983 for\n\nunconstitutional convictions or imprisonment who, because they were no longer\n\nimprisoned, could have no relief under habeas. Extending Heck’s favorable termination\n\nrequirement to plaintiffs not in custody, Justice Souter wrote, would “deny any federal\n\nforum for claiming a deprivation of federal rights to those who cannot first obtain a\n\nfavorable state ruling.” Id. at 500 (Souter, J., concurring). A better way to read the\n\nmajority’s opinion is “as saying nothing more than that now, after enactment of the\n\nhabeas statute and because of it, prison inmates seeking § 1983 damages . . . must\n\nsatisfy a . . . favorable-termination requirement.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n      Four years after Heck, Justice Souter repeated these views in another\n\nconcurrence. Spencer, 523 U.S. at 18-21 (Souter, J., concurring). This time he was\n\njoined by four Justices. Three joined Justice Souter’s concurrence, which stated (again\n\nin dicta, as the case ultimately turned on other grounds) “that a former prisoner, no\n\nlonger ‘in custody,’ may bring a § 1983 action establishing the unconstitutionality of a\n\nconviction or confinement without being bound to satisfy a favorable-termination\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\frequirement that it would be impossible as a matter of law for him to satisfy.” Id. at 21.1\n\nAnd Justice Stevens, in dissent, went out of his way to adhere to Justice Souter’s\n\nposition. Id. at 25 n.8 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\nThe Law of the Circuit\n\n              Our Court has adopted Justice Souter’s dicta in Spencer. In Jenkins v. Haubert,\n\nwe reversed the dismissal of a former inmate’s § 1983 challenge to the validity of two\n\nprison disciplinary hearings. 179 F.3d 19 (2d Cir. 1999). We held that “a § 1983 suit by a\n\nprisoner . . . challenging the validity of a disciplinary or administrative sanction that\n\ndoes not affect the overall length of a prisoner’s confinement is not barred by Heck.” Id.\n\nat 27. To hold otherwise, we noted, “would contravene the pronouncement of five\n\njustices that some federal remedy—either habeas corpus or § 1983—must be available.”\n\nId. (emphasis added). In Leather v. Eyck, decided the same day as Jenkins, we held\n\nthat Heck did not bar the § 1983 suit of an arrestee who was convicted (but fined rather\n\nthan imprisoned) for driving while impaired. 180 F.3d 420 (2d Cir. 1999). “Because\n\nLeather is not and never was in the custody of the State,” we explained, “he, like Jenkins,\n\nhas no remedy in habeas corpus. Having escaped the jaws of Heck, Leather should\n\ntherefore be permitted to pursue his § 1983 claim in the district court.” Id. at 424.\n\n              Since Jenkins and Leather, we have repeatedly affirmed that Heck’s favorable-\n\ntermination requirement applies only to plaintiffs who are in custody, and that all other\n\nclaimants—those who have no remedy in habeas—may pursue their claims under\n                                                            \n1   Between Heck and Spencer, Justice Ginsburg revised her view of the matter. See Spencer, 523 U.S. at 21\n(Ginsburg, J., concurring) (“I have come to agree with Justice SOUTER’s reasoning: Individuals without\nrecourse to the habeas statute because they are not ‘in custody’ (people merely fined or whose sentences\nhave been fully served, for example) fit within § 1983’s broad reach.”) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n\n                                                               8\n\f§ 1983. See McKithen v. Brown, 481 F.3d 89, 101 (2d Cir. 2007) (“Over time, [Heck’s]\n\nimplicit exception [to § 1983’s otherwise broad coverage] has been carefully\n\ncircumscribed.”); Huang ex rel. Yu v. Johnson, 251 F.3d 65, 75 (2d Cir. 2001) (“In light\n\nof our holding in Leather, and in light of . . . the fact that the Spencer concurrences and\n\ndissent ‘revealed that five justices hold the view that, where federal habeas corpus is not\n\navailable to address constitutional wrongs, § 1983 must be,’ we conclude that Huang’s\n\nSection 1983 claim must be allowed to proceed.”) (quoting Jenkins, 179 F.3d at 26);\n\nGreen v. Montgomery, 219 F.3d 52, 60 n.3 (2d Cir. 2000) (“We have held . . . that Heck\n\nacts only to bar § 1983 suits when the plaintiff has a habeas corpus remedy available to\n\nhim (i.e., when he is in state custody).                       Because it does not appear that Green is\n\npresently in state custody, his § 1983 action is not barred by Heck.” (internal citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n              The facts in this case differ somewhat from the facts in the cases just cited, but\n\nnot in a way that is material to the issue before us. After Poventud’s original conviction\n\nwas vacated, but before that vacatur was affirmed on appeal, Poventud pled guilty to a\n\nlesser, related offense.2 This fact, however, does not alter the underlying principle that a\n\n                                                            \n2   Although we think it unnecessary to reach the issue in light of our conclusion that Heck’s bar does not\napply to a § 1983 plaintiff who is not in custody, even if Heck did apply, we are doubtful that success on\nPoventud’s § 1983 suit would “necessarily imply the invalidity,” Heck, 512 U.S. at 487, of his subsequent\nguilty plea. The alleged Brady violation resulted in a conviction that was later vacated. Because that\nconviction was vacated—regardless of whether Poventud then pled guilty or was retried—victory in his\n§ 1983 suit would no longer implicate the validity of an outstanding criminal judgment. See Smith v.\nGonzalez, 222 F.3d 1220, 1222 (10th Cir. 2000); Davis v. Zain, 79 F.3d 18, 19 (5th Cir. 1996) (per\ncuriam). Moreover, Poventud’s § 1983 suit cannot call into question the validity of his guilty plea,\ninasmuch as it is undisputed that at the time he pled guilty Poventud was aware of the Brady violation on\nwhich his present lawsuit is based. See Smith, 222 F.3d at 1222 (where conviction was vacated and case\nremanded due to Brady violation, success on plaintiff’s § 1983 suit had no relevance to a later criminal\ntrial, since the prosecution could not withhold the same exculpatory evidence at a subsequent trial).\n\n\n\n                                                               9\n\fclaimant who cannot seek relief under habeas must be able to seek it under § 1983.\n\nPoventud’s guilty plea may (or may not) supply defendants with a defense that no § 1983\n\nviolation occurred. But it does not entitle them to summary judgment under Heck.\n\n              To repeat, the law of this Circuit makes clear that a plaintiff alleging civil rights\n\nviolations in connection with his conviction or imprisonment must have access to a\n\nfederal remedy either under habeas or under § 1983. Because Poventud is not in\n\ncustody, he has no remedy under habeas. He must be able, therefore, to pursue relief\n\nunder § 1983.\n\n\n\n                                                               CODA\n\n              We would end here, but for the apocalyptic tone of the dissent, which requires a\n\nbrief answer. Among its many flaws are the following.\n\n              First. Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, the majority does not rely principally\n\non Leather. It relies at least as much on Jenkins. It does so because Jenkins, an opinion\n\nwritten by Judge Walker and concurred in by Judge Miner and Judge Sack,3 most\n\nclearly embraced, and most thoroughly recited the history behind, the proposition that\n\nwe reaffirm today: “that some federal remedy—either habeas corpus or § 1983—must be\n\navailable.” 179 F.3d at 27. To be sure, the panel in Jenkins also had other grounds for its\n\ndecision. Id. (“We do not rest our holding solely on our tally of votes on the [Supreme]\n\nCourt for Justice Souter’s view of Heck.”). And it is true, as the dissent points out, that\n\nJenkins dealt with prison discipline rather than a conviction. But that, for purposes of\n\nthe case before us, is a distinction without a difference. The court in Jenkins did not\n\n                                                            \n3   We mention the names of individual judges only because the dissent goes out of its way to do so.\n\n\n\n                                                                10\n\flimit its endorsement of Justice Souter’s position to the facts before it. It stated that\n\nendorsement as a general proposition and, having done so, made it one basis for its\n\nholding.\n\n       It is significant, moreover, that Jenkins and Leather (which dealt with an actual\n\ncriminal conviction, and not only with conditions of confinement) came down the same\n\nday. As is well known, the normal practice, when two panels are dealing with closely\n\nrelated issues at the same time, is for the panels to communicate with each other to\n\nensure, if at all possible, that the opinions are consistent. One can therefore assume\n\nthat, together, Jenkins and Leather reflected the law of the Circuit at the time, and that\n\nthe law was, as Jenkins stated it, “that some federal remedy—either habeas corpus or §\n\n1983—must be available.” 179 F.3d at 27. Significantly, within a year, this view was\n\naffirmed again in Green v. Montgomery, which stated that “Heck acts only to bar §\n\n1983 suits when the plaintiff has a habeas corpus remedy available to him (i.e., when he\n\nis in state custody).” 219 F.3d at 60 n.3 (Kearse, J.; Calabresi, J.; Katzmann, J.). Less\n\nthan a year after Green, this position was stated yet again in Huang v. Johnson. 251\n\nF.3d at 75 (“In light of our holding in Leather, and in light of both the\n\nSpencer majority’s dictum and the fact that the Spencer concurrences and dissent\n\n‘revealed that five justices hold the view that, where federal habeas corpus is not\n\navailable to address constitutional wrongs, § 1983 must be,’ Jenkins, 179 F.3d at 26, we\n\nconclude that Huang’s Section 1983 claim must be allowed to proceed.”) (Feinberg, J.;\n\nWinter, J.; Cabranes, J.).\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f              Within a period of two years, then, four unanimous panels of the Second Circuit,\n\nincluding a majority of active judges sitting throughout that time,4 affirmed the position\n\nof the Circuit that Heck’s bar on § 1983 relief applies only when federal relief can be\n\nsought under habeas. These panels so ruled because, as the Jenkins Court noted, to do\n\notherwise “would contravene the pronouncement of five justices that some federal\n\nremedy—either habeas corpus or § 1983—must be available.” 179 F.3d at 27. And this is\n\nthe principle the majority follows today. Indeed, this position is so clearly the current\n\nlaw of the Circuit that the majority considered this case a candidate for disposition by\n\nsummary order on this ground only, rather than on the alternate ground discussed\n\nbelow.\n\n              Second. The dissent suggests, nonetheless, that Jenkins, Leather, Green, and\n\nHuang—and the judges who participated in those three decisions—flew in the face of a\n\nSupreme Court holding that remained the law despite subsequent Supreme Court dicta\n\nto the contrary. If that were true, these opinions would have been wrong,5 and one\n\nwould have expected that fact to have been raised at the time. The Supreme Court in\n\nHeck decided a case in which habeas was available. In dicta, in a footnote, which was\n                                                            \n4   That is, seven active judges (Judges Kearse, Walker, Calabresi, Cabranes, Straub, Sack, and Katzmann)\nout of thirteen. Judge Winter, who served as Chief Judge when Jenkins, Leather, and Green were\ndecided, had assumed senior status before writing the panel opinion in Huang.\n\n5   This was not always necessarily so, see W. Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 642 (1943)\n(affirming a district court decision that parted with clear Supreme Court precedent in the belief that the\nSupreme Court would now decide the matter differently), but it is so now, see Rodriguez de Quijas v.\nShearson/Am. Express, Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 (1989) (“If a precedent of this Court has direct application\nin a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals\nshould follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own\ndecisions.”).\n\n\n\n\n                                                               12\n\fcompletely unnecessary to the decision in Heck, there is language suggesting that the\n\nholding might well be extended to a future case where habeas was not available. Heck,\n\n512 U.S. at 490 n.10. It was to distance himself from this dicta that Justice Souter wrote\n\nhis concurrence. And, when one of the Justices who had joined the Heck footnote\n\nchanged her mind, see Spencer, 523 U.S. at 21 (Ginsburg, J., concurring), it became\n\nclear that the Heck dicta no longer commanded the support of a majority of Supreme\n\nCourt Justices.\n\n              In such circumstances—i.e., where there is no Supreme Court holding in one\n\ndirection, and there are powerful statements by a majority of the Justices in an opposite\n\ndirection—it is perfectly appropriate (though not required) for a lower court to embrace\n\nthe position adopted (albeit in dicta) by that majority. This is precisely what the panels\n\nin Jenkins, Leather, Green, and Huang did.\n\n              Third. The dissent claims that in doing this, the Jenkins, Leather, Green, and\n\nHuang Courts improperly altered the law of the Circuit without going in banc. There is\n\nno need, however, to discuss today what the Circuit law was before the Supreme Court\n\ndecided Heck and Spencer. For, even assuming, very much, arguendo that the dissenter\n\nis correct as to our Circuit’s pre-Heck law,6 it is readily accepted that a panel of this\n\n\n                                                            \n6   We note that the two Second Circuit decisions—Roesch v. Otarola, 980 F.2d 850 (2d Cir. 1992) and\nSingleton v. City of New York, 632 F.2d 185 (2d Cir. 1980)—that the dissent adduces for the proposition\nthat our pre-Heck cases did not turn “on whether the plaintiff was incarcerated or at liberty when suit was\nfiled,” both involved § 1983 claims sounding in malicious prosecution. Of course these cases didn’t turn\non whether the plaintiff was in or out of custody. They turned on the fact that favorable termination is an\nelement of malicious prosecution. These decisions did not anticipate Heck; they simply applied an old\ncommon law rule from which the Heck majority drew a controversial analogy. Whatever the vices of the\nJenkins-Leather-Green-Huang line of cases, we do not think that even so hardened a foe as the dissenter\ncan accuse them of straying from the notion that a claim must be dismissed if one of its elements—i.e.,\nfavorable termination in malicious prosecution suits—is missing. The dissent also cites two cases—\n\n\n                                                               13\n\fCourt may depart from a prior decision when that earlier decision’s “rationale is\n\noverruled, implicitly or expressly, by the Supreme Court.” In re Sokolowski, 205 F.3d\n\n532, 535 (2d Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). As far as we\n\ncan determine, our Court has not clearly decided whether such undermining must\n\nhappen in a holding by the Supreme Court, or whether clear dicta also suffices.7 In any\n\nevent, had anyone cared to disagree with Jenkins or Leather or Green or Huang on the\n\nground that they deviated from prior holdings, the time to say so was when those four\n\ncases were decided.                              Accordingly, one would have expected a request for in banc\n\nreconsideration at that time. There was no such request, which comes as no surprise\n\ngiven the unanimity of support in those cases for the position we reaffirm today. The\n\ndissenter obviously disagrees, as is his right, with the position our Court then took. But,\n\ngiven those holdings, we would think it preferable for the dissent to state that\n\ndisagreement by concurring in today’s result and expressing distaste for the settled law\n\nthat requires such a concurrence.\n\n              Fourth. Quite apart from whether the absence of habeas, by itself, means that a\n\n§ 1983 action may lie, the dissent is incorrect in its statement that this § 1983 action\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \nAmaker v. Weiner, 179 F.3d 48 (2d Cir. 1999), and Channer v. Mitchell, 43 F.3d 786 (2d Cir. 1994) (per\ncuriam)—that were not malicious prosecution cases, but were cases in which the petitioner was still\nincarcerated and could bring habeas. The bar on § 1983 suits in those circumstances, of course, continues\nto apply.\n\n7   In one case, in which the Supreme Court had suggested a certain direction in dicta but then explicitly left\nthe question open, we concluded that “the Supreme Court’s dicta do not outweigh prior circuit authority.”\nMeacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab., 381 F.3d 56, 70 (2d Cir. 2004), rev’d on other grounds by KAPL,\nInc. v. Meacham, 544 U.S. 957 (2005). As a general matter, however, “[w]e have also observed that we\nmay depart from a prior decision when it merely ‘has been called into question by an intervening United\nStates Supreme Court decision.’” Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc. v. UGI Utils., Inc., 423 F.3d 90, 101 n.12\n(2d Cir. 2005) (quoting Meacham, 381 F.3d at 69).\n\n\n\n                                                                                            14\n\fcalls into question Poventud’s second conviction. It does nothing of the sort. It asserts\n\nthat his constitutional rights were violated by the state through a Brady violation.\n\nUnder Heck, this could not have been brought up prior to the quashing of his first\n\nconviction because a finding of a Brady violation would undercut that conviction. But\n\nonce that conviction was quashed, the Brady violation—if one were established, and if it\n\ninjured Poventud—would constitute an independent infringement of Poventud’s\n\nconstitutional rights, regardless of his subsequent conviction.\n\n       To give a dramatic example: suppose a defendant is tortured viciously, confesses,\n\nand is convicted on the basis of that confession. Under Heck, he cannot, while in jail on\n\nthat conviction, bring a § 1983 action for being tortured because that would undercut\n\nthe conviction. But once his conviction is quashed (through habeas or in other ways), he\n\nis free to assert that he was tortured and seek a § 1983 remedy. Does the dissent really\n\nbelieve that this becomes less true if that defendant later freely confesses, even to the\n\nsame crime? At that point, the claim for damages for torture in no way undercuts the\n\nsecond, and only existing, conviction and hence is in no way barred by Heck.\n\n       At core, this is what Poventud claims today. He seeks damages for the harm\n\ncaused by a Brady violation in connection with his first (invalidated) conviction; he\n\nmakes no claims at all with respect to his second (outstanding) conviction.          See\n\nAppellant’s Br. 32 (“Seeking damages only for punishment he suffered in excess of the\n\none-year imprisonment he accepted as part of his plea, the lawsuit, if successful, would\n\nnot be inconsistent with that plea.”).     As noted earlier, whether there was such a\n\nviolation, and whether there were such damages, will be determined in a § 1983 trial.\n\nBut whatever the result of that trial, Poventud’s subsequent guilty plea is not\n\nundermined by his § 1983 action.\n\n\n                                            15\n\f       Finally, the dissent makes the extraordinary argument that habeas might be\n\navailable to Poventud because his “inability to bring a § 1983 action alone may\n\nconstitute a collateral consequence sufficient to overcome a mootness challenge and\n\nsupport a . . . post-release habeas petition.” This argument, which has not been made by\n\nanyone in this case, is circular. It posits a result—the unavailability of § 1983 relief—and\n\non the basis of that result creates the premise for that result. It is, in short, absolutely\n\nPtolemaic in the uselessness of its epicycles.\n\n\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court’s judgment and\n\nREMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f 1   DENNIS JACOBS, Chief Judge, dissenting:\n\n 2       Marcos Poventud’s 1998 New York State conviction for\n\n 3   holding up a livery-car driver was vacated by the courts of\n\n 4   New York on a Brady violation, and he was released from\n\n 5   custody in 2005 after pleading guilty--on lesser charges--to\n\n 6   the same hold-up at the same place and time, on the same\n\n 7   date.    He has sued prosecutors and police, under 42 U.S.C.\n\n 8   § 1983, for achieving his conviction for a crime that he\n\n 9   committed--as he has conceded under oath and in open court.\n\n10   The United States District Court for the Southern District\n\n11   of New York (Batts, J.) dismissed the complaint on the\n\n12   ground that, under Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S. 477 (1994), he\n\n13   cannot sue under § 1983 unless the conviction has been\n\n14   overturned.    I would affirm.     The only errors in this case\n\n15   have been introduced on appeal.\n\n16       The majority holds that Heck is no bar to a civil suit\n\n17   once the sentence has been served, regardless of whether the\n\n18   conviction was overturned.       The majority relies on a\n\n19   concurrence in Heck and dicta in other Supreme Court cases,\n\n20   and on Second Circuit case law that has accrued along these\n\n21   lines.\n\n22       I respectfully dissent.       My objection goes deep, to the\n\n23   root of the error in Second Circuit cases that prefer dicta\n\f 1   in Heck to its holding--a holding that confirmed\n\n 2   longstanding Second Circuit law.   As the majority opinion\n\n 3   states, concurrences in Heck and Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S.\n\n 4   1 (1998) posited the idea that Heck might not bar a civil\n\n 5   claim for damages notwithstanding that the claim necessarily\n\n 6   called into question an undisturbed criminal conviction, if\n\n 7   habeas is unavailable to challenge the conviction under the\n\n 8   federal Constitution.   Spencer precipitated a Circuit split,\n\n 9   with some Circuits recognizing a few narrow exceptions to\n\n10   Heck, and others countenancing no exception at all.     The\n\n11   majority opinion follows and extends a line of cases in this\n\n12   Circuit that cannot be located on either side of that\n\n13   Circuit split.   The majority opinion holds that Heck is a\n\n14   bar to suit under § 1983 only until the convict is released\n\n15   from custody (because habeas is no longer available to a\n\n16   person at liberty); and this stretch is widened to discount\n\n17   a post-vacatur plea of guilt to lesser charges on the same\n\n18   crime.\n\n19       The majority opinion thus places at risk of\n\n20   constitutional litigation--for decades--prosecutors and\n\n21   police who obtained convictions of persons who indisputably\n\n22   or even admittedly committed the crimes charged.\n\n23       I would affirm the district court’s judgment.     The\n\n24   unconstitutional conduct for which Poventud seeks damages is\n\n                                   2\n\f 1   the failure to disclose the identification of another person\n\n 2   as having committed the crime.      The premise of that claim--\n\n 3   that Poventud was denied the opportunity to effectively\n\n 4   challenge his identification as the perpetrator--necessarily\n\n 5   implies the invalidity of the unchallenged, subsisting\n\n 6   conviction that was entered on Poventud’s plea of guilty to\n\n 7   that crime.     Heck therefore bars Poventud from asserting his\n\n 8   § 1983 claim.\n\n 9                                   I\n\n10       In 1998, a jury convicted Poventud of attempted murder\n\n11   in the second degree, attempted robbery in the first degree,\n\n12   and criminal possession of a weapon in the first degree, in\n\n13   connection with the armed robbery and shooting of Younis\n\n14   Duopo as he was driving a livery cab.     The time and place\n\n15   were: approximately 8:40 p.m. on March 6, 1997, between\n\n16   Oliver Place and Marion Avenue in the Bronx.     The conviction\n\n17   and the 10-to-20 year sentence were affirmed on appeal.      See\n\n18   People v. Poventud, 300 A.D.2d 223, 224 (1st Dep’t 2002).\n\n19       In 2005, the New York Supreme Court, Bronx County,\n\n20   vacated the conviction and ordered a re-trial on the ground\n\n21   that the prosecution had withheld potentially exculpatory\n\n22   evidence.     This ruling was highly solicitous of Poventud’s\n\n23   rights; in fact, the evidence withheld might as easily be\n\n24   viewed as inculpatory.\n                                     3\n\f 1         After the hold-up, photo ID of Poventud’s brother\n\n 2   Francisco was found in a wallet in Duopo’s vehicle.   When\n\n 3   shown the photograph of Francisco, Duopo opined that it\n\n 4   “looks like” the perpetrator, or “looks a lot like him.”      A\n\n 5   98.   (The majority calls this a positive identification.1\n\n 6   See Maj. Op. at 3.)   After it was ascertained that Francisco\n\n 7   was and had been in prison, Duopo positively identified\n\n 8   Marcos Poventud, as he later did in a line-up and for a\n\n 9   third time in the courtroom.   A 98, 114.   The state court\n\n10   ordered a re-trial on the ground that Brady was violated by\n\n11   the State’s failure to disclose Duopo’s observation that\n\n12   Francisco’s photo resembled the perpetrator.   See People v.\n\n13   Poventud, 802 N.Y.S.2d 605, 608 (Brx. Cnty. 2005).\n\n14         Poventud claims that he looks nothing like his own\n\n15   brother (which would certainly make Duopo’s observation\n\n16   uncanny), and that it is just one of those coincidences that\n\n17   his jailed brother’s photo ID was left at the scene of the\n\n18   crime.\n\n19         Poventud had the opportunity to test those explanations\n\n20   before a jury on retrial.   Instead, Poventud pled guilty to\n\n21   attempted robbery in the third degree.   At his hearing, he\n\n22   admitted to holding up Duopo as he was driving a livery cab\n\n\n           1\n           The Bronx District Attorney’s Office considered this\n     statement a “tentative identification,” A 59, that tended to\n     inculpate Poventud, A 75.\n                                    4\n\f 1   at: approximately 8:40 p.m. on March 6, 1997, between Oliver\n\n 2   Place and Marion Avenue in the Bronx.       The plea colloquy\n\n 3   thus resolved the issue: Duopo’s identification of Poventud\n\n 4   was sound.   A 93.   Poventud was re-sentenced to one year in\n\n 5   prison and, because he had already served nine years, was\n\n 6   released.\n\n 7       Upon release from prison, Poventud filed a motion\n\n 8   challenging the voluntariness of his plea, but later\n\n 9   withdrew the motion.   He then filed this damages action\n\n10   under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that the prosecution’s Brady\n\n11   violation deprived him of a fair trial.       See Brady v.\n\n12   Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963).        Judge Batts ruled that\n\n13   Poventud’s claims were barred by Heck v. Humphrey, 512 U.S.\n\n14   477 (1994), and dismissed the case.       See Poventud v. City of\n\n15   N.Y., No. 07 Civ. 3998 (DAB), 2012 WL 727802, at *3\n\n16   (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 6, 2012).\n\n17\n\n18                                   II\n\n19       Even before Heck, our Circuit (like many others) barred\n\n20   § 1983 claims that necessarily implied the invalidity of\n\n21   outstanding convictions--and did so regardless of whether\n\n22   the plaintiff remained in jail.       The seminal case was\n\n23   Cameron v. Fogarty, 806 F.2d 380 (2d Cir. 1986), which\n\n24   explained why a plaintiff’s outstanding conviction (for\n\n\n                                     5\n\f 1   possession of stolen property) barred his damages action for\n\n 2   false arrest under § 1983: “the common-law rule, equally\n\n 3   applicable to actions asserting false arrest, false\n\n 4   imprisonment, or malicious prosecution, was and is that the\n\n 5   plaintiff can under no circumstances recover if he was\n\n 6   convicted of the offense for which he was arrested.”      Id. at\n\n 7   388 (emphasis added).    Cameron extended that principle to\n\n 8   § 1983 actions, observing: “The right to bring suit under §\n\n 9   1983 is designed both to allow an injured person to obtain\n\n10   compensation for the loss of his civil rights and to deter\n\n11   public officials from further violation of such rights.”\n\n12   806 F.2d at 388.    Yet, neither interest “is more than\n\n13   minimally implicated where the [claimant] was convicted.”\n\n14   Id.; see also Singleton v. City of N.Y., 632 F.2d 185, 195\n\n15   (2d Cir. 1980) (dismissing malicious prosecution claim\n\n16   brought under § 1983 on the same grounds).\n\n17          The rule was given broad application.   In Roesch v.\n\n18   Otarola, 980 F.2d 850 (2d Cir. 1992), we explained that a\n\n19   § 1983 plaintiff who seeks to challenge his conviction “must\n\n20   pursue the criminal case to an acquittal or an unqualified\n\n21   dismissal, or else waive his Section 1983 claim.”      Id. at\n\n22   853.    We later held that this bar applied to Brady\n\n23   violations, Amaker v. Weiner, 179 F.3d 48, 51 (2d Cir.\n\n24   1999), as well as related claims under §§ 1981, 1985, and\n\n\n                                     6\n\f 1   1986, id. at 51-52.2   And, as discussed infra at 29-30,\n\n 2   several courts in this Circuit have held (and we have\n\n 3   affirmed) that the bar applies even if the subsequent guilty\n\n 4   plea is to a lesser charge.   See McNeill v. People of City &\n\n 5   State, No. 06-CV-4843(NGG), 2006 WL 3050867, at *3 (E.D.N.Y.\n\n 6   Oct. 24, 2006), summarily aff’d, 242 F. App’x 777 (2d Cir.\n\n 7   2007); Papeskov v. Brown, No. 97 Civ. 5351(SS), 1998 WL\n\n 8   299892, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. June 8, 1998) (Sotomayor, J.),\n\n 9   summarily aff’d, 173 F.3d 845 (2d Cir. 1999); see also Stein\n\n10   v. Cnty. of Westchester, N.Y., 410 F. Supp. 2d 175, 179\n\n11   (S.D.N.Y. 2006).\n\n12       None of these cases turned on whether the plaintiff was\n\n13   incarcerated or at liberty when suit was filed, or suggested\n\n14   that this consideration had any weight or bearing.   In most\n\n15   of these cases, the plaintiff was not in custody.    See,\n\n16   e.g., Roesch, 980 F.2d at 850; Singleton, 632 F.2d at 195;\n\n\n\n         2\n           Heck confirmed that this bar is not limited to false\n     arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution\n     claims: the plaintiff alleged, inter alia, that prosecutors\n     “‘knowingly destroyed’ evidence ‘which was exculpatory in\n     nature and could have proved [petitioner’s] innocence[.]’”\n     512 U.S. at 479 (citation omitted); see also Channer v.\n     Mitchell, 43 F.3d 786, 787 (2d Cir. 1994) (per curiam);\n     Rosato v.

Mar. 20, 2012). The majority opinion here\n     mistakenly suggests that the bar is so limited, Maj. Op. at\n     13 n.6, but prudently concludes that there is “no need” to\n     consider this case law in any depth, id. at 13.\n                                    7\n\f 1   McNeill, 2006 WL 3050867, at *2-3; Papeskov, 1998 WL 299892,\n\n 2   at *5; Stein, 410 F. Supp. 2d at 179.\n\n 3       These decisions consistently and methodically applied\n\n 4   the rule that plaintiffs may not use § 1983 to call into\n\n 5   question an outstanding criminal conviction, a rule that\n\n 6   avoided “the prospect of harassment, waste and endless\n\n 7   litigation, contrary to principles of federalism.”\n\n 8   Singleton v. City of N.Y., 632 F.2d 185, 195 (2d Cir. 1980).\n\n 9       The majority relies on Leather v. Ten Eyck, 180 F.3d\n\n10   420 (2d Cir. 1999) (Calabresi, J.) and cases that cited or\n\n11   followed it;3 but these cases could not have undone the law\n\n12   of this Court without review in banc.4   See United States v.\n\n\n\n         3\n           Among other cases, the majority cites Jenkins v.\n     Haubert, 179 F.3d 19 (2d Cir. 1999) (Walker, J.), which was\n     decided the same day as Leather. But, as discussed infra at\n     14, Jenkins involved a challenge to a prison disciplinary\n     sanction (not the plaintiff’s conviction itself), which\n     plainly did not trigger the Heck bar. See id. at 27\n     (“[Nothing in Supreme Court precedent requires that the Heck\n     rule be applied to a challenge by a prisoner to a term of\n     disciplinary segregation[.]”).\n         4\n           The majority opinion wonders aloud why such cases\n     were not challenged in banc. See Maj. Op. at 13-14. First,\n     there is little point in mobilizing the Court in banc to\n     excise dicta. Second, this Court is notoriously reluctant\n     to sit in banc. See Ricci v. DeStefano, 530 F.3d 88, 93 (2d\n     Cir. 2008) (Jacobs, C.J., dissenting from denial of\n     rehearing in banc) (arguing that “to rely on [Circuit]\n     tradition to deny rehearing in banc starts to look very much\n     like abuse of discretion”); see id. at 89 (Calabresi, J.,\n     concurring in denial of rehearing in banc) (concluding that\n     in banc review is unnecessary even when “[d]ifficult issues”\n     are presented).\n                                   8\n\f 1   King, 276 F.3d 109, 112 (2d Cir. 2002).    In any event, our\n\n 2   Circuit law, as it was settled before Leather, was validated\n\n 3   and confirmed by the Supreme Court in Heck v. Humphrey, 512\n\n 4   U.S. 477 (1994).    While Heck was serving a fifteen-year\n\n 5   sentence for voluntary manslaughter and his direct appeal\n\n 6   was still pending, he brought a § 1983 action alleging that\n\n 7   prosecutors and police officers had destroyed exculpatory\n\n 8   evidence.   Id. at 478-79.   The Supreme Court affirmed the\n\n 9   dismissal of the claim because “civil tort actions are not\n\n10   appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of\n\n11   outstanding criminal judgments,” and because success on the\n\n12   plaintiff’s § 1983 claim “would necessarily imply the\n\n13   invalidity of his conviction or sentence[.]”    Id. at 486-87.\n\n14   To recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction\n\n15   or imprisonment, a § 1983 plaintiff “must prove that the\n\n16   conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,\n\n17   expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state\n\n18   tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called\n\n19   into question by a federal court’s issuance of a writ of\n\n20   habeas corpus[.]”   Id.\n\n21       This requirement is animated by the values of finality\n\n22   and consistency, and “a strong judicial policy against the\n\n23   creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the\n\n24   same or identical transaction.”    Id. at 484 (citation and\n\n\n                                    9\n\f 1   quotation marks omitted).     Heck, which strengthened and\n\n 2   validated our existing precedent, remains the rule until--if\n\n 3   ever--the Supreme Court alters its holding.\n\n 4\n\n 5                                  III\n\n 6       A Circuit split has opened as to whether some\n\n 7   exceptions to Heck may be permitted on the basis of self-\n\n 8   described dicta signed by five Justices (three of whom are\n\n 9   no longer on the Court).     The majority opinion patches\n\n10   together the various concurrences and passages of dicta,\n\n11   identifying the Justices (some active, some retired) who\n\n12   wrote or signed the opinions.     See Maj. Op. at 7-8\n\n13   (discussing Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 18-21 (1998)\n\n14   (Souter, J., concurring)).     In a nutshell, these Justices\n\n15   posited that “a former prisoner, no longer ‘in custody,’ may\n\n16   bring a § 1983 action establishing the unconstitutionality\n\n17   of a conviction or confinement without being bound to\n\n18   satisfy a favorable-termination requirement that it would be\n\n19   impossible as a matter of law for him to satisfy.”      Spencer,\n\n20   523 U.S. at 21 (Souter, J., concurring) (emphasis added).\n\n21   While some Circuits carve out a narrow exception to Heck’s\n\n22   holding based on the Spencer concurrences, the majority in\n\n23   our case adopts a view that would have no basis even in\n\n24   Supreme Court dicta.\n\n\n                                     10\n\f 1       Several courts of appeals have concluded (as I do) that\n\n 2   the Spencer concurrences cannot override Heck’s binding\n\n 3   precedent.    See, e.g., Entzi v. Redmann, 485 F.3d 998, 1003\n\n 4   (8th Cir. 2007); Gilles v. Davis, 427 F.3d 197, 209-10 (3d\n\n 5   Cir. 2005); Randell v. Johnson, 227 F.3d 300, 301 (5th Cir.\n\n 6   2000); Figueroa v. Rivera, 147 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n 7       These opinions heed the Supreme Court’s admonition\n\n 8   that, even if binding precedent “appears to rest on reasons\n\n 9   rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of\n\n10   Appeals should follow the case which directly controls,\n\n11   leaving to this [Supreme] Court the prerogative of\n\n12   overruling its own decisions.”      Agostini v. Felton, 521 U.S.\n\n13   203, 237 (1997) (citations and internal quotation marks\n\n14   omitted).    We adhere to that rule: “It is not within our\n\n15   purview to anticipate whether the Supreme Court may one day\n\n16   overrule its existing precedent.”     United States v.\n\n17   Santiago, 268 F.3d 151, 155 n.6 (2d Cir. 2001).\n\n18       Other Circuits have nevertheless held that Spencer‘s\n\n19   dicta does allow for unusual and compelling circumstances in\n\n20   which Heck’s holding does not absolutely foreclose a claim.\n\n21   See, e.g., Burd v. Sessler, 702 F.3d 429, 435-36 (7th Cir.\n\n22   2012); Cohen v. Longshore, 621 F.3d 1311, 1317 (10th Cir.\n\n23   2010); Wilson v. Johnson, 535 F.3d 262, 267–68 (4th Cir.\n\n24   2008); Powers v. Hamilton Cnty. Public Defender Comm’n, 501\n\n\n                                    11\n\f 1   F.3d 592, 603 (6th Cir. 2007); Guerrero v. Gates, 442 F.3d\n\n 2   697, 704 (9th Cir. 2006); Harden v. Pataki, 320 F.3d 1289,\n\n 3   1298 (11th Cir. 2003).\n\n 4       But even the courts that recognize certain narrow\n\n 5   exceptions to Heck emphatically reject the idea that the\n\n 6   rule in Heck no longer applies once a convict exits the\n\n 7   prison gates.     The Seventh Circuit, for instance, recently\n\n 8   dismissed a claim by a released convict who argued that\n\n 9   § 1983 must be made available if habeas relief is not.        See\n\n10   Burd, 702 F.3d at 435-36 (holding that “Heck applies where a\n\n11   § 1983 plaintiff could have sought collateral relief at an\n\n12   earlier time but declined the opportunity and waited until\n\n13   collateral relief became unavailable before suing”).\n\n14   Likewise the Ninth Circuit: “The fact that [a criminal\n\n15   defendant] is no longer in custody and thus cannot overturn\n\n16   his prior convictions by means of habeas corpus does not\n\n17   lift Heck’s bar.”     Guerrero, 442 F.3d at 704.5   And the\n\n18   Sixth Circuit: “It seems unlikely that Justice Souter\n\n19   intended to carve out a broad Heck exception for all former\n\n20   prisoners.”     Powers, 501 F.3d at 603.\n\n\n         5\n            The Ninth Circuit qualified its endorsement of the\n     Spencer dicta further: the exception posited by Justice\n     Souter “‘affects only former prisoners challenging loss of\n     good-time credits, revocation of parole or similar matters,’\n     not challenges to an underlying conviction such as those\n     Guerrero brought.” Guerrero, 442 F.3d at 705 (quoting\n     Nonnette v. Small, 316 F.3d 872, 878 n.7 (9th Cir. 2002)).\n                                     12\n\f 1       Our Court has gone its own way, without adhering to\n\n 2   either side of this broad Circuit split.    This Circuit first\n\n 3   invoked the Spencer dicta in Leather v. Ten Eyck, 180 F.3d\n\n 4   420 (2d Cir. 1999) (Calabresi, J.), to allow an individual\n\n 5   fined for drunk driving to seek damages in federal court\n\n 6   even though he chose to forgo an appeal in state court.      A\n\n 7   year later, the Spencer dicta was adopted as a holding, in a\n\n 8   broadened and generalized form, in Green v. Montgomery, 219\n\n 9   F.3d 52 (2d Cir. 2000) (Calabresi, J.): “Heck acts only to\n\n10   bar § 1983 suits when the plaintiff has a habeas corpus\n\n11   remedy available to him (i.e., when he is in state\n\n12   custody).”   Id. at 60 n.3.   The majority’s present opinion\n\n13   builds on this error.\n\n14       The final segment of the majority opinion cites several\n\n15   Second Circuit opinions to argue for a spurious consensus.\n\n16   Two of those cases allowed § 1983 claims to proceed when the\n\n17   plaintiff challenged conditions of confinement rather than\n\n18   the fact or duration of confinement.   See Jenkins v.\n\n19   Haubert, 179 F.3d 19, 25 (2d Cir. 1999) (Walker, J.); Sims\n\n20   v. Artuz, 230 F.3d 14, 24 (2d Cir. 2000) (Kearse, J.).\n\n21   These uncontroversial decisions are straightforward\n\n22   applications of Supreme Court precedent.    See Preiser v.\n\n23   Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 490 (1973).    Another case cited by\n\n24   the majority, Huang ex rel. Yu v. Johnson, 251 F.3d 65 (2d\n\n\n                                    13\n\f 1   Cir. 2001) (Winter, J.), is likewise inapposite.    See id. at\n\n 2   67 (considering whether New York law required court to\n\n 3   credit a juvenile for time spent in a different institution\n\n 4   on an unrelated charge); see also Huang ex rel. Yu v.\n\n 5   Johnson, 274 F.3d 682, 682-83 (2d Cir. 2001) (per curiam)\n\n 6   (dismissing case after New York Court of Appeals held that\n\n 7   government agency properly calculated juvenile’s sentence).\n\n 8   The majority devotes considerable space to these dissimilar\n\n 9   cases, see Maj Op. at 8-9, 10-14, and counts on fingers the\n\n10   judges involved in their dispositions, see id. at 12 n.4.\n\n11   It is true that these opinions cited the Spencer dicta with\n\n12   approval, expressing support for a very narrow exception\n\n13   that the majority opinion here expands immoderately and\n\n14   adopts as a holding.   But I decline to argue over dicta\n\n15   distilled from dicta--especially when the Supreme Court, ten\n\n16   sister Circuits, and numerous cases in this Circuit counsel\n\n17   otherwise.   See supra at 5-8, 11-12.\n\n18\n\n19                                 IV\n\n20       The majority’s holding--that Heck is inapplicable\n\n21   because Poventud was no longer in custody when he filed\n\n22   suit--relies (as I have shown) on Justice Souter’s dicta in\n\n23   Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 3 (1998), which the majority\n\n24   opinion presumes to elevate as the “better” rule.   See Maj.\n\n\n                                   14\n\f 1   Op. at 7.    (The Justices are free to choose the “better”\n\n 2   rule--or a worse one, for that matter--but we are not.)      In\n\n 3   Heck, the Court made its choice perfectly clear.\n\n 4       Heck involved a challenge by a plaintiff in custody,\n\n 5   but the opinion left no doubt that its holding applied\n\n 6   regardless of whether the plaintiff was in custody or at\n\n 7   liberty:\n\n 8               We hold that, in order to recover damages for\n 9               allegedly unconstitutional conviction or\n10               imprisonment, or for other harm caused by actions\n11               whose unlawfulness would render a conviction or\n12               sentence invalid, a § 1983 plaintiff must prove\n13               that the conviction or sentence has been reversed\n14               on direct appeal, expunged by executive order,\n15               declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to\n16               make such determination, or called into question by\n17               a federal court’s issuance of a writ of habeas\n18               corpus, 28 U.S.C. § 2254. A claim for damages\n19               bearing that relationship to a conviction or\n20               sentence that has not been so invalidated is not\n21               cognizable under § 1983.\n\n22   Heck, 512 U.S. at 486-87.    The majority here presumptuously\n\n23   concludes that Heck’s holding is expressed with careless\n\n24   overbreadth, and is not intended to apply to all § 1983\n\n25   actions including those filed by released convicts.6\n\n\n         6\n           Of course, the Supreme Court is not obligated to\n     adopt the narrowest holding possible. See Citizens United\n     v. Fed. Election Comm’n, 558 U.S. 310, 130 S. Ct. 876, 919,\n     175 L. Ed. 2d 753 (2010) (Roberts, C.J., concurring) (“It\n     should go without saying . . . that we cannot embrace a\n     narrow ground of decision simply because it is narrow; it\n     must also be right.”); In re McDonald, 205 F.3d 606, 612 (3d\n     Cir. 2000) (“[A] holding . . . extends beyond a statement of\n     who won or lost a case. A court can choose among different\n     holdings that offer broader or narrower ways of resolving a\n                                     15\n\f 1       Heck’s reasoning confirms that its holding means what\n\n 2   it says.   Favorable termination is an absolute prerequisite\n\n 3   to § 1983 actions that seek damages arising from unlawful\n\n 4   incarceration: “We do not engraft an exhaustion requirement\n\n 5   upon § 1983, but rather deny the existence of a cause of\n\n 6   action.”   Id. at 489.   Since no cause of action exists under\n\n 7   § 1983 so long as the plaintiff stands convicted of the\n\n 8   crime, it cannot matter whether a plaintiff whose conviction\n\n 9   subsists is in custody or at liberty, or has (or could have)\n\n10   pursued habeas relief.\n\n11       The incompatibility between Heck’s holding and Justice\n\n12   Souter’s dicta is acknowledged by Justice Souter’s\n\n13   expression of his views in terms of disagreement.7\n\n\n     dispute.”). Lower courts therefore may not escape the reach\n     of a Supreme Court opinion by limiting it to its facts. See\n     generally Michael C. Dorf, Dicta and Article III, 142 U. Pa.\n     L. Rev. 1997, 2040 (1994) (explaining that courts should not\n     cast aside as “mere dictum” an earlier ruling, regardless of\n     “the relative merits of a broad or narrow decisional\n     principle in the initial case”); Michael Abramowicz &\n     Maxwell Stearns, Defining Dicta, 57 Stan. L. Rev. 953, 986\n     (2005) (“[B]readth does not make statements dicta.”).\n         7\n           The Justice observed that although the case arose at\n     the intersection of § 1983 and the federal habeas statute,\n     the majority nonetheless “appear[ed] to take the position\n     that the statutes were never on a collision course in the\n     first place.” Id. at 492 (Souter, J., concurring). As\n     Justice Souter explained, the Court reached this conclusion\n     “because, like the common-law tort of malicious prosecution,\n     § 1983 requires (and, presumably, has always required)\n     plaintiffs seeking damages for unconstitutional conviction\n     or confinement to show the favorable termination of the\n     underlying proceeding.” Id. Justice Souter then said why,\n                                    16\n\f 1   Reciprocally, the majority opinion in Heck rejected Justice\n\n 2   Souter’s bid to narrow its holding:\n\n 3               Justice Souter also adopts the common-law principle\n 4               that one cannot use the device of a civil tort\n 5               action to challenge the validity of an outstanding\n 6               criminal conviction, but thinks it necessary to\n 7               abandon that principle in those cases (of which no\n 8               real-life example comes to mind) involving former\n 9               state prisoners who, because they are no longer in\n10               custody, cannot bring postconviction challenges.\n11               We think the principle barring collateral attacks--\n12               a longstanding and deeply rooted feature of both\n13               the common law and our own jurisprudence--is not\n14               rendered inapplicable by the fortuity that a\n15               convicted criminal is no longer incarcerated.\n\n16   Id. at 490 n.10 (emphasis added) (internal citation\n\n17   omitted).\n\n18       The majority in our case deprecates this footnote as\n\n19   dictum, Maj. Op. at 7 (though it is unclear to me why this\n\n20   would make it less compelling to the majority, whose entire\n\n21   argument here rests on nothing else).     I disagree: the\n\n22   passage does not address some ancillary issue; it responds\n\n23   directly to Justice Souter’s criticism, emphasizing that the\n\n24   scope and rationale of the holding are broad enough to be\n\n25   unaffected by whether the plaintiff is in jail or not.      “‘A\n\n26   dictum . . . is an assertion in a court’s opinion of a\n\n27   proposition of law [that] does not explain why the court’s\n\n28   judgment goes in favor of the winner.’”    Barclays Capital\n\n29\n\n\n     in his view, this approach was flawed.    Id.\n                                     17\n\f 1   Inc. v. Theflyonthewall.com, Inc., 650 F.3d 876, 899 (2d\n\n 2   Cir. 2011) (quoting Pierre N. Leval, Judging Under the\n\n 3   Constitution: Dicta About Dicta, 81 N.Y.U. L. Rev. 1249,\n\n 4   1256 (2006)).   As illustrated above, Heck made clear that\n\n 5   the rule did not impose an exhaustion requirement and did\n\n 6   not turn on the availability of habeas relief or whether the\n\n 7   plaintiff is still in jail.    Heck, 512 U.S. at 489, 490\n\n 8   n.10.   Just as a court may state (in binding terms) what the\n\n 9   rule is, it may also state (in terms equally binding) what\n\n10   the rule is not.\n\n11       In any event, footnote ten only reinforces what Heck’s\n\n12   holding makes plain: a claim for damages that necessarily\n\n13   implies the invalidity of an outstanding conviction is not\n\n14   cognizable under § 1983.   Heck, 512 U.S. at 486-87.\n\n15                              *   *    *\n\n16       The concurrences in Heck and Spencer could not narrow\n\n17   or redefine or otherwise alter the Supreme Court’s holding.\n\n18   Unlike plurality opinions, in which “the holding of the\n\n19   Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members\n\n20   who concurred in the judgment on the narrowest grounds,”\n\n21   Marks v. United States, 430 U.S. 188, 193 (1977), a majority\n\n22   opinion dictates the precise contours of the Court’s\n\n23   holding.   See Abramowicz & Stearns, supra n.6, at 1059.\n\n24   “Critically, this is so even if a Justice concurring in the\n\n\n                                    18\n\f 1   judgment would have preferred instead to resolve the case on\n\n 2   a narrower ground[.]”   Id.   Likewise, the majority here\n\n 3   concedes, as it must, that Supreme Court dicta does not\n\n 4   outweigh Circuit precedent; only an intervening Supreme\n\n 5   Court decision will have that effect.    See Maj. Op. at 14\n\n 6   n.7 (citing Meacham v. Knolls Atomic Power Lab., 381 F.3d\n\n 7   56, 70 (2d Cir. 2004) and Consol. Edison Co. of N.Y., Inc.\n\n 8   v. UDGI Utils., Inc., 423 F.3d 90, 101 n.12 (2d Cir. 2005)).\n\n 9\n\n10                                  V\n\n11       The majority opinion runs counter to the several values\n\n12   that animate Heck (and our pre-Heck jurisprudence).\n\n13       The Supreme Court has “long expressed . . . concerns\n\n14   for finality and consistency and has generally declined to\n\n15   expand opportunities for collateral attack.”   Heck, 512 U.S.\n\n16   at 484-85.   The majority opinion posits a rule that makes\n\n17   the opportunity for inconsistent collateral attack eternal.\n\n18       A § 1983 action that necessarily impugns an outstanding\n\n19   conviction subverts the “longstanding and deeply rooted”\n\n20   principle barring collateral attacks, id. at 490 n.10,\n\n21   whether or not the challenge is issued from prison.     An\n\n22   exception for released inmates would violate “the hoary\n\n23   principle that civil tort actions are not appropriate\n\n24   vehicles for challenging the validity of outstanding\n\n\n                                    19\n\f 1   criminal judgments.”     Id. at 486.   It is an irrelevant\n\n 2   “fortuity that a convicted criminal is no longer\n\n 3   incarcerated.”     Id. at 490 n.10.\n\n 4       The majority’s approach here also undermines\n\n 5   federalism.     “Federal post-trial intervention, in a fashion\n\n 6   designed to annul the results of a state trial, . . .\n\n 7   deprives the States of a function which quite legitimately\n\n 8   is left to them[.]”     Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592,\n\n 9   609 (1975).     To allow collateral attacks on criminal\n\n10   convictions in federal court upon the convict’s release from\n\n11   state prison would “fly in the teeth of Heck,” Figueroa v.\n\n12   Rivera, 147 F.3d 77, 81 (1st Cir. 1998), and would impair\n\n13   the fundamental principles that compelled its holding.\n\n14       The majority opinion has the single virtue of assuring\n\n15   that there is absolutely no residual unavailability of\n\n16   federal remedies to any state criminal defendant.        However,\n\n17   there is no support in the Constitution or in § 1983 for the\n\n18   principle that “every person asserting a federal right is\n\n19   entitled to one unencumbered opportunity to litigate that\n\n20   right in a federal district court.”     Allen v. McCurry, 449\n\n21   U.S. 90, 103 (1980).     A § 1983 action need not “always and\n\n22   everywhere be available.”     Spencer, 523 U.S. at 17.\n\n23       Section 1983 aside, a convicted criminal is not without\n\n24   recourse.     Upon release from custody, a convict may seek\n\n\n                                     20\n\f 1   habeas relief if the State continues to impose significant\n\n 2   restraints on his liberty, such as probation or parole.      See\n\n 3   Jones v. Cunningham, 371 U.S. 236, 242 (1963).   Even absent\n\n 4   such a showing, courts are now willing to presume that a\n\n 5   criminal conviction has continuing collateral consequences\n\n 6   that could support a post-release habeas petition.     See\n\n 7   Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 8 (1998); see also Nonnette v.\n\n 8   Small, 316 F.3d 872, 878 n.7 (9th Cir. 2002) (“[T]he status\n\n 9   of prisoners challenging their underlying convictions or\n\n10   sentences does not change upon release, because they\n\n11   continue to be able to petition for a writ of habeas\n\n12   corpus.”).   The inability to bring a § 1983 action alone may\n\n13   constitute a collateral consequence sufficient to overcome a\n\n14   mootness challenge and support a convict’s post-release\n\n15   habeas petition.8   See Leonard v. Nix, 55 F.3d 370, 373 (8th\n\n\n         8\n            The majority satirizes this statement as circular\n     (because I posit the unavailability of § 1983 as a possible\n     basis for seeking habeas relief, the existence of which, in\n     the majority’s view, would render § 1983 unavailable). See\n     Maj. Op. at 15-16. But this text paragraph of my opinion\n     merely lists remedies (aside from § 1983) that remain\n     available to convicted criminals; it does not form a basis\n     for concluding that Poventud’s § 1983 claim must be\n     dismissed. Here, § 1983 is unavailable because the claim\n     would undermine an outstanding conviction--without regard to\n     whether habeas relief is also available. See Heck, 512 U.S.\n     at 503 (Souter, J., concurring) (criticizing the majority\n     for imposing a favorable-termination requirement rather than\n     “constru[ing] § 1983 in light of the habeas statute and its\n     explicit policy of exhaustion”); Channer v. Mitchell, 43\n     F.3d 786, 787-88 (2d Cir. 1994) (per curiam).\n          The majority’s error illuminates a more significant\n                                   21\n\f 1   Cir. 1995) (“Leonard’s section 1983 action gives this case\n\n 2   life, for if Leonard wins this habeas action, the state\n\n 3   becomes vulnerable to his section 1983 damages claim.\n\n 4   Leonard’s petition is therefore not moot.”); see also\n\n 5   O’Neill v. City of Phila., 32 F.3d 785, 788 n.7 (3d Cir.\n\n 6   1994); Sule v. Warden, ADX Florence Colo., 133 F.3d 933, at\n\n 7   *2 (10th Cir. Jan. 13, 1998) (unpublished).   And, of course,\n\n 8   all criminal defendants may pursue a direct appeal--whether\n\n 9   or not they remain in jail--through the state court system\n\n10   and on to the Supreme Court of the United States.   Supreme\n\n11   Court review is itself “sufficient to preserve the role of\n\n12   the federal courts as the ultimate guardians of federally\n\n13   guaranteed rights.”   Waste Mgmt. of Wis., Inc. v. Fokakis,\n\n14   614 F.2d 138, 141 (7th Cir. 1980).   Under any circumstance,\n\n15   then, the convicted criminal has post-release remedies\n\n16   available in both federal and state court.9\n\n\n     defect that pervades its entire analysis: a willingness to\n     view this case through the eyes of a concurring opinion\n     rather than the opinion of the Court.\n         9\n            Additionally, a convict may seek a writ of error\n     coram nobis from the court that rendered judgment against\n     him--here, the New York Supreme Court. See United States v.\n     Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 507 n.9 (1954); Finkelstein v.\n     Spitzer, 455 F.3d 131, 133-34 (2d Cir. 2006). If\n     successful, he may then pursue damages under § 1983.\n          To the extent that the majority relies on an implicit\n     notion that New York courts are inadequate protectors of\n     Poventud’s federal rights, I disagree for several reasons.\n     [1] It was the New York Supreme Court that overturned\n     Poventud’s original conviction on Brady grounds, a ruling\n                                   22\n\f 1       The majority opinion falls victim to the judicial\n\n 2   fallacy of viewing the ramifications of any legal principle\n\n 3   through the single prism of the plaintiff’s interests.   But\n\n 4   it should be obvious that important interests are dis-served\n\n 5   when every prosecutor and every police officer remains\n\n 6   subject to suit for acts alleged to have happened years and\n\n 7   decades in the past, after memory fades, witnesses move on,\n\n 8   and evidence is discarded.   The worse the crime for which\n\n 9   the plaintiff was convicted, the longer the sentence, and\n\n10   thus the worse the peril for public officials, who may years\n\n11   later no longer be indemnified or defended.\n\n12       The majority opinion likewise disadvantages the class\n\n13   of persons who achieve vacatur of their convictions.\n\n14   Allowing defendants to seek damages under § 1983 after\n\n15   pleading guilty would create an incentive for prosecutors to\n\n16   retry the case rather than offer a plea based on time\n\n17   served.   Cf. Olsen v. Correiro, 189 F.3d 52, 69 (1st Cir.\n\n\n     that was quite solicitous given that the evidence withheld\n     was arguably inculpatory (or, at best, a wash). [2] It\n     would be unwise “to base a rule on the assumption that state\n     judges will not be faithful to their constitutional\n     responsibilities.” Huffman v. Pursue, Ltd., 420 U.S. 592,\n     611 (1975). [3] Plaintiffs may be able to file a § 1983\n     action seeking an injunction against any individuals who are\n     impeding their efforts to appeal a conviction. See Hoard v.\n     Reddy, 175 F.3d 531, 533 (7th Cir. 1999) (dismissing § 1983\n     claim for damages under Heck because injunction was the\n     appropriate remedy where plaintiff alleged that various\n     state officials were “illegally blocking his access to state\n     postconviction remedies”).\n                                   23\n\f 1   1999) (observing that if the court were to recognize a\n\n 2   § 1983 action following a plea of nolo contendere, it would\n\n 3   make prosecutors, faced with the prospect of continuing\n\n 4   litigation and a possible damages award, much less likely to\n\n 5   offer such a deal).   It would also “undermine the finality\n\n 6   of plea bargains and jeopardize society’s interest in a\n\n 7   system of compromise resolution of criminal cases.”   Id.\n\n 8   Finality is a vital principle, not a bureaucratic means of\n\n 9   closing the judicial books.10   The majority opinion offers no\n\n10   appreciable counterweight to these rooted values and vital\n\n11   interests.\n\n12\n\n13                                   VI\n\n14       Even if we were free to prefer Spencer’s dicta to the\n\n15   holding of Heck (not to mention Second Circuit precedent),\n\n16   the narrow exception articulated by Justice Souter would not\n\n17   be applicable here.   As discussed above, the motivating\n\n18   concern in the Spencer dicta was that circumstances beyond\n\n19   the control of a criminal defendant might deprive him of the\n\n\n         10\n            See Custis v. United States, 511 U.S. 485, 497 (1994)\n     (“‘[I]nroads on the concept of finality tend to undermine\n     confidence in the integrity of our procedures’ and\n     inevitably delay and impair the orderly administration of\n     justice.”) (quoting United States v. Addonizio, 442 U.S.\n     178, 184, n.11 (1979)). Moreover, “when a guilty plea is at\n     issue, ‘the concern with finality served by the limitation\n     on collateral attack has special force.’” Id. (quoting\n     United States v. Timmreck, 441 U.S. 780, 784 (1979)).\n                                     24\n\f 1   opportunity to challenge a federal constitutional violation\n\n 2   in federal court.    Poventud is not such a person.\n\n 3       Poventud challenged his first conviction in state court\n\n 4   and won--making it unnecessary for him to seek federal\n\n 5   habeas relief.    At that point, Poventud had the option of\n\n 6   fighting at a new untainted trial or pleading guilty to the\n\n 7   same crime on reduced charges and accepting a reduced\n\n 8   sentence.    He chose to plead.    Poventud then had the option\n\n 9   of filing a motion to challenge the voluntariness of his\n\n10   plea.    He withdrew it.11   It was therefore by no means\n\n11   “impossible as a matter of law” for Poventud to challenge\n\n12   his conviction and thereby satisfy Heck’s favorable\n\n13   termination requirement, Spencer v. Kemna, 523 U.S. 1, 21\n\n14   (1998) (Souter, J., concurring); he simply decided not to.\n\n15       A guilty plea “represents a break in the chain of\n\n16   events which has preceded it in the criminal process,”\n\n\n\n         11\n             Poventud’s allegations of “gruesome and repetitive\n     physical and sexual abuse” in prison are cited by the\n     majority, presumably to imply that the government’s plea\n     offer, resulting in immediate release, was one that could\n     not be refused. Maj. Op. at 4. But it is naive to think\n     that any plea is free from powerful pressures and\n     influences, and that it is only the exceptional defendant\n     who has reason to fear prison. Moreover, this argument is a\n     red herring; Poventud withdrew his § 440 motion challenging\n     the voluntariness of his guilty plea. However tantalizing\n     the government’s offer, Poventud swore in open court that he\n     participated in the armed robbery charged in the\n     indictment–-which is of course the same crime of which he\n     was convicted originally.\n                                       25\n\f 1   Tollett v. Henderson, 411 U.S. 258, 267 (1973), and is\n\n 2   accorded “a great measure of finality,” Blackledge v.\n\n 3   Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 71 (1977).     “When a criminal defendant\n\n 4   has solemnly admitted in open court that he is in fact\n\n 5   guilty of the offense with which he is charged, he may not\n\n 6   thereafter raise independent claims relating to the\n\n 7   deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to\n\n 8   the entry of the guilty plea.”     Tollett, 411 U.S. at 267;12\n\n 9   see also United States v. Gregg, 463 F.3d 160, 164 (2d Cir.\n\n10   2006) (per curiam) (“[A] guilty plea . . . conclusively\n\n11   resolves the question of factual guilt supporting the\n\n12   conviction, thereby rendering any antecedent constitutional\n\n13   violation bearing on factual guilt a non-issue[.]”).\n\n14   Poventud’s ability to attack his conviction therefore ended\n\n15   when he pled guilty to the hold-up.     Cf. Pouncey v. Ryan,\n\n\n\n         12\n            The Tollett bar, distinct from the rule in Heck, is\n     grounded in collateral estoppel rather than the plaintiff’s\n     inability to prove a key element of his claim. See Tollett,\n     411 U.S. at 267; United States v. Podell, 572 F.2d 31, 35\n     (2d Cir. 1978) (“It is well-settled that a criminal\n     conviction, whether by jury verdict or guilty plea,\n     constitutes estoppel in favor of the United States in a\n     subsequent civil proceeding as to those matters determined\n     by the judgment in the criminal case.”). Certainly, some\n     analytical overlap exists, and in this arena too the Supreme\n     Court has rejected the notion that a federal remedy must be\n     available to criminal defendants seeking to challenge state\n     convictions. See Migra v. Warren City Sch. Dist. Bd. of\n     Educ., 465 U.S. 75, 84 (1984) (“§ 1983 did not open the way\n     to relitigation of an issue that had been determined in a\n     state criminal proceeding[.]”).\n                                  26\n\f 1   396 F.

To allow defendants, after pleading\n     guilty, to file § 1983 actions that call into question their\n     convictions would “enable them to ‘end-run Heck,’ and, at\n     bottom, would confer on them the benefit of their plea\n     bargain while shielding them from its consequences.” Lewis,\n     2013 WL 529954, at *8 (internal citation omitted).\n                                  27\n\f 1       The majority hedges on this point: “Poventud’s guilty\n\n 2   plea may (or may not) supply defendants with a defense[.]”\n\n 3   Maj.

Apr. 23, 1999) (dismissing § 1983 action brought by\n\n14   former inmate who was charged with assault and criminal\n\n15   possession of a weapon and pled guilty to harassment); see\n\n16   also Stein v. Cnty. of Westchester, N.Y., 410 F.

McNeill is especially persuasive as a close\n\n25\n\n                                     29\n\f 1   analog; and both of my colleagues in the majority on the\n\n 2   present panel sat on the panel in McNeill.\n\n 3       The majority relies on other courts’ opinions in cases\n\n 4   that bear no resemblance whatsoever to the present.     See\n\n 5   Maj. Op. at 9 n.2 (citing Smith v. Gonzales, 222 F.3d 1220\n\n 6   (10th Cir. 2000) (holding that Heck was inapplicable where\n\n 7   court vacated defendant’s conviction and government filed\n\n 8   nolle prosequi indicating that it would not prosecute\n\n 9   defendant’s case further); Davis v. Zain, 79 F.3d 18, 19\n\n10   (5th Cir. 1996) (holding that Heck was inapplicable where\n\n11   court vacated defendant’s conviction, defendant filed § 1983\n\n12   action while second trial was pending, and court found it\n\n13   “highly unlikely that Davis’s § 1983 suit will implicate the\n\n14   validity of his pending retrial”)).   The majority’s labored\n\n15   search for support is telling.15\n\n16       Some cases may present a difficult question as to\n\n17   whether the § 1983 action is fundamentally inconsistent with\n\n18   the defendant’s guilty plea.   Cf. DiBlasio v. City of N.Y.,\n\n19   102 F.3d 654, 659 (2d Cir. 1996) (Jacobs, J., concurring)\n\n20   (observing that a conviction on a lesser charge of drug\n\n21   possession might not bar the plaintiff’s malicious\n\n         15\n            The majority observes that “at the time he pled\n     guilty Poventud was aware of the Brady violation on which\n     his present lawsuit is based.” Maj. Op. at 9 n.2. This\n     statement is puzzling. Of course Poventud was aware of the\n     alleged Brady violation; his conviction had just been\n     overturned on that basis. Surely the point is that he chose\n     to plead guilty to the crime rather than face retrial.\n                                    30\n\f 1   prosecution claim for drug trafficking).16   A fact-intensive\n\n 2   inquiry may sometimes be needed, see Covington v. City of\n\n 3   New York, 171 F.3d 117, 122 (2d Cir. 1999), but Poventud’s\n\n 4   allocution is clear enough:\n\n 5            [THE COURT:]        In this case it’s charged that\n 6                           on or about March 6, 1997, at\n 7                           approximately 8:40 in the evening, in\n 8                           the area of Oliver Place and Marion\n 9                           . . .

Gregg, 463 F.3d 160, 163-65 (2d Cir.\n     2006) (per curiam) offers another helpful contrast. There,\n     we considered whether a defendant’s guilty plea to a state\n     charge of criminal impersonation barred him from raising a\n     Fourth Amendment challenge to a federal firearms charge\n     arising from the same events. Id. at 162. Because the\n     firearm seizure “simply was not at issue” when the defendant\n     pleaded guilty to criminal impersonation, his guilty plea\n     did not bar a subsequent challenge to the search. Id. at\n     166. However, “were Gregg challenging . . . the discovery\n     of the evidence supporting the criminal impersonation charge\n     to which he pled guilty, then . . . Gregg’s Fourth Amendment\n     claims would be foreclosed.” Id. (emphasis added).\n          If Poventud had pled guilty to an unrelated charge, or\n     if his § 1983 claim had alleged unrelated police misconduct,\n     then Poventud’s § 1983 action might not have undermined his\n     plea, making the case arguably more akin to Gregg and\n     DiBlasio.\n                                    31\n\f 1   of the same day, wielding a weapon, and holding up the\n\n 2   victim.   Poventud’s § 1983 action calls that conviction and\n\n 3   plea into question, challenging the victim’s identification\n\n 4   of him as one of his attackers, and asserting that Poventud\n\n 5   “spent the entire evening of March 6, 1997, through the\n\n 6   morning of March 7, 1997, at the home of his friend . . .\n\n 7   playing video games.    He was never anywhere near the\n\n 8   vicinity of Oliver Place and Marion Avenue, where the\n\n 9   shooting occurred.”    A 106.   Success on Poventud’s § 1983\n\n10   action “would necessarily imply the invalidity” of his\n\n11   outstanding conviction.     Heck, 512 U.S. at 487.     It is\n\n12   therefore barred by Heck.\n\n13                               *   *    *\n\n14       The final section of the majority opinion introduces\n\n15   the idea that Poventud’s suit calls into question only his\n\n16   first conviction, not his second.        See Maj. Op. at 14-16.\n\n17   As I have already shown, Poventud’s claim is premised on his\n\n18   innocence of a crime to which he pled guilty.        See supra at\n\n19   32-33.    Accordingly, it is foreclosed by Heck, which bars\n\n20   both an action to recover damages for unconstitutional\n\n21   conviction or confinement, as well as an action “that does\n\n22   not seek damages directly attributable to conviction or\n\n23   confinement but whose successful prosecution would\n\n24   necessarily imply that the plaintiff’s criminal conviction\n\n25   was wrongful.”   Heck, 512 U.S. at 487 n.6.       Poventud’s claim\n\n                                     32\n\f 1   does both: [i] he seeks damages directly attributable to his\n\n 2   confinement, and [ii] success on his claim would necessarily\n\n 3   imply that his conviction (by guilty plea) was wrongful.\n\n 4   Poventud cannot evade this fact by “‘[s]eeking damages only\n\n 5   for punishment he suffered in excess of the one-year\n\n 6   imprisonment he accepted as part of his plea.’”   Maj. Op. at\n\n 7   15 (quoting Appellant Br. 32).\n\n 8       Turning elsewhere, the majority posits the hypothetical\n\n 9   of a defendant who is tortured, then confesses, then\n\n10   successfully challenges his conviction, then pleads guilty\n\n11   prior to retrial (under no compulsion), and is then released\n\n12   from prison.   I have three short responses:\n\n13       •    Such a defendant would not need to rely on § 1983\n\n14            because he could pursue intentional tort claims\n\n15            against the offending officers--state or federal.\n\n16            See N.Y. Ct. Cl. Act § 8 (McKinney) (waiving\n\n17            sovereign immunity); Millbrook v. United States,\n\n18            133 S. Ct. 1441, 1446 (2013) (holding that waiver\n\n19            of sovereign immunity under Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n20            for intentional acts committed by federal law\n\n21            enforcement was not limited to investigative\n\n22            activities).\n\n23       •    I agree with the majority that “the claim for\n\n24            damages for torture [would] in no way undercut[]\n\n25            the second, and only existing, conviction and hence\n\n                                   33\n\f 1       [would] in no way [be] barred by Heck,” Maj. Op. at\n\n 2       15.   That is because a claim for torture damages\n\n 3       would not necessarily imply the invalidity of the\n\n 4       defendant’s conviction.   Cf. Jackson v. Suffolk\n\n 5       Cnty. Homicide Bureau, 135 F.3d 254, 257 (2d Cir.\n\n 6       1998) (holding that Heck did not bar Fifth\n\n 7       Amendment claim for excessive force because “a\n\n 8       finding that excessive force had in fact been used\n\n 9       would not necessarily require invalidation of the\n\n10       conviction”).   However, what the defendant\n\n11       categorically may not do is seek damages for\n\n12       “unlawful” confinement for criminal conduct that he\n\n13       freely admitted.\n\n14   •   The majority opinion thus illustrates the hazard of\n\n15       creating constitutional law under the influence of\n\n16       a seminar hypothetical.\n\n\n\n\n                              34\n\f",

Somehow the NYPD Crime Scene Unit had missed the wallet. The\n\nwallet contained a pair of old photo I.D. cards belonging to Francisco Poventud, brother\n\nof the plaintiff-appellant. When investigators showed Duopo a photo array containing\n\none of the photos of Francisco Poventud (who allegedly looks nothing like his brother),\n\nDuopo positively identified it as a picture of his assailant.     At the time, however,\n\nFrancisco Poventud was incarcerated and could not possibly have committed the crime.\n\nDetectives then showed Duopo photo arrays containing a picture of Marcos Poventud.\n\nOnly upon seeing Marcos’s photo for the fourth time did Duopo identify Marcos as the\n\nshooter. Marcos was arrested, identified (by Duopo) at a line-up, and indicted, along\n\nwith a co-defendant, Robert Maldonado, whom Duopo also identified. Investigators left\n\nno record of the false identification of Francisco Poventud; they also did not disclose it\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\fto defense counsel or to the Bronx County prosecutors; and they did not preserve the\n\nphoto array.\n\n      Marcos Poventud learned all of this only during the 2003 retrial of Robert\n\nMaldonado. In December 2004, Poventud filed a motion under N.Y. C.P.L.R. § 440.10\n\nto vacate his conviction on the ground that the prosecution withheld exculpatory\n\nevidence. The New York Supreme Court for Bronx County granted this motion in\n\nOctober 2005.    The prosecution filed a notice of appeal; successfully argued that\n\nPoventud be denied bail; and offered him immediate release in exchange for a guilty\n\nplea to a non-violent, Class E felony charge of third-degree attempted robbery. By this\n\ntime, Poventud had been incarcerated for nearly nine years. Poventud testifies that\n\nduring his imprisonment he endured gruesome and repetitive physical and sexual\n\nabuse; that he attempted suicide; and that he suffered from depression and post-\n\ntraumatic stress disorder. In January 2006, Poventud accepted the terms of the plea\n\nbargain and went home.\n\n      Poventud now contends that he was deceived into pleading guilty. He alleges that\n\nthe assistant district attorney knew, but did not disclose, that the district attorney’s\n\noffice had decided not to perfect its appeal. Poventud alleges further that the ADA\n\nwithheld crucial information from the defense. When he learned of these omissions,\n\nPoventud stayed the instant federal suit and moved in state court to have his guilty plea\n\nvacated as involuntarily given. The New York Supreme Court for Bronx County granted\n\nan evidentiary hearing on the question of voluntariness, but Poventud withdrew his\n\nmotion without prejudice. He says he did this after learning that he had multiple\n\nmyeloma, after nearly dying from kidney failure, and after undergoing bone and stem\n\ncell transplants and chemotherapy. Poventud asserts that he thought the stress and\n\n\n                                           4\n\finfection risks of a new trial, together with the possibility, however remote, of returning\n\nto jail, would kill him. After withdrawing his state motion, Poventud resumed this\n\nfederal action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, in which he alleges violations of his federal due\n\nprocess and fair trial rights under Brady v. Maryland, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963). He also sues\n\nthe City of New York for failing properly to train its officers.\n\n       The district court found that, because plaintiff’s guilty plea was to conduct that\n\n“necessarily required his presence at the scene of the crime,” success on a § 1983 claim\n\narising out of the suppression of evidence relevant to his alleged misidentification would\n\n“logically imply the invalidity” of his guilty plea. Poventud, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">727802</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *3. This\n\nbeing so, the court continued, Poventud could survive summary judgment under Heck\n\nonly by showing “that the challenged conviction has been reversed, expunged,\n\ninvalidated, or called into question.” Id. Poventud could do none of this, the court\n\nconcluded, either as to his first conviction or to his guilty plea. Moreover, Poventud’s\n\n“decision not to pursue in the state court an available remedy by which he could\n\ninvalidate his [guilty plea] does not relieve him of his obligation to demonstrate its\n\ninvalidity if he is to avoid the bar established in Heck.” Id. at *4. The district court\n\ngranted defendants’ motion for summary judgment, and this appeal followed.\n\n\n\n                                          DISCUSSION\n\n       We review grants of summary judgment de novo.

Under the law of\n\nthis Circuit, a plaintiff asserting the unconstitutionality of his conviction or\n\nincarceration must have access to a federal remedy. Normally that remedy is through a\n\n\n                                              5\n\f§ 1983 action. If, however, the plaintiff is in custody, Heck may apply and require that\n\nthe plaintiff assert his claim first in a habeas petition. As Poventud is no longer in\n\ncustody, Heck does not bar his claims under § 1983. The district court erred, then, in\n\ngranting summary judgment against him on the basis of Heck. The law of this Circuit in\n\nthis matter derives from the interplay of two Supreme Court decisions: Heck v.\n\nHumphrey itself, and the subsequent Spencer v. Kemna, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118176\"><a href=\"/opinion/118176/spencer-v-kemna/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1998).\n\n\n\nHeck and Spencer\n\n      The petitioner in Heck was a state prisoner who sought relief under § 1983.\n\nEarlier, Heck had twice sought and failed to secure relief under the federal habeas\n\nstatute. In upholding the dismissal of Heck’s § 1983 claims, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat when the success of a § 1983 claim would “necessarily require the plaintiff to prove\n\nthe unlawfulness of his conviction or confinement,” the complaint must be dismissed\n\nunless the plaintiff can “prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed on\n\ndirect appeal, expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state tribunal\n\nauthorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court’s\n\nissuance of a writ of habeas corpus.” Heck, 512 U.S. at 486-87. In other words, the\n\nCourt continued,\n\n\n\n      when a state prisoner seeks damages in a § 1983 suit, the district court\n\n      must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would\n\n      necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would,\n\n      the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that\n\n      the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated.\n\n\n                                           6\n\fId. at 487. This statement tracked the fact pattern in Heck, which involved “a state\n\nprisoner”—that is, someone still in custody. In a footnote, and in dicta, the Court\n\nsuggested, however, that the rule should similarly apply to plaintiffs no longer in\n\ncustody: “We think the principle barring collateral attacks . . . is not rendered\n\ninapplicable by the fortuity that a convicted criminal is no longer incarcerated.” Id. at\n\n490 n.10.\n\n      In a concurrence, Justice Souter, joined by three colleagues, expressed\n\nreservations about denying relief to plaintiffs seeking damages under § 1983 for\n\nunconstitutional convictions or imprisonment who, because they were no longer\n\nimprisoned, could have no relief under habeas. Extending Heck’s favorable termination\n\nrequirement to plaintiffs not in custody, Justice Souter wrote, would “deny any federal\n\nforum for claiming a deprivation of federal rights to those who cannot first obtain a\n\nfavorable state ruling.” Id. at 500 (Souter, J., concurring). A better way to read the\n\nmajority’s opinion is “as saying nothing more than that now, after enactment of the\n\nhabeas statute and because of it, prison inmates seeking § 1983 damages . . . must\n\nsatisfy a . . . favorable-termination requirement.” Id. (emphasis added).\n\n      Four years after Heck, Justice Souter repeated these views in another\n\nconcurrence. Spencer, 523 U.S. at 18-21 (Souter, J., concurring). This time he was\n\njoined by four Justices. Three joined Justice Souter’s concurrence, which stated (again\n\nin dicta, as the case ultimately turned on other grounds) “that a former prisoner, no\n\nlonger ‘in custody,’ may bring a § 1983 action establishing the unconstitutionality of a\n\nconviction or confinement without being bound to satisfy a favorable-termination\n\n\n\n\n                                            7\n\frequirement that it would be impossible as a matter of law for him to satisfy.” Id. at 21.1\n\nAnd Justice Stevens, in dissent, went out of his way to adhere to Justice Souter’s\n\nposition. Id. at 25 n.8 (Stevens, J., dissenting).\n\n\n\nThe Law of the Circuit\n\n              Our Court has adopted Justice Souter’s dicta in Spencer. In Jenkins v. Haubert,\n\nwe reversed the dismissal of a former inmate’s § 1983 challenge to the validity of two\n\nprison disciplinary hearings. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764670\"><a href=\"/opinion/764670/eric-jenkins-v-lt-haubert/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1999). We held that “a § 1983 suit by a\n\nprisoner . . . challenging the validity of a disciplinary or administrative sanction that\n\ndoes not affect the overall length of a prisoner’s confinement is not barred by Heck.” Id.\n\nat 27. To hold otherwise, we noted, “would contravene the pronouncement of five\n\njustices that some federal remedy—either habeas corpus or § 1983—must be available.”\n\nId. (emphasis added). In Leather v. Eyck, decided the same day as Jenkins, we held\n\nthat Heck did not bar the § 1983 suit of an arrestee who was convicted (but fined rather\n\nthan imprisoned) for driving while impaired. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764822\"><a href=\"/opinion/764822/john-leather-v-michael-ten-eyck-individually-thomas-lindert/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. 1999). “Because\n\nLeather is not and never was in the custody of the State,” we explained, “he, like Jenkins,\n\nhas no remedy in habeas corpus.

Because it does not appear that Green is\n\npresently in state custody, his § 1983 action is not barred by Heck.” (internal citations\n\nomitted)).\n\n              The facts in this case differ somewhat from the facts in the cases just cited, but\n\nnot in a way that is material to the issue before us. After Poventud’s original conviction\n\nwas vacated, but before that vacatur was affirmed on appeal, Poventud pled guilty to a\n\nlesser, related offense.2 This fact, however, does not alter the underlying principle that a\n\n                                                            \n2   Although we think it unnecessary to reach the issue in light of our conclusion that Heck’s bar does not\napply to a § 1983 plaintiff who is not in custody, even if Heck did apply, we are doubtful that success on\nPoventud’s § 1983 suit would “necessarily imply the invalidity,” Heck, 512 U.S. at 487, of his subsequent\nguilty plea. The alleged Brady violation resulted in a conviction that was later vacated. Because that\nconviction was vacated—regardless of whether Poventud then pled guilty or was retried—victory in his\n§ 1983 suit would no longer implicate the validity of an outstanding criminal judgment. See Smith v.\nGonzalez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"159959\"><a href=\"/opinion/159959/smith-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">222</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1222 (10th Cir. 2000); Davis v.

Moreover, Poventud’s § 1983 suit cannot call into question the validity of his guilty plea,\ninasmuch as it is undisputed that at the time he pled guilty Poventud was aware of the Brady violation on\nwhich his present lawsuit is based. See Smith, 222 F.3d at 1222 (where conviction was vacated and case\nremanded due to Brady violation, success on plaintiff’s § 1983 suit had no relevance to a later criminal\ntrial, since the prosecution could not withhold the same exculpatory evidence at a subsequent trial).\n\n\n\n                                                               9\n\fclaimant who cannot seek relief under habeas must be able to seek it under § 1983.\n\nPoventud’s guilty plea may (or may not) supply defendants with a defense that no § 1983\n\nviolation occurred. But it does not entitle them to summary judgment under Heck.\n\n              To repeat, the law of this Circuit makes clear that a plaintiff alleging civil rights\n\nviolations in connection with his conviction or imprisonment must have access to a\n\nfederal remedy either under habeas or under § 1983. Because Poventud is not in\n\ncustody, he has no remedy under habeas. He must be able, therefore, to pursue relief\n\nunder § 1983.\n\n\n\n                                                               CODA\n\n              We would end here, but for the apocalyptic tone of the dissent, which requires a\n\nbrief answer. Among its many flaws are the following.\n\n              First. Contrary to the dissent’s assertion, the majority does not rely principally\n\non Leather. It relies at least as much on Jenkins. It does so because Jenkins, an opinion\n\nwritten by Judge Walker and concurred in by Judge Miner and Judge Sack,3 most\n\nclearly embraced, and most thoroughly recited the history behind, the proposition that\n\nwe reaffirm today: “that some federal remedy—either habeas corpus or § 1983—must be\n\navailable.” 179 F.3d at 27. To be sure, the panel in Jenkins also had other grounds for its\n\ndecision. Id. (“We do not rest our holding solely on our tally of votes on the [Supreme]\n\nCourt for Justice Souter’s view of Heck.”). And it is true, as the dissent points out, that\n\nJenkins dealt with prison discipline rather than a conviction. But that, for purposes of\n\nthe case before us, is a distinction without a difference. The court in Jenkins did not\n\n                                                            \n3   We mention the names of individual judges only because the dissent goes out of its way to do so.\n\n\n\n                                                                10\n\flimit its endorsement of Justice Souter’s position to the facts before it. It stated that\n\nendorsement as a general proposition and, having done so, made it one basis for its\n\nholding.\n\n       It is significant, moreover, that Jenkins and Leather (which dealt with an actual\n\ncriminal conviction, and not only with conditions of confinement) came down the same\n\nday. As is well known, the normal practice, when two panels are dealing with closely\n\nrelated issues at the same time, is for the panels to communicate with each other to\n\nensure, if at all possible, that the opinions are consistent. One can therefore assume\n\nthat, together, Jenkins and Leather reflected the law of the Circuit at the time, and that\n\nthe law was, as Jenkins stated it, “that some federal remedy—either habeas corpus or §\n\n1983—must be available.” 179 F.3d at 27. Significantly, within a year, this view was\n\naffirmed again in Green v. Montgomery, which stated that “Heck acts only to bar §\n\n1983 suits when the plaintiff has a habeas corpus remedy available to him (i.e., when he\n\nis in state custody).” 219 F.3d at 60 n.3 (Kearse, J.; Calabresi, J.; Katzmann, J.). Less\n\nthan a year after Green, this position was stated yet again in Huang v. Johnson. 251\n\nF.3d at 75 (“In light of our holding in Leather, and in light of both the\n\nSpencer majority’s dictum and the fact that the Spencer concurrences and dissent\n\n‘revealed that five justices hold the view that, where federal habeas corpus is not\n\navailable to address constitutional wrongs, § 1983 must be,’ Jenkins, 179 F.3d at 26, we\n\nconclude that Huang’s Section 1983 claim must be allowed to proceed.”) (Feinberg, J.;\n\nWinter, J.; Cabranes, J.).\n\n\n\n\n                                            11\n\f              Within a period of two years, then, four unanimous panels of the Second Circuit,\n\nincluding a majority of active judges sitting throughout that time,4 affirmed the position\n\nof the Circuit that Heck’s bar on § 1983 relief applies only when federal relief can be\n\nsought under habeas. These panels so ruled because, as the Jenkins Court noted, to do\n\notherwise “would contravene the pronouncement of five justices that some federal\n\nremedy—either habeas corpus or § 1983—must be available.” 179 F.3d at 27. And this is\n\nthe principle the majority follows today. Indeed, this position is so clearly the current\n\nlaw of the Circuit that the majority considered this case a candidate for disposition by\n\nsummary order on this ground only, rather than on the alternate ground discussed\n\nbelow.\n\n              Second. The dissent suggests, nonetheless, that Jenkins, Leather, Green, and\n\nHuang—and the judges who participated in those three decisions—flew in the face of a\n\nSupreme Court holding that remained the law despite subsequent Supreme Court dicta\n\nto the contrary. If that were true, these opinions would have been wrong,5 and one\n\nwould have expected that fact to have been raised at the time. The Supreme Court in\n\nHeck decided a case in which habeas was available. In dicta, in a footnote, which was\n                                                            \n4   That is, seven active judges (Judges Kearse, Walker, Calabresi, Cabranes, Straub, Sack, and Katzmann)\nout of thirteen. Judge Winter, who served as Chief Judge when Jenkins, Leather, and Green were\ndecided, had assumed senior status before writing the panel opinion in Huang.\n\n5   This was not always necessarily so, see W.

Heck,\n\n512 U.S. at 490 n.10. It was to distance himself from this dicta that Justice Souter wrote\n\nhis concurrence. And, when one of the Justices who had joined the Heck footnote\n\nchanged her mind, see Spencer, 523 U.S. at 21 (Ginsburg, J., concurring), it became\n\nclear that the Heck dicta no longer commanded the support of a majority of Supreme\n\nCourt Justices.\n\n              In such circumstances—i.e., where there is no Supreme Court holding in one\n\ndirection, and there are powerful statements by a majority of the Justices in an opposite\n\ndirection—it is perfectly appropriate (though not required) for a lower court to embrace\n\nthe position adopted (albeit in dicta) by that majority. This is precisely what the panels\n\nin Jenkins, Leather, Green, and Huang did.\n\n              Third. The dissent claims that in doing this, the Jenkins, Leather, Green, and\n\nHuang Courts improperly altered the law of the Circuit without going in banc. There is\n\nno need, however, to discuss today what the Circuit law was before the Supreme Court\n\ndecided Heck and Spencer.

Of course these cases didn’t turn\non whether the plaintiff was in or out of custody. They turned on the fact that favorable termination is an\nelement of malicious prosecution. These decisions did not anticipate Heck; they simply applied an old\ncommon law rule from which the Heck majority drew a controversial analogy. Whatever the vices of the\nJenkins-Leather-Green-Huang line of cases, we do not think that even so hardened a foe as the dissenter\ncan accuse them of straying from the notion that a claim must be dismissed if one of its elements—i.e.,\nfavorable termination in malicious prosecution suits—is missing. The dissent also cites two cases—\n\n\n                                                               13\n\fCourt may depart from a prior decision when that earlier decision’s “rationale is\n\noverruled, implicitly or expressly, by the Supreme Court.” In re Sokolowski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767876\"><a href=\"/opinion/767876/in-re-sokolowski-debtor-bankboston-na-appellant-cross-appellee-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535 (2d Cir. 2000) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted). As far as we\n\ncan determine, our Court has not clearly decided whether such undermining must\n\nhappen in a holding by the Supreme Court, or whether clear dicta also suffices.7 In any\n\nevent, had anyone cared to disagree with Jenkins or Leather or Green or Huang on the\n\nground that they deviated from prior holdings, the time to say so was when those four\n\ncases were decided.                              Accordingly, one would have expected a request for in banc\n\nreconsideration at that time. There was no such request, which comes as no surprise\n\ngiven the unanimity of support in those cases for the position we reaffirm today. The\n\ndissenter obviously disagrees, as is his right, with the position our Court then took. But,\n\ngiven those holdings, we would think it preferable for the dissent to state that\n\ndisagreement by concurring in today’s result and expressing distaste for the settled law\n\nthat requires such a concurrence.\n\n              Fourth. Quite apart from whether the absence of habeas, by itself, means that a\n\n§ 1983 action may lie, the dissent is incorrect in its statement that this § 1983 action\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \n                                                                                                                                                                                               \nAmaker v.

It does nothing of the sort. It asserts\n\nthat his constitutional rights were violated by the state through a Brady violation.\n\nUnder Heck, this could not have been brought up prior to the quashing of his first\n\nconviction because a finding of a Brady violation would undercut that conviction. But\n\nonce that conviction was quashed, the Brady violation—if one were established, and if it\n\ninjured Poventud—would constitute an independent infringement of Poventud’s\n\nconstitutional rights, regardless of his subsequent conviction.\n\n       To give a dramatic example: suppose a defendant is tortured viciously, confesses,\n\nand is convicted on the basis of that confession. Under Heck, he cannot, while in jail on\n\nthat conviction, bring a § 1983 action for being tortured because that would undercut\n\nthe conviction. But once his conviction is quashed (through habeas or in other ways), he\n\nis free to assert that he was tortured and seek a § 1983 remedy. Does the dissent really\n\nbelieve that this becomes less true if that defendant later freely confesses, even to the\n\nsame crime? At that point, the claim for damages for torture in no way undercuts the\n\nsecond, and only existing, conviction and hence is in no way barred by Heck.\n\n       At core, this is what Poventud claims today. He seeks damages for the harm\n\ncaused by a Brady violation in connection with his first (invalidated) conviction; he\n\nmakes no claims at all with respect to his second (outstanding) conviction.          See\n\nAppellant’s Br. 32 (“Seeking damages only for punishment he suffered in excess of the\n\none-year imprisonment he accepted as part of his plea, the lawsuit, if successful, would\n\nnot be inconsistent with that plea.”).     As noted earlier, whether there was such a\n\nviolation, and whether there were such damages, will be determined in a § 1983 trial.\n\nBut whatever the result of that trial, Poventud’s subsequent guilty plea is not\n\nundermined by his § 1983 action.\n\n\n                                            15\n\f       Finally, the dissent makes the extraordinary argument that habeas might be\n\navailable to Poventud because his “inability to bring a § 1983 action alone may\n\nconstitute a collateral consequence sufficient to overcome a mootness challenge and\n\nsupport a . . . post-release habeas petition.” This argument, which has not been made by\n\nanyone in this case, is circular. It posits a result—the unavailability of § 1983 relief—and\n\non the basis of that result creates the premise for that result. It is, in short, absolutely\n\nPtolemaic in the uselessness of its epicycles.\n\n\n\n                                     CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the district court’s judgment and\n\nREMAND the case to the district court for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\f 1   DENNIS JACOBS, Chief Judge, dissenting:\n\n 2       Marcos Poventud’s 1998 New York State conviction for\n\n 3   holding up a livery-car driver was vacated by the courts of\n\n 4   New York on a Brady violation, and he was released from\n\n 5   custody in 2005 after pleading guilty--on lesser charges--to\n\n 6   the same hold-up at the same place and time, on the same\n\n 7   date.    He has sued prosecutors and police, under 42 U.S.C.\n\n 8   § 1983, for achieving his conviction for a crime that he\n\n 9   committed--as he has conceded under oath and in open court.\n\n10   The United States District Court for the Southern District\n\n11   of New York (Batts, J.) dismissed the complaint on the\n\n12   ground that, under Heck v. Humphrey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117864\"><a href=\"/opinion/117864/heck-v-humphrey/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994), he\n\n13   cannot sue under § 1983 unless the conviction has been\n\n14   overturned.    I would affirm.     The only errors in this case\n\n15   have been introduced on appeal.\n\n16       The majority holds that Heck is no bar to a civil suit\n\n17   once the sentence has been served, regardless of whether the\n\n18   conviction was overturned.       The majority relies on a\n\n19   concurrence in Heck and dicta in other Supreme Court cases,\n\n20   and on Second Circuit case law that has accrued along these\n\n21   lines.\n\n22       I respectfully dissent.       My objection goes deep, to the\n\n23   root of the error in Second Circuit cases that prefer dicta\n\f 1   in Heck to its holding--a holding that confirmed\n\n 2   longstanding Second Circuit law.   As the majority opinion\n\n 3   states, concurrences in Heck and Spencer v. Kemna, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n <span class=\"page\">4</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   1 (1998) posited the idea that Heck might not bar a civil\n\n 5   claim for damages notwithstanding that the claim necessarily\n\n 6   called into question an undisturbed criminal conviction, if\n\n 7   habeas is unavailable to challenge the conviction under the\n\n 8   federal Constitution.   Spencer precipitated a Circuit split,\n\n 9   with some Circuits recognizing a few narrow exceptions to\n\n10   Heck, and others countenancing no exception at all.     The\n\n11   majority opinion follows and extends a line of cases in this\n\n12   Circuit that cannot be located on either side of that\n\n13   Circuit split.   The majority opinion holds that Heck is a\n\n14   bar to suit under § 1983 only until the convict is released\n\n15   from custody (because habeas is no longer available to a\n\n16   person at liberty); and this stretch is widened to discount\n\n17   a post-vacatur plea of guilt to lesser charges on the same\n\n18   crime.\n\n19       The majority opinion thus places at risk of\n\n20   constitutional litigation--for decades--prosecutors and\n\n21   police who obtained convictions of persons who indisputably\n\n22   or even admittedly committed the crimes charged.\n\n23       I would affirm the district court’s judgment.     The\n\n24   unconstitutional conduct for which Poventud seeks damages is\n\n                                   2\n\f 1   the failure to disclose the identification of another person\n\n 2   as having committed the crime.      The premise of that claim--\n\n 3   that Poventud was denied the opportunity to effectively\n\n 4   challenge his identification as the perpetrator--necessarily\n\n 5   implies the invalidity of the unchallenged, subsisting\n\n 6   conviction that was entered on Poventud’s plea of guilty to\n\n 7   that crime.     Heck therefore bars Poventud from asserting his\n\n 8   § 1983 claim.\n\n 9                                   I\n\n10       In 1998, a jury convicted Poventud of attempted murder\n\n11   in the second degree, attempted robbery in the first degree,\n\n12   and criminal possession of a weapon in the first degree, in\n\n13   connection with the armed robbery and shooting of Younis\n\n14   Duopo as he was driving a livery cab.     The time and place\n\n15   were: approximately 8:40 p.m. on March 6, 1997, between\n\n16   Oliver Place and Marion Avenue in the Bronx.     The conviction\n\n17   and the 10-to-20 year sentence were affirmed on appeal.      See\n\n18   People v. Poventud, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.D.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">223</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224 (1st Dep’t 2002).\n\n19       In 2005, the New York Supreme Court, Bronx County,\n\n20   vacated the conviction and ordered a re-trial on the ground\n\n21   that the prosecution had withheld potentially exculpatory\n\n22   evidence.     This ruling was highly solicitous of Poventud’s\n\n23   rights; in fact, the evidence withheld might as easily be\n\n24   viewed as inculpatory.\n                                     3\n\f 1         After the hold-up, photo ID of Poventud’s brother\n\n 2   Francisco was found in a wallet in Duopo’s vehicle.   When\n\n 3   shown the photograph of Francisco, Duopo opined that it\n\n 4   “looks like” the perpetrator, or “looks a lot like him.”      A\n\n 5   98.   (The majority calls this a positive identification.1\n\n 6   See Maj. Op. at 3.)   After it was ascertained that Francisco\n\n 7   was and had been in prison, Duopo positively identified\n\n 8   Marcos Poventud, as he later did in a line-up and for a\n\n 9   third time in the courtroom.   A 98, 114.   The state court\n\n10   ordered a re-trial on the ground that Brady was violated by\n\n11   the State’s failure to disclose Duopo’s observation that\n\n12   Francisco’s photo resembled the perpetrator.   See People v.\n\n13   Poventud, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">802</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608 (Brx. Cnty. 2005).\n\n14         Poventud claims that he looks nothing like his own\n\n15   brother (which would certainly make Duopo’s observation\n\n16   uncanny), and that it is just one of those coincidences that\n\n17   his jailed brother’s photo ID was left at the scene of the\n\n18   crime.\n\n19         Poventud had the opportunity to test those explanations\n\n20   before a jury on retrial.   Instead, Poventud pled guilty to\n\n21   attempted robbery in the third degree.   At his hearing, he\n\n22   admitted to holding up Duopo as he was driving a livery cab\n\n\n           1\n           The Bronx District Attorney’s Office considered this\n     statement a “tentative identification,” A 59, that tended to\n     inculpate Poventud, A 75.\n                                    4\n\f 1   at: approximately 8:40 p.m. on March 6, 1997, between Oliver\n\n 2   Place and Marion Avenue in the Bronx.       The plea colloquy\n\n 3   thus resolved the issue: Duopo’s identification of Poventud\n\n 4   was sound.   A 93.   Poventud was re-sentenced to one year in\n\n 5   prison and, because he had already served nine years, was\n\n 6   released.\n\n 7       Upon release from prison, Poventud filed a motion\n\n 8   challenging the voluntariness of his plea, but later\n\n 9   withdrew the motion.   He then filed this damages action\n\n10   under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that the prosecution’s Brady\n\n11   violation deprived him of a fair trial.

Cameron extended that principle to\n\n 8   § 1983 actions, observing: “The right to bring suit under §\n\n 9   1983 is designed both to allow an injured person to obtain\n\n10   compensation for the loss of his civil rights and to deter\n\n11   public officials from further violation of such rights.”\n\n12   806 F.2d at 388.

While Heck was serving a fifteen-year\n\n 5   sentence for voluntary manslaughter and his direct appeal\n\n 6   was still pending, he brought a § 1983 action alleging that\n\n 7   prosecutors and police officers had destroyed exculpatory\n\n 8   evidence.   Id. at 478-79.   The Supreme Court affirmed the\n\n 9   dismissal of the claim because “civil tort actions are not\n\n10   appropriate vehicles for challenging the validity of\n\n11   outstanding criminal judgments,” and because success on the\n\n12   plaintiff’s § 1983 claim “would necessarily imply the\n\n13   invalidity of his conviction or sentence[.]”    Id. at 486-87.\n\n14   To recover damages for allegedly unconstitutional conviction\n\n15   or imprisonment, a § 1983 plaintiff “must prove that the\n\n16   conviction or sentence has been reversed on direct appeal,\n\n17   expunged by executive order, declared invalid by a state\n\n18   tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called\n\n19   into question by a federal court’s issuance of a writ of\n\n20   habeas corpus[.]”   Id.\n\n21       This requirement is animated by the values of finality\n\n22   and consistency, and “a strong judicial policy against the\n\n23   creation of two conflicting resolutions arising out of the\n\n24   same or identical transaction.”    Id. at 484 (citation and\n\n\n                                    9\n\f 1   quotation marks omitted).

The Seventh Circuit, for instance, recently\n\n 8   dismissed a claim by a released convict who argued that\n\n 9   § 1983 must be made available if habeas relief is not.

I disagree: the\n\n22   passage does not address some ancillary issue; it responds\n\n23   directly to Justice Souter’s criticism, emphasizing that the\n\n24   scope and rationale of the holding are broad enough to be\n\n25   unaffected by whether the plaintiff is in jail or not.      “‘A\n\n26   dictum . . . is an assertion in a court’s opinion of a\n\n27   proposition of law [that] does not explain why the court’s\n\n28   judgment goes in favor of the winner.’”    Barclays Capital\n\n29\n\n\n     in his view, this approach was flawed.

There,\n     we considered whether a defendant’s guilty plea to a state\n     charge of criminal impersonation barred him from raising a\n     Fourth Amendment challenge to a federal firearms charge\n     arising from the same events. Id. at 162. Because the\n     firearm seizure “simply was not at issue” when the defendant\n     pleaded guilty to criminal impersonation, his guilty plea\n     did not bar a subsequent challenge to the search. Id. at\n     166. However, “were Gregg challenging . . . the discovery\n     of the evidence supporting the criminal impersonation charge\n     to which he pled guilty, then . . . Gregg’s Fourth Amendment\n     claims would be foreclosed.” Id. (emphasis added).\n          If Poventud had pled guilty to an unrelated charge, or\n     if his § 1983 claim had alleged unrelated police misconduct,\n     then Poventud’s § 1983 action might not have undermined his\n     plea, making the case arguably more akin to Gregg and\n     DiBlasio.\n                                    31\n\f 1   of the same day, wielding a weapon, and holding up the\n\n 2   victim.   Poventud’s § 1983 action calls that conviction and\n\n 3   plea into question, challenging the victim’s identification\n\n 4   of him as one of his attackers, and asserting that Poventud\n\n 5   “spent the entire evening of March 6, 1997, through the\n\n 6   morning of March 7, 1997, at the home of his friend . . .\n\n 7   playing video games.    He was never anywhere near the\n\n 8   vicinity of Oliver Place and Marion Avenue, where the\n\n 9   shooting occurred.”    A 106.   Success on Poventud’s § 1983\n\n10   action “would necessarily imply the invalidity” of his\n\n11   outstanding conviction.     Heck, 512 U.S. at 487.     It is\n\n12   therefore barred by Heck.\n\n13                               *   *    *\n\n14       The final section of the majority opinion introduces\n\n15   the idea that Poventud’s suit calls into question only his\n\n16   first conviction, not his second.        See Maj. Op. at 14-16.\n\n17   As I have already shown, Poventud’s claim is premised on his\n\n18   innocence of a crime to which he pled guilty.        See supra at\n\n19   32-33.    Accordingly, it is foreclosed by Heck, which bars\n\n20   both an action to recover damages for unconstitutional\n\n21   conviction or confinement, as well as an action “that does\n\n22   not seek damages directly attributable to conviction or\n\n23   confinement but whose successful prosecution would\n\n24   necessarily imply that the plaintiff’s criminal conviction\n\n25   was wrongful.”   Heck, 512 U.S. at 487 n.6.       Poventud’s claim\n\n                                     32\n\f 1   does both: [i] he seeks damages directly attributable to his\n\n 2   confinement, and [ii] success on his claim would necessarily\n\n 3   imply that his conviction (by guilty plea) was wrongful.\n\n 4   Poventud cannot evade this fact by “‘[s]eeking damages only\n\n 5   for punishment he suffered in excess of the one-year\n\n 6   imprisonment he accepted as part of his plea.’”   Maj. Op. at\n\n 7   15 (quoting Appellant Br. 32).\n\n 8       Turning elsewhere, the majority posits the hypothetical\n\n 9   of a defendant who is tortured, then confesses, then\n\n10   successfully challenges his conviction, then pleads guilty\n\n11   prior to retrial (under no compulsion), and is then released\n\n12   from prison.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1446 (2013) (holding that waiver\n\n19            of sovereign immunity under Federal Tort Claims Act\n\n20            for intentional acts committed by federal law\n\n21            enforcement was not limited to investigative\n\n22            activities).\n\n23       •    I agree with the majority that “the claim for\n\n24            damages for torture [would] in no way undercut[]\n\n25            the second, and only existing, conviction and hence\n\n                                   33\n\f 1       [would] in no way [be] barred by Heck,” Maj. Op. at\n\n 2       15.   That is because a claim for torture damages\n\n 3       would not necessarily imply the invalidity of the\n\n 4       defendant’s conviction.   Cf. Jackson v. Suffolk\n\n 5       Cnty.

However, what the defendant\n\n11       categorically may not do is seek damages for\n\n12       “unlawful” confinement for criminal conduct that he\n\n13       freely admitted.\n\n14   •   The majority opinion thus illustrates the hazard of\n\n15       creating constitutional law under the influence of\n\n16       a seminar hypothetical.\n\n\n\n\n                              34\n\f</pre>",
