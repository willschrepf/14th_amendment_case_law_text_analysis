At issue in this § 1983 action is whether the district court properly\ndenied qualified immunity to 15 Michigan corrections officers on duty at various points during the\nisolation, dehydration and eventual death of inmate Jeffrey Clark. Viewing the facts in the light\nmost favorable to Clark-Murphy (the representative of Clark’s estate), we affirm the denial of\nqualified immunity as to 11 of the employees and reverse it as to 4 of them (Andy Dyer, Kristine\nWakefield, Rina Becher and JoAnn Friedt).\n                                                  I.\n       According to Clark-Murphy’s version of this lamentable episode, here is what happened\nduring the last six days of the Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility’s custody over Jeffrey Clark.\n         June 29. On Saturday, June 29, 2002, the prison, located in Ionia, Michigan, was on “heat\nalert,” a warning that applies whenever outdoor temperatures exceed 85 degrees and a warning that\napplied to the prison from June 29 to July 5. D. Ct. Op. at 2, JA 1991–92. At roughly 5:30 p.m. that\nday, Clark collapsed outside while waiting in line to enter the mess hall. Two prison officials,\nCaptain Andy Dyer and Lieutenant Don Wise, attended to him, laying him down under the shade\nof a tree. Sergeant Kristine Wakefield, who also came to Clark’s assistance, observed that “[h]e was\ncrying. He said stuff about his dad, he said stuff about dying. He didn’t make sense, really. [He]\nwas not connecting a lot of it.” JA 557. She did not perceive any physical problems with Clark but\n“thought [he] had some mental problems.” JA 558. Using a wheelchair, Wakefield and Dyer\ntransported Clark to an observation cell.\n       As its name suggests, an observation cell gives officers an opportunity to observe a prisoner\nmore closely than would be possible if the prisoner were in the general prison population. Two\nobservation cells were located near the “pod,” the control center at the junction of two residence\nwings in the Bellamy prison. Each of the observation cells has a small window and two slots\nthrough which officers may pass food to the inmate and (if appropriate) cuff the inmate’s hands or\nfeet. On the way to meals or exercise, prisoners in the general population pass by the observation\ncells.\n       When the officers placed Clark in one of the observation cells on June 29, Wakefield\nobserved that “he start[ed] barking like a dog, screaming at the top of his lungs.” JA 561. Dyer told\nSergeant Tom Lauters, the officer in charge of the unit, that Clark “need[ed] to be referred—his\nbehavior was real erratic and [ ] he needed to be referred for psychological services.” JA 2504.\nSome officers on the housing unit, however, told Wakefield that they thought Clark was “faking.”\nJA 202.\n        That same day, Lauters filled out a psychiatric referral form, called a “Roberta-R” (which\nstands for reasoning, orientation, behavior, emotions, recall-and-memory, talk, appearance and\nrelationships), noting that Clark had suffered a seizure. JA 2588. When Lauters and other officers\nattempted to move Clark to his regular cell later that day, Clark “stiffened up and his legs just gave\nout,” JA 2592, and when they arrived at his regular cell Lauters noticed Clark’s packed duffel bag,\nfrom which he inferred that Clark had planned to leave his cell and was “a manipulator,” JA 2593.\nBased on these observations, Lauters returned Clark to the observation cell. So far as the record\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394          Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.                                    Page 3\n\n\nshows, this was the last time the door to Clark’s cell was opened while he was alive; the officers\nhandled all other contact with him through the slots in his cell door.\n         June 30. When officer Bruce Stout arrived at work at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, he found\nthe water to Clark’s cell turned off. Sergeant Mike Harvey, the supervisor of the unit during this\nshift, telephoned JoAnn Friedt, a registered nurse, telling her that “prisoner Clark was barking and\nwould not talk or respond to me.” JA 2751. In response, Friedt said that she “was aware of it” and\nthat she “put the Roberta-R Form in for psych to follow-up with him.” JA 2780.\n        At 7 p.m., during Lauters’ shift, Clark was “[w]alking back and forth, barking and yelling.”\nJA 769. Despite this odd behavior, Lauters did not determine whether Clark was receiving\npsychiatric care: “I knew that healthcare was contacted. I left it at that.” JA 2599. At 10:35 p.m.,\nduring the night shift, the log book revealed that Clark was “still beating on [the] door and yelling.”\nJA 769. At some point that weekend, inmate Andre Williams heard Clark asking for water.\n        July 1. On Monday, at 5:40 a.m., officer Anthony VanderVlucht noted that “Clark is acting\nvery strange, talking and yelling at himself.” JA 769. When Harvey arrived at 6 a.m., VanderVlucht\ntold him that Clark was not drinking. By the end of VanderVlucht’s 16-hour shift at 2 p.m., he had\nnot seen Clark sleep.\n        During Harvey’s morning shift, psychologist Mark Fox observed Clark and noted that he was\n“acting somewhat strangely” and that it “was kind of difficult to carry on a conversation with him.”\nJA 1783. Fox diagnosed Clark with “psychosis.” JA 1788. As Fox was leaving, Clark asked him\nif he could turn the water on. Fox says he asked Harvey to do so but, according to Harvey, Fox\n“said [Clark] was acting out to try to manipulate his way to a transfer.” JA 2754. Officer Ginger\nBayne recalled that it was Fox who ordered the water turned off. Later that day, Bayne observed\nClark drinking from his toilet, an observation she shared with Harvey. She acknowledged that Clark\nneeded mental health attention but did nothing because “that is what the Roberta-R was for.” JA\n1465. She also noted that the water had been turned off during this shift.\n         At 7:52 p.m., during Lauters’ shift, Clark “threw his food tray on the floor and wall.” JA\n769. Lauters claims that Clark’s water was never turned off during his shift. When officer Brian\nForeback and Lieutenant Shirley Whittaker relieved Lauters later that night, however, Foreback\nobserved that the water to Clark’s cell was turned off. Foreback could not remember whether the\nwater was ever turned back on during his shift. That night, Rina Becher, a relief sergeant who was\nfilling in for another sergeant, “observed [Clark] pacing back and forth naked and telling me he was\nselling candy canes.” JA 2107. She believed that Clark needed to see someone (presumably a\npsychologist or a psychiatrist) but was satisfied when she learned that a Roberta-R had been filled\nout.\n        July 2. On Tuesday, Stout arrived at 6 a.m., relieving Whittaker, and again found the water\nin Clark’s cell turned off. Roughly two hours into the shift, Harvey instructed Stout to turn on the\nwater. Another officer observed Clark urinating in the corner of the cell; the urine ran under the\ndoor, leading inmate-workers to complain about the “sticky” floor. JA 212.\n        Later that day, Tim Nelson, unit chief of the outpatient mental health unit, sent Deputy\nWarden Lee Gilman an e-mail stating that “it is my clinical opinion that prisoner Clark is psychotic\nand should have been or should be referred . . . for intense psychiatric treatment. . . . [H]is current\nlevel of functioning requires intense interventions.” JA 822. The record does not reveal any\nresponse by Gilman to this e-mail. That afternoon, Lauters, who still did not know whether Clark\nhad received medical attention, noticed that Clark’s cell was “trashed.” JA 2613. Officer Tom\nDowker reported that Clark refused his dinner that day.\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394          Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.                                     Page 4\n\n\n        July 3. On Wednesday, Clark refused his breakfast. The officer who attempted to deliver\nhis food noticed that “the floor, walls, and Clark were covered with something that looked like dried\nfood.” JA 213. Harvey asked Rufus Wright, the residence unit manager, if he could move Clark\nand informed Wright that the water to the cell was off. “It’s 90 degrees,” Wright responded, “you\ncan’t have the water off.” JA 214.\n        From outside the observation cell, Fox observed Clark for “a couple of minutes,” JA 1798,\nnoting that he was virtually non-responsive and that he “was laying on his cell floor when [I]\narrived. He refused to get up and talk to [me]. . . [H]e continues to act in an odd manner, but he has\nbecome less aggressive in behavior, i.e., not banging on the cell doors much. . . . Unable to assess\nbecause inmate is refusing to talk.” JA 1795–96. Fox informed Harvey that “Clark had a history\nof acting out to get into segregation.” JA 214. Later, Nelson contacted Fox regarding a report from\nan officer concerned about Clark’s condition. According to Nelson, Fox said “he was not going to\ngo back to the housing unit as he had already talked to Clark.” JA 214. “Clark was a\n‘manipulator,’” Fox added, “and was ‘trying to have things his way.’” JA 214.\n       On the next shift, Lauters noticed nothing unusual about Clark, though as far as he knew\nClark still had not received psychiatric help. Officer Thomas Dowker, who worked with Lauters\nevery day that Clark was in the cell, acknowledged some deterioration in Clark’s condition. Officer\nRicardo Dominguez observed Clark lying naked on his bed. According to the log book, Clark\nrefused to accept his evening meal. During Clark’s time in the observation cell, several inmates\nheard Clark asking for water as they passed his cell on the way to the mess hall. JA 573, 1288–94,\n1640, 2016, 2017, 2020.\n        July 4. At roughly 1 a.m., during Whittaker’s shift, Clark was discovered dead. His body\nlay naked on the floor, in full rigor mortis, with eyes open and vomit encrusted on his mouth. The\nwater to Clark’s cell was turned off and the toilet was dry. When an emergency medical crew\narrived, they asked how long it had been since someone had checked on Clark. Upon being\ninformed it had been 35 to 45 minutes, one of them said, “Jesus. He’s rigored.” JA 216.\n        Michigan Detective Michael Morey investigated the scene and noted a strong odor of urine,\na pool of urine beneath Clark’s mattress and debris on the floor, including uneaten food. Due to the\nsmearing of filth on the cell window, Morey determined that “very little of the activity inside that\ncell could have been observed from the outside.” JA 2050. Gilman reached the same conclusion:\nDue to “the filth on the inside of the window of the door,” he did not “believe that officers in the pod\ncould see anybody in those cells.” JA 785.\n       An autopsy revealed that Clark had died of dehydration.\n         On March 3, 2003, Clark’s estate, through his sister Bonita Clark-Murphy, filed two lawsuits\nagainst a number of prison employees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that they were deliberately\nindifferent to Clark’s medical needs in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Ruling\non three summary-judgment motions filed by different groups of defendants in the two cases, the\ndistrict court eventually dismissed the claims against several employees as a matter of law. As to\nthe remaining 15 defendants, the district court ruled (1) that there was a fact dispute about whether\nthey were deliberately indifferent to Clark’s need for water, ventilation and medical care, and (2)\nthat qualified immunity did not apply to these employees because Clark’s right to these necessities\nand services was clearly established at the time of the incident. Thirteen of the employees filed an\ninterlocutory challenge to this ruling, while two of them filed a separate interlocutory challenge to\nthe ruling. We have jurisdiction over each interlocutory appeal, Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511,\n527 (1985); we give de novo review to the district court’s summary judgment decisions, Thomas v.\nCohen, 304 F.3d 563, 568 (6th Cir. 2002); and we have exercised our discretion to consolidate the\ntwo appeals and resolve them together.\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394          Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.                                    Page 5\n\n\n                                                  II.\n         Something obviously went wrong during the last six days of the State of Michigan’s custody\nover Jeffrey Clark, and the question is whether a triable issue of fact exists over the constitutional\nresponsibility of these 15 defendants for his suffering and eventual death. Faced with this grim set\nof allegations and with the requirement that we must accept them as true at this stage of the\nlitigation, one might be tempted to invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur and let the trial begin.\nBut the Constitution gives governments considerable leeway when it comes to the day-to-day\nchallenges of managing a prison and erects a series of hurdles that allegations of prisoner\nmistreatment must clear before they proceed to a jury.\n        First, the standard of care in this area is not negligence, Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825,\n835 (1994), which is why res ipsa loquitur does not apply, Sweeney v. Erving, 228 U.S. 233, 240\n(1913). Under the Eighth Amendment, an inmate may bring a § 1983 claim regarding his conditions\nof confinement only when he can show that there has been “deliberate indifference” to his “medical\nneeds.” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 104 (1976); see also Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832 (“The\nAmendment [ ] imposes duties on these officials [to] ensure that inmates receive adequate food,\nclothing, shelter, and medical care, and . . . [to] ‘take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety\nof the inmates.’”) (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, 468 U.S. 517, 526–27 (1984)). To establish\n“deliberate indifference,” an inmate must show that the alleged mistreatment was “objectively”\nserious and that the defendants “subjectively” ignored the inmate’s medical or safety needs.\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 829, 834. A claimant may satisfy the subjective prong of this inquiry by\nestablishing that “the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety,”\nwhich is to say “the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn\nthat a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.” Id. at 837.\n         Second, qualified immunity prevents the officers from being held liable for constitutional\nviolations if the right at issue was not “clearly established” at the time of the violation. Saucier v.\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 200 (2001). Under Saucier, the “dispositive inquiry in determining whether a\nright is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was\nunlawful in the situation he confronted.” Id. at 202.\n                                                  A.\n        Turning to the constitutional question, we note that little room for debate exists about the\nobjective component of Clark-Murphy’s Eighth Amendment claim. In the abstract, the deprivation\nof water and medical care, including psychological services, of course would be “sufficiently\nserious” to satisfy this requirement, Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, and the defendants do not argue\notherwise. The question is whether the defendants satisfy the subjective component of the claim,\na question that we will answer by dividing the defendants into two groups—those involved only in\ntreating Clark’s collapse outside the mess hall on June 29 and those involved in his treatment from\nthat day forward.\n                                                  1.\n        Captain Dyer and Sergeant Wakefield assisted Clark after he collapsed outside the mess hall\non June 29. Each defendant’s involvement in Clark’s care ended after the two of them transferred\nhim to Lauters’ unit later that day. While they each perceived that Clark needed psychological care,\nthey had no reason to expect that Lauters or any of the other defendants charged with Clark’s care\nwould fail to secure that help. Nor did they leave it at that. Each of them took reasonable steps to\nensure that Lauters looked out for Clark’s safety in this area. See, e.g., JA 2504 (Dyer told Lauters\nthat Clark needed psychological services); JA 190 (Wakefield “radioed to the unit to find out any\ninformation that would help us on him”). See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844 (noting that “officials who\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394          Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.                                          Page 6\n\n\nactually knew of a substantial risk . . . may be found free from liability if they responded reasonably\nto the risk, even if the harm ultimately was not averted”).\n         Clark-Murphy has not produced evidence indicating or even suggesting that these defendants\nhad any reason to think Clark was not receiving the psychological treatment he needed after June\n29. And there is no evidence that these defendants had any reason to think that Clark was\ndehydrated at this point in time. While it fairly can be said that each of these defendants perceived\na risk to Clark’s health, they acted reasonably in response to that perception. Clark was moved to\nan observation cell, and the officers looked into his treatment history and communicated their\nconcerns that Clark needed psychiatric assistance. Clark-Murphy does not allege that these officers\nhad any other responsibility for, or interaction with, Clark after this incident. On this record, the\nconstitutional claims of deliberate indifference fail as a matter of law against these two defendants.\nSee Williams v. Mehra, 186 F.3d 685, 692–93 (6th Cir. 1999) (en banc) (“Plaintiff would need to\nshow that the doctors actually knew that [their actions] constituted an excessive risk to [plaintiff’s]\nhealth or safety.”); Davis v.

Each of these\nofficers had some involvement with Clark after his June 29 collapse, and each of them learned at\none time or another about his serious psychological needs or his potential for dehydration. As\nshown by the following assessment of the evidence, Clark-Murphy has presented sufficient evidence\nfrom which 11 of these defendants (all but Becher and Friedt) could have inferred that a substantial\nrisk of serious harm existed to Clark’s health and safety from the deprivation of water or\npsychological treatment, or both.\n                                        DEPUTY WARDEN\nLee Gilman\n       Gilman received an e-mail on July 2 from the head of the outpatient mental health\n       unit stating that “it is my clinical opinion that prisoner Clark is psychotic . . . .

In response, Friedt said that “I was aware of it and\n        that I put the Roberta-R Form in for psych to follow-up with him.” JA 2780.\nMark Fox, psychologist\n        Shifts: Visited Clark on July 1 and 3.\n        As a psychologist, Fox was well-positioned to identify Clark’s psychosis and to\n        address it; he did not address the problem during his first examination and gave\n        Clark only a cursory examination the day he died, despite his awareness that Clark\n        was suffering from psychosis and despite seeing Clark in a non-responsive condition;\n        and Fox may have ordered the water turned off in Clark’s cell.\n          As this record evidence shows, each of these defendants, except for Becher and Friedt,\nrepeatedly perceived sufficient facts to infer that Clark faced serious risks to his health and safety.\nWith regard to the dehydration claim, Clark-Murphy has presented evidence indicating that the\nwater repeatedly was off during many of these defendants’ shifts, that other inmates heard Clark\nasking for water throughout the week, that officers perceived that Clark was not drinking and that\nthe prison was on a heat alert throughout this six-day period. With regard to the mental-illness\nclaim, many of the officers testified that they believed Clark needed psychological attention. See\nGilman Br. at 11 (Fox diagnosed Clark with psychosis); id. at 17 (Gilman was advised that “Clark\nneeded psychiatric treatment”); id. at 21 (Bayne thought that Clark had “mental health” needs); id.\nat 24 (VanderVlucht “thought Clark’s problems were psychological”); id. at 25 (Dowker “thought\n. . . Clark needed psychological or psychiatric intervention”); id. at 27 (Harvey “thought that Clark\n‘had some mental issues’”); id. at 29 (Whittaker “thought that Clark needed to be seen by a mental\nhealth professional”).\n         Despite these widely held beliefs, the record shows that Clark languished in his cell for five\ndays without the door being opened and apparently with the officers unable readily to see into his\ncell for part of this time. Even though prison rules required officers to go up the chain of command\nif they felt that a referral had not secured the requisite assistance for an inmate, these defendants pin\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394           Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.                                     Page 9\n\n\nmuch of their defense on the fact that they (or others) had completed psychological-referral forms.\nSee, e.g., JA 2599 (Lauters: “I knew that healthcare was contacted, I left it at that.”). While this fact\nmay be relevant to whether the individual defendants recklessly disregarded a risk of harm to Clark\nor responded reasonably to it, the fact does not suffice to establish that the defendants are entitled\nto qualified immunity as a matter of law at this stage of the case given their repeated interactions\nwith Clark and repeated opportunities to assess the seriousness of the situation.\n        None of this, to be sure, establishes that these defendants either singly or as a group showed\ndeliberate indifference to Clark. For summary-judgment purposes, we hold only that these 11\ndefendants could have perceived a substantial risk of serious harm to Clark. Whether in fact they\nperceived, inferred or disregarded that risk is an issue for trial. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842\n(“Whether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of fact\nsubject to demonstration in the usual ways . . . , and a factfinder may conclude that a prison official\nknew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.”); see also Comstock v.\nMcCrary, 273 F.3d 693, 703 (6th Cir. 2001) (noting that it is “permissible for reviewing courts to\ninfer from circumstantial evidence that a prison official had the requisite knowledge”).\n        In contrast to these 11 defendants, Sergeant Becher and nurse Friedt worked just one 8-hour\nshift between Clark’s seizure on June 29 and his death on July 3 or July 4. While a prison employee\ndoubtlessly could exhibit deliberate indifference toward an inmate in the course of one shift, neither\nFriedt nor Becher had sufficient exposure to Clark to make out a triable issue of fact that any such\nwantonness occurred on their part.\n        Only one of Nurse Friedt’s shifts (an eight-hour shift on Sunday, June 30) involved Clark.\nFriedt became aware of Clark’s situation by way of a Roberta-R form, which mentioned “some type\nof seizure.” JA 2784. A Roberta-R form is used only “for psychiatric or mental conditions.” JA\n2778. As a nurse, Friedt was not expected to become involved with mental-health issues unless the\ninmate was being watched for self-harm, which was not the case here. She also knew that the\nofficers had not prepared a health-care contact sheet, a fact that was inconsistent with a medical\nemergency. Knowing that the hospital could have been called the night before if there had been “an\nimminent need for care,” JA 2778, Friedt, without more, fairly could have deduced that the situation\nwith Clark was under control. The officers on the scene had not contacted a hospital or a nurse; they\ninstead had sought psychiatric care; and 12 hours had passed since the original incident—all prior\nto her arrival. Quite possibly, on this record, Friedt reasonably could have done nothing more. But\nshe did more: She called the officer on duty in Clark’s cell block (Thelen) to determine if Clark\nneeded medical assistance. Officer Thelen informed Friedt, “All he’s on is custody watch [which\ndid not impose a responsibility on Friedt]. He does not need medical care.” JA 2780. When Harvey\ncalled later, he mentioned that Clark was having psychiatric difficulties. Since she was not qualified\nto help an inmate with psychiatric needs, she let Harvey know that the referral to the psychiatric\ndepartment had been completed. In contrast to Harvey, no allegation has been made that Friedt\nknew the psychiatric referral had failed to secure Clark the help he needed. No evidence indicates\nthat Harvey or anyone else told Friedt that a psychologist or psychiatrist needed to see Clark that\nday, and Clark-Murphy has offered no theory of liability or damages relating to the fact that Fox did\nnot see Clark until the next day. On these facts, it is doubtful that negligence could be proved, much\nless deliberate indifference.\n        Sergeant Becher was a relief sergeant who was filling in for another sergeant on July 1 and\nworked just one 8-hour shift during the six days at issue. While she learned firsthand during the\nshift that Clark needed psychiatric care (based on seeing him pace back and forth naked in his cell\nand based on hearing him offer to sell her candy canes), she responded appropriately to this\nobservation by asking whether a psychiatric referral (a Roberta-R) had been completed for Clark.\nShe was told that several Roberta-Rs had been completed for him. And of course earlier that day\nFox (the psychologist) had paid his first visit to Clark. On this record, Becher simply did not have\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394          Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.                                    Page 10\n\n\nthe repeated opportunities that others had to know that proper mental-health care was not being\nprovided for Clark. See Davis v. Oakland County, No. 96-1678, 1998 WL 180608, at *4 (6th Cir.\nApr. 7, 1998) (“It was not unreasonable” for defendant “to assume that the trained medical\nprofessional . . . would follow-up in an appropriate manner.”). Nor does any evidence indicate that\nshe was aware that he repeatedly was not drinking water (or eating food). Later during the shift, she\nasked an officer how Clark was doing. The officer responded that he was doing “okay” but that he\nhad attempted to shove a pillow down his toilet. JA 210. In response, Becher asked if “they would\nhave to shut the water off and the officer told her no, they had already done that.” Id. To the extent\nthis evidence shows that Becher was aware that the water to Clark’s cell was turned off, it shows\nonly that it was turned off toward the end of her shift and solely in response to an incident that\ntemporarily would have justified shutting off the water. In the absence of other evidence that Becher\nwas aware that Clark was not drinking (or eating) or that the water was turned off in his cell for an\nextended period of time, Clark-Murphy has not tenably shown that Becher recklessly ignored\nClark’s need for water.\n        Given the brief exposures of these two defendants to Clark and given the resulting absence\nof evidence regarding their purposeful indifference to his health and safety needs, the claims against\nthese defendants must be dismissed as a matter of law. See Gibson v. Matthews, 926 F.2d 532, 535\n(6th Cir. 1991) (“[P]ersonal liability on any of the defendants. . . . must be based on the actions of\nthat defendant in the situation that the defendant faced, and not based on any problems caused by\nthe errors of others, either defendants or non-defendants.”); see also Vance v. Peters, 97 F.3d 987,\n992 (7th Cir. 1996) (“The focus must be on whether any of the defendants had the personal\ninvolvement necessary to permit a finding of liability.”).\n                                                  B.\n        Having concluded that a triable issue of fact exists over whether 11 of the defendants showed\ndeliberate indifference to Clark’s health and safety needs, we turn to whether that right was clearly\nestablished in June 2002. Under Saucier, the “dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is\nclearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful\nin the situation he confronted.” 533 U.S. at 202; Comstock, 273 F.3d at 702; see also Anderson v.\nCreighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640 (1987) (“The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a\nreasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.”). “If the officer’s\nmistake as to what the law requires is reasonable,” however, “the officer is entitled to the immunity\ndefense.” Saucier, 533 U.S. at 205.\n        At the time of this incident, it should come as no surprise that Clark had a clearly established\nright not to be deprived of food and water. See Kent v. Johnson, 821 F.2d 1220, 1229 (6th Cir.\n1987) (holding that “[t]he Eighth Amendment affords prisoners protection against . . . exposure to\negregious physical conditions which deprive them of basic human needs”); see also Cherrington v.\nSkeeter, 344 F.3d 631, 637 (6th Cir. 2003) (noting that when the state “fails to provide for [a\nprisoner’s] basic human needs—e.g., food, clothing, shelter, medical care, and reasonable safety—it\ntransgresses the substantive limits on state action set by the Eighth Amendment”).\n        The same holds true for Clark’s right to psychological treatment. See Comstock, 273 F.3d\nat 702 (noting that a “prison inmate has [an] Eighth Amendment right [to] be free from deliberate\nindifference to serious psychiatric needs”); Greason v. Kemp, 891 F.2d 829, 834 (11th Cir. 1990)\n(noting that “every reported decision handed down after Estelle and before [June 1985] . . .\nrecognized that deliberate indifference to an inmate’s need for mental health care is actionable on\neighth amendment grounds”); Woodall v.

Stewart County, 958 F.2d 709, 717 (6th Cir. 1992) (holding that\n“[t]here can be no doubt that in 1987 existing law clearly established the right [of inmates] . . . to\nreceive care for [ ] serious medical needs”); Fitzke v. Shappell, 468 F.2d 1072, 1076 (6th Cir. 1972)\n(holding that “fundamental fairness and our most basic conception of due process mandate that\nmedical care be provided to one who is incarcerated and may be suffering from serious illness”).\n        As the above cases suggest and as the following cases confirm, the defendants’ distinction\nbetween medical care and psychological care—“prisoner Clark showed signs that he needed\npsychological or psychiatric help, not medical help,” Foreback Br. at 36—does not protect them\nfrom liability. See Horn v. Madison County Fiscal Court, 22 F.3d 653, 660 (6th Cir. 1994)\n(“[P]sychological needs may constitute serious medical needs.”); Davis, 1998 WL 180608, at *4\n(“Medical needs encompass treatment for mental illness.”); see also Partridge v. Two Unknown\nPolice Officers of Houston, 791 F.2d 1182, 1187 (5th Cir. 1986) (“A serious medical need may exist\nfor psychological or psychiatric treatment, just as it may exist for physical ills.”); Pierce, 612 F.2d\nat 763 (“Although most challenges to prison medical treatment have focused on . . . physical ills,\nwe perceive no reason why psychological or psychiatric care should not be held to the same\nstandard.”); Bowring v. Godwin, 551 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir. 1977) (“We see no underlying distinction\nbetween the right to medical care for physical ills and its psychological or psychiatric counterpart.”).\n        Neither are the defendants correct in contending that Clark-Murphy cannot prove “proximate\ncause between their actions and Clark’s death.” Gilman Br. at 50. The claimant need only\ndemonstrate a link between each defendant’s misconduct and Clark’s injury, which may include his\ndeath as well as the “pain and suffering,” JA 25, that preceded his death. See, e.g., Boretti v.\nWiscomb, 930 F.2d 1150, 1154 (6th Cir. 1991) (holding that “physical pain and mental anguish\n[suffered] during the time he was denied [treatment] . . . . may constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment”); Westlake v. Lucas, 537 F.2d 857, 860\n(6th Cir. 1976) (holding that “a prisoner who is needlessly allowed to suffer pain when relief is\nreadily available does have a cause of action against those whose deliberate indifference is the cause\nof his suffering”).\n        One of the defendants (Whittaker) claims the complaint does not contain any allegations\nagainst her, requiring that she be dismissed from the case. Not true. The complaint lists Whittaker\nas a defendant; it alleges that the defendants, including Whittaker, observed Clark’s deteriorating\ncondition and failed to seek treatment; and the summary-judgment evidence shows that a triable\nissue of fact exists over Whittaker’s alleged indifference.\n                                                  III.\n       For these reasons, we affirm the denial of qualified immunity as to 11 of the defendants\n(Gilman, Whittaker, Wise, Harvey, Lauters, Bayne, Dowker, Foreback, Stout, Vandervlucht and\nFox) but reverse as to 4 of them (Dyer, Wakefield, Becher and Friedt), and remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394               Clark-Murphy v.

I\ndissent in part because I would affirm the denial of qualified immunity for JoAnn Friedt and Rina\nBecher for the following reasons.\n        The majority’s reliance on the brevity of Friedt’s one-shift-long involvement with Clark to\ndecide that Friedt was entitled to qualified immunity erroneously disregards other factors relevant\nto this inquiry, such as the Defendant’s position and expertise and the severity of distressing\nbehavior that she saw Clark display. Friedt’s awareness of Clark’s seizure, which was noted on the\nRoberta-R Form that Friedt received and read, carries enhanced significance because she is a\nregistered nurse who admitted at her deposition that seizures can be “life[-]threatening” and that she\ncould not assess whether the seizure was of medical concern without seeing Clark. Joint Appendix\nat 2782 (Friedt Dep. at 38). Although the majority further concludes that Friedt did not ignore a\nserious risk to Clark’s health because Officer Thelen told Friedt that Clark did not require medical\ncare, Friedt knew that Thelen did not have medical expertise, and given Friedt’s own training, Friedt\nshould have taken further action to assess Clark’s health. The majority’s conjecture     that “[q]uite\npossibly, on this record, Friedt reasonably could have done nothing more,”1 Majority Opinion\n(“Maj. Op.”) at 9, is flatly contradicted by the record. Friedt herself testified that when she gets a\ncall from a resident unit officer regarding a medical concern relating to a prisoner, as she did from\nSergeant Mike Harvey, she has three options: talking to the prisoner on the phone, seeing the\nprisoner on his unit, or having the prisoner come to the clinic. In this instance, Friedt chose none\nof these courses of conduct, and instead, opted to do nothing.\n        The majority attempts to absolve Friedt’s inaction by asserting that Friedt had no\nresponsibility to respond to a prisoner’s potentially life-threatening health risk because she was\nmade aware of this risk by prison paperwork that is ordinarily used for psychological rather than\nmedical health issues. This amounts to a rule that a prison’s medical-care personnel can turn a blind\neye to health-care concerns placed before them. This is precisely what the Eighth Amendment\ndisallows: “deliberate indifference” to “a substantial risk of serious harm” to a prisoner’s health.\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994). Friedt, a medical professional, ignored a fact that\nshe knew indicated a potential serious health risk — a seizure — that may have required immediate\nmedical care. Therefore, that a health-care contact sheet had not been prepared and that the hospital\nwas not contacted is irrelevant in the face of concrete facts that Clark might have been confronting\na serious health risk that required prompt medical attention.\n       Regardless of whether and when Psychologist Mark Fox or any other mental health\nprofessional saw Clark, because Friedt knew of Clark’s seizure, she knew that he may have required\nmedical attention.2 As in Comstock v. McCrary, the circumstances reveal that Friedt should have\n\n\n         1\n           The majority’s willingness to infer facts in favor of Defendant Friedt, a moving party, as evidenced by this\nstatement and the majority’s assumption that Friedt “could have deduced that the situation with Clark was under control,”\nMaj. Op. at 9, contravenes our obligation, in reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, to “view all the\nfacts and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Cockrel v. Shelby County\nSch. Dist., 270 F.3d 1036, 1048 (6th Cir. 2001).\n         2\n          The majority notes that the Plaintiff “has offered no theory of liability or damages relating to the fact that\n[Psychologist] Fox did not see Clark until the next day.” Maj. Op. at 9. This reasoning seems out of place given that\nthe majority does not require the Plaintiff to make such a robust showing of specific causation and damages regarding\nthe other Defendants in this case. In fact, the majority expressly criticizes that “defendants pin much of their defense\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394               Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.                                               Page 13\n\n\ninvestigated Clark’s condition before determining that he did not require immediate care, and her\ndecision not to do so amounts to deliberate indifference. See Comstock v. McCrary, 273 F.3d 693,\n707-08 (6th Cir. 2001). Therefore, Friedt’s decision not to see Clark, particularly when she knew\nthat he would not be seen by someone from psychological services that day, smacks of reckless\ndisregard for the health risks he may have been facing.\n          The majority again relies too heavily on the extent of Becher’s contact with Clark to\ndetermine whether she ignored a significant health risk. Although Becher worked only one shift in\nthe time between Clark’s collapse and his death, she observed Clark “pacing back and forth naked\nand telling me he was selling candy canes.” Joint Appendix at 2107 (Becher Dep. at 20). One\nwould expect that this behavior is sufficiently bizarre to arouse great concern in anyone witnessing\nit. Moreover, although Becher testified at her deposition that she was unaware that there was a heat\nalert, that the water in Clark’s cell was off, and that Clark was experiencing a mental disturbance,\nother statements made during her deposition cast doubt on these self-serving assertions. Given that\na factfinder may determine that “‘a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk\n. . . [by] inference from circumstantial evidence,’” including “‘from the very fact that the risk was\nobvious,’” Lemarbe v. Wisneski, 266 F.3d 429, 436 (6th Cir. 2001) (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511\nU.S. 834, 842 (1994)); see also Majority Op. at 9, Becher has not put forth sufficient evidence to\nshow that she was not aware of the health risks Clark faced, and thus she should not be dismissed\nfrom the case.\n        For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the district court’s denial of qualified immunity\nto Friedt and Becher, and accordingly I dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\non the fact that they (or others) had completed psychological-referral forms” because “prison rules required officers to\ngo up the chain of command if they felt that a referral had not secured the requisite assistance for an inmate.” Id. at 9.\nIn any event, it does not require much speculation to conclude that had Friedt seen Clark, she would have gotten him\nproper treatment, and perhaps he would have survived or at least avoided some degree of suffering.\n\f",

At issue in this § 1983 action is whether the district court properly\ndenied qualified immunity to 15 Michigan corrections officers on duty at various points during the\nisolation, dehydration and eventual death of inmate Jeffrey Clark. Viewing the facts in the light\nmost favorable to Clark-Murphy (the representative of Clark’s estate), we affirm the denial of\nqualified immunity as to 11 of the employees and reverse it as to 4 of them (Andy Dyer, Kristine\nWakefield, Rina Becher and JoAnn Friedt).\n                                                  I.\n       According to Clark-Murphy’s version of this lamentable episode, here is what happened\nduring the last six days of the Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility’s custody over Jeffrey Clark.\n         June 29. On Saturday, June 29, 2002, the prison, located in Ionia, Michigan, was on “heat\nalert,” a warning that applies whenever outdoor temperatures exceed 85 degrees and a warning that\napplied to the prison from June 29 to July 5. D. Ct. Op. at 2, JA 1991–92. At roughly 5:30 p.m. that\nday, Clark collapsed outside while waiting in line to enter the mess hall. Two prison officials,\nCaptain Andy Dyer and Lieutenant Don Wise, attended to him, laying him down under the shade\nof a tree. Sergeant Kristine Wakefield, who also came to Clark’s assistance, observed that “[h]e was\ncrying. He said stuff about his dad, he said stuff about dying. He didn’t make sense, really. [He]\nwas not connecting a lot of it.” JA 557. She did not perceive any physical problems with Clark but\n“thought [he] had some mental problems.” JA 558. Using a wheelchair, Wakefield and Dyer\ntransported Clark to an observation cell.\n       As its name suggests, an observation cell gives officers an opportunity to observe a prisoner\nmore closely than would be possible if the prisoner were in the general prison population. Two\nobservation cells were located near the “pod,” the control center at the junction of two residence\nwings in the Bellamy prison. Each of the observation cells has a small window and two slots\nthrough which officers may pass food to the inmate and (if appropriate) cuff the inmate’s hands or\nfeet. On the way to meals or exercise, prisoners in the general population pass by the observation\ncells.\n       When the officers placed Clark in one of the observation cells on June 29, Wakefield\nobserved that “he start[ed] barking like a dog, screaming at the top of his lungs.” JA 561. Dyer told\nSergeant Tom Lauters, the officer in charge of the unit, that Clark “need[ed] to be referred—his\nbehavior was real erratic and [ ] he needed to be referred for psychological services.” JA 2504.\nSome officers on the housing unit, however, told Wakefield that they thought Clark was “faking.”\nJA 202.\n        That same day, Lauters filled out a psychiatric referral form, called a “Roberta-R” (which\nstands for reasoning, orientation, behavior, emotions, recall-and-memory, talk, appearance and\nrelationships), noting that Clark had suffered a seizure. JA 2588. When Lauters and other officers\nattempted to move Clark to his regular cell later that day, Clark “stiffened up and his legs just gave\nout,” JA 2592, and when they arrived at his regular cell Lauters noticed Clark’s packed duffel bag,\nfrom which he inferred that Clark had planned to leave his cell and was “a manipulator,” JA 2593.\nBased on these observations, Lauters returned Clark to the observation cell. So far as the record\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394          Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.                                    Page 3\n\n\nshows, this was the last time the door to Clark’s cell was opened while he was alive; the officers\nhandled all other contact with him through the slots in his cell door.\n         June 30. When officer Bruce Stout arrived at work at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, he found\nthe water to Clark’s cell turned off. Sergeant Mike Harvey, the supervisor of the unit during this\nshift, telephoned JoAnn Friedt, a registered nurse, telling her that “prisoner Clark was barking and\nwould not talk or respond to me.” JA 2751. In response, Friedt said that she “was aware of it” and\nthat she “put the Roberta-R Form in for psych to follow-up with him.” JA 2780.\n        At 7 p.m., during Lauters’ shift, Clark was “[w]alking back and forth, barking and yelling.”\nJA 769. Despite this odd behavior, Lauters did not determine whether Clark was receiving\npsychiatric care: “I knew that healthcare was contacted. I left it at that.” JA 2599. At 10:35 p.m.,\nduring the night shift, the log book revealed that Clark was “still beating on [the] door and yelling.”\nJA 769. At some point that weekend, inmate Andre Williams heard Clark asking for water.\n        July 1. On Monday, at 5:40 a.m., officer Anthony VanderVlucht noted that “Clark is acting\nvery strange, talking and yelling at himself.” JA 769. When Harvey arrived at 6 a.m., VanderVlucht\ntold him that Clark was not drinking. By the end of VanderVlucht’s 16-hour shift at 2 p.m., he had\nnot seen Clark sleep.\n        During Harvey’s morning shift, psychologist Mark Fox observed Clark and noted that he was\n“acting somewhat strangely” and that it “was kind of difficult to carry on a conversation with him.”\nJA 1783. Fox diagnosed Clark with “psychosis.” JA 1788. As Fox was leaving, Clark asked him\nif he could turn the water on. Fox says he asked Harvey to do so but, according to Harvey, Fox\n“said [Clark] was acting out to try to manipulate his way to a transfer.” JA 2754. Officer Ginger\nBayne recalled that it was Fox who ordered the water turned off. Later that day, Bayne observed\nClark drinking from his toilet, an observation she shared with Harvey. She acknowledged that Clark\nneeded mental health attention but did nothing because “that is what the Roberta-R was for.” JA\n1465. She also noted that the water had been turned off during this shift.\n         At 7:52 p.m., during Lauters’ shift, Clark “threw his food tray on the floor and wall.” JA\n769. Lauters claims that Clark’s water was never turned off during his shift. When officer Brian\nForeback and Lieutenant Shirley Whittaker relieved Lauters later that night, however, Foreback\nobserved that the water to Clark’s cell was turned off. Foreback could not remember whether the\nwater was ever turned back on during his shift. That night, Rina Becher, a relief sergeant who was\nfilling in for another sergeant, “observed [Clark] pacing back and forth naked and telling me he was\nselling candy canes.” JA 2107. She believed that Clark needed to see someone (presumably a\npsychologist or a psychiatrist) but was satisfied when she learned that a Roberta-R had been filled\nout.\n        July 2. On Tuesday, Stout arrived at 6 a.m., relieving Whittaker, and again found the water\nin Clark’s cell turned off. Roughly two hours into the shift, Harvey instructed Stout to turn on the\nwater. Another officer observed Clark urinating in the corner of the cell; the urine ran under the\ndoor, leading inmate-workers to complain about the “sticky” floor. JA 212.\n        Later that day, Tim Nelson, unit chief of the outpatient mental health unit, sent Deputy\nWarden Lee Gilman an e-mail stating that “it is my clinical opinion that prisoner Clark is psychotic\nand should have been or should be referred . . . for intense psychiatric treatment. . . . [H]is current\nlevel of functioning requires intense interventions.” JA 822. The record does not reveal any\nresponse by Gilman to this e-mail. That afternoon, Lauters, who still did not know whether Clark\nhad received medical attention, noticed that Clark’s cell was “trashed.” JA 2613. Officer Tom\nDowker reported that Clark refused his dinner that day.\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394          Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.                                     Page 4\n\n\n        July 3. On Wednesday, Clark refused his breakfast. The officer who attempted to deliver\nhis food noticed that “the floor, walls, and Clark were covered with something that looked like dried\nfood.” JA 213. Harvey asked Rufus Wright, the residence unit manager, if he could move Clark\nand informed Wright that the water to the cell was off. “It’s 90 degrees,” Wright responded, “you\ncan’t have the water off.” JA 214.\n        From outside the observation cell, Fox observed Clark for “a couple of minutes,” JA 1798,\nnoting that he was virtually non-responsive and that he “was laying on his cell floor when [I]\narrived. He refused to get up and talk to [me]. . . [H]e continues to act in an odd manner, but he has\nbecome less aggressive in behavior, i.e., not banging on the cell doors much. . . . Unable to assess\nbecause inmate is refusing to talk.” JA 1795–96. Fox informed Harvey that “Clark had a history\nof acting out to get into segregation.” JA 214. Later, Nelson contacted Fox regarding a report from\nan officer concerned about Clark’s condition. According to Nelson, Fox said “he was not going to\ngo back to the housing unit as he had already talked to Clark.” JA 214. “Clark was a\n‘manipulator,’” Fox added, “and was ‘trying to have things his way.’” JA 214.\n       On the next shift, Lauters noticed nothing unusual about Clark, though as far as he knew\nClark still had not received psychiatric help. Officer Thomas Dowker, who worked with Lauters\nevery day that Clark was in the cell, acknowledged some deterioration in Clark’s condition. Officer\nRicardo Dominguez observed Clark lying naked on his bed. According to the log book, Clark\nrefused to accept his evening meal. During Clark’s time in the observation cell, several inmates\nheard Clark asking for water as they passed his cell on the way to the mess hall. JA 573, 1288–94,\n1640, 2016, 2017, 2020.\n        July 4. At roughly 1 a.m., during Whittaker’s shift, Clark was discovered dead. His body\nlay naked on the floor, in full rigor mortis, with eyes open and vomit encrusted on his mouth. The\nwater to Clark’s cell was turned off and the toilet was dry. When an emergency medical crew\narrived, they asked how long it had been since someone had checked on Clark. Upon being\ninformed it had been 35 to 45 minutes, one of them said, “Jesus. He’s rigored.” JA 216.\n        Michigan Detective Michael Morey investigated the scene and noted a strong odor of urine,\na pool of urine beneath Clark’s mattress and debris on the floor, including uneaten food. Due to the\nsmearing of filth on the cell window, Morey determined that “very little of the activity inside that\ncell could have been observed from the outside.” JA 2050. Gilman reached the same conclusion:\nDue to “the filth on the inside of the window of the door,” he did not “believe that officers in the pod\ncould see anybody in those cells.” JA 785.\n       An autopsy revealed that Clark had died of dehydration.\n         On March 3, 2003, Clark’s estate, through his sister Bonita Clark-Murphy, filed two lawsuits\nagainst a number of prison employees under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that they were deliberately\nindifferent to Clark’s medical needs in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. Ruling\non three summary-judgment motions filed by different groups of defendants in the two cases, the\ndistrict court eventually dismissed the claims against several employees as a matter of law. As to\nthe remaining 15 defendants, the district court ruled (1) that there was a fact dispute about whether\nthey were deliberately indifferent to Clark’s need for water, ventilation and medical care, and (2)\nthat qualified immunity did not apply to these employees because Clark’s right to these necessities\nand services was clearly established at the time of the incident. Thirteen of the employees filed an\ninterlocutory challenge to this ruling, while two of them filed a separate interlocutory challenge to\nthe ruling.

Page 5\n\n\n                                                  II.\n         Something obviously went wrong during the last six days of the State of Michigan’s custody\nover Jeffrey Clark, and the question is whether a triable issue of fact exists over the constitutional\nresponsibility of these 15 defendants for his suffering and eventual death. Faced with this grim set\nof allegations and with the requirement that we must accept them as true at this stage of the\nlitigation, one might be tempted to invoke the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur and let the trial begin.\nBut the Constitution gives governments considerable leeway when it comes to the day-to-day\nchallenges of managing a prison and erects a series of hurdles that allegations of prisoner\nmistreatment must clear before they proceed to a jury.\n        First, the standard of care in this area is not negligence, Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n835 (1994), which is why res ipsa loquitur does not apply, Sweeney v.

Under the Eighth Amendment, an inmate may bring a § 1983 claim regarding his conditions\nof confinement only when he can show that there has been “deliberate indifference” to his “medical\nneeds.” Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 104 (1976); see also Farmer, 511 U.S. at 832 (“The\nAmendment [ ] imposes duties on these officials [to] ensure that inmates receive adequate food,\nclothing, shelter, and medical care, and . . . [to] ‘take reasonable measures to guarantee the safety\nof the inmates.’”) (quoting Hudson v. Palmer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111252\"><a href=\"/opinion/111252/hudson-v-palmer/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 526–27 (1984)). To establish\n“deliberate indifference,” an inmate must show that the alleged mistreatment was “objectively”\nserious and that the defendants “subjectively” ignored the inmate’s medical or safety needs.\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 829, 834. A claimant may satisfy the subjective prong of this inquiry by\nestablishing that “the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety,”\nwhich is to say “the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn\nthat a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.” Id. at 837.\n         Second, qualified immunity prevents the officers from being held liable for constitutional\nviolations if the right at issue was not “clearly established” at the time of the violation. Saucier v.\nKatz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 200 (2001). Under Saucier, the “dispositive inquiry in determining whether a\nright is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was\nunlawful in the situation he confronted.” Id. at 202.\n                                                  A.\n        Turning to the constitutional question, we note that little room for debate exists about the\nobjective component of Clark-Murphy’s Eighth Amendment claim. In the abstract, the deprivation\nof water and medical care, including psychological services, of course would be “sufficiently\nserious” to satisfy this requirement, Farmer, 511 U.S. at 834, and the defendants do not argue\notherwise. The question is whether the defendants satisfy the subjective component of the claim,\na question that we will answer by dividing the defendants into two groups—those involved only in\ntreating Clark’s collapse outside the mess hall on June 29 and those involved in his treatment from\nthat day forward.\n                                                  1.\n        Captain Dyer and Sergeant Wakefield assisted Clark after he collapsed outside the mess hall\non June 29. Each defendant’s involvement in Clark’s care ended after the two of them transferred\nhim to Lauters’ unit later that day. While they each perceived that Clark needed psychological care,\nthey had no reason to expect that Lauters or any of the other defendants charged with Clark’s care\nwould fail to secure that help. Nor did they leave it at that. Each of them took reasonable steps to\nensure that Lauters looked out for Clark’s safety in this area. See, e.g., JA 2504 (Dyer told Lauters\nthat Clark needed psychological services); JA 190 (Wakefield “radioed to the unit to find out any\ninformation that would help us on him”). See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 844 (noting that “officials who\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394          Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.

And there is no evidence that these defendants had any reason to think that Clark was\ndehydrated at this point in time. While it fairly can be said that each of these defendants perceived\na risk to Clark’s health, they acted reasonably in response to that perception. Clark was moved to\nan observation cell, and the officers looked into his treatment history and communicated their\nconcerns that Clark needed psychiatric assistance. Clark-Murphy does not allege that these officers\nhad any other responsibility for, or interaction with, Clark after this incident. On this record, the\nconstitutional claims of deliberate indifference fail as a matter of law against these two defendants.\nSee Williams v.

With regard to the mental-illness\nclaim, many of the officers testified that they believed Clark needed psychological attention. See\nGilman Br. at 11 (Fox diagnosed Clark with psychosis); id. at 17 (Gilman was advised that “Clark\nneeded psychiatric treatment”); id. at 21 (Bayne thought that Clark had “mental health” needs); id.\nat 24 (VanderVlucht “thought Clark’s problems were psychological”); id. at 25 (Dowker “thought\n. . . Clark needed psychological or psychiatric intervention”); id. at 27 (Harvey “thought that Clark\n‘had some mental issues’”); id. at 29 (Whittaker “thought that Clark needed to be seen by a mental\nhealth professional”).\n         Despite these widely held beliefs, the record shows that Clark languished in his cell for five\ndays without the door being opened and apparently with the officers unable readily to see into his\ncell for part of this time. Even though prison rules required officers to go up the chain of command\nif they felt that a referral had not secured the requisite assistance for an inmate, these defendants pin\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394           Clark-Murphy v.

Page 9\n\n\nmuch of their defense on the fact that they (or others) had completed psychological-referral forms.\nSee, e.g., JA 2599 (Lauters: “I knew that healthcare was contacted, I left it at that.”). While this fact\nmay be relevant to whether the individual defendants recklessly disregarded a risk of harm to Clark\nor responded reasonably to it, the fact does not suffice to establish that the defendants are entitled\nto qualified immunity as a matter of law at this stage of the case given their repeated interactions\nwith Clark and repeated opportunities to assess the seriousness of the situation.\n        None of this, to be sure, establishes that these defendants either singly or as a group showed\ndeliberate indifference to Clark. For summary-judgment purposes, we hold only that these 11\ndefendants could have perceived a substantial risk of serious harm to Clark. Whether in fact they\nperceived, inferred or disregarded that risk is an issue for trial. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 842\n(“Whether a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk is a question of fact\nsubject to demonstration in the usual ways . . . , and a factfinder may conclude that a prison official\nknew of a substantial risk from the very fact that the risk was obvious.”); see also Comstock v.\nMcCrary, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775805\"><a href=\"/opinion/775805/carolyn-comstock-v-norris-mccrary-v-s-thyagarajan-and-david-howell/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 703 (6th Cir. 2001) (noting that it is “permissible for reviewing courts to\ninfer from circumstantial evidence that a prison official had the requisite knowledge”).\n        In contrast to these 11 defendants, Sergeant Becher and nurse Friedt worked just one 8-hour\nshift between Clark’s seizure on June 29 and his death on July 3 or July 4. While a prison employee\ndoubtlessly could exhibit deliberate indifference toward an inmate in the course of one shift, neither\nFriedt nor Becher had sufficient exposure to Clark to make out a triable issue of fact that any such\nwantonness occurred on their part.\n        Only one of Nurse Friedt’s shifts (an eight-hour shift on Sunday, June 30) involved Clark.\nFriedt became aware of Clark’s situation by way of a Roberta-R form, which mentioned “some type\nof seizure.” JA 2784. A Roberta-R form is used only “for psychiatric or mental conditions.” JA\n2778. As a nurse, Friedt was not expected to become involved with mental-health issues unless the\ninmate was being watched for self-harm, which was not the case here. She also knew that the\nofficers had not prepared a health-care contact sheet, a fact that was inconsistent with a medical\nemergency. Knowing that the hospital could have been called the night before if there had been “an\nimminent need for care,” JA 2778, Friedt, without more, fairly could have deduced that the situation\nwith Clark was under control. The officers on the scene had not contacted a hospital or a nurse; they\ninstead had sought psychiatric care; and 12 hours had passed since the original incident—all prior\nto her arrival. Quite possibly, on this record, Friedt reasonably could have done nothing more. But\nshe did more: She called the officer on duty in Clark’s cell block (Thelen) to determine if Clark\nneeded medical assistance. Officer Thelen informed Friedt, “All he’s on is custody watch [which\ndid not impose a responsibility on Friedt]. He does not need medical care.” JA 2780. When Harvey\ncalled later, he mentioned that Clark was having psychiatric difficulties. Since she was not qualified\nto help an inmate with psychiatric needs, she let Harvey know that the referral to the psychiatric\ndepartment had been completed. In contrast to Harvey, no allegation has been made that Friedt\nknew the psychiatric referral had failed to secure Clark the help he needed. No evidence indicates\nthat Harvey or anyone else told Friedt that a psychologist or psychiatrist needed to see Clark that\nday, and Clark-Murphy has offered no theory of liability or damages relating to the fact that Fox did\nnot see Clark until the next day. On these facts, it is doubtful that negligence could be proved, much\nless deliberate indifference.\n        Sergeant Becher was a relief sergeant who was filling in for another sergeant on July 1 and\nworked just one 8-hour shift during the six days at issue. While she learned firsthand during the\nshift that Clark needed psychiatric care (based on seeing him pace back and forth naked in his cell\nand based on hearing him offer to sell her candy canes), she responded appropriately to this\nobservation by asking whether a psychiatric referral (a Roberta-R) had been completed for Clark.\nShe was told that several Roberta-Rs had been completed for him. And of course earlier that day\nFox (the psychologist) had paid his first visit to Clark. On this record, Becher simply did not have\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394          Clark-Murphy v.

Nor does any evidence indicate that\nshe was aware that he repeatedly was not drinking water (or eating food). Later during the shift, she\nasked an officer how Clark was doing. The officer responded that he was doing “okay” but that he\nhad attempted to shove a pillow down his toilet. JA 210. In response, Becher asked if “they would\nhave to shut the water off and the officer told her no, they had already done that.” Id. To the extent\nthis evidence shows that Becher was aware that the water to Clark’s cell was turned off, it shows\nonly that it was turned off toward the end of her shift and solely in response to an incident that\ntemporarily would have justified shutting off the water. In the absence of other evidence that Becher\nwas aware that Clark was not drinking (or eating) or that the water was turned off in his cell for an\nextended period of time, Clark-Murphy has not tenably shown that Becher recklessly ignored\nClark’s need for water.\n        Given the brief exposures of these two defendants to Clark and given the resulting absence\nof evidence regarding their purposeful indifference to his health and safety needs, the claims against\nthese defendants must be dismissed as a matter of law.

The claimant need only\ndemonstrate a link between each defendant’s misconduct and Clark’s injury, which may include his\ndeath as well as the “pain and suffering,” JA 25, that preceded his death. See, e.g., Boretti v.\nWiscomb, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559529\"><a href=\"/opinion/559529/david-g-boretti-v-beverly-a-wiscomb-rn-wanda-m-baldwin-rn/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1150</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1154 (6th Cir. 1991) (holding that “physical pain and mental anguish\n[suffered] during the time he was denied [treatment] . . . . may constitute cruel and unusual\npunishment within the meaning of the Eighth Amendment”); Westlake v.

Not true. The complaint lists Whittaker\nas a defendant; it alleges that the defendants, including Whittaker, observed Clark’s deteriorating\ncondition and failed to seek treatment; and the summary-judgment evidence shows that a triable\nissue of fact exists over Whittaker’s alleged indifference.\n                                                  III.\n       For these reasons, we affirm the denial of qualified immunity as to 11 of the defendants\n(Gilman, Whittaker, Wise, Harvey, Lauters, Bayne, Dowker, Foreback, Stout, Vandervlucht and\nFox) but reverse as to 4 of them (Dyer, Wakefield, Becher and Friedt), and remand for further\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394               Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.

I\ndissent in part because I would affirm the denial of qualified immunity for JoAnn Friedt and Rina\nBecher for the following reasons.\n        The majority’s reliance on the brevity of Friedt’s one-shift-long involvement with Clark to\ndecide that Friedt was entitled to qualified immunity erroneously disregards other factors relevant\nto this inquiry, such as the Defendant’s position and expertise and the severity of distressing\nbehavior that she saw Clark display. Friedt’s awareness of Clark’s seizure, which was noted on the\nRoberta-R Form that Friedt received and read, carries enhanced significance because she is a\nregistered nurse who admitted at her deposition that seizures can be “life[-]threatening” and that she\ncould not assess whether the seizure was of medical concern without seeing Clark. Joint Appendix\nat 2782 (Friedt Dep. at 38). Although the majority further concludes that Friedt did not ignore a\nserious risk to Clark’s health because Officer Thelen told Friedt that Clark did not require medical\ncare, Friedt knew that Thelen did not have medical expertise, and given Friedt’s own training, Friedt\nshould have taken further action to assess Clark’s health. The majority’s conjecture     that “[q]uite\npossibly, on this record, Friedt reasonably could have done nothing more,”1 Majority Opinion\n(“Maj. Op.”) at 9, is flatly contradicted by the record. Friedt herself testified that when she gets a\ncall from a resident unit officer regarding a medical concern relating to a prisoner, as she did from\nSergeant Mike Harvey, she has three options: talking to the prisoner on the phone, seeing the\nprisoner on his unit, or having the prisoner come to the clinic. In this instance, Friedt chose none\nof these courses of conduct, and instead, opted to do nothing.\n        The majority attempts to absolve Friedt’s inaction by asserting that Friedt had no\nresponsibility to respond to a prisoner’s potentially life-threatening health risk because she was\nmade aware of this risk by prison paperwork that is ordinarily used for psychological rather than\nmedical health issues. This amounts to a rule that a prison’s medical-care personnel can turn a blind\neye to health-care concerns placed before them. This is precisely what the Eighth Amendment\ndisallows: “deliberate indifference” to “a substantial risk of serious harm” to a prisoner’s health.\nFarmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837 (1994). Friedt, a medical professional, ignored a fact that\nshe knew indicated a potential serious health risk — a seizure — that may have required immediate\nmedical care. Therefore, that a health-care contact sheet had not been prepared and that the hospital\nwas not contacted is irrelevant in the face of concrete facts that Clark might have been confronting\na serious health risk that required prompt medical attention.\n       Regardless of whether and when Psychologist Mark Fox or any other mental health\nprofessional saw Clark, because Friedt knew of Clark’s seizure, she knew that he may have required\nmedical attention.2 As in Comstock v. McCrary, the circumstances reveal that Friedt should have\n\n\n         1\n           The majority’s willingness to infer facts in favor of Defendant Friedt, a moving party, as evidenced by this\nstatement and the majority’s assumption that Friedt “could have deduced that the situation with Clark was under control,”\nMaj. Op. at 9, contravenes our obligation, in reviewing the grant of a motion for summary judgment, to “view all the\nfacts and the inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.” Cockrel v. Shelby County\nSch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775498\"><a href=\"/opinion/775498/donna-cockrel-v-shelby-county-school-district/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1036</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1048 (6th Cir. 2001).\n         2\n          The majority notes that the Plaintiff “has offered no theory of liability or damages relating to the fact that\n[Psychologist] Fox did not see Clark until the next day.” Maj. Op. at 9. This reasoning seems out of place given that\nthe majority does not require the Plaintiff to make such a robust showing of specific causation and damages regarding\nthe other Defendants in this case. In fact, the majority expressly criticizes that “defendants pin much of their defense\n\fNos. 05-1323/1394               Clark-Murphy v. Foreback, et al.                                               Page 13\n\n\ninvestigated Clark’s condition before determining that he did not require immediate care, and her\ndecision not to do so amounts to deliberate indifference. See Comstock v. McCrary, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775805\"><a href=\"/opinion/775805/carolyn-comstock-v-norris-mccrary-v-s-thyagarajan-and-david-howell/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n707-08 (6th Cir. 2001). Therefore, Friedt’s decision not to see Clark, particularly when she knew\nthat he would not be seen by someone from psychological services that day, smacks of reckless\ndisregard for the health risks he may have been facing.\n          The majority again relies too heavily on the extent of Becher’s contact with Clark to\ndetermine whether she ignored a significant health risk. Although Becher worked only one shift in\nthe time between Clark’s collapse and his death, she observed Clark “pacing back and forth naked\nand telling me he was selling candy canes.” Joint Appendix at 2107 (Becher Dep. at 20). One\nwould expect that this behavior is sufficiently bizarre to arouse great concern in anyone witnessing\nit. Moreover, although Becher testified at her deposition that she was unaware that there was a heat\nalert, that the water in Clark’s cell was off, and that Clark was experiencing a mental disturbance,\nother statements made during her deposition cast doubt on these self-serving assertions. Given that\na factfinder may determine that “‘a prison official had the requisite knowledge of a substantial risk\n. . . [by] inference from circumstantial evidence,’” including “‘from the very fact that the risk was\nobvious,’” Lemarbe v. Wisneski, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775014\"><a href=\"/opinion/775014/richard-lemarbe-v-jerome-j-wisneski-sharon-fairbanks-dennis-straub/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436 (6th Cir. 2001) (quoting Farmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">834</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 842 (1994)); see also Majority Op. at 9, Becher has not put forth sufficient evidence to\nshow that she was not aware of the health risks Clark faced, and thus she should not be dismissed\nfrom the case.\n        For the foregoing reasons, I would affirm the district court’s denial of qualified immunity\nto Friedt and Becher, and accordingly I dissent in part.\n\n\n\n\non the fact that they (or others) had completed psychological-referral forms” because “prison rules required officers to\ngo up the chain of command if they felt that a referral had not secured the requisite assistance for an inmate.” Id. at 9.\nIn any event, it does not require much speculation to conclude that had Friedt seen Clark, she would have gotten him\nproper treatment, and perhaps he would have survived or at least avoided some degree of suffering.\n\f</pre>",
