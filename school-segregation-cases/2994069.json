Doyle</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Defendant-Appellant.            )  Judge, Presiding.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>_________________________________________________________________</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     JUSTICE RATHJE delivered the opinion of the court:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Following a jury trial, the defendant, Tracy Taylor, was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>convicted of one count of aggravated criminal sexual assault and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was sentenced to a term of 30 years' imprisonment in the Department</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of Corrections.  The defendant appealed, and this court reversed</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>his conviction and remanded the cause for a new trial.  See People</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>v. Taylor, 244 Ill. App. 3d 460 (1993).  Following a second jury</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial, the defendant was again convicted of aggravated criminal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sexual assault and was sentenced to a term of 35 years'</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imprisonment.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant appeals raising the following issues:  whether</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the trial judge should have recused himself from all proceedings</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>which occurred after the jury began deliberations; and whether the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>increase in the defendant's sentence from 30 to 35 years'</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imprisonment was improper.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On October 11, 1994, following the defendant's second</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conviction, the trial court held a sentencing hearing.  The State</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>called several witnesses to testify in aggravation.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Susan Dahl testified that, on January 18, 1990, she was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>working as a clerk in a convenience store when the defendant robbed</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the store.  In the course of the robbery, the defendant slapped her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in the face and told her that he had a gun.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Cameron Forbes, employed by the Illinois Department of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Corrections in the records department, testified as to the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's penitentiary records for the time period between his</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>two trials in this cause.  Mr. Forbes explained that an inmate</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>disciplinary report is referred to as a \"ticket.\"  There are major</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>tickets which would be for something like assaultive behavior while</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a minor ticket would be for not reporting for school or being slow</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in locking up.  Minor tickets are sent to the program unit which is</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>limited to enforcing minor discipline.  Major tickets are sent to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the adjustment committee which has the latitude to dismiss the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>ticket or impose a proper punishment following a hearing.  A major</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>ticket would be any ticket where an inmate received a C grade</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>demotion, a segregation placement, or a loss of good-conduct</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>credits for the violation.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Mr. Forbes further testified that the records reflect that the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant received one major ticket in his first six months of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>incarceration and nine thereafter.  He also received 12 minor</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>tickets during his incarceration.  The records further reflected</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that the defendant lost good-time credits on two occasions. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>According to Forbes, of the major tickets the defendant received,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>it appeared that at least two were for assaultive behavior.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On cross-examination, Mr. Forbes testified that neither of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>two incidents of assaultive behavior were directed against a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>correctional officer.  He acknowledged that there was gang activity</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>at the Menard facility, to which the defendant had been transferred</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>from the Joliet facility, but denied that the gangs had more</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>control over the day-to-day activities of the inmates than the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>guards.  He further denied that fighting was very common at Menard</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>or Joliet.  Mr. Forbes acknowledged that the good-time credits that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the defendant lost as a result of those incidents were in fact</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>restored to him as of January 22, 1992.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Mr. Forbes further testified that other \"major\" tickets that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the defendant received were for giving extra meat to another inmate</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>while the defendant was on the serving line; failing to complete an</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>assigned detail; and being in a cell with another inmate where</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>music was being played too loud.  However, Mr. Forbes was unsure as</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to whether all these were included as major tickets in his total of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>nine for the defendant since in certain cases a minor punishment</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was imposed.  Mr. Forbes did agree that the defendant had only been</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>involved in two incidents of assaultive behavior since his</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>incarceration.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Mr. Forbes further testified that the defendant's records</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>showed no violations from November 1992 to November 1993 when he</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was returned to the Kane County jail to await his new trial.  In</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>addition, the records reflected that the defendant had received a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\"low risk\" status and had been recommended by the warden for</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>transfer to a less secure facility.  The transfer was denied solely</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>on the basis of the amount of time remaining to be served on the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's sentence.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On redirect examination, Mr. Forbes testified that, in one of </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the assault incidents, the defendant and two others jumped another</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>inmate and began to beat him up.  The defendant was also \"ticketed\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>for stealing syrup, which the inmates would use to make alcohol.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>On re-cross-examination, Mr. Forbes testified that no criminal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>charges were placed against the defendant while he was in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Department of Corrections.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The trial court then questioned Mr. Forbes as to why the 30</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>days of good-time credit that the defendant lost as a result of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>above assault incident were restored to him.  Mr. Forbes explained</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that, under Department of Corrections' procedures, after a certain</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>period of time has elapsed without similar conduct occurring, the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>good-time credit lost is restored to the inmate, unless the time</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was lost in conjunction with an escape in which case it is not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>restored.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Thomas Oatman testified that the victim and he were living</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>together at the time of the offense; they are now married.  He</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>described the impact that the offense had on his working life as</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>well as on the victim and their social life.  At the time that the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>cause was remanded for a second trial, the victim received eight</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>obscene telephone calls.  The calls were traced to the Department</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of Corrections facility at Danville.  Mr. Oatman denied knowing</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>anyone at the Danville facility or that he gave anyone at the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Danville facility his telephone number.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On cross-examination, Mr. Oatman acknowledged that he had a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>published telephone number.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defense then called Stacy Taylor, the defendant's brother,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and Marcia Green, the defendant's mother, to provide testimony in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>mitigation.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     In argument following the testimony, the State urged the trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>court to impose a longer sentence than had been originally imposed</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>on the defendant based upon his conduct while incarcerated in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Department of Corrections.  The defense responded that the original</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial judge had found that the defendant was not subject to an</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>extended-term sentence and instead had imposed the maximum</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>nonextended-term sentence of 30 years' imprisonment on the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant.  Therefore, under the resentencing statute, the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's new sentence could not exceed the original sentence. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The defense further argued that the incidents that the defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was involved in while he was incarcerated were for the most part</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>minor and occurred early in his incarceration.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     In pronouncing sentence, the trial judge stated that the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>offense in this cause was the most brutal of its type that he had</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>ever heard or seen.  He specifically found that, based upon the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>testimony and the evidence, the offense here was accompanied by</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>exceptionally brutal behavior and was indicative of wanton cruelty. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The trial judge further found no basis for reducing the original</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sentence of 30 years' imprisonment.  Citing the testimony regarding</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the defendant's conduct during his incarceration, the trial court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>found that he could impose a higher sentence than the original 30-</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>year sentence.  After considering the factors in aggravation and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>balancing them with the factors in mitigation, the trial court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imposed a sentence of 35 years' imprisonment in the Department of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Corrections.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On November 10, 1994, the defendant filed a motion to reduce</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>his sentence.  Inter alia, the motion alleged that the defendant's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>rights to due process were violated when the trial judge</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>(hereinafter Judge Doyle) engaged in conversation with the victim's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>family during jury deliberations at the defendant's second trial. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The motion further alleged that the violation was compounded by the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>fact that Thomas Oatman, one of the family members, subsequently</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>testified at the defendant's sentencing hearing.  The defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>also filed an addition to his motion for a new trial, which had</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>already been denied on October 11, 1994, alleging the same due</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>process violation.  The case was transferred to Judge Barry Puklin</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>for a hearing on those particular allegations.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On May 5, 1995, a hearing was conducted by Judge Puklin on the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>motion to reduce sentence and the addition to the motion for a new</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial, limited to the allegations surrounding Judge Doyle's alleged</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation with the victim's family.  Prior to the beginning of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the hearing, the parties stipulated that a conversation took place</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in the cafeteria of the Kane County judicial center, at which time</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Judge Doyle and members of the victim's family were present and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that the conversation was of some duration, not merely a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation in passing.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Don Zuelke, the assistant public defender representing the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant, testified that on June 15, 1994, after jury</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>deliberations began on the defendant's cause, he went into the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>cafeteria.  He proceeded to sit at a table with Bill Catching, a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>reporter with the Beacon News.  At the time, the cafeteria was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>open, and members of the general public were present.  After a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>while, Mr. Catching commented to him that Judge Doyle was sitting</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in another part of the cafeteria with the victim's family.  At that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>time, Mr. Zuelke looked over and observed Judge Doyle standing by</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a table where several of the victim's \"supporters\" (people who had</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>been presented during the trial) were seated and talking to these</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>people.  He described the conversation as very amicable, friendly. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Although he did not time it, he estimated that the conversation was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>at least 15 minutes in length.  Mr. Zuelke subsequently learned</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that one of the people at the table was the victim's husband when</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>he testified at the defendant's sentencing hearing.  He did not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>make an objection to Mr. Oatman testifying, hoping that Judge Doyle</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>would say something, but Judge Doyle did not.  After speaking with</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>appellate counsel,  Mr. Zuelke raised the issue in the motion to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>reduce sentence and the addition to the motion for a new trial. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Mr. Zuelke noted that Judge Doyle had increased the defendant's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>original sentence by five years.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On cross-examination, Mr. Zuelke acknowledged that Judge Doyle</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>had based the additional five years on the defendant's activities</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>since the time of his first conviction.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On redirect examination, Mr. Zuelke testified that he has</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>learned that Mr. Oatman is a Kane County employee working in data</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>processing. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Will Nelson testified that he is a friend of Tom Oatman's and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that his (Nelson's) wife is the victim's best friend.  He was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>present for the defendant's entire trial.  After the jury retired</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to deliberate, Tom Oatman, Karen, the victim's sister, and he went</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to the cafeteria.  While they were there, Judge Doyle came by and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>spoke to them.  Mr. Nelson had met Judge Doyle previously at a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>little league game.  Other than at the game, he had never spoken to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Judge Doyle.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Mr. Nelson testified further that Judge Doyle recognized him,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>said hello or something to that effect, and pulled up a chair,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sitting between the table at which Mr. Nelson was sitting and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>another table.  Judge Doyle primarily spoke to Mr. Nelson.  They</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>spoke about little league baseball, that Judge Doyle had previously</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>been a sheriff, and that the judge's wife was attending or had just</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>finished law school.  Mr. Nelson asked who won the arguments at his</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>house.  Later, Mr. Nelson asked about the number of trials in Kane</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>County, and Judge Doyle remarked that there were a lot of trials in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Kane County.  Mr. Nelson brought Mr. Oatman into the conversation</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>by telling Judge Doyle that Mr. Oatman would agree with the judge.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Mr. Nelson further testified that he did not introduce Mr.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Oatman to Judge Doyle nor did Mr. Oatman introduce himself to Judge</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Doyle.  The defendant's case was never discussed.  There was no</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>indication that Judge Doyle knew who Mr. Oatman was.  The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation lasted about 20 minutes.  It ended when someone</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>announced that the jury was back.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Following argument, Judge Puklin denied the motion to reduce</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sentence and the addition to the motion for a new trial, based upon</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the allegations as to Judge Doyle's conduct.  Following a hearing</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>before Judge Doyle on the remaining allegations of the motion to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>reduce sentence, Judge Doyle denied the motion, and this appeal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>followed. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant contends that Judge Doyle's conversation with</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>members of the victim's family created the appearance of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>impropriety and that the judge's failure to recuse himself from</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>further proceedings in the defendant's cause entitles the defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to a new trial or, in the alternative, to a new sentencing hearing</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>before a different judge.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     At the outset, the State contends that by failing to raise the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>issue at the time the jury returned its verdict or to object at the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>time Tom Oatman testified at the sentencing hearing the defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>has waived this issue for purposes of appeal.  People v. Enoch, 122</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Ill. 2d 176 (1988) (preservation of an issue for purposes of appeal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>requires both an objection at trial and a written post-trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>motion).  However, since this issue may impact on the sentence the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant received thus violating one of his fundamental rights, we</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>will consider the issue to determine if plain error was committed</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>here.  People v. Moncrief, 276 Ill. App. 3d 533, 535 (1995).</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     A judge must make every effort to avoid the appearance of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>impropriety during his activities that may reflect on his judicial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conduct.  People v. Dunigan, 96 Ill. App. 3d 799, 812 (1981). </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Private conversations concerning a case are impermissible, since a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant is unable to rebut information obtained from members of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the public and considered by the judge.  Dunigan, 96 Ill. App. 3d</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>at 812.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The facts in Dunigan are somewhat similar to the facts in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>present cause.  After the jury had reached a verdict in Dunigan's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>case, the trial judge, at the invitation of an assistant State's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Attorney, had stopped at a tavern.  The victims in the cause</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>stopped by the judge's table for a few moments, discussed</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>generalities, and then left.  The meeting was by chance, and the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>judge stated that he did not discuss Dunigan's sentence or the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>outcome of the cause with the victims.  The assistant State's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Attorney confirmed the judge's recollection of the conversation.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     In addressing Dunigan's argument that the judge's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\"socializing\" with the victims required him to recuse himself from</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the sentencing procedures, the reviewing court noted that there was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>no evidence that the judge considered or received any information</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>from the victims at their brief, unplanned encounter.  \"The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>question then becomes whether the trial judge was required to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>recuse himself by virtue of the meeting itself, in the absence of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>evidence that the case was discussed.\"  Dunigan, 96 Ill. App. 3d at</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>812.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The Dunigan court relied on the supreme court decision in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>People v. Hicks, 44 Ill. 2d 550 (1970).  In Hicks, our supreme</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>court held that a judge's conversation with an individual, who was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>allegedly a relative of the victim and who went to the judge's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>chambers of her own volition to obtain a front row seat in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>courtroom, did not supply cause for the judge's disqualification or</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>give rise to the probability of unfairness which might affect the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial.  The Hicks court stated:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     \"To say that any involuntary meeting or conversation, no</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     matter how trivial, gives rise to disqualification would</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     present too easy a weapon with which to harass the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     administration of criminal justice and to obtain a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     substitution of judges.\"  Hicks, 44 Ill. 2d at 557.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The Dunigan court agreed with Hicks and held that the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>involuntary meeting between the judge and the victims in that cause</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>did not, in and of itself, disqualify the judge from presiding at</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Dunigan's sentencing hearing.  The Dunigan court stated further as</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     \"Our review of the record reveals no malice directed toward</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     [Dunigan] by the trial judge as a result of his contact with</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     the [victims], and it is unlikely that this single event</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     resulted in such an increased level of emotional involvement</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     as to make prejudice likely and disqualification necessary.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Dunigan, 96 Ill. App. 3d at 813.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     In the cause before us, there was no evidence that the meeting</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>between Judge Doyle and the victim's family and supporters was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>anything but a chance encounter.  There is also no evidence that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>any details of the defendant's case were discussed during the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation, nor is there any evidence that this conversation</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>increased Judge Doyle's involvement with the case such that it</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>would influence him against the defendant.  Applying the analysis</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>set forth in Dunigan, we conclude that the defendant was not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>entitled to a new trial or a new sentencing hearing before a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>different judge.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant's reliance on People v. Bradshaw, 171 Ill. App.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>3d 971 (1988), is misplaced.  In Bradshaw, during the trial, a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>deputy sheriff, the mother of the victim, sent a note to the trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>judge, asking to see him.  Upon receiving the note, the trial judge</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>recessed the trial and met with the deputy sheriff in his chambers. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>According to the trial judge, after he ascertained what the deputy</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sheriff's relationship to the cause was, he terminated the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On appeal, the reviewing court held that the trial court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>should have recused himself from the cause following his ex parte</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation with the victim's mother.  The court noted that a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>deputy sheriff is an officer of the court and plays an integral</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>role in the administration of justice.  There was evidence that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>other persons witnessed the deputy sheriff pass the note to the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial judge who was presiding over a cause in which her daughter</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was the victim.  The witnesses also observed the trial judge enter</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>his chambers with the deputy sheriff.  Even if the conversation was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>terminated as soon as the trial court realized the relationship of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the deputy sheriff to the cause before him, the reviewing court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>concluded that the appearance of impropriety had already been</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>created.     </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Unlike the cause before us, in Bradshaw, the meeting was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>deliberately sought by the deputy sheriff.  It was witnessed by</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>persons in the courtroom who knew the deputy sheriff was related to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the victim and who observed her go into chambers with the trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>judge.  The meeting took place in the judge's chambers, thus</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conveying a secretive atmosphere to the meeting.  In contrast, in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the cause before us, the meeting was accidental and unplanned.  The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation took place in a public place.  The other participants</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in the conversation were private citizens.  Finally, with the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>exception of the assistant public defender, who might be expected</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to take a different view, there was no testimony from other</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>individuals present in the cafeteria at the time the conversation</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>took place suggesting that even the appearance of impropriety was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>created by Judge Doyle's conversation with the victim's family.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Even the assistant public defender did not raise the issue of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation until after he spoke with appellate counsel.  The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant suggests that the failure to raise the issue earlier</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>resulted from his counsel's reluctance to \"taint his relationship</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>with Judge Doyle in all future trials.\"   We are inclined to accord</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that argument very little weight since, if it were true, it would</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>mean that the thought of displeasing a trial judge carries more</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>weight than presenting effective arguments on behalf of one's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>client.  More importantly, however, the assistant public defender</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>did in fact raise the issue, as soon as he discovered it might be</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>an issue, and the presentation of the argument did result in what</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>we would generously describe as a lively discussion between Judge</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Doyle and counsel for the defendant and the State.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant's reliance on People v. Mote, 255 Ill. App. 3d</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>757 (1994), is also misplaced.  In that cause, the trial judge,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>with Mote's permission, conferred with the victims to determine</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>whether they would approve of Mote being sentenced to a term of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>probation rather than four years' incarceration.  In determining</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that Mote required a new sentencing hearing, the reviewing court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>reaffirmed an earlier holding that private conversations between a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>judge and members of the general public to assist the court in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>determining the sentence to be imposed is reversible error.  Mote,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>255 Ill. App. 3d at 760.  Again, in the cause before us, there is</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>no evidence that the conversation in question involved any aspect</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of the defendant's cause.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     A judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>impropriety in all of the judge's activities.  155 Ill. 2d R. 62. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>This rule implies that it is the judge who must initiate the course</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of conduct which creates a disfavorable public impression.  People</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>v. Musso, 227 Ill. App. 3d 514, 518 (1992).  Although it appears</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>from Will Nelson's testimony that Judge Doyle initiated the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation in this cause, nevertheless, the evidence in this</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>cause fails to establish that the conversation in this cause</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\"created a disfavorable public impression.\"  No appearance of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>impropriety was created by Judge Doyle's conduct in this cause.  We</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conclude, therefore, that Judge Puklin did not err in denying the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's motion for a new sentencing hearing and his motion for</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a new trial based on additional matters based upon the conversation</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>between Judge Doyle and the victim's family.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant then contends that the increase in his sentence</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>from 30 years' to 35 years' imprisonment was improper.  The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault, a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Class X felony.  See 720 ILCS 5/12--14 (West 1994).  The maximum</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>nonextended term of imprisonment for a Class X felony is 30 years'</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imprisonment.  See 730 ILCS 5/5--8--1(a)(3) (West 1994).  The range</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>for an extended-term sentence for a Class X felony is between 30</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and 60 years' imprisonment.  See 730 ILCS 5/5--8--2(a)(2) (West</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>1994).  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant's original sentence was 30 years' imprisonment,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the maximum nonextended term for the offense of aggravated criminal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sexual assault.  The 35-year sentence imposed by Judge Doyle</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>reflected an additional five years based upon the defendant's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conduct while he was incarcerated between his first and second</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trials.  Judge Doyle relied on section 5--5--4 of the Unified Code</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5--5--4 (West 1994), which provides as</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>          \"Where a conviction or sentence has been set aside on</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     direct review or on collateral attack, the court shall not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     impose a new sentence for the same offense or for a different</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     offense based on the same conduct which is more severe than</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     the prior sentence less the portion of the prior sentence</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     previously satisfied unless the more severe sentence is based</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     upon conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     original sentencing.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant seeks to distinguish People v. Rivera, 166 Ill.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>2d 279 (1995).  In that cause our supreme court held that the trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>court could properly increase Rivera's original sentence of 60</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>years' imprisonment for first degree murder to 80 years'</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imprisonment upon his retrial and conviction of the same offense</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>where Rivera had been convicted of unlawful use of a weapon in a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>penal institution.  Rivera, 166 Ill. 2d at 294.  The defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>argues that, unlike Rivera, he was never charged with or convicted</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of a crime while incarcerated.  The defendant further argues that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>only two of the incidents involved assaultive behavior; that Mr.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Forbes could not provide any details as to one of those incidents;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and that the defendant's good-time credits, lost as a result of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>those two incidents, were, in fact, restored to the defendant. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Finally, the defendant points out that the majority of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\"tickets\" he received were for conduct not criminal in nature and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that he received them early in his incarceration.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Section 5--5--4 permits a trial court to increase a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's sentence based upon conduct occurring after the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>original sentence.  Thus the trial court is not limited to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>considering only criminal convictions or only conduct that rises to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the level of a criminal offense.  In Rivera, our supreme court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>stated:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     \"[The United States Supreme] Court in [North Carolina v.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Pearce, 395 U.S. 711, 23 L. Ed. 2d 656, 89 S. Ct. 2072 (1969)]</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     reasoned that: 'A trial judge is not constitutionally</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     precluded, in other words, from imposing a new sentence,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     whether greater or less than the original sentence, in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     light of events subsequent to the first trial that may have</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     thrown new light upon the defendant's \"life, health, habits,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     conduct, and mental and moral propensities.\" ' \"  Rivera, 166</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Ill. 2d at 294.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>An increased sentence after retrial may be proper if the court is</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>able to point to specific conduct on the part of defendants</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>occurring subsequent to their original sentencing, which warrants</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a heavier sentence.  Rivera, 166 Ill. 2d at 294-95; People v. Baze,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>43 Ill. 2d 298, 303 (1969).  The Rivera court noted that the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>legislature incorporated the Pearce and Baze decisions in its</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>enactment of section 5--5--4.  Rivera, 166 Ill. 2d at 295.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     It is clear that, in imposing an increased sentence on the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant, the trial court relied on the testimony of Mr. Forbes</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and the defendant's record of conduct while in the Department of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Corrections.  It is also clear that the trial court properly relied</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>on evidence showing, at the least, the defendant's unwillingness to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>follow the rules of the institution he was confined to and, at the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>worst, a propensity to violence.  The fact that the defendant later</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>did learn to follow the rules is commendable, but does not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>eliminate his earlier violations from consideration by the trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>court.  We note also that, for his conviction of criminal conduct</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>while incarcerated, Rivera received an additional 20 years'</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imprisonment while the defendant in this cause received only an</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>additional 5 years, even though at least one of his \"tickets\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>involved an attack on another inmate.   </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     We conclude that the trial court properly increased the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's sentence from 30 to 35 years' imprisonment based upon</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>his conduct following his original sentencing,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     In summary, we conclude that the defendant is not entitled to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a new trial or a new sentencing hearing.  We further determine that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the trial court properly increased the defendant's sentence to 35</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>years' imprisonment.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The judgment of the circuit court of Kane County is affirmed. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Affirmed.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     GEIGER, P.J., and INGLIS, J., concur.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span></span>\n</p>\n\n</div>",

Taylor, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">460</span></span> (1993).  Following a second jury</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial, the defendant was again convicted of aggravated criminal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sexual assault and was sentenced to a term of 35 years'</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imprisonment.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant appeals raising the following issues:  whether</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the trial judge should have recused himself from all proceedings</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>which occurred after the jury began deliberations; and whether the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>increase in the defendant's sentence from 30 to 35 years'</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imprisonment was improper.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On October 11, 1994, following the defendant's second</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conviction, the trial court held a sentencing hearing.  The State</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>called several witnesses to testify in aggravation.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Susan Dahl testified that, on January 18, 1990, she was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>working as a clerk in a convenience store when the defendant robbed</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the store.  In the course of the robbery, the defendant slapped her</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in the face and told her that he had a gun.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Cameron Forbes, employed by the Illinois Department of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Corrections in the records department, testified as to the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's penitentiary records for the time period between his</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>two trials in this cause.  Mr. Forbes explained that an inmate</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>disciplinary report is referred to as a \"ticket.\"  There are major</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>tickets which would be for something like assaultive behavior while</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a minor ticket would be for not reporting for school or being slow</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in locking up.  Minor tickets are sent to the program unit which is</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>limited to enforcing minor discipline.  Major tickets are sent to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the adjustment committee which has the latitude to dismiss the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>ticket or impose a proper punishment following a hearing.  A major</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>ticket would be any ticket where an inmate received a C grade</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>demotion, a segregation placement, or a loss of good-conduct</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>credits for the violation.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Mr. Forbes further testified that the records reflect that the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant received one major ticket in his first six months of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>incarceration and nine thereafter.  He also received 12 minor</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>tickets during his incarceration.  The records further reflected</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that the defendant lost good-time credits on two occasions. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>According to Forbes, of the major tickets the defendant received,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>it appeared that at least two were for assaultive behavior.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On cross-examination, Mr. Forbes testified that neither of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>two incidents of assaultive behavior were directed against a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>correctional officer.  He acknowledged that there was gang activity</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>at the Menard facility, to which the defendant had been transferred</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>from the Joliet facility, but denied that the gangs had more</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>control over the day-to-day activities of the inmates than the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>guards.  He further denied that fighting was very common at Menard</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>or Joliet.  Mr. Forbes acknowledged that the good-time credits that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the defendant lost as a result of those incidents were in fact</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>restored to him as of January 22, 1992.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Mr. Forbes further testified that other \"major\" tickets that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the defendant received were for giving extra meat to another inmate</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>while the defendant was on the serving line; failing to complete an</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>assigned detail; and being in a cell with another inmate where</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>music was being played too loud.  However, Mr. Forbes was unsure as</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to whether all these were included as major tickets in his total of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>nine for the defendant since in certain cases a minor punishment</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was imposed.  Mr. Forbes did agree that the defendant had only been</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>involved in two incidents of assaultive behavior since his</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>incarceration.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Mr. Forbes further testified that the defendant's records</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>showed no violations from November 1992 to November 1993 when he</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was returned to the Kane County jail to await his new trial.  In</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>addition, the records reflected that the defendant had received a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\"low risk\" status and had been recommended by the warden for</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>transfer to a less secure facility.  The transfer was denied solely</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>on the basis of the amount of time remaining to be served on the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's sentence.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On redirect examination, Mr. Forbes testified that, in one of </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the assault incidents, the defendant and two others jumped another</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>inmate and began to beat him up.  The defendant was also \"ticketed\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>for stealing syrup, which the inmates would use to make alcohol.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>On re-cross-examination, Mr. Forbes testified that no criminal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>charges were placed against the defendant while he was in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Department of Corrections.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The trial court then questioned Mr. Forbes as to why the 30</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>days of good-time credit that the defendant lost as a result of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>above assault incident were restored to him.  Mr. Forbes explained</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that, under Department of Corrections' procedures, after a certain</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>period of time has elapsed without similar conduct occurring, the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>good-time credit lost is restored to the inmate, unless the time</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was lost in conjunction with an escape in which case it is not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>restored.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Thomas Oatman testified that the victim and he were living</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>together at the time of the offense; they are now married.  He</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>described the impact that the offense had on his working life as</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>well as on the victim and their social life.  At the time that the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>cause was remanded for a second trial, the victim received eight</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>obscene telephone calls.  The calls were traced to the Department</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of Corrections facility at Danville.  Mr. Oatman denied knowing</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>anyone at the Danville facility or that he gave anyone at the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Danville facility his telephone number.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On cross-examination, Mr. Oatman acknowledged that he had a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>published telephone number.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defense then called Stacy Taylor, the defendant's brother,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and Marcia Green, the defendant's mother, to provide testimony in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>mitigation.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     In argument following the testimony, the State urged the trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>court to impose a longer sentence than had been originally imposed</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>on the defendant based upon his conduct while incarcerated in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Department of Corrections.  The defense responded that the original</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial judge had found that the defendant was not subject to an</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>extended-term sentence and instead had imposed the maximum</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>nonextended-term sentence of 30 years' imprisonment on the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant.  Therefore, under the resentencing statute, the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's new sentence could not exceed the original sentence. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The defense further argued that the incidents that the defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was involved in while he was incarcerated were for the most part</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>minor and occurred early in his incarceration.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     In pronouncing sentence, the trial judge stated that the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>offense in this cause was the most brutal of its type that he had</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>ever heard or seen.  He specifically found that, based upon the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>testimony and the evidence, the offense here was accompanied by</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>exceptionally brutal behavior and was indicative of wanton cruelty. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The trial judge further found no basis for reducing the original</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sentence of 30 years' imprisonment.  Citing the testimony regarding</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the defendant's conduct during his incarceration, the trial court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>found that he could impose a higher sentence than the original 30-</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>year sentence.  After considering the factors in aggravation and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>balancing them with the factors in mitigation, the trial court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imposed a sentence of 35 years' imprisonment in the Department of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Corrections.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On November 10, 1994, the defendant filed a motion to reduce</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>his sentence.  Inter alia, the motion alleged that the defendant's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>rights to due process were violated when the trial judge</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>(hereinafter Judge Doyle) engaged in conversation with the victim's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>family during jury deliberations at the defendant's second trial. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>The motion further alleged that the violation was compounded by the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>fact that Thomas Oatman, one of the family members, subsequently</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>testified at the defendant's sentencing hearing.  The defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>also filed an addition to his motion for a new trial, which had</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>already been denied on October 11, 1994, alleging the same due</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>process violation.  The case was transferred to Judge Barry Puklin</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>for a hearing on those particular allegations.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On May 5, 1995, a hearing was conducted by Judge Puklin on the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>motion to reduce sentence and the addition to the motion for a new</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial, limited to the allegations surrounding Judge Doyle's alleged</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation with the victim's family.  Prior to the beginning of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the hearing, the parties stipulated that a conversation took place</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in the cafeteria of the Kane County judicial center, at which time</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Judge Doyle and members of the victim's family were present and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that the conversation was of some duration, not merely a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation in passing.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Don Zuelke, the assistant public defender representing the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant, testified that on June 15, 1994, after jury</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>deliberations began on the defendant's cause, he went into the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>cafeteria.  He proceeded to sit at a table with Bill Catching, a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>reporter with the Beacon News.  At the time, the cafeteria was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>open, and members of the general public were present.  After a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>while, Mr. Catching commented to him that Judge Doyle was sitting</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in another part of the cafeteria with the victim's family.  At that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>time, Mr. Zuelke looked over and observed Judge Doyle standing by</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a table where several of the victim's \"supporters\" (people who had</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>been presented during the trial) were seated and talking to these</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>people.  He described the conversation as very amicable, friendly. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Although he did not time it, he estimated that the conversation was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>at least 15 minutes in length.  Mr. Zuelke subsequently learned</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that one of the people at the table was the victim's husband when</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>he testified at the defendant's sentencing hearing.  He did not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>make an objection to Mr. Oatman testifying, hoping that Judge Doyle</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>would say something, but Judge Doyle did not.  After speaking with</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>appellate counsel,  Mr. Zuelke raised the issue in the motion to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>reduce sentence and the addition to the motion for a new trial. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Mr. Zuelke noted that Judge Doyle had increased the defendant's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>original sentence by five years.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On cross-examination, Mr. Zuelke acknowledged that Judge Doyle</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>had based the additional five years on the defendant's activities</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>since the time of his first conviction.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On redirect examination, Mr. Zuelke testified that he has</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>learned that Mr. Oatman is a Kane County employee working in data</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>processing. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Will Nelson testified that he is a friend of Tom Oatman's and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that his (Nelson's) wife is the victim's best friend.  He was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>present for the defendant's entire trial.  After the jury retired</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to deliberate, Tom Oatman, Karen, the victim's sister, and he went</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to the cafeteria.  While they were there, Judge Doyle came by and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>spoke to them.  Mr. Nelson had met Judge Doyle previously at a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>little league game.  Other than at the game, he had never spoken to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Judge Doyle.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Mr. Nelson testified further that Judge Doyle recognized him,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>said hello or something to that effect, and pulled up a chair,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sitting between the table at which Mr. Nelson was sitting and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>another table.  Judge Doyle primarily spoke to Mr. Nelson.  They</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>spoke about little league baseball, that Judge Doyle had previously</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>been a sheriff, and that the judge's wife was attending or had just</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>finished law school.  Mr. Nelson asked who won the arguments at his</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>house.  Later, Mr. Nelson asked about the number of trials in Kane</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>County, and Judge Doyle remarked that there were a lot of trials in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Kane County.  Mr. Nelson brought Mr. Oatman into the conversation</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>by telling Judge Doyle that Mr. Oatman would agree with the judge.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Mr. Nelson further testified that he did not introduce Mr.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Oatman to Judge Doyle nor did Mr. Oatman introduce himself to Judge</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Doyle.  The defendant's case was never discussed.  There was no</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>indication that Judge Doyle knew who Mr. Oatman was.  The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation lasted about 20 minutes.  It ended when someone</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>announced that the jury was back.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Following argument, Judge Puklin denied the motion to reduce</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sentence and the addition to the motion for a new trial, based upon</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the allegations as to Judge Doyle's conduct.  Following a hearing</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>before Judge Doyle on the remaining allegations of the motion to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>reduce sentence, Judge Doyle denied the motion, and this appeal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>followed. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant contends that Judge Doyle's conversation with</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>members of the victim's family created the appearance of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>impropriety and that the judge's failure to recuse himself from</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>further proceedings in the defendant's cause entitles the defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to a new trial or, in the alternative, to a new sentencing hearing</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>before a different judge.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     At the outset, the State contends that by failing to raise the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>issue at the time the jury returned its verdict or to object at the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>time Tom Oatman testified at the sentencing hearing the defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>has waived this issue for purposes of appeal.  People v. Enoch, 122</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Ill. 2d 176 (1988) (preservation of an issue for purposes of appeal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>requires both an objection at trial and a written post-trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>motion).  However, since this issue may impact on the sentence the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant received thus violating one of his fundamental rights, we</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>will consider the issue to determine if plain error was committed</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>here.  People v. Moncrief, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></span>, 535 (1995).</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     A judge must make every effort to avoid the appearance of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>impropriety during his activities that may reflect on his judicial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conduct.  People v. Dunigan, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2230450\"><a href=\"/opinion/2230450/people-v-dunigan/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span>, 812 (1981). </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Private conversations concerning a case are impermissible, since a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant is unable to rebut information obtained from members of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the public and considered by the judge.  Dunigan, 96 Ill. App. 3d</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>at 812.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The facts in Dunigan are somewhat similar to the facts in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>present cause.  After the jury had reached a verdict in Dunigan's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>case, the trial judge, at the invitation of an assistant State's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Attorney, had stopped at a tavern.  The victims in the cause</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>stopped by the judge's table for a few moments, discussed</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>generalities, and then left.  The meeting was by chance, and the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>judge stated that he did not discuss Dunigan's sentence or the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>outcome of the cause with the victims.  The assistant State's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Attorney confirmed the judge's recollection of the conversation.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     In addressing Dunigan's argument that the judge's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\"socializing\" with the victims required him to recuse himself from</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the sentencing procedures, the reviewing court noted that there was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>no evidence that the judge considered or received any information</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>from the victims at their brief, unplanned encounter.  \"The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>question then becomes whether the trial judge was required to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>recuse himself by virtue of the meeting itself, in the absence of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>evidence that the case was discussed.\"  Dunigan, 96 Ill. App. 3d at</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>812.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The Dunigan court relied on the supreme court decision in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>People v. Hicks, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2078142\"><a href=\"/opinion/2078142/the-people-v-hicks/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">550</span></a></span> (1970).  In Hicks, our supreme</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>court held that a judge's conversation with an individual, who was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>allegedly a relative of the victim and who went to the judge's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>chambers of her own volition to obtain a front row seat in the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>courtroom, did not supply cause for the judge's disqualification or</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>give rise to the probability of unfairness which might affect the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial.  The Hicks court stated:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     \"To say that any involuntary meeting or conversation, no</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     matter how trivial, gives rise to disqualification would</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     present too easy a weapon with which to harass the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     administration of criminal justice and to obtain a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     substitution of judges.\"  Hicks, 44 Ill. 2d at 557.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The Dunigan court agreed with Hicks and held that the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>involuntary meeting between the judge and the victims in that cause</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>did not, in and of itself, disqualify the judge from presiding at</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Dunigan's sentencing hearing.  The Dunigan court stated further as</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     \"Our review of the record reveals no malice directed toward</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     [Dunigan] by the trial judge as a result of his contact with</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     the [victims], and it is unlikely that this single event</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     resulted in such an increased level of emotional involvement</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     as to make prejudice likely and disqualification necessary.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Dunigan, 96 Ill. App. 3d at 813.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     In the cause before us, there was no evidence that the meeting</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>between Judge Doyle and the victim's family and supporters was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>anything but a chance encounter.  There is also no evidence that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>any details of the defendant's case were discussed during the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation, nor is there any evidence that this conversation</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>increased Judge Doyle's involvement with the case such that it</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>would influence him against the defendant.  Applying the analysis</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>set forth in Dunigan, we conclude that the defendant was not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>entitled to a new trial or a new sentencing hearing before a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>different judge.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant's reliance on People v. Bradshaw, 171 Ill. App.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>3d 971 (1988), is misplaced.  In Bradshaw, during the trial, a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>deputy sheriff, the mother of the victim, sent a note to the trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>judge, asking to see him.  Upon receiving the note, the trial judge</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>recessed the trial and met with the deputy sheriff in his chambers. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>According to the trial judge, after he ascertained what the deputy</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sheriff's relationship to the cause was, he terminated the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     On appeal, the reviewing court held that the trial court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>should have recused himself from the cause following his ex parte</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation with the victim's mother.  The court noted that a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>deputy sheriff is an officer of the court and plays an integral</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>role in the administration of justice.  There was evidence that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>other persons witnessed the deputy sheriff pass the note to the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trial judge who was presiding over a cause in which her daughter</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>was the victim.  The witnesses also observed the trial judge enter</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>his chambers with the deputy sheriff.  Even if the conversation was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>terminated as soon as the trial court realized the relationship of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the deputy sheriff to the cause before him, the reviewing court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>concluded that the appearance of impropriety had already been</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>created.     </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Unlike the cause before us, in Bradshaw, the meeting was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>deliberately sought by the deputy sheriff.  It was witnessed by</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>persons in the courtroom who knew the deputy sheriff was related to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the victim and who observed her go into chambers with the trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>judge.  The meeting took place in the judge's chambers, thus</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conveying a secretive atmosphere to the meeting.  In contrast, in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the cause before us, the meeting was accidental and unplanned.  The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation took place in a public place.  The other participants</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>in the conversation were private citizens.  Finally, with the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>exception of the assistant public defender, who might be expected</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>to take a different view, there was no testimony from other</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>individuals present in the cafeteria at the time the conversation</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>took place suggesting that even the appearance of impropriety was</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>created by Judge Doyle's conversation with the victim's family.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Even the assistant public defender did not raise the issue of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation until after he spoke with appellate counsel.  The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant suggests that the failure to raise the issue earlier</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>resulted from his counsel's reluctance to \"taint his relationship</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>with Judge Doyle in all future trials.\"   We are inclined to accord</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that argument very little weight since, if it were true, it would</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>mean that the thought of displeasing a trial judge carries more</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>weight than presenting effective arguments on behalf of one's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>client.  More importantly, however, the assistant public defender</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>did in fact raise the issue, as soon as he discovered it might be</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>an issue, and the presentation of the argument did result in what</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>we would generously describe as a lively discussion between Judge</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Doyle and counsel for the defendant and the State.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant's reliance on People v. Mote, 255 Ill. App. 3d</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>757 (1994), is also misplaced.  In that cause, the trial judge,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>with Mote's permission, conferred with the victims to determine</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>whether they would approve of Mote being sentenced to a term of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>probation rather than four years' incarceration.  In determining</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that Mote required a new sentencing hearing, the reviewing court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>reaffirmed an earlier holding that private conversations between a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>judge and members of the general public to assist the court in</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>determining the sentence to be imposed is reversible error.  Mote,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>255 Ill. App. 3d at 760.  Again, in the cause before us, there is</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>no evidence that the conversation in question involved any aspect</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of the defendant's cause.  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     A judge should avoid impropriety and the appearance of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>impropriety in all of the judge's activities.  155 Ill. 2d R. 62. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>This rule implies that it is the judge who must initiate the course</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of conduct which creates a disfavorable public impression.  People</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>v.

App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></span>, 518 (1992).  Although it appears</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>from Will Nelson's testimony that Judge Doyle initiated the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conversation in this cause, nevertheless, the evidence in this</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>cause fails to establish that the conversation in this cause</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\"created a disfavorable public impression.\"  No appearance of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>impropriety was created by Judge Doyle's conduct in this cause.  We</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conclude, therefore, that Judge Puklin did not err in denying the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's motion for a new sentencing hearing and his motion for</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>a new trial based on additional matters based upon the conversation</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>between Judge Doyle and the victim's family.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant then contends that the increase in his sentence</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>from 30 years' to 35 years' imprisonment was improper.  The</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant was convicted of aggravated criminal sexual assault, a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Class X felony.  See 720 ILCS 5/12--14 (West 1994).  The maximum</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>nonextended term of imprisonment for a Class X felony is 30 years'</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imprisonment.  See 730 ILCS 5/5--8--1(a)(3) (West 1994).  The range</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>for an extended-term sentence for a Class X felony is between 30</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and 60 years' imprisonment.  See 730 ILCS 5/5--8--2(a)(2) (West</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>1994).  </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant's original sentence was 30 years' imprisonment,</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the maximum nonextended term for the offense of aggravated criminal</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>sexual assault.  The 35-year sentence imposed by Judge Doyle</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>reflected an additional five years based upon the defendant's</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>conduct while he was incarcerated between his first and second</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>trials.  Judge Doyle relied on section 5--5--4 of the Unified Code</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5--5--4 (West 1994), which provides as</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>follows:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>          \"Where a conviction or sentence has been set aside on</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     direct review or on collateral attack, the court shall not</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     impose a new sentence for the same offense or for a different</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     offense based on the same conduct which is more severe than</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     the prior sentence less the portion of the prior sentence</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     previously satisfied unless the more severe sentence is based</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     upon conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     original sentencing.\"</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     The defendant seeks to distinguish People v. Rivera, 166 Ill.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>2d 279 (1995).  In that cause our supreme court held that the trial</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>court could properly increase Rivera's original sentence of 60</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>years' imprisonment for first degree murder to 80 years'</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>imprisonment upon his retrial and conviction of the same offense</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>where Rivera had been convicted of unlawful use of a weapon in a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>penal institution.  Rivera, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span> at 294.  The defendant</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>argues that, unlike Rivera, he was never charged with or convicted</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>of a crime while incarcerated.  The defendant further argues that</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>only two of the incidents involved assaultive behavior; that Mr.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Forbes could not provide any details as to one of those incidents;</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>and that the defendant's good-time credits, lost as a result of</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>those two incidents, were, in fact, restored to the defendant. </span>\n</p>\n<p><span>Finally, the defendant points out that the majority of the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>\"tickets\" he received were for conduct not criminal in nature and</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>that he received them early in his incarceration.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Section 5--5--4 permits a trial court to increase a</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>defendant's sentence based upon conduct occurring after the</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>original sentence.  Thus the trial court is not limited to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>considering only criminal convictions or only conduct that rises to</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>the level of a criminal offense.  In Rivera, our supreme court</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>stated:</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     \"[The United States Supreme] Court in [North Carolina v.</span>\n</p>\n<p><span>     Pearce, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107978\"><a href=\"/opinion/107978/north-carolina-v-pearce/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107978\"><a href=\"/opinion/107978/north-carolina-v-pearce/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.
