We're here on Daniel Warren's Plea To The\n\n 6   Jurisdiction.\n\n 7                   MS. CANTRELL:    That is correct.   Are we\n\n 8   ready to proceed?\n\n 9                   THE COURT:    Yes, we are.\n\n10             DANIEL WARREN'S PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n\n11                    ARGUMENT BY MS. CANTRELL:\n\n12                   MS. CANTRELL:    Well hopefully this will be\n\n13   the easiest of the three Weiner Trust cases.\n\n14                   This case involves a nonsuit at a time\n\n15   where there were no outstanding claims of any kind.\n\n16                   Daniel had sued Andy Weiner, and Katherine\n\n17   Warren was a Respondent in that.      He nonsuited Katherine\n\n18   Warren.    So, she was out.\n\n19                   Andy Weiner had affirmative defenses but\n\n20   no counter-claims against Daniel.\n\n21                   Andy Weiner had cross-claims against\n\n22   Katherine but not in Daniel's case.      They were all in\n\n23   the case that David filed.      And so at the moment in time\n\n24   that he nonsuited, and at the time he was dismissed,\n\n25   under Greenberg versus Brookshire, the case was over.\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G. LOPEZ, CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER\n\f                                                                    5\n\n\n 1   All the controversies were settled; all the cllaims were\n\n 2   gone and the parties were gone.\n\n 3                  I would like to go ahead and irtroduce as\n\n 4   Exhibit 1, the date order so that there's no question\n\n 5   about that just to make sure.      What I have in Exhibit 1\n\n 6   for you, Sarah,   is the Daniel's nonsuit of his entire\n\n 7   case against Andy Weiner.      And I have this Ccurt's order\n\n 8   granting his nonsuit and dismissal.       His nonsuit was\n\n 9   March lOth; the dismissal was March 16th; anc the\n\n10   counter and cross-petition was March 24th.\n\n11                  MS. PACHECO:     My only request, Your Honor,\n\n12   is if it is three distinct documents,      if we can enter\n\n13   those as three distinct exhibits because I'm quite\n\n14   confident where Ms. Cantrell would go next ar.d that\n\n15   would be the appellate record.      I always fine it's\n\n16   easier to refer to each document separately in the\n\n17   record if that's okay.\n\n18                  MS. CANTRELL:     Okay.   That's fine.\n\n19                  We'll mark those Exhibit 1 for the notice\n\n20   of nonsuit.   Exhibit 2 for the dismissal.      Ar.d Exhibit 3\n\n21   for the counter and cross-petition.\n\n22                  THE COURT:     Exhibit 1 which is\n\n23   Petitioner's Notice of Nonsuit Against Andy Weiner is\n\n24   admitted as Exhibit 1, as Plaintiff's Exhibit 1.         And\n\n25   the Order Granting Petitioner's Nonsuit and Dismissal,\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

Jnd Andy\n\n 2   Weiner's Counter and Cross-Petition is admitted as\n\n 3   Plaintiff's Exhibit 3.\n\n 4                   MS. CANTRELL:     I would also   li~e   to admit\n\n 5   Exhibit 4 which is Andy Weiner's Second Amenced\n\n 6   Cross-Claims.   And one of the footnotes in tte response\n\n 7   that,   I guess, Ms. Beduze or Ms. Pacheco filed last\n\n 8   night about 5:00, said that it was administrative error\n\n 9   that this cross-claim got left off of the liEt of\n\n10   documents that were transferred to Daniel's case.           And\n\n11   so, I would like to admit Exhibit 4 as the Second\n\n12   Amended Cross-Claims to show, number one,        that it was in\n\n13   David's case only.\n\n14                   MS. PACHECO:     I have no objection.\n\n15                   MS. CANTRELL:     Okay.\n\n16                   THE COURT:     Okay.   Andy Weiner's Second\n\n17   Amended Cross-Claims Against Katherine Warren Formerly\n\n18   Known As Katherine Weiner is admitted as Plaintiff's\n\n19   Exhibit 4.\n\n20                   MS. CANTRELL:     And because I think there\n\n21   might be a dispute over whether that -- those\n\n22   counter-claims or those cross-claims apply in Daniel's\n\n23   case,   I would like to also admit Exhibit 5 which is this\n\n24   Court's order and the list of documents that were moved\n\n25   over in the motion to sever in the agreed order -- or\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

PACHECO:     No objection.\n\n 5                  THE COURT:     Okay.   The Amended Order On\n\n 6   The Motion To Sever is admitted as Plaintiff's Exhibit\n\n 7   5.\n\n 8                  MS. CANTRELL:     And the only otter one that\n\n 9   I would like to admit at this time is Exhibit 6 which is\n\n10   the email chain that led up to that motion      OI   that order\n\n11   to sever in that itemized list of documents tecause it\n\n12   took us 10 days of negotiations to get that list pulled\n\n13   together.   It started with a draft of a, of a list that\n\n14   Ms. Beduze put together, and it's in substantial\n\n15   identical form as the one that was actually      ~igned.

PACHECO:     I'm going to object to a\n\n 3   series of emails between Counsel and your court staff\n\n 4   that are basically going back and forth and aren't\n\n 5   complete.     It's hearsay, it's inappropriate, and this\n\n 6   doesn't constitute anything but the efforts of lawyers\n\n 7   trying to do the right thing.      The document speaks for\n\n 8   itself.\n\n 9                   MS.

PACHECO:    We've already placed in the\n\n13   record what we placed in the record, Your Honor.       The\n\n14   record speaks for itself.\n\n15                    MS. CANTRELL:    The record is conflicting,\n\n16   then, because the response says that they are before\n\n17   this court, and I believe that the record shows that\n\n18   they're not.\n\n19                    MS. PACHECO:    The Court's order speaks for\n\n20   itself.     And the Court's order specifically says that\n\n21   you are moving over, let me find the exact wcrding ...\n\n22                    \"All prior motions, discovery crders,\n\n23   responses and answers.\"     And then there is a laundry\n\n24   list of specific pleadings.

So,   I mean, if we're in agreemer.t that the\n\n 9   cross-claim does not apply to this case, ther.,          I'm okay\n\n10   not admitting the emails.\n\n11                   MS.

It's for the   Co~rt   to rule.\n\n15   I believe the record speaks for itself, and it's for the\n\n16   appellate court to determine where somebody is going to\n\n17   go.\n\n18                   THE COURT:     Okay.

It's a landmark case.            It was\n\n 9   a case exactly like this where there was a suit and a\n\n10   nonsuit and a counter-claim following the nonsuit.

But\n\n 5   what she misses is when she chooses to nonsui t      1   my\n\n 6   client who'd been a defendant for a year and a half, had\n\n 7   substantial money invested in the education of this\n\n 8   Court and rulings obtained by this Court, had the\n\n 9   absolute right to, himself, institute a lawsuit and\n\n10   proceed on that lawsuit to resolve the very issues they\n\n11   have raised and vilified him for.     And that's exactly\n\n12   what -- you don't have to worry about the nonsuit.\n\n13                   I'll take the simple answer first.\n\n14                   When we filed days after she filed her\n\n15   nonsuit, we filed a cross and counter-petition.           We\n\n16   affirmatively stated in there, and it's her exhibit,\n\n17   that because of the convoluted procedural nature of this\n\n18   case, we drafted it just like an original petition.              And\n\n19   in fact,   it shows Paragraph 1 as discovery letter level\n\n20   just like an original petition.     And Footnote, 2 says,\n\n21   \"Due to the confusing nature of this case's Jrocedural\n\n22   background, Mr. Weiner requests that service lbe affected\n                                                      I\n\n\n\n\n23   on Daniel through his attorney of record as ~ell as\n                                                      I\n\n\n\n\n24   through private process.\"\n\n25                   We treated this suit to be careful as a\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

And that is confirmed.   In fact,   when I was\n\n 4   looking at this issue, and it is an odd issue - because\n\n 5   what Ms. Cantrell focuses on her nonsuit.      If she filed\n\n 6   a nonsuit and then when we came down and got\n\n 7   affirmative relief against Daniel, which is what\n\n 8   happened in Greenberg,   I would be saying she's\n\n 9   absolutely right.   We can't do that.   All we did was\n\n10   reinstitute a lawsuit in the same cause number which\n\n11   Local Rule 2.2 tells us this is where this lawsuit goes.\n\n12   Once you choose the number, it goes back to that\n\n13   original number.\n\n14                  We instituted a new lawsuit and\n\n15   immediately attempted to effectuate service.\n\n16                  When they evaded it nine times, this Court\n\n17   entered a substituted service order.    This Court had\n\n18   absolutely every right to do that because every court\n\n19   has jurisdiction to enter a substituted order when a\n\n20   party is evading service.    And that's what's happened in\n\n21   this case.   That's all that's happened.\n\n22                  In Greenberg, after the party dismissed,\n\n23   the Court entered rulings.    Well they can't enter\n\n24   rulings because I would agree in that case the parties\n\n25   aren't before this Court.    The only thing that's\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

We haven't\n\n 4   gotten to any affirmative rulings.      They will be a\n\n 5   party.\n\n 6                 Greenberg is completely irrelevant to this\n\n 7   case 'cause your court has entered no rulings.       You've\n\n 8   done nothing other than approved substituted service\n\n 9   since we filed this pleading.      Now once the service date\n\n10   has passed, whatever she's going to do - she can argue\n\n11   then whether we should have the ruling or not, but\n\n12   they're before this Court; they've been joined.\n\n13                 The supreme court in Zachary versus Lane\n\n14   in 2001 looked at the issue of who is a party.       Do you\n\n15   have to be served to be a party or are you a party the\n\n16   second the pleading is filed?      The supreme court looked\n\n17   at the case and said,    \"No.   You are a party the second\n\n18   the case is filed.\"     They were rejoined as a party\n\n19   'cause we re-served her which I agree - if they claim\n\n20   they want a party - so be it.       But we didn't skip the\n\n21   step of personal service.       We did that; albeit, by\n\n22   substituted because they evaded.\n\n23                 But in that case, the supreme court said\n\n24   they are party the second the pleading is filed.          Now\n\n25   you can't render judgment against that person unless we\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

PACHECO:     Thank you, Your Honor.\n\n 3                       I offer as our Exhibit G, the Rules of The\n\n 4   Probate Courts of Harris County, Texas approved by the\n\n 5   supreme court and entered as an order of this court on\n\n 6   March    8    of, 2007.\n\n 7                       MS. CANTRELL:     May I see those?        Which\n\n 8   rules are those?\n\n 9                       MS. PACHECO:     Yes.\n\n10                       MS.

Thank you.\n\n12                       THE COURT:     The Rules of The Probate\n\n13   Courts of Harris County, Texas, are entered as\n\n14   Respondent's Exhibit G.\n\n15                       MS. PACHECO:     Thank you.    And I was going\n\n16   to offer so I affirm the offering of Andy Weiner's\n\n17   Counter-Claim and Cross-Petition which I believe is\n\n18   already Plaintiff's Exhibit 3.              I believe that's already\n\n19   admitted into evidence; is that right, Your Honor?\n\n20                       THE COURT:     It is.\n\n21                       MS.

Warren and Katherine Warren as next friend of MHW, a\n\n25   minor.        That was filed in the district courts of Harris\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

CANTRELL:       No objection.\n\n 4                   THE COURT:      Okay.   Plaintiff's Original\n\n 5   Petition is admitted as Respondent's Exhbit H.\n\n 6                  MS.   PACHECO:     And what those documents\n\n 7   establish is the procedural history in this court\n\n 8   including the severance because of Mr. Daniel Weiner's\n\n 9   now-Daniel-Warren's intervention; but more specifically,\n\n10   that Mr. Weiner's counter and cross-petition which fell\n\n11   to constitute the original pleading that was promptly\n\n12   served was filed before any attempt to initiate any\n\n13   jurisdiction, any other court which the supreme court\n\n14   has also said the first filing applies.           And that would\n\n15   reinstitute this Court's jurisdiction.\n\n16                   Even if you believe that we couldn't\n\n17   rejoin her,   even if you believed that there was no valid\n\n18   existing lawsuit as it relates to Daniel,          it's\n\n19   irrelevant because we reinstituted a lawsuit on March\n\n20   24th; we promptly served; service has been obtained.\n\n21                  And finally we ask the Court to take\n\n22   judicial notice of your order of substituted service.\n\n23                   THE COURT:      It is so noted.\n\n24                  MS.

CANTRELL:    May I?   I have a couple of\n\n 3   comments in rebuttal.\n\n 4                  THE COURT:   Sure.\n\n 5                  MS. CANTRELL:    The facts of this case are\n\n 6   what happened in Greenberg versus Brookshire\n\n 7   identically.   There was a counter-claim, a brand new\n\n 8   pleading into the case after the nonsuit, and that's in\n\n 9   the Court's -- the supreme court said that that -- the\n\n10   nonsuit ended the case.     It was over at that point.\n\n11   There should be no more claims - whether they're\n\n12   hearings or not - there's no more orders.       The case is\n\n13   over.\n\n14                  And so I also wanted to point out that in\n\n15   their responsive -- the response to our motion -- our\n\n16   plea to the jurisdiction which I'm not sure that you-all\n\n17   have because it was filed about 5:00 last night.       Did\n\n18   you-all get that?\n\n19                  THE COURT:    The response --\n\n20                  MS. CANTRELL:    Their response to our plea.\n\n21                  THE COURT:    Yes,   I got it right here.\n\n22   They gave me this notebook which is their courtesy copy.\n\n23                  MS. CANTRELL:    Okay.    Could you please\n\n24   look for me on -- at Paragraph 33 and 36 of their\n\n25   response because I would like to correct the record on a\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G. LOPEZ, CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER\n\f                                                                  21\n\n\n1    couple of misstatements in there about timing and dates\n\n 2   which I think the records -- the documents we have\n\n 3   admitted will speak for themselves.\n\n 4                   Paragraph 33 says that \"Further in his\n\n 5   counter and cross-petition filed prior to the Court\n\n 6   signing Daniel's request for dismissal\" - that is not\n\n 7   correct.    The counter and cross-petition was filed after\n\n 8   the Court signing Daniel's request for dismissal - the\n\n 9   dates being March 24th for the counter and\n\n10   cross-petition and March 16 on signing the dismissal.\n\n11   And that error is repeated in Paragraph 36 where it\n\n12   says,   \"In subsequent to Daniel's nonsuit but prior to\n\n13   the entry of dismissal, Mr. Weiner's cross and\n\n14   counter-petition was filed.\"       That's the same error.       It\n\n15   is incorrect on the dates.      Daniel's nonsuit predated,\n\n16   and his dismissal predated, the cross or the counter and\n\n17   the cross-petition.    so·,   I would -- I'd 1 ike to correct\n\n18   the record on those two things.\n\n19                   THE COURT:    Okay.   Just quite simply:    We\n\n20   view the pleading filed on March 24th by Andy Weiner\n\n21   whose counter and cross-petition, we view that as an\n\n22   original petition.    I mean,    I know it's titled,   \"Counter\n\n23   and Cross-Petition\" but we view it as an original\n\n24   petition.    And so\n\n25                   MS.

CANTRELL:   It says,   \"All matters\n\n 5   relating to or appertaining to an estate or\n\n 6   guardianship -- \"\n\n 7                   THE COURT:   Where are you reading from?\n\n 8                   MS. CANTRELL:   The Rule 2.2, the one they\n\n 9   cited in their response.\n\n10                   THE COURT:   Okay.\n\n11                   MS. CANTRELL:    \"All matters relating or\n\n12   appertaining to an estate or guardianship,\" which this\n\n13   does not,   \"that has not been closed as provided in the\n\n14   Probate Court Code including proceedings upon trust\n\n15   created by decedent's will,\" which this is not -this is\n\n16   an inter vivos trust,     \"shall remain in such court\n\n17   subject to an order of transfer as with any case and\n\n18   shall retain the original docket number with an\n\n19   appropriate sub file.\"\n\n20                   So,   if it's an original petition, it\n\n21   should have its own separate case number according to\n\n22   the way I read these rules.\n\n23                    \"Each subsequent matter filed involving\n\n24   the same decedent or Proposed Ward,\" which this does not\n\n25   involve,    \"shall be filed in the original file under the\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

I don't dispute that they could file a\n\n 6   brand new lawsuit and they're welcome to.          They will --\n\n 7   they've already raised the construction issues in the\n\n 8   district court case; so those are already before the\n\n 9   district court case.     So,   it would be duplication if it\n\n10   reads the same way as their counter and cross-petition.\n\n11                  MS. PACHECO:      Actually,   they're part of an\n\n12   affirmative answer, and there is a plea to abate in the\n\n13   district court case saying this court has jurisdiction.\n\n14                  MS. CANTRELL:      I have a copy of that\n\n15   pleading.   Well you've got it in evidence.\n\n16                  THE COURT:      Okay.   So,   if we view this as\n\n17   an original petition, does it need to go back to\n\n18   should it have gone through the process of being\n\n19   assigned to another probate court?\n\n20                  MS. PACHECO:      I don't know the answer to\n\n21   that.   That's never been my experience.         My experience\n\n22   with the Clerk's Office in 20-plus years,         if it relates\n\n23   to the exact same cause number or style of the\n\n24   original - it always goes back to that case.

CANTRELL:     And, Your Honor,   I have the\n\n 4   Government Code Section 25.1034 which this Rule 2.2\n\n 5   refers to,   and it does talk about the random\n\n 6   assignments.   And it says,     \"The county clerks will keep\n\n 7   a separate docket for each court.      The County Clerk\n\n 8   shall assign and docket as random matters and\n\n 9   proceedings filed in the statutory probate courts\n\n10   according to the following percentages:\n\n11                   \"Probate Court Number 1 - 30 percent;\n\n12   Probate Court 2 - 30 percent; Probate Court 3 - 20\n\n13   percent; Probate Court 4 - 20 percent.\"\n\n14                   So, this is the random assignments.       You\n\n15   may be familiar with this.\n\n16                   MS. PACHECO:    That's a Clerk's Office\n\n17   function.    If the Court wants to tell them to reassign\n\n18   it a new cause number,   it doesn't change the filing it\n\n19   attaches to the courts - it's just a matter who hears\n\n20   it.   But I've never seen a case where the case was\n\n21   already before a court that even if it was assigned to\n\n22   another court, it wasn't immediately transferred back\n\n23   under administrative transfer powers.\n\n24                   MS.

But\n\n 3   then whatever judge in Harris County gets it is going to\n\n 4   see that we've got two other related cases, and they're\n\n 5   going to send it back.\n\n 6                   MS. CANTRELL:     Your Honor,   I would submit\n\n 7   that they need to file a brand new lawsuit in starting\n\n 8   all over.\n\n 9                   MS. PACHECO:     Of course,   she does because\n\n10   she wants to try and get to her district court.          This is\n\n11   a game.     It is a vile game that has been played for a\n\n12   year and a half.     It is offensive.\n\n13                   MS. CANTRELL:     It is not a game; it is\n\n14   called following the rules.\n\n15                   MS. PACHECO:     No,   this isn't following the\n\n16   rules.    This isn't the spirit of the Code of\n\n17   Professional Conduct.     This isn't the spirit of the\n\n18   Rules of Professional Procedure.        There is nothing\n\n19   appropriate about the actions that have been taken in\n\n20   this case.\n\n21                   MS. CANTRELL:     There is\n\n22                   MS.

And I'm not\n\n 2   going to do anything about the sending it to the Clerk\n\n 3   for random reassignment.       I really don't -- I've never\n\n 4   had this issue come up, and I'm just not going to do\n\n 5   anything about it.    And,   I mean, and you can, you can\n\n 6   appeal these decisions, of course.      And so,    I mean,\n\n 7   that's what I suggest you do.      But I view this as an\n\n 8   original petition and that's just, that's just how I\n\n 9   reasonably view it.    And so I could be wrong about that\n\n10   but --\n\n11                   MS.

An appellate Court should declare\n\n 2   post-plenary power orders void.\"\n\n 3                    And that is my position that any order in\n\n 4   this case past April 16th, according to every case I\n\n 5   have read,   is void.\n\n 6                    In this case, now they can file a brand\n\n 7   new lawsuit, but the jurisdiction in this case is over\n\n 8   starting with the nonsuit and 30 days thereafter when\n\n 9   the plenary power expires.       That is just according to\n\n10   the rules.\n\n11                    You can call it gamesmanship as Ms.\n\n12   Pacheco likes to do frequently,         but it's playing by the\n\n13   rules.   It is to prevent this exact same thing\n\n14   happening; otherwise, the right to nonsuit would be\n\n15   illusory.    You could never nonsuit because someone could\n\n16   simply counter-claim you right back in which is exactly\n\n17   what happened.     And this case is -- this would be not\n\n18   only void but it would be an interlocutory order and\n\n19   that does not qualify for permissive appeal because it's\n\n20   not a situation where there's substantial ground for\n\n21   disagreement.\n\n22                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MS.

And then she tried to get out of\n\n 5   this court 'cause she didn't like where it was going and\n\n 6   go find a different shore.       That is flat-out forum\n\n 7   shopping.     This isn't even a different county - it's a\n\n 8   different court; different floor; different court; same\n\n 9   courthouse.\n\n10                    So,   I don't see how any of that is\n\n11   appropriate or relevant to the issues in this case.\n\n12                    MS.

And now he is\n\n19   the Plaintiff, and he has chosen the Harris County\n\n20   Probate Courts, wherever he be assigned,        including the\n\n21   judge who is very educated on this process.\n\n22                    MS. CANTRELL:    Your Honor,   I have an order\n\n23   dismissing Andy Weiner's counter and cross-claim and\n\n24   dismissing this entire case.\n\n25\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

I'm not going to\n\n 3   dismiss it.      And I could be wrong on when I sign this\n\n 4   order on the plea to the jurisdiction.          I guess,       I'm\n\n 5   just -- I'm frustrated because at the beginning of this\n\n 6   case then Andy Weiner wanted it moved over to the family\n\n 7   court.     And so we -- when I looked at the case,         I\n\n 8   thought, you know, clearly this is within the language\n\n 9   of the divorce decree, right?          The divorce decree.           And\n\n10   I know I'm going back years, but the divorce decree,                  if\n\n11   I remember right, said that they were to be trustees and\n\n12   that they weren't supposed to seek the removal of either\n\n13   of them.       I don't remember exactly what the language\n\n14   was.     So,   I thought, well, you know, a judge over there\n\n15   is one who signed that order or that decree, and they\n\n16   need to go back and determine if this is,         in fact,       a\n\n17   violation of that decree.       I was wrong about that.              So,\n\n18   that came back to us.\n\n19                     And now the Warren children are wanting to\n\n20   move their cases to district court.          And it's, in my\n\n21   view,    it doesn't serve the interest of either party or\n\n22   either -- or any of the parties to be jumping around\n\n23   courts especially you guys have both invested a lot of\n\n24   time, energy, and money in this court.          And it feels\n\n25   like forum shopping to me.       And they've invested a lot\n\n\n            HIPOLITA G. LOPEZ, CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER\n\f                                                                       30\n\n\n 1   of effort and money and time when they,         over the course\n\n 2   of this case,      and I can't just dismiss it.     And I could\n\n 3   be wrong.     I mean,    I could be wrong that my plenary\n\n 4   powers expire 30 days after I sign the order dismissing\n\n 5   the case.     But that's not the way I view it.         I view\n\n 6   this as,    in essence, an original petition being filed.\n\n 7   And maybe it should have been funneled through the\n\n 8   Clerk's Office and assigned to a different court.             I\n\n 9   don't know.        But I'm not going to dismiss it over\n\n10   something procedural like that.\n\n11                       So, you know,   I'm going to have to just do\n\n12   what I think is right and let the appeals court deal\n\n13   with it.     So,    that's all I know how to do.\n\n14                       MS. CANTRELL:    Yes, Your Honor.\n\n15                       MS. PACHECO:    Your Honor, while we're\n\n16   here, may I make one last request that has nothing to do\n\n17   with this motion.        And you raised this at the last\n\n18   hearing.\n\n19                       Ms. Cantrell has the propensity to contact\n\n20   your staff and email them and elicit comments and then\n\n21   quote them, now in mandamuses and other proceedings.              I\n\n22   recognize it's your prerogative to allow us to do that,\n\n23   and you've been very accommodating to move things along.\n\n24   Given what she has contorted some of those statements to\n\n25   be,   I would request that if any requests should be made,\n\n\n           HIPOLITA G. LOPEZ, CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER\n\f                                                                    31\n\n\n 1   they should be made in open hearings with a record so\n\n 2   it's not this back and forth convoluted process and then\n\n 3   attempt to put an email in the record.\n\n 4                   I recognize -- I'm a believer in\n\n 5   cooperative courts, and y'all have always been\n\n 6   cooperative, but I feel that now she tries to get\n\n 7   answers and then use those in future proceedings and\n\n 8   it's just improper.\n\n 9                   She has suggested court staff has given\n\n10   her legal advice which hasn't -- I'm not staying it\n\n11   happened,   but I just think it needs to stop.       I mean,    to\n\n12   the extent we request a hearing,     the request should be I\n\n13   want to set a hearing on ''X\" date - not the going back\n\n14   and forth because I feel like we have crossed the line,\n\n15   or perhaps all sides,    in this case.    And because of the\n\n16   nature of this case,    I would ask that you direct all\n\n17   parties to stop emailing anything substantive to the\n\n18   Court and put in a pleading.\n\n19                   THE COURT:   Okay.\n\n20                   MS. CANTRELL:   I thought you did that\n\n21   already, Your Honor, at the last hearing.         You did ask\n\n22   us -- well,   to put everything in emails so now the\n\n23   request I'm hearing is not to even email?\n\n24                   THE COURT:   Well,   I mean,   the thing is,\n\n25   this is the limits -- I mean, we're bound by judicial\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G. LOPEZ, CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER\n\f                                                                      32\n\n 1   ethics, and I'll say this.      What I said before is we've\n\n 2   kind of been -- we've done our best to abide by those\n\n 3   ethical requirements, but I will say that in estate and\n\n 4   guardianship matters where we're dealing with a lot of\n\n 5   pro se litigants then quite often we will give advice\n\n 6   that borders on, you know,      it may go beyond just\n\n 7   procedural, and it may be even bordering on legal\n\n 8   advice.   And we do that because we view that sometimes\n\n 9   it's just,   it's expeditious for the protection of a Ward\n\n10   especially, okay.    We don't want anything bad to happen\n\n11   to our Wards, and we view that as our highest priority.\n\n12                  This case is totally different, okay.        And\n\n13   the only thing that you guys, as you know, are permitted\n\n14   to visit with our staff about is procedural issues.             And\n\n15   so beyond that, we shouldn't receive any communication\n\n16   if it has nothing      if it goes beyond procedural, we\n\n17   are not permitted to receive it.\n\n18                   MS. CANTRELL:     Your Honor,    I understand\n\n19   that, and I think that was clear at the last hearing.\n\n20   I'm not sure why it's coming up again.\n\n21                   MS. PACHECO:     It's coming up because now\n\n22   she's quoting emails in mandamuses.       And what I've come\n\n23   to realize is you call it procedural issues, but\n\n24   technically, what she should be communicating with the\n\n25   Court about is setting hearings.       I mean,    she can't get\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G. LOPEZ, CERTIFIED SHORTHAND REPORTER\n\f                                                                    33\n\n\n 1   her procedural questions answered by this Court either.\n\n 2   If she wants to know what the Court wants to do on a\n\n 3   particular issue,   I'm always happy to come down here and\n\n 4   have a status conference with a record,   and we can deal\n\n 5   with it in the proper way.\n\n 6                  166(g), under the Rules of Procedure,      is\n\n 7   intended to address procedural issues on notice and\n\n 8   pleading.   But what has happened in this case is she's\n\n 9   sort of contorting those communications into other\n\n10   things; and frankly,   I don't like having arguments with\n\n11   Counsel where, you know,   colleagues or anybody\n\n12   associated with the Court are copied on those.      It just,\n\n13   you know -- and there's embedded comments in there.\n\n14                  I understand -- I'm not saying it should\n\n15   be in every case, and I certainly,   I said this last time\n\n16   and I'm going to say it on the record - I am not\n\n17   implying this Court has done anything other than be\n\n18   excessively cooperative to both sides.    But Ms. Cantrell\n\n19   then contorts those into advice; and, you know,      it's not\n\n20   even with you, but your staff is an arm of you and it\n\n21   can be deemed as ex parte communication or she's trying\n\n22   to argue the Court told her to do something.       It's\n\n23   improper.   And she's not seeing the limits of those,       and\n\n24   yet again, when we're setting things,    there's a lot of\n\n25   back and forth that included Judge Comstock.       I just\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

CANTRELL:   These emails with the order\n\n 8   on the severance,   I'm not sure who initiated those but\n\n 9   it certainly wasn't me.      I mean, but we have discussed\n\n10   this over and over at the last hearing.\n\n11                   THE COURT:   Well no, no because the Court\n\n12   can discuss procedural issues with lawyers, but when\n\n13   but that is such a -- you know, when you talk about\n\n14   procedure versus giving legal advice,     I think there is a\n\n15   lot of overlap there.     And here, you know, you guys are\n\n16   seasoned lawyers.    You guys know the procedures.\n\n17   There's no reason why you need to be visiting with us\n\n18   over -- about anything other than scheduling hearings.\n\n19   So,   I think it's very fair that Ms. Pacheco request that\n\n20   we limit our all-communication.\n\n21                   MS. CANTRELL:    Yes, Your Honor,   I agree.\n\n22   We did that already.     I'm not sure what it is that made\n\n23   her bring it up again.\n\n24                   THE COURT:    I don't even see these emails.\n\n25   I don't know.

PACHECO:      There's a discussion of\n\n 3   pulling down certain hearings, we're going to go in a\n\n 4   different direction.     All of that is beyond what should\n\n 5   be communicated in emails.      They're not part of the\n\n 6   Court's record and yet she tries to admit them.\n\n 7                 Again,   I've never made this request, but\n\n 8   I've never had a case quite like this.        And I'm very\n\n 9   appreciative that we can approach you on any normal case\n\n10   and ask reasonable questions with Counsel copied.         This\n\n11   is just not that case.\n\n12                 MS. CANTRELL:        But Counsel was copied on\n\n13   those emails and it was initiated --\n\n14                 MS. PACHECO:      But it's a rally back and\n\n15   forth.   It's an ex parte communication and then Counsel\n\n16   is forced to respond and your staff is then watching\n\n17   this volley back and what do you do with that thing?           Do\n\n18   you show it to you?    Does it go in the Court's file?\n\n19                  THE COURT:    It doesn't get to me, but it\n\n20   does in a sense because if it gets to anyone of our\n\n21   staff it gets to me.     I mean,    it's deemed that I have\n\n22   viewed it, okay.   And so because they are an extension.\n\n23   The staff is, of course, an extension of me.\n\n24                  And, you know,      the truth is,   I view those\n\n25   emails as ex parte even though it copies Counsel.          It's\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

I mean, you're putting information\n\n 5   out there or questions out there and forcing the other\n\n 6   party in to respond.       I don't know what else to say\n\n 7   except that if someone makes a request that we limit\n\n 8   receipts of emails and communication by email and phone\n\n 9   to scheduling hearings.       I think that's a reasonable\n\n10   request and especially because you guys can call up any\n\n11   time and set a hearing, and you'll have it, you know.             I\n\n12   mean,   it's not like I'm not here, you know.\n\n13                    MS. CANTRELL:       I'm just confused about\n\n14   what it is Ms. Pacheco is concerned about if it was\n\n15                    MS.   PACHECO:   I don't want to have a\n\n16   discussion of the substance of all emails.            I think\n\n17   everybody's aware, probably not you because you haven't\n\n18   seen them, of what's been going on.          I   just think it\n\n19   needs to stop.\n\n20                    And again,   she,    just like the offering of\n\n21   this email today,      some emails that are going to happen\n\n22   to show up in the mandamus - it doesn't matter the\n\n23   substance.    I'm not complaining anything's improper at\n\n24   this point - I just think in the future on an on-going\n\n25   basis, to avoid future issues, that I would ask the\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

Daniel Warren asks the Court to dismiss Andy Weiner’s Counter and Cross-Petition\n\n because it was filed after Daniel Warren nonsuited all of his claims and the court lacks\n\n jurisdiction to rule on it under the holding of Greenberg v. Brookshire, 640 S.W.2d 870 (Tex.\n\n 1982).\n\n                                        BACKGROUND\n\n 2.    Daniel Warren is the sole beneficiary of the Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust (the\n\n “Trust”). The Trust was created on March 20, 1996 by Andy I. Weiner and Katherine R.\n\n Warren (formerly Katherine F. Weiner), who are also the co-trustees.\n\n 3.       On April 22, 2014, Daniel Warren filed a Plea in Intervention in Cause No. 425,577,\n\n In Re David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust, suing Andy Weiner for breach of fiduciary duty\n\n for borrowing substantially all of the Trust assets for Andy Weiner’s own personal use,\n\n commingling the Trust assets with Andy’s personal funds, failing to prudently invest the\n\n Trust assets, and failing to render an accounting upon Daniel’s request.\n\n 4.    On July 8, 2014 Andy Weiner asserted various affirmative defenses, including that his\n\n\n                                                                                          EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                             exhibitsticker.com\n\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n\n\n                                                                                            TAB F\n\f“actions were justified, excused and/or authorized by the terms of the Daniel Steven Weiner\n\n1996 Trust” and “Ambiguity.” [See attached Exhibit A]\n\n5.    On October 24, 2014 Andy Weiner filed a Second Amended Cross-Claim against\n\nKatherine Warren in Cause No. 425,577 seeking to hold Katherine responsible for any\n\ndamages, actions, inactions, and violations of the Trust Agreement, breach of her fiduciary\n\nduty, removal, tortious interference with Andy’s ability to properly administer the Trust, and\n\nreimbursement of Andy’s legal fees in defending the lawsuit.\n\n6.   On November 17, 2014 the Court severed Daniel Warren’s suit against Andy Weiner\n\ninto a separate Cause No. 425,576-401, and ordered 24 docket entries to be moved to the\n\nnew case. [See attached Exhibit B] The Cross-Claim was not moved and remained in Cause\n\nNo. 425,577.\n\n7.   Pursuant to the November 17, 2014 Order, Daniel Warren filed an Original Petition in\n\nthis Cause No. 425,576-401 on December 1, 2014 asserting the same claims as in his Plea in\n\nIntervention filed in Cause No. 425,577. The Original Petition named Andy Weiner and\n\nKatherine Warren as parties, but expressly stated that his Notice of Nonsuit against Ms.\n\nWarren applies to this Cause No. 425,576-401.\n\n8.    On February 10, 2015, Daniel challenged Andy Weiner’s Answer and Supplemental\n\nAnswer by Special Exceptions. After a hearing on the matter on February 17, 2015, the Court\n\nordered Andy Weiner to replead nine (9) of his thirteen (13) defenses by March 17, 2015.\n\nAndy Weiner failed to do so.\n\n9.   On March 10, 2015, Daniel Warren nonsuited all of his claims in this case and on March\n\n16, 2015 the Court dismissed Daniel Warren without prejudice. [See attached Exhibit C].\n\n10. On March 24, 2015, two weeks after Daniel Warren nonsuited his claims, Andy Weiner\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\ffiled a Counter and Cross-Petition against Daniel and Katherine, attempting to join them as\n\nparties to the nonsuited case.\n\n                                 ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n11. Daniel Warren asks the Court to dismiss Andy Weiner’s Counter and Cross-Petition for\n\nthe following reasons:\n\n12. Daniel Warren had an absolute right to nonsuit all of his claims on March 10, 2015 and\n\nbe dismissed from the case as long as it does not “prejudice the right of an adverse party to\n\nbe heard on a pending claim for affirmative relief.” (emphasis added) [TRCP 96, 162].\n\n13. The right to nonsuit should be liberally construed in favor of the nonsuiting plaintiff.\n\n[Greenberg v. Brookshire, 640 S.W.2d 870, 872 (Tex. 1982)].\n\n14. When the defendant has no pending claims for affirmative relief, the plaintiff’s nonsuit\n\nrenders the merits of the underlying case moot and dismisses the entire case. A trial court\n\nmay not rule on a counter or cross claim filed after a nonsuit. [Greenberg, 640 S.W.2d at\n\n871].\n\n15.     Andy Weiner’s failure to replead the nine (9) affirmative defenses as ordered by the\n\nCourt left Andy’s only defenses as 1) that Daniel is not entitled to attorney fees, 2) Daniel\n\nlacks standing, legal authority or capacity to sue, 3) Daniel’s claims are barred by the statute\n\nof limitations, and 4) Daniel’s claims are barred because he has no legal or equitable basis\n\nfor recovery. [See attached Exhibit D]. These are not claims for affirmative relief under\n\nTRCP 162.\n\n16. Since Daniel has dropped all his claims, both the claims and the defenses in this case are\n\nmoot. A trial court has no jurisdiction to rule on a moot controversy. [Klein v. Hernandez,\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\f315 S.W.3d 1, 3 (Tex. 2010; Devon Energy Prod. Co., L.P. v. KCS Res., LLC, 450 S.W.3d\n\n203, 209 (Tex. App.─Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, pet. pending on other grounds)].\n\n17. In Greenberg v. Brookshire, the wife filed a counterclaim against her husband two days\n\nafter he nonsuited his divorce case against her. Over the husband’s objections, the trial judge\n\nheld a hearing on the wife’s counterclaim and entered an order pertaining to it.            In a\n\nproceeding for mandamus relief, the Texas Supreme Court held that the trial judge should\n\nnot have proceeded with the hearing on the counterclaim and directed him to withdraw his\n\norder pertaining to it. [Greenberg v. Brookshire, 640 S.W.2d 870 (Tex. 1982)].\n\n18.   When a plaintiff files a nonsuit, the trial court loses jurisdiction of the entire case,\n\nexcept jurisdiction to render the order of dismissal without prejudice, which this Court has\n\ndone. [Ault v. Mulanax, 724 S.W.2d 824, 828 (Tex. App.─Texarkana 1986, orig.\n\nproceeding), also citing Greenberg v. Brookshire].\n\n19. Similarly, in Ault v. Mulanax the defendant filed a cross-action against the plaintiff after\n\nshe had nonsuited all of her claims. The appeal court held that the trial court lost jurisdiction\n\nof the entire case immediately upon the filing of the plaintiff’s nonsuit, except jurisdiction to\n\nrender the order of dismissal without prejudice. [Ault, 724 S.W.2d at 829].\n\n20. Just as in Greenberg and Ault, when Daniel nonsuited this case, there were no pending\n\nclaims for affirmative relief filed by any party. As such, the trial court’s only recourse is to\n\ndismiss the entire case without prejudice, as the Court has done.\n\n21. Andy Weiner’s cross-claims against Katherine Warren have no impact on this case.\n\nThey were filed only in Cause No. 425,577, a separate cause of action. Nor do Andy\n\nWeiner’s Counter and Cross-Petition have any impact on this case because they were filed\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fafter Daniel nonsuited his entire case. According, Daniel had an absolute right to dismiss his\n\nentire case under the holding of Greenberg v. Brookshire.\n\n22. A trial court cannot deny a litigant's right to nonsuit his case when affirmative relief is\n\nnot sought by an adverse party before the nonsuit. [Greenberg v. Brookshire, 640 S.W.2d\n\n870, 871 (Tex. 1982)]. Andy Weiner had no claims for affirmative relief pending at the time\n\nof Daniel’s nonsuit.\n\n23. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss this entire case and Andy Weiner’s Counter and\n\nCross-Petition as it was filed after Daniel nonsuited his entire case.\n\n\n                                        RELIEF REQUESTED\n\n24. For these reasons, Daniel Warren asks the Court to set this Plea to the Jurisdiction for a\n\nhearing and sign an order dismissing Andy Weiner’s Counter and Cross-Petition and this\n\nentire case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                                Respectfully submitted,\n                                                CANTRELL & CANTRELL, PLLC\n                                                By: /s/ Carol A.

Wro-ren (\"David\"), and in suppOlt\n\n   thereof respectfully shows the following:\n\n                                                  I.\n                                               Overview\n\n   1.       Tho Original Petition for Termination of Trust (\"Petition\") is just anothe1· sad stage in\n\n   Ms. Warren's systematic plan to exclude Mr. Weiner from his son's life. Mr. Weiner and Ms.\n\n   Warren are currently patties to a family coUlt proceeding that arises from Ms. Warren's failure to\n\n   comply with the terms of the Trust and a Judgment entered by the Family Court in their divorce,\n\n  pending in the 309111 Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas.\n\n  2.       The Petition filed Jn this Comt seeks to gain complete control of funds gifted by Mr.\n\n  Weiner's parents to the Trust established by both Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren prior to their\n\n  divorce. It cites no credible or legal basis to remove Mr. Weiner and/or terminate the Trust by\n\n  distributing said funds either free of trust to David or into a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act\n\n  account only Ms. Wan·en would control. And, while Mr. Weiner has historically attempted to\n\n  accommodate Ms. Warren's various requests, he is unwilling to risk funds needed for David's\n\n\n                                                                                                EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                          exhibitsticker.com\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   A\n  onawoo]()Ql\n l76- 942296vl\n\f        Oct. 23. 2013 3:35PM                                                                     No. 1344    P. 25\n\n\n\n\n                 future education or sanction her ignoring provisions of a Judgment entered by the Family Court\n\n                 in their divorce.\n\n                 3.     Neither Mr. Weiner nor the named successor trustee is disqualified to serve as a trustee of\n\n              the Trust. Mr. Weiner has never mishandled the Trust, has never harbored any hostility towai\"ds\n\n              David and has always acted in a prudent ffit\\lll\\er- even under the most difficult of circumstances\n\n              created by Ms. Warren. Mr. Weiner has done so because he recognizes that David and the T!.·ust\n\n              both need protection.\n\n                                                               II.\n                                                          B@ckgro!lnd\n\n             4.         On December 13, 1994, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren established the Tmst for the benefit\n\n             of their then-minor son, David. The irrevocable trust agreement provides that David is the\n\n             primaq beneficiary and Mr. Weiner and Ms. Wan·en are the original co-trustees. In the event\n\n             they are not able to serve, the tmst agreement provides that Bayle Weiner Dt-ubel shall serve as\n\n             successor trustee.\n\n             5.        Mr. Weiner's parents, David's grandparents, funded the Trust with the desire to provide\n\n            for their grandson's education,\n\n            6.         After David's grandparents' generous gifts, Ms. Warren systematically excluded Mr.\n\n            Wehter and his family from David and his siblings' lives. By way of example, Ms. Warren\n\n            facilitated in David changing his last name from his father's (Weiner) to a name with no family\n                                                                     ..\n            significance shortly after David's eighteenth birthday.

Notwithstanding Daniel’s assertions to the contrary, Mr. Weiner’s claims against\n\nKatherine Warren f/k/a Katherine Weiner (“Ms. Warren”) were properly on file when Daniel\n\nfiled his nonsuit. But, regardless, Mr. Weiner has an absolute right to initiate a new lawsuit to\n\nresolve the construction and other issues pled in his Counter and Cross-Petition properly filed in\n\nthe above-referenced proceeding in accordance with Local Rule 2.2. Therefore, this Court\n\nshould retain the above-referenced lawsuit on its docket and deny Daniel’s Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction.\n\n                                          II.\n                                 FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n2.       On March 20, 1996, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren established the Daniel Steven Weiner\n\n1996 Trust (the “Trust”) for the benefit of their then-minor son, Daniel. The irrevocable trust\n\nagreement provides that Daniel is the primary beneficiary and Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                            EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                             exhibitsticker.com\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             TAB F-1\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\fthe original co-trustees. In the event they are not able to serve, the trust agreement provides that\n\nBayle Weiner Drubel shall serve as successor trustee.\n\n3.         Mr. Weiner’s parents, Daniel’s grandparents, primarily funded the Trust with the desire\n\nto provide for Daniel’s education.\n\n4.         After Daniel’s grandparents’ generous gifts, Ms. Warren systematically excluded Mr.\n\nWeiner and his family from Daniel’s life, as well as the lives of his brothers, David and Michael.\n\nBy way of example, Ms. Warren likely facilitated the process of Daniel changing his last name\n\nfrom his father’s (Weiner) to a name with no family significance on his eighteenth birthday.\n\nAnd, in 2011, Ms. Warren deceitfully made ulterior plans to celebrate Daniel’s birthday to\n\npurposefully exclude Mr. Weiner. Further, Ms. Warren routinely belittled Mr. Weiner, his\n\nmother and his sisters in front of his sons.\n\n5.         On January 6, 2011, Ms. Warren filed for divorce from Mr. Weiner. Pursuant to an\n\nAgreed Decree of Divorce (“Divorce Decree”) entered into by the 309th Judicial District Court\n\nof Harris County, Texas in Cause No. 2011-01040 (the “Family Court Proceeding” or “Family\n\nCourt”), Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren were divorced on March 29, 2012.\n\n6.         Subsequent to the parties’ divorce, Ms. Warren has continued her efforts to alienate their\n\nchildren and has failed to comply with the terms of the Divorce Decree.\n\n7.         On September 30, 2013, Ms. Warren, as co-trustee of the Trust, filed a lawsuit1 against\n\nMr. Weiner, seeking an order from this Court to terminate the Trust and for the Trust funds to be\n\ndistributed to a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act account created for Daniel’s benefit over which\n\nMs. Warren would have sole control, even though the Trust agreement and the Divorce Decree\n\nprovide otherwise. See Original Petition, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit A and\n\nincorporated by this reference.\n1\n    Cause No. 425,576; In re: Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust, In Probate Court No. 4 of Harris County, Texas.\n\n\n                                                          2\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\f8.       On October 23, 2013, Mr. Weiner filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction in Cause No. 425576,\n\nalleging that the District Court had jurisdiction over the claims brought by Daniel because they\n\nrelated to the Family Court Proceeding.\n\n9.       On November 4, 2013, Ms. Warren, as next friend of Daniel, filed a First Amended\n\nOriginal Petition in Cause No. 425,576 in which she requests for the Trust to be modified to\n\nallow Daniel to become his own trustee upon reaching the age of 18. See First Amended\n\nPetition, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit B and incorporated by this reference.\n\n10.      On November 21, 2013, the Probate Court granted Mr. Weiner’s Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\nin Cause No. 425576.\n\n11.      On April 22, 2014, Daniel filed an Original Petition in Intervention in his older brother\n\nDavid Weiner’s proceeding against Mr. Weiner.2 See Original Petition in Intervention, attached\n\nhereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit C and incorporated by this reference.\n\n12.      On July 2, 2014, Mr. Weiner filed his Cross-Claims against Ms. Warren in Cause No.\n\n425,577 (where Daniel was an Intervenor), seeking to hold Ms. Warren equally responsible for\n\n(1) all actions and alleged inactions of the trustees, (2) all claimed damages and relief sought by\n\nDavid and Daniel, (3) all violations of the Trust agreements, including any scheme of collusion,\n\n(4) the preparation of an accounting, and (5) payment of one-half of Mr. Weiner’s attorneys’ fees\n\nand costs. See Cross-Claims, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit D and incorporated by\n\nthis reference.\n\n13.      On July 8, 2014, Mr. Weiner filed his First Supplement to Original Answer, alleging,\n\namong other claims and defenses, that Daniel has no standing to intervene in David’s case. See\n\n\n\n\n2\n Cause No. 425,577, In re: David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust, In Probate Court No. Four (4) of Harris County,\nTexas (“David’s Case”).\n\n\n                                                    3\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\fFirst Supplement to Original Answer, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit E and\n\nincorporated by this reference.\n\n14.      On July 15, 2014, Mr. Weiner filed his Motion for Partial Traditional Summary\n\nJudgment.\n\n15.      On August 7, 2014, Mr. Weiner filed his First Supplement to Cross-Claims against Ms.\n\nWarren, incorporating, by reference, the cross-claims and factual background supporting same\n\ncontained within his Motion for Partial Traditional Summary Judgment.\n\n16.      Also on August 7, 2014, David and Daniel (as Intervenor in David’s Case) nonsuited\n\ntheir claims against Ms. Warren in Cause No. 425,577.\n\n17.      On September 8, 2014, pursuant to an order of this Court, Daniel filed a Motion to Sever\n\nin David’s Case.\n\n18.      On September 25, 2014, the Probate Court partially granted and partially denied Mr.\n\nWeiner’s Motion for Partial Traditional Summary Judgment finding that, pursuant to the terms of\n\nDavid’s Trust: (i) a trustee of the trust may retain, invest or reinvest in assets unproductive of\n\ninterest and wasting assets, (ii) the diversification required under the Texas Trust Code and\n\nTexas common law, if any, does not apply to the Trust; (iii) Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren had a\n\nduty to jointly administer the Trust; (iv) in order to delegate her powers or duties to Movant as\n\nco-trustee of the Trust, Ms. Warren must have filed a written instrument with the records of the\n\nTrust; and (v) Mr. Weiner has no liability relating to his actions as trustee other than for acts and\n\nomissions found to be made with gross negligence, bad faith or fraud.\n\n19.      On October 24, 2014, Mr. Weiner filed his Second Amended Cross-Claims against Ms.\n\nWarren in Cause No. 425,577. See Second Amended Cross-Claims, attached hereto as Exhibit F\n\nand incorporated by this reference. As clearly expressed in the Second Amended Cross-Claims,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\fthe cross-claims relate to the David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust as well as Daniel’s Trust\n\nbecause, at the time of filing, Daniel’s intervention had not yet been severed into its own cause\n\nof action. Exhibit F ¶1.\n\n20.      On November 5, 2014, Daniel’s claims were severed into their own cause of action in the\n\ninstant proceeding. An amended order, specifically identifying the pleadings and orders to be\n\ntransferred into the new cause of action, was signed on November 17, 2014.3\n\n21.      On December 1, 2014, Daniel, pursuant to this Court’s order, filed his Original Petition in\n\nCause No. 425,576-401.\n\n22.      On March 10, 2015, Daniel nonsuited his claims against Mr. Weiner.\n\n23.      On March 24, 2015, Mr. Weiner filed his Counter and Cross-Petition. See Counter and\n\nCross-Petition, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit G and incorporated by this\n\nreference. In his Counter and Cross-Petition, Mr. Weiner (1) asked for the Court to construe the\n\nlanguage of the Trust agreement; (2) alleged the following cross/counterclaims against Ms.\n\nWarren: breaches of fiduciary duty, reimbursement, removal as trustee, tortious interference with\n\nadministration; and (3) requested the appointment of a corporate trustee. While no monetary\n\nclaims were brought against Daniel, he was joined as a necessary party because he is the primary\n\nbeneficiary of Daniel’s Trust. See TEX. PROP. CODE § 115.011.\n\n24.      On March 24, 2015, Mr. Weiner’s counsel took Ms. Warren’s court-ordered deposition.\n\nMs. Cantrell attended that deposition.\n\n25.      On April 2, 2015, Daniel, along with his brothers, David and Michael, jointly filed an\n\nOriginal Petition in the 133rd Judicial District of Harris County, Texas, Cause No. 2015-19320.\n\nSee Original Petition, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit H and incorporated by this\n\n\n3\n Due to an administrative error, Mr. Weiner’s Second Amended Cross-Claims were inadvertently left off of the list\nof documents to be transferred to Cause No. 425,576-401.\n\n\n                                                       5\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\freference. When the three related cases currently pending in Probate Court No. 4 of Harris\n\nCounty, Texas (Cause No. 425,576-401, Cause No. 425,577, and Cause No. 425,578) are\n\ncompared to the District Court case, the parties and issues are the same.\n\n26.      On April 17, 2015, Daniel filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction in this Court, alleging that Mr.\n\nWeiner’s cross-claims against Ms. Warren, pled in his Second Amended Cross Claims and his\n\nCounter and Cross-Petition, have “no impact on this case.” Motion at ¶21. As further discussed\n\nbelow, Daniel’s request for dismissal is misguided, as Mr. Weiner’s affirmative claims against\n\nMs. Warren were properly in front of this Court prior to the nonsuit being filed. But, regardless,\n\nMr. Weiner had every right – and did – initiate cross and counter claims. Even if considered a\n\nnew lawsuit, the Counter and Cross-Petition is validly before this Court and Mr. Weiner has\n\nproperly and diligently sought to serve Daniel, in compliance with the Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure.\n\n27.      On May 4, 2015, Mr. Weiner filed a Plea in Abatement and, subject thereto, Original\n\nAnswer in Cause No. 2015-19320.\n\n                                           III.\n                                   ARGUMENT & AUTHORITY\n\n28.      Daniel’s Plea to the Jurisdiction is his last ditch effort to have his case tried in the District\n\nCourt, instead of this Court where he originally filed his claims against his father, Mr. Weiner.\n\n29.      Daniel’s nonsuit nullifies the controversy by and between Daniel and Mr. Weiner; it does\n\nnot affect any pending claims for relief made by Mr. Weiner. In re Bennett, 960 S.W. 35, 38\n\n(Tex. 1997). A party has an absolute right to nonsuit their own claims, but not someone else’s\n\nclaims they are trying to avoid. Tex. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Ledbetter, 251 S.W.3d 31, 37 (Tex. 2008)\n\n(emphasis in original).\n\n30.      So long as the plaintiff pleads enough facts to affirmatively demonstrate the trial court\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\fhas jurisdiction over the suit, a court’s jurisdiction attaches upon filing a lawsuit. TEX. PROP.\n\nCODE § 115.001; TDCJ v. Miller, 51 S.W.3d 583, 587 (Tex. 2001). And, unless the pleadings\n\ndemonstrate the absence of jurisdiction, the court will assume it has jurisdiction over the case.\n\nPeek v. Equip. Serv., 779 S.W.2d 802, 804 (Tex. 1989); Beacon Nat’l Ins. v. Montemayor, 86\n\nS.W.3d 260, 266 (Tex. App.—Austin 2002, no pet.).             In the event this Court “lost” its\n\njurisdiction upon Daniel’s nonsuit – which Mr. Weiner vehemently disagrees – this Court gained\n\njurisdiction upon the filing of Mr. Weiner’s Cross and Counter-Petition.\n\n31.      Rule 162 of Texas Rule of Civil Procedure governs dismissal and nonsuits. Rule 162\n\nprovides that “[a]ny dismissal pursuant to this rule shall not prejudice the right of an adverse\n\nparty to be heard on a pending claim for affirmative relief.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 162. A claim for\n\naffirmative relief is one “on which the claimant could recover compensation or relief even if the\n\nplaintiff abandons his cause of action.” Univ. of Tex. Med. Branch at Galveston v. Est. of\n\nBlackmon ex rel. Shultz, 195 S.W.3d 98, 101 (Tex. 2006); BHP Petroleum Co., Inc. v. Millard,\n\n800 S.W.2d 838, 841 (Tex.1990).\n\n32.      Daniel falsely asserts that Mr. Weiner had no affirmative claims for relief pending at the\n\ntime of Daniel’s nonsuit. At the time of Daniel’s nonsuit, Mr. Weiner had the following cross-\n\nclaims, alleged in his Second Amended Cross-Claims, against Ms. Warren pending: (1)\n\ncontribution, (2) breaches of fiduciary duty, (3) removal of trustee, (4) tortious interference with\n\nadministration, and (5) attorneys’ fees and costs. See Exhibit F. These are claims for affirmative\n\nrelief under Rule 162 of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. TEX. R. CIV. P. 162; BHP Pet. Co.\n\nv. Millard, 800 S.W.2d 838, 840-41 (Tex. 1990) (defendant’s request for declaratory judgment if\n\nit seeks resolution of continuing issues); Leon Springs Gas Co. v. Restaurant Equip. Leasing Co.,\n\n961 S.W.2d 574, 578 (Tex. App—San Antonio 1997, no pet.); Ulloa v. Davila, 860 S.W.2d 202,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\f204 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 1993, no writ) (counterclaim did more than resist plaintiff’s suit).\n\nThese are independent claims for affirmative relief, not merely derivative claims. In re Estate of\n\nKidd, 812 S.W.2d 356, 359 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1991, writ denied).\n\n33.      Further, in his Counter and Cross-Petition, filed prior to this Court signing Daniel’s\n\nrequest for dismissal, Mr. Weiner alleged the following claims: (1) construction of the Trust\n\nAgreement, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) reimbursement, (4) removal as trustee, (5) tortious\n\ninterference with administration, and (6) petition to modify trust and request for appointment of a\n\ncorporate trustee. See Exhibit G.\n\n34.      Daniel relies upon Greenberg v. Brookshire and Ault v. Mulanex in support of his\n\nposition that this lawsuit should be dismissed, despite Mr. Weiner’s valid pending claims.\n\nGreenberg v. Brookshire, 640 S.W.2d 870 (Tex. 1982); Ault v. Mulanex, 724 S.W.2d 824 (Tex.\n\nApp—Texarkana 1986, orig. proceeding). However, these cases are readily distinguishable.\n\nGreenberg was a divorce action wherein the lower court conducted a hearing on an amended\n\npleading after the husband nonsuited his claims. Unlike the facts to the instant case, there were\n\nonly two parties to the lawsuit – a husband and a wife – and the wife filed a counterclaim against\n\nher husband and requested a hearing on same after her husband filed a nonsuit. The lower court\n\nconducted a hearing on the counterclaims, which the Texas Supreme Court held was in error, as\n\na plaintiff has an absolute, unqualified right to a nonsuit. Greenberg, 640 S.W.2d at 872. Ault\n\nv. Mulanax is another divorce proceeding, specifically involving custody and child support issues\n\nand; not relating, whatsoever, to the factual disputes at issue in the instant litigation. Ault v.\n\nMulanax, 724 S.W.2d at 828. Notwithstanding the factual differences, the Ault cases specifically\n\nrelated to and involved the imposition of the Texas Family Code. Id. Furthermore, the legal\n\nissues in Ault were jurisdictional – which court had dominant jurisdiction at the time the nonsuit\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\fwas filed. Id. at 828. Like in Greenberg, the Texarkana Court of Appeal’s ruling in Ault is not\n\ninstructive to this Court, as the factual and legal matters at issue in Ault are grossly different and\n\nirrelevant to the case at hand.\n\n35.      Regardless of the gamesmanship of Daniel and his mother, Ms. Warren, and their\n\npersistent litigious acts, Daniel’s nonsuit does not summarily dismiss the affirmative claims\n\nbrought by Mr. Weiner against Ms. Warren, which were filed prior to the nonsuit; Daniel cannot\n\nnonsuit Mr. Weiner’s claims against Ms. Warren. Tex. Mut. Ins. Co., 251 S.W.3d at 37.\n\n                                              V.\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n36.      Mr. Weiner’s Second Amended Cross-Claims were properly on file prior to Daniel’s\n\nNonsuit. And, subsequent to Daniel’s nonsuit, but prior to the entry of dismissal, Mr. Weiner’s\n\nCross and Counter-Petition was filed.\n\n37.      While Daniel’s nonsuit effectively eliminates the affirmative claims he had against Mr.\n\nWeiner, it does nothing with respect to the claims alleged by Mr. Weiner against Ms. Warren.\n\nThis Court has jurisdiction over this case and the remaining claims between Mr. Weiner and Ms.\n\nWarren.\n\n38.      Accordingly, it would be improper to dismiss this case, in its entirety, because of the\n\nremaining claims by Mr. Weiner against Ms. Warren.\n\n         WHEREFORE, Andy Weiner respectfully requests that this Court, after oral hearing,\n\ndeny the Plea to the Jurisdiction filed by Daniel Warren f/k/a Daniel Steven Weiner, and for such\n\nother and further relief, either at law or in equity, to which he may be justly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\f                                                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                      CRAIN, CATON & JAMES,\n                                                      A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n\n                                                      By: /s/ Kathleen Tanner Beduze\n                                                          SARAH PATEL PACHECO\n                                                          (TBA # 00788164)\n                                                          spacheco@craincaton.com\n                                                          KATHLEEN TANNER BEDUZE\n                                                          (TBA # 24052205)\n                                                          kbeduze@craincaton.com\n                                                          1401 McKinney, 17th Floor\n                                                          Houston, Texas 77010\n                                                          (713) 658-2323\n                                                          (713) 658-1921 (Facsimile)\n\n                                                      Attorneys for Andy Weiner\n\n\n\n\n                                 CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nI hereby certify that a true and correct copy of the foregoing instrument has been forwarded to:\n\n           Carol A.

The Twst is an inter vivos trust created under Internal Revenue Code § 2503( c) by\n\n   Katheline F. Wan·en and Andy I. Weiner by agreement dated March 20, 1996 for the\n\n   benefit of their son, the Primary Beneficiary.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f 7. At the present time, the only pennissible beneficiary of the Trust is the Primary\n\n     Beneficiary. The Trust is authorized under Section A-I to make distributions to the\n\n    Primary Beneficiary as follows:\n\n            During the tenn of the trust, the trustees may distribute as much or\n\n            all of the Trust estate as, in the trustees' discretion, is in the\n\n            Primary Beneficiary's best interests.\n\n8. Pursuant to Section A-2 of the Trust, the Plimary Beneficiary may withdraw all or part of\n\n    the Tn1st estate within 60 days after becoming age 21, and may thereby terminate the\n\n    trust as to the part withdrawn.      If the Primaty Beneficiary does not exercise his\n\n    withdrawal right, the T!ust continues 1mtil the Primary Beneficiary becomes age 30.\n\n9. Section A-2 of the Tmst provides that in the event the Primary Beneficiary should die\n\n    before the Trust tenninates, then all assets remaining in the T1ust shall be held or\n\n    distributed by the T1ustee for the benefit of those in favor of whom the Primary\n\n    Beneficiary exercises a power of appointment, or otherwise in the following order: (I) to\n\n   the Primary Beneficiary's descendants, (2) if none of the descendants are then Jiving, to\n\n   the hustors' descendants, (3) if none of the trusters' descendants are then living, to the\n\n   trustors' heirs.\n\nI 0. Section C-1 T1ust agreement provides that any distribution made to a beneficiary of the\n\n   Trust may be made to a custodian for a minor beneficiary under the Uniform Gifts to\n\n   Minors Act.\n\nII. The trust had marketable securities and cash in the approximate value of $113,000 as of\n\n   August 31, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f 12. The initial co-trustees of the Trust were Katherine A. Warren and Andy I. Weiner. Both\n\n    of the initial co-hustees of the Trust remain the current co-trustees, and no other co-\n\n    trustees have been appointed. In the event that Andy I. Weiner and Katherine F. Warren\n\n    cease to act as tmstee, Bayle Weiner Drubel, Andy I. Weiner's sister, is appointed\n\n    successor trustee under Section D-l(a) of the Tmst.\n\n 13. The co-hustees of the Tn.1st are the parents of the Primary Beneficiary. Although the co-\n\n    hustees were manied at the time the Trust was created, they were granted a divorce on\n\n    March 29, 2012. From the time that the div01'ce was finalized, the co-trustees have been\n\n    unable to agree on proper administration of the Trust.\n\n14. Pursuant to the divorce decree attached as \"Exhibit B,\" the Court ruled that the Trust\n\n    should be administered according to its te1ms. Tltis requixes the co-trustees to act jointly,\n\n    which has proved detrimental to the best interests of the Primary Beneficiary and\n\n    contrary to the purposes ofthe Trust.\n\n15. Texas Trust Code § 112.054(a)(3) provides that on the petition of a trustee, a Comt may\n\n   order that the trustee be changed or that the Tmst be terminated if modification of\n\n   administrative, non-dispositive terms of the tmst is necessary or appropriate to prevent\n\n   waste or avoid impairment ofthe Tmst's administration.\n\n16. Texas Trust Code§ 112.054(a)(2) provides that on the petition of a trustee, a Court may\n\n   order that the tmstee be changed or that the Tmst be tenninated if, because of\n\n   circumstances not known to or anticipated by the hustors, termination or modification of\n\n   the Tmst will further the purposes oft he Trust.\n\n17. Petitioner claims that the inability of the co-llustees to agree on the appropriate\n\n   administration of the Trust assets has impaired the Tn1st's administration. The purposes\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f     of the Tmst, to provide for the Primary Beneficiary, cannot be fulfilled if the co-tmstees\n\n     cannot agree regarding what actions constitute the \"best interests\" of the Primary\n\n     Beneficiary. Additionally, the cunent circumstances, i.e. the divorce of the co-tmstees,\n\n     was not known to or anticipated by the tmstors. Tetmination or modification of the Trust\n\n     is necessary due to the disharmony between the Tmst's co-trustees which prevents the\n\n    co-trustees from administering the Tmst in the best interests of the Primary Beneficiary.\n\n                                  RELIEF REQUESTED\n\n l. Petitioner requests that the Court order that the Tmst be tetminated and that the Trust\n\n    estate be distributed to the Unifmm Transfers to Minors Act account created for the\n\n    benefit of the DanielS. Weiner, Fidelity Account ending in #6843, over which Katherine\n\n    F. Wanen was awarded sole and exclusive control in the divorce decree attached as\n\n    \"Exhibit B\"; that continued administration of the Trust would defeat or substantially\n\n    impair the accomplislm1ent of the Tmst; that such circumstances were not known to or\n\n    anticipated by the tmstms upon creation of the Tmst; that termination of the Tmst will\n\n    further the purposes of the Trust; that the Petitioner be awarded Court costs and expenses\n\n    and legal fees fi·om the Trust estate; that the remaining assets of the Tmst, after payment\n\n    of Court costs and expenses and legal fees, be distributed to the Fidelity Account ending\n\n   in #6843; and that the Court enter such other orders as may be approp1iate to provide for\n\n    the delivery of all Tmst assets fi·om Katherine F. Warren and Andy I. Weiner to the\n\n   Fidelity Account ending in #6843.\n\n2. Petitioner altematively requests that the Comi order that the co-trustees be changed; that\n\n   the Court appoint an independent corporate tmstce; that replacing the co-trustees with an\n\n   independent corporate tmstee will ftniher the purposes of the Trust; that modification of\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f    the Trust is necessary or appropriate to prevent waste or avoid impairment of the Ttust's\n\n    administration; that the Petitioner be awarded Court costs and expenses and legal fees\n\n    from the Trust estate; that the remaining assets of the Trust, after payment of Court costs\n\n    and expenses and legal fees, be distributed to an independent corporate trustee; and that\n\n    the Court enter such other orders as may be appropriate to provide for the delivery of all\n\n    Trust assets fi·om Katherine F.

Petitioner appeared\n\nthrough her duly authorized representative and attomey of record and mmounced ready for trial.\n\nRespondent Andy I. Weiner appeared by and through his duly authorized representative and\n\nattomey of record and allllounced ready for trial. No jury having been demanded by any patiy,\n\nall issues of fact and law were submitted to the Court for decision.\n\n       Having reviewed the pleadings and other papers on file in this cause; and having\n\nconsidered the evidence presented at trial and the arguments of counsel, the Court finds as\n\nfollows:\n\n   1. This Court has jurisdiction and venue of this action.\n\n   2. All necessary patiies to this action are properly before the Court and have been duly\n\n       served with citation in the mallller required by law.\n\n   3. The DANIEL STEPHEN WEINER 1996 TRUST (hereinafter referred to as the \"Trust\")\n\n       is an inter vivos trust created by Katherine F. Warren and Andy I. Weiner by agreement\n\n       dated March 20, 1996 for the benefit of their son, Daniel S. Weiner (hereinafter referred\n\n       to as the \"Primary Beneficiary\").\n\n   4. The current co-trustees of the Trust are Katherine F. Warren and Andy I. Weiner.\n\f 5. Texas Trust Code§ 112.054(a)(3) provides that on the petition of a trustee or beneficiary,\n\n    a Comt may order that the tmstee be changed or that the Trust be te1minated if\n\n    modification of administrative, non-dispositive terms of the trust is necessary or\n\n    appropriate to prevent waste or avoid impairment of the Tmst's administration.\n\n6. Texas Tmst Code§ 112.054(a)(2) provides that on the petition of a trustee or beneficiary,\n\n    a Comt may order that the tmstee be changed or that the Trust be tem1inated if,· because\n\n    of circumstances not known to or anticipated by the trustors, termination or modification\n\n    of the Tmst will fmther the purposes of the Tmst.\n\n7. Petitioner has requested termination of the Trust contingent on the Court's finding that:\n\n    (a) the inability of the co-hustees to agree on the appropriate administration of the Trust\n\n    assets has impaired the Trust's administration; and (b) due to the divorce of the co-\n\n    trustees, a circumstance not known to or anticipated by the trustors when they created the\n\n   Trust, termination will further the purposes of the Trust, which is to provide for the best\n\n   interests of the Primary Beneficiary.\n\n8. Petitioners have alternatively requested that the co-trustees be replaced by an independent\n\n   cmporate trustee, if available, contingent on the Court's finding that: (a) the inability of\n\n   the co-trustees to agree on the appropriate administration of the Trust assets has impaired\n\n   the Trust's administration; and (b) due to the divorce of the co-trustees, a circumstance\n\n   not known to or anticipated by the trustors when they created the Tmst, modification of\n\n   the Tmst will further the p\\ll'poses of the Trust, which is to provide for the best interests\n\n   of the Primary Beneficiary.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f     9. The co-trustees have tendered an accounting of their actions as co-trustee of the Tn1st\n\n         (the \"Final Accounting\").     The Final Accounting reflects that the co-trustees have\n\n         administered the Tmst in accordance with the requirements of Texas law.\n\n     10. The Final Accounting should be approved in all respects, and the co-trustees should be\n\n        released and discharged from any and all liabilities arising out of or in any way related to\n\n        the administration of the Trust or the Trust termination.\n\n     11. The Tmst should be tenninated and the remaining Trust estate, after payment of all Comt\n\n        costs and expenses and legal fees should be distributed to the Unifonn Transfers to\n\n        Minors Act account created for the benefit of the Daniel S. Weiner, Fidelity Acco<mt\n\n        ending in #6843.\n\n    12. Katherine F. Warren brought this action for the purpose of preserving and protecting the\n\n        interests of the Trust and its Primary Beneficiary. The relief sought in this action was\n\n        necessary to enable the Trust to accomplish the purposes of the Trust as established by\n\n        the trustors. Accordingly, Katherine F. Warren is entitled to recover her reasonable and\n\n        necessary attorney's fees and litigation expenses fi·om the Trust pursuant to Texas Trust\n\n        Code § 114.064.\n\n\n\n       It is therefore, ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the Trust is hereby\n\nterminated; that the termination shall be effective immediately upon the entry of this Final\n\nJudgment by the Court; that the co-trustees are directed to deliver the remaining Trust estate,\n\nafter payment of all Court costs and expenses and legal fees to the Fidelity Account ending in\n\n#6843. The provisions of this Final Judgment shall constitute sufficient legal authority to all\n\npersons owing any money to the Trust, having custody of any property of the Trust, or acting as\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f transfer agent of any property of the Tn1st, for payment or transfer of such money, property, or\n\n right without liability to Daniel S.

WARREN\n\n        Before me, the undersigned notary, on this day personally appeared KATHERINE F.\n\nWARREN, the affiant, whose identity is known to me. After I administered an oath, affiant\n\ntestified as follows:\n\n    1. My name is Katherine F. Warren. I am over eighteen years of age, of sonnd mind, and\n\n       capable of making tllis affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal\n\n       knowledge and are true and correct.\n\n   2. On December 13, 1994, Andy I. Weiner and I created the DAVID ABRAHAM WEINER\n\n       1994 TRUST (the \"Trust\") for the benefit of our son, David W. Warren, formerly known\n\n       as David A. Weiner. Andy I. Weiner and I are the trustors and co-ttustees of the Trust.\n\n  3. The purpose of the Trust is to provide for the best interests of our son, David. A primary\n\n       purpose of the Trust is to fund his educational costs. I believe that it is in David's best\n\n      interest to receive a quality education.\n\n  4. David is enrolled as a freshman at Rice University in Houston, Texas.             He began\n\n      attending classes in August 2013.\n\n  5. Andy I. Weiner and I were granted a divorce on March 29, 2012. As part of the divorce\n\n      decree, the trust was to continue as provided under the tmst agreement. Under the trust\n\n      agreement, Andy I. Weiner and I are required to act jointly as co-trustees.\n\n\n                                                 1\n                                      txh;hrf             ~\n\f  6. Although David is the primary beneficiary of the Trust, he applied for fmancial aid with\n\n      Rice University prior to the start of the Fall 2013 semester. David was denied financial\n\n     aid because of the Trust. The financial aid department of Rice University explained that\n\n     where students are the beneficiaries of trusts like the DAVID ABRAHAM WEINER\n\n     1994 TRUST, that the school assumes that the trust funds are intended for the payment of\n\n     college expenses.\n\n 7. David received a tuition bill from Rice University in July 2013. I wrote a check from the\n\n     Trust's Fidelity account for $20,000 or around August 1, 2013. The check was returned\n\n     to Rice University unpaid because Andy I. Weiner requested that Fidelity not honor the\n\n     check.\n\n8. After the check was returned to Rice University unpaid, David received a letter from the\n\n    university advising him that his tuition payment was overdue. I requested that Fidelity\n\n    wire $20,000 to David, with which he paid his tuition. It took approximately six weeks\n\n    for the tuition payment to be credited to David's account with Rice University.\n\n9. I believe that it is detrimental to the best interests of David for Andy I. Weiner and I to\n\n    continue acting as co-trustees of the Trust. Our disagreements regarding distributions of\n\n    David's behalf could seriously inhibit his ability to receive a wonderful education.\n\n10. David is an intelligent adult and is capable of using the Trust assets for his best interests.\n\n   I believe that David has shown maturity beyond most other college students his age.

Petitioner respectfully shows the Court as\n\nfollows:\n\n                                            PARTIES\n\n   I. Katherine F. Warren appears as next fi'iend of Daniel S. Weiner pursuant to Rule 44 of\n\n       the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and files this action on his behalf in his capacity as\n\n       beneficiary of the DANIEL STEPHEN WEINER 1996 TRUST (\"Trust\"). Daniel S.\n\n       Weiner, a minor, was born on March 11, 1996. He will be an adult on March II, 2014.\n\n       No legal guardian or attorney ad litem has been appointed for DanielS. Weiner.\n\n   2. Daniel S. Weiner (\"Primary Beneficiary\") has an interest in tltis proceeding under Texas\n\n       Trust Code § 111.004(7). He is also a necessary pmiy under Texas Trust Code §\n\n       115.011(2) because he is the primary beneficiary named in the Trust.\n\n   3. Katherine F. Warren has the exclusive right to represent Daniel S. Weiner in legal action\n\n       and to make decisions of substantial legal significance concerning him pursuant to the\n                                                                                                        EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                                             exhibitsticker.com\n\n\n\n\n                                                  I\n\n                                                                                                             TAB H\n\f    Agreed Final Decree of Divorce (\"Divorce Decree\"), Cause No. 2011-01040 in the\n\n    District Court of the 309'\" Judicial District in Hanis County, Texas, which is attached as\n\n    \"Exhibit B\" and incorporated for all pmposes. Texas Trust Code§ 115.013(c)(3) petmits\n\n    a parent to represent her child as guardian ad litem or next friend if there is no conflict of\n\n    interest and no guardian of the estate or guardian ad litem has been appointed. Ms.\n\n    Wan·en's interests do not conflict with those of DanielS. Weiner.\n\n4. Katherine F. Wanen is an individual acting as tmstee of the Tmst. Ms. WmTen is joined\n\n    as a Respondent herein because she has an interest in the proceeding under Texas Tmst\n\n    Code § 111.004(7) and is a necessary party pursuant to Texas Tmst Code §\n\n    115.011(b)(4).   She cmTently resides at 1226 Muirfield Place, Houston, Hanis County,\n\n   Texas 77055.\n\n5. Andy I. Weiner is an individual acting as trustee of the Tmst. Mr. Weiner is joined as a\n\n   Respondent herein because he has an interest in this proceeding under Texas Tmst Code\n\n   § 111.004(7) and is a necessary party pursuant to Texas Trust Code§ 115.011(b)(4). Mr.\n\n   Weiner currently resides at 1200 Post Oak Blvd., Apmiment 907, Houston, Texas 77056.\n\n6. The situs of the Trust is Houston, Hanis County, Texas.\n\n\n                                     JURISDICTION\n\n7. The subject matter of this dispute involves the management and modification of the Trust\n\n   estate of the DANIEL STEPHEN WEINER 1996 TRUST. This Court has jurisdiction\n\n   over this subject matter pursuant to Texas Trust Code§ 115.001(d)(1) and Texas Probate\n\n   Code§ 4G.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f                           RESPONSE TO PLEA IN ABATEMENT\n\n8. Respondent Andy I. Weiner filed a Plea in Abatement in this action alleging that he had\n\n    commenced an earlier suit on the same subject matter involving the same patties in the\n\n    3091h Judicial Disllict. In order to succeed on his Plea in Abatement, Mr. Weiner must\n\n   show that I) he commenced suit first, 2) the suit is still pending, 3) the same parties are\n\n   involved, and 4) the controversies are the same. In re Sims, 88 S.W.3d 301, 303 (Tex.\n\n   App. - San Antonio 2002, Wiit granted).        The undisputed record shows that the Mr.\n\n   Weiner cannot meet the last two requirements. On their face, Mr. Weiner's pleadings\n\n   show that the parties are not the same in the District Comt and the Probate Court. Daniel\n\n   S. Weiner is not a party in the District Court action. Daniel S. Weiner would be a\n\n   necessary party to a suit involving the DANIEL STEPHEN WEINER 1996 TRUST\n\n   because he is a named beneficiary. Tex. Trust Code§ 115.01l(b)(2). A lack of necessary\n\n   parties deprives the first court of dominant jurisdiction. Mission Res. v. Garza Energy\n\n   Trust, 268 S.W.3d 301, 328 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi 2005). A plaintiff who is not a\n\n   pmty to a plior suit is fi·ee to choose his forum. Wyatt v. Shaw Plumbing Co., 760 S.W.2d\n\n   245, 248 (Tex. 1988). A defendant, however, is not at libetty to decline to do battle in the\n\n   forum chosen by the plaintiff. Id. Accordingly, Mr. Weiner's Plea in Abatement should\n\n   be denied.\n\n9. Nor can Mr. Weiner show that he had a prior case involving the same subject matter\n\n   when Petitioner filed his case in the Probate Comt. Two controversies involve the same\n\n   subject matter when the issues presented in each case are \"inherently intenelated\" - i.e.\n\n   one controversy cannot be resolved without resolving the other. In re Puig, 351 S.W.3d\n\n   301, 305 (Tex. 2011); Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 247. That is not the case here. The pleadings\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f          on their face reveal that the subject matters in the two actions are wholly dissimilar. The\n\n          alienation issues can be resolved without modifying the Tmst and the Trust can be\n\n          modified without resolving the alienation issues.\n\n     10. The hemi of Mr. Weiner's Petition to Modify Parent-Child Relationship (\"SAPCR\" 1)\n\n         filed on August 14, 2013 is a claim of alienation from his children allegedly caused by\n\n         Katherine F. Wan·en, his ex-wife. See Suppotiing Affidavit to Exhibit A to Mr. Weiner's\n\n         Plea in Abatement. Mr. Weiner's SAPCR contained a litany of grievances and relief\n\n         requested in order to stop the alienation. Among them was a request for the exclusive\n\n         right to consent to the children's psychiattic and psychological treatment, to manage their\n\n         estates, 2 to represent them in legal action, and to exercise a fully expanded Standard\n\n         Possession Order. Mr. Weiner also requested temporary orders for psychological\n\n         evaluation of the whole family, the appointment of an Amicus Attorney, mandatory\n\n         alternative dispute resolution (\"ADR\"), access to the children's health care records, and\n\n         enforcement of the Divorce Decree's order that the Fidelity Trust accounts be changed to\n\n         \"and\" accounts. He also requested a temporary restraining order to prevent Ms. Wan·en\n\n         from withdrawing the children from school where they are presently enrolled and making\n\n         disparaging remarks about him in front of the children. And finally, he requested a\n\n         permanent injunction to prevent Ms. Wan·en from changing the names of the children.\n\n         There was no mention of Trust management or modification and hence no inherent\n\n         intenelation of the initial subject matter of the two suits. In re Puig, 351 S.W.3d at 305;\n\n         Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 247.\n\n1\n  Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship (\"SAPCR\") means a suit filed in which the appointment of a\nmanaging conservator or a possessory conservator, access to or support of a child, or establishment or termination of\nthe parent-child relationship is requested. Tex. Family Code§ 101.032.\n2\n  The children have a Unifonn Transfer to Minors Account (\"UTMA\"), which Ms. WaiTen was awarded sole and\nexclusive control of on page 9 of the original Divorce Decree dated March 29, 2012.\n\n                                                         4\n\fII. It was only after Petitioner filed suit to modify the Trust on September 30, 2013 that Mr.\n\n   Weiner amended hiss pleadings in the District Court on October 18, 2013 to request \"the\n\n   exclusive right to manage the existing ttusts of the children.\" See page 2 of Exhibit B to\n\n   Mr. Weiner's Plea in Abatement. This addition is the only change that was made in the\n\n   amended pleadings. See Mr. Weiner's Exhibits A and B to his Plea in Abatement. In\n\n   essence, Mr. Weiner amended his pleading to set up a new subject matter in order to\n\n   obtain dominant jurisdiction in the District Court. But this is directly contrary to the\n\n   Texas Supreme Court's ruling in State of Texas v. Boyd, in which the Court held that a\n\n   party cannot obtain dominant jurisdiction by amending its pleadings in the first court to\n\n   set up a subject matter similar to a different case in a second court involving the same\n\n  parties. State of Texas v. Boyd, 136 S.W.2d II 07 (Tex. 1940). The plaintiff in Boyd\n\n   amended its pleading in the Ha!Tis County District Court to set up a similar subject matter\n\n  as another suit involving the same defendant in Travis County. The plaintiff then filed a\n\n  plea in abatement alleging that it had a prior suit on the same subject matter pending in\n\n  Han-is County. The Court held that such action did not bestow dominant jurisdiction on\n\n  the first case because they were wholly dissimilar prior to the amendment. Id. These\n\n  facts are identical to the case at bar in which Mr. Weiner amended his parent-child\n\n  alienation case against his ex-wife to add a new subject matter- management of the Trust\n\n  estate - and then alleged that he had a prior suit pending on the same subject matter as\n\n  Petitioner's case in the Probate Court. But the law is clear that amending a pleading to\n\n  set up a subject matter similar to a second action does not give the first action dominant\n\n  jurisdiction where the subject matter of the two cases were \"wholly dissimilar\" prior to\n\n  the amendment. Id.\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f                        RESPONSE TO PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n\n12. Mr. Weiner also filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction on October 23, 2013 alleging that the\n\n    District Court has continuing exclusive jurisdiction over matters pertaining to the Trust\n\n    estate.   But that asse1iion is directly contrary to the statute. Texas Family Code §\n\n    155.001(a) confers exclusive continuing exclusive jurisdiction over only the matters\n\n   provided for in Title 5 of the Texas Family Code. These include \"orders regarding\n\n   managing conservatorship, possessory conservatorship, possession of and access to the\n\n   child, and support of the child.\" Tex. Family Code§ 155.003(a). The limits of the District\n\n   Comi's continuing exclusive jurisdiction are not boundless. They include only those\n\n   matters expressly enumerated in Texas Family Code § 155.003(a), which are not\n\n   involved in Petitioner's action to modifY the Trust. Accordingly, this Court should deny\n\n   Mr. Weiner's Plea to the Jurisdiction.\n\n13. A hearing is scheduled on the Plea in Abatement and the Plea to the Jurisdiction for\n\n   November II, 2013 at I :30 p.m. in this Court.\n\n                                        VENUE\n\n14. Venue of this proceeding is proper in this Comi pursuant to Texas Trust Code §\n\n   115.002(b-2) and Texas Probate Code§ 8.\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n15. The Trust is an inter vivos minor's trust created under Internal Revenue Code§ 2503(c)\n\n   by Ms. Wan·en and Mr. Weiner by agreement dated March 20, 1996 for the benefit of\n\n   their son, DanielS. Weiner, the Primary Beneficimy and Petitioner.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f16. At the present time, Daniel S. Weiner is the only beneficiary of the Trust. Daniel S.\n\n    Weiner is a high school senior and straight-A student at The Kincaid School in Houston,\n\n    Texas. He is completing applications to attend college in the Fall of 2014 and is\n\n    concemed about being able to depend on distributions fi·om the Tmst to help pay for his\n\n    college.\n\n17. The Tmst estate consists of marketable securities and cash in the approximate value of\n\n    $113,000 as of August 31, 2013.\n\n18. The Trust is authorized under Section A-1 to make disttibutions to the Ptimary\n\n   Beneficiary as follows:\n\n           \"The income of the trust may be accumulated and retained, in\n\n           whole or in pati, or the tmstee may distribute to Daniel, fi·om time\n\n           to time, so much or all of the bust estate as, in the trustee's\n\n           discretion, is in Daniel's best interests.\"\n\n19. Pursuant to Section A-2 of the Trust, the Ptimary Beneficiary may withdraw all or part of\n\n   the Trust estate within 60 days after becoming age 21, and may thereby te1minate the\n\n   trust as to the pati withdrawn.        If the Primaty Beneficiary does not exercise his\n\n   withdrawal tight, the Trust continues until the Ptimary Beneficiary becomes age 30.\n\n20. Section A-2 of the Trust provides that in the event the Primary Beneficiary should die\n\n   before the Trust tenninates, then all assets remaining in the Trust shall be held or\n\n   distributed by the Trustee for the benefit of those in favor of whom the Primary\n\n   Beneficiary exercises a power of appointment, or otherwise in the following order:(!) to\n\n   the Ptimary Beneficiary's descendants, (2) if none of the descendants are then living, to\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f    the trustors' descendants, (3) if none of the trustors' descendants are then living, to the\n\n    trustors' heirs.\n\n21. The initial and current bus tees of the Trust are Ms. Warren and Mr. Weiner. In the event\n\n    that both Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren cease to act as tmstee, Bayle Weiner Drubel, Mr.\n\n    Weiner's sister, who is believed to live in Dmtmouth, Massachusetts, is appointed\n\n    successor tmstee under Section D-l(a) of the Trust.\n\n22. The tmstees were granted a divorce on March 29, 2012. The Divorce Decree ordered\n\n   that:\n\n            \"the following children's trusts are held in ilTevocable tmsts,\n\n            which shall continue as written, and that each party will take any\n\n            and all necessary steps to provide full co-trustee ownership and\n\n            control of each such account including the placing of such\n\n           accounts in a deposit and withdrawal agreement requiling both co-\n\n           trustees to disburse funds; also known as an \"and\" account:\n\n            I. Fidelity Trust Acct Ending in #8634 (David)\n\n           2. Fidelity Trust Acct Ending in #3958 (Daniel)\n\n           3. Fidelity Trust Acct Ending in #1942 (Michael).\"\n\n   See Exhibit B, page I 0.\n\n23. The Texas Trust Code provides that on the petition of a beneficiary, a Court may order\n\n   that the trustee be changed or that the trust be otherwise modified if modification of\n\n   administrative, non-dispositive tenns of the trust is necessary or appropriate to prevent\n\n   waste or avoid impainnent of the Trust's administration. Tex. Trust Code §\n\n   112.054(a)(3).\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f24. Petitioner believes that the inability of the trustees to agree on management of the Trust\n\n    has impaired the Tmst's administration. Modification of the Tmst is necessary to prevent\n\n    the tmstees' personal issues fi·om hindering their ability to effectively administer the\n\n    Trust.\n\n                                  RELIEF REQUESTED\n\n25. Petitioner requests that the Court order that the Tmst be modified to allow Daniel S.\n\n   Weiner to become trustee of the Trust upon attaining age 18 on March 11, 2014; that\n\n   modification of the Trust will further the purposes of the Trust; that modifying the Trust\n\n   is necessary or appropriate to prevent waste or avoid impaitment of the Tmst's\n\n   administration; and that the Court enter such other orders to effect the modification of the\n\n   Trust.\n\n26. Petitioner brings this action for the purpose of preserving and protecting the interests of\n\n   the Trust estate and its Primary Beneficiary. The relief sought herein is necessary to\n\n   enable the Tmst to fulfill its intended purposes.

No person shall have the right to revoke or amend\nthis trust agreement or any of its provisions. However, property\nacceptable to the trustee may be added to any trust from time to\ntime in the future by trusters or by any other person (including\nadditions pursuant to the provisions of the last will of any\nperson).\n\n     All references to \"trustee\" shall refer to the person or\npersons then acting as such.\n\n     A.

CONTINGENT TRUSTS\n\nB-1. Trusts Established. Any portion of a trust estate upon the\ntrusts termination (other than a portion withdrawn by Daniel\npursuant to Paragraph A-2) which would be distributable to a\nbeneficiary who is under age 30 or to a beneficiary who is under a\nlegal disability instead shall be distributed to the trustee of a\nContingent Trust (unless otherwise directed by the valid exercise\nof a power of appointment).        Each beneficiary's portion so\ndistributed shall be held and administered as the initial trust\nestate of a separate trust for the beneficiary.

WARREN\n\n        Before me, the undersigned notary, on this ·day personally appeared KATHERINE F.\n\nWARREN, the affiant, whose identity is known to me. After I administered an oath, affiant\n\niestified as follows:·\n\n   1. My name is Katherine F. Warren. I am over eighteen years of age, of ~ound mind, and\n\n        capable of making this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal\n\n       knowledge and are true and correct.\n\n   2. On December 13, 1994, Andy I. Weiner and I created the DAVID ABRAHAM WEJNER\n\n       1994 TRUST (the \"Trust\") for the benefit of our son, David W. Warren, formerly known\n\n      as David A. Weiner. Andy I. Weiner and I are the trustors and co-trustees of the Ttust.\n\n  3. The purpose of the Trust is to provide for the best interests of our son, David. A primary\n\n      purpose of the Trust is to fund his educational costs. I believe that it is in David's best\n\n    . interest to receive a quality education.\n\n 4. David is enrolled as a freshman at Rice University in Houston, Texas.             He began\n\n     attending classes in August 2013.\n\n5. Andy I. Weiner and I were granted a divorce on March 29, 2012. As part of the divorce\n\n    decree, the trust was to continue as provided under the trust agreement. Under the trust\n\n    agreement, Andy I. Weiner and I are required to act jointly as co-trustees.\n\n\n                                                 1\n\f     6. Although David is the primary beneficiary of the Trust, he applied for fmancial aid with\n\n         Rice University prior to the start of the Fall 2013 semester. David was denied fmancial\n\n         aid because of the Trust. The financial aid department of Rice University explained that\n\n        where students are the beneficiaries of trusts like the DAVID ABRAHAM WEINER\n\n        1994 TRUST, that the school assumes that the trust funds are intended for the payment of\n\n        college expenses.\n\n    7. David received a tuition bill from Rice University in July 2013. I wrote a check from the\n\n       Trust's Fidelity account for $20,000 or around August 1, 2013. The check was returned\n\n       to Rice University unpaid because Andy I. Weiner requested that Fidelity not honor the\n\n       check.\n\n   8. After the check was returned to Rice University unpaid, David received a letter from the\n\n      university advising him that his tuition payment was overdue. I requested that Fidelity\n\n      wire $20,000 to David, with which he paid his tuition. It took approximately six weeks\n\n      for the tuition payment to be credited to David's account with Rice University.\n\n  9. I believe that it is detrimental to the best interests of David for Andy I. Weiner and I to\n\n     continue acting as co-trustees of the Trust. Our disagreements regarding distributions of\n\n     David's behalf could seriously inhibit his ability to receive a wonderful educatio!J .\n\n. 10. David is an intelligent adult and is capable of using the Trust assets for his best interests.\n\n     I believe that David has shown maturity beyond most otber college students his age. It\n\n    would be in his best interests to be given the Tlust assets for his college tuition, rather\n\n    than to face the uncetiaintyinherent in the current situation.\n\n\n\n\n                                           ' 2\n\fSworn to and subscribed before me by Katherine F.

Respondent Katherine R. Warren, an individual, has appeared and answered. A copy\n\n of this petition will be forwarded to Thomas R. Conner, attorney of record for Respondent\n\n Warren, Conner & Lindamood, P.C., 1221 Lamar, Suite 1010, Houston, TX 77010.\n\n\n                                            VENUE\n\n   5. Venue of this proceeding is proper in this Court pursuant to Texas Trust Code §\n\n115.002(b).\n\n                                  THE ORIGINAL LAWSUIT\n\n    6. Plaintiff David W. Warren filed an Original Petition for Termination of Trust on\n\n September 30, 2013 seeking to terminate the David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust.\n\n Respondents Andy I. Weiner and Katherine R. Warren were joined as necessary parties\n\n under Texas Property Code § 115.011 because they are trustees of the trust.\n\n    7. On October 23, 2013, Respondent Weiner filed an answer to plaintiff’s original petition\n\n asserting a general denial as well as affirmative defenses of res judicata, collateral estoppel,\n\n the doctrine of unclean hands, and the terms of the trust.\n\n    8. On November 1, 2013, plaintiff David Warren filed a First Amended Original Petition\n\n for Modification of Trust and sought to remove both trustees and appoint himself as trustee\n\n rather than to terminate the trust.\n\n    9. On January 15, 2014 Respondent Warren filed an answer to plaintiff’s First Amended\n\n Original Petition for Modification of Trust and asserted a general denial.\n\n    10. On March 13, 2014 David W. Warren filed his Second Amended Original Petition\n\n seeking to remove only Andy I. Weiner as trustee and obtain damages against Andy I.\n\n Weiner for breach of fiduciary duty by failing to prudently invest David’s Trust funds and\n\n borrowing substantially all of David’s Trust’s funds, which is expressly prohibited by the\n\fTexas Trust Code § 113.052 and the terms of the trust instrument.\n\n                       INTERVENOR’S INTEREST IN LAWSUIT\n\n  11. Daniel S. Weiner has a justiciable interest in this lawsuit because he will be harmed if\n\nthe Court finds that Andy I. Weiner did nothing wrong by borrowing substantially all of the\n\nfunds from David’s Trust on April 9, 2009 for his own personal use and benefit while he was\n\ntrustee. Andy I. Weiner also borrowed substantially all of the funds from Daniel’s Trust on\n\nthe same day in the same transaction for Respondent Weiner’s his own personal use and\n\nbenefit without interest or collateral while he was trustee of Daniel’s Trust. The trust\n\ninstruments of both David’s Trust and Daniel’s Trust expressly prohibit borrowing by the\n\ntrustee.\n\n  12. Daniel S. Weiner will also be harmed in this lawsuit if the Court finds that Andy I.\n\nWeiner did nothing wrong by maintaining the assets of David’s Trust in cash for 3.5 years\n\nwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 Index, and the NASDAQ advanced by\n\n72 to 203 percent during that time period. Andy I. Weiner also maintained the assets of\n\nDaniel’s Trust in cash during that same time period.\n\n  13. Daniel S. Weiner will also be harmed in this lawsuit if the Court finds that Andy I.\n\nWeiner did nothing wrong by investing more than half of David’s Trust portfolio in Weiners\n\nStores, Inc. when the company had a history of bankruptcy and was ultimately sold for a\n\ncomplete loss. Andy I. Weiner also invested over 65 percent of Daniel’s Trust portfolio in\n\nWeiner Stores, Inc. during the same time period and sold the stock for a complete loss.\n\n  14. Daniel S. Weiner will also be harmed in this lawsuit if the Court finds that Andy I.\n\nWeiner did nothing wrong by failing to diversify David’s Trust portfolio and consequently\n\nselling the stocks for a significant loss. Andy I Weiner also failed to diversify Daniel’s Trust\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fDaniel’s Trust by investing in the same stocks (Autozone Inc., Kohls Corp, Lowes\n\nCompanies, Whole Foods Market, and 99 Cents Only Stores) as David’s Trust and selling\n\nthem at the same time for a loss of $30,586.\n\n  15. Because Daniel Weiner challenges the very same transactions that David Warren is\n\nalready challenging, his claims arise from the same transactions or occurrences and involve\n\ncommon questions of law and fact with David’s claims – namely, whether the actions of\n\nAndy I. Weiner in failing to prudently invest the trust assets and borrowing nearly all of the\n\ntrust corpus for Respondent Weiner’s own benefit constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. The\n\noutcome of David W. Warren’s case will substantially affect the interest of Daniel S. Weiner\n\nbecause they complain of the same transactions by the same trustee during the same time\n\nperiod pertaining to identical trusts with identical assets.\n\n  16. A party has a justiciable interest in a lawsuit when its interests will be affected by the\n\nlitigation. {In re Union Carbide Corp., 273 S.W.3d 152, 155 (Tex. 2008); Law Offices of\n\nWindle Turley, P.C. v. Ghiasinejad, 109 S.W.3d 68, 70 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 2003, no\n\npet.).} A party may intervene in a suit if it could have brought all or part of the same suit in\n\nits own name. {In re Union Carbide, 273 S.W.3d at 155; Guar. Fed. Sav. Bank v. Horseshoe\n\nOperating Co., 793 S.W.2d 652, 657 (Tex. 1990); E & B Carpet Mills v. State, 776 S.W.2d\n\n286, 290 (Tex. App.—Austin 1989, writ dism’d).}\n\n                                             FACTS\n\n  17. Intervenor Daniel S. Weiner is the beneficiary of the Daniel Steven Weiner 1996\n\nTrust (Daniel’s Trust), an irrevocable inter vivos trust created by Respondents (trustors)\n\nWarren and Weiner on March 20, 1996. A true and correct copy of the trust agreement is\n\nattached hereto as “Exhibit A” and is incorporated for all purposes.\n\f18.   Respondents Andy I. Weiner and Katherine R. Weiner, are Trustees of the Trust.\n\nRespondent Weiner’s sister Bayle Weiner Drubel is successor trustee in the event that both\n\nRespondents Weiner and Warren cease to serve.\n\n19. Daniel S. Weiner was born on March 18, 1996 and is an adult.\n\n20. The primary purpose of Daniel’s Trust is to pay for Daniel’s education. He is presently\n\na senior student at Kinkaid High School in Houston, Texas. He has accepted enrollment at\n\nRice University in Houston, Texas to attend classes in the fall of 2014.\n\n21. Daniel’s Trust owns marketable securities worth approximately $124,983 as of January\n\n31, 2014. The Trust assets came from various sources including Daniel’s own income tax\n\nrefunds, birthday and Hanukkah gifts, and checks payable to the Custodian of his Uniform\n\nGifts to Minors Account. Respondent Weiner “endorsed” these checks over to Daniel’s Trust\n\nwithout Daniel’s knowledge.\n\n22. The Trustee is authorized to make discretionary distributions to the beneficiary as are\n\nin the beneficiary's best interest. The beneficiary may withdraw the entire Trust corpus upon\n\nreaching age 21.\n\n23. On March 25, 2009, Respondent Andy I. Weiner liquidated the entire portfolio of\n\nDaniel’s Trust and incurred a capital loss of $30,586.\n\n24. On April 9, 2009 Respondent Weiner borrowed $90,959.38 from Daniel’s Trust,\n\nleaving $1,000 in the trust. On the same day Respondent Weiner borrowed $126,641.40 from\n\nDavid’s Trust and $82,474.40 from his other son Michael Weiner’s trust, leaving only\n\n$1,000 in each of those trusts. In all, Respondent borrowed $300,075.18 from his sons’ trusts\n\nfor his own personal use and benefit while he was trustee.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f25. On December 19, 2013, Daniel S. Weiner demanded an accounting of his trust under\n\nTexas Trust Code § 113.151-152. Respondent Weiner has ignored his demand.\n\n26. In 1999, Daniel’s Trust purchased 34,000 shares of Wieners Stores, Inc. stock, in\n\naddition to the 18,000 shares it already owned. On August 31, 1999, Weiners Stores, Inc.\n\naccounted for over 65 percent of Daniel’s Trust’s portfolio.\n\n27. Respondent Weiner was an Executive Vice President of Weiner Stores, Inc. until 1995\n\nwhen it declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Weiners Stores emerged from bankruptcy on\n\nAugust 26, 1997 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again on October 16, 2000.\n\n 28. On December 6, 2001, Daniel’s Trust sold 52,000 shares of Wieners Stores, Inc. for\n\n2/10ths of a cent per share for a total loss of $28,762.44.\n\n29. From July 1, 1999 to March 25, 2009 Daniel’s Trust invested in only five to eight\n\nindividual stocks in a portfolio worth less than $90,000.\n\n30. From March 26, 2009 to September 11, 2012 Daniel’s Trust’s account at Fidelity\n\nconsisted entirely of cash. During this time the trust earned $99.13 of interest income, while\n\nthe Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 72 percent, the S&P 500 Index increased by\n\n79 percent, and the NASDAQ Composite increased by over 203 percent.\n\n31. Daniel S. Weiner did not discover Respondent Weiner’s borrowing or failure to\n\nprudently invest his Trust funds until discovery began in David Warren’s case. Daniel\n\nWeiner was a minor when the borrowings and other breaches occurred. The period of\n\nlimitations does not begin to run against a person entitled to bring an action for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty while the person is under 18 years of age. {Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§\n\n16.001, 16.004.} Daniel S. Weiner became 18 on March 18, 2014 and is thus within the\n\nlimitations period for bringing this action.\n\f                                   CAUSES OF ACTION\n\n32. Daniel S. Weiner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the\n\npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.\n\n33. There is a real and justiciable controversy between Daniel S. Weiner and Respondent\n\nAndy I. Weiner concerning Respondent Weiner’s actions as trustee of Daniel’s Trust.\n\n34. Respondent Weiner has materially breached his fiduciary duties in the following\n\nmanner:\n\n      a.         By borrowing substantially all of the assets of Daniel’s Trust for his own\n\n  personal use and benefit on April 9, 2009 without interest or collateral in violation of\n\n  Paragraph E-3(a) of the Trust Agreement and the Texas Trust Code § 113.052, both of\n\n  which expressly forbid borrowing by the trustee;\n\n      b.         By commingling substantially all of Daniel’s Trust assets with Respondent\n\n  Weiner's own personal funds in violation of the duty of loyalty under Texas Trust Code §\n\n  117.007, the duty not to profit by self-dealing with the trust under Texas Trust Code §\n\n  114.0001(a), and the common law duty to segregate trust assets;\n\n      c.         By investing over 65 percent of Daniel’s Trust assets in Weiner Stores, Inc. in\n\n  1999, resulting in a material loss to the trust in violation of the prudent investor rule under\n\n  Texas Trust Code § 117.004;\n\n      d.         By failing to properly diversify Daniel’s Trust property resulting in a material\n\n  loss to the trust in violation of the duty to diversify under Texas Trust Code § 117.005;\n\n      e.         By failing to prudently invest Daniel’s Trust property resulting in a material\n\n  loss to the trust in violation of the prudent investor rule under Texas Trust Code § 117.004;\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f       f.         By failing to render an accounting despite written demand by Daniel S.\n\n    Weiner on December 19, 2013 in violation of the duty to account under Texas Trust Code\n\n    §§ 113.151 and 113.152.\n\n   Daniel and his trust have suffered substantial economic damages as a direct result of\n\nRespondent Weiner’s material breaches of fiduciary duty enumerated above.\n\n  35. Daniel Weiner further claims that Respondent Weiner’s sister, Bayle Weiner Drubel,\n\n should not be named as successor trustee in the event Respondents are unable to serve\n\n because she has a material conflict of interest with respect to this Trust due to her\n\n relationship with Respondent Weiner. As a result of her conflict, Ms. Drubel would not be\n\n capable of properly performing her fiduciary duties. {Kappus v. Kappus, 284 S.W.3d 831\n\n (Tex. 2009)}.\n\n                                  RELIEF REQUESTED\n\nWHEREFORE, Daniel S. Weiner requests:\n\n  36. Judgment against Respondent Andy I. Weiner for a sum within the jurisdictional limits\n\n of the Court.\n\n  37. Monetary relief of over $200,000 but not more than $1,000,000.\n\n  38. Removal of Respondent Weiner as Trustee of the Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust\n\n pursuant to Texas Trust Code §§ 114.008(a)(7) and 113.082;\n\n  39. That Respondent Weiner be ordered to pay money or restore property to Daniel’s Trust\n\n equal to the trust’s lost profits caused by Respondent Weiner's borrowing, imprudent\n\n investing, and other breaches of fiduciary duty pursuant to Texas Trust Code §\n\n 114.008(a)(3);\n\f40. That Respondent Weiner be ordered to disgorge and pay to Daniel’s Trust any profit\n\nhe has made through his personal use of Daniel’s Trust funds under Texas Trust Code §\n\n114.0001(a).\n\n41. That Respondent Weiner be ordered to pay Daniel’s Trust punitive damages in excess\n\nof the statutory cap due to Respondent Weiner's gross negligence and intentional and\n\nconscious indifference to the rights of the beneficiaries under Texas Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code\n\n§ 41.008.\n\n42. That Daniel S. Weiner be awarded reasonable and necessary attorney fees, costs, and\n\nexpenses through trial and all appeals under applicable Texas law, including but not limited\n\nto Texas Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.001 and Texas Trust Code §§ 114.064 and\n\n113.151(a).\n\n43. That Respondent Weiner be ordered to submit an accounting that meets the\n\nrequirements of Texas Trust Code § 113.152 and personally bear the cost of the accounting\n\npursuant to Texas Trust Code § 113.151.\n\n44. That Daniel’s Trust be modified pursuant to Texas Trust Code § 112.054(a)(3) to\n\nappoint Daniel Weiner as co-Trustee with Respondent Katherine Warren and remove Bayle\n\nWeiner Drubel as the successor trustee in the event that Ms. Warren ceases to serve.\n\n45.

WARREN\n\nBy:_/s/ Carol A. Cantrell\n\f                   DANIEL STEVEN WEINER 1996 TRUST\n\n     By this trust agreement, Andy I . Weiner and Katherine Friedman\nWeiner, husband and wife, both of Harris County, Texas, as\n\"trusters,\" establish the Daniel steven Weiner 1996 Trust for the\nbenefit of their son, Daniel steven Weiner (\"Daniel\"), born\nMarch 11, 1996.   Trusters grant, assign and deliver to Andy I.\nWeiner and Katherine Friedman Weiner, both of Harris County, Texas,\nas \"trustees,\" the property described in Attachment A. Attachment\nA, which is captioned \"Initial Contributions to the Daniel Steven\nWeiner 1996 Trust,\" is incorporated by reference as a part of this\ntrust agreement.\n     This trust agreement and the trusts established by it are\nirrevocable.   No person shall have the right to revoke or amend\nthis trust agreement or any of its provisions. However, property\nacceptable to the trustee may be added to any trust from time to\ntime in the future by trusters or by any other person (including\nadditions pursuant to the provisions of the last will of any\nperson).\n\n     All references to \"trustee\" shall refer to the person or\npersons then acting as such.\n     A.    PRIMARY TRUST\n\nA-1.   Distributions . The income of the trust may be accumulated\nand retained, in whole or in part, or the trustee may distribute to\nDaniel, from time to time, so much or all of the trust estate as,\nin the trustee's discretion, is in Daniel's best interests.\n\nA-2.   Termination.  Daniel may withdraw any part or all of the\ntrust estate within 60 days after he becomes age 21, and may\nthereby terminate the trust as to the part withdrawn.    Exercise of\nthis withdrawal right shall be by one or more written instruments\ndelivered to the trustee within the 60-day period.    If or to the\nextent that Daniel does not exercise this withdrawal right, the\ntrust shall continue until Daniel becomes age 30 or dies before\nthat age, at which time the trust estate shall be distributed:\n\n     (a)    To Daniel.\n\n     (b) If Daniel is not then living, to such one or more\npersons, corporations or organizations (including Daniel's estate) ,\nas Daniel appoints by a will which specifically refers to this\npower of appointment.    If or to the extent that Daniel does not\neffectively exercise this power of appointment, the trust estate\nshall be distributed:\n\n     (1)    To Daniel's descendants.\n     (2)  If none of Daniel's descendants is then living, to\ntrustors' descendants.\n\n                           EXHIBIT A\n\f     ( 3} If none of trusters'       descendants   is   then living,   to\ntrusters' heirs.\nA-3. Payment of Taxes.     If Daniel's will contains no contrary\ndirections, the trustee shall pay from the trust estate the entire\nincrement in taxes payable by reason of Daniel's death (including\nany interest or penalties thereon} to the extent (if any} that the\ntotal of such taxes is greater than would have been imposed if no\nportion of the trust estate were taken into account in determining\nsuch taxes.\n\n     B.    CONTINGENT TRUSTS\nB-1. Trusts Established. Any portion of a trust estate upon the\ntrusts termination (other than a portion withdrawn by Daniel\npursuant to Paragraph A-2} which would be distributable to a\nbeneficiary who is under age 30 or to a beneficiary who is under a\nlegal disability instead shall be distributed to the trustee of a\nContingent Trust (unless otherwise directed by the valid exercise\nof a power of appointment} .       Each beneficiary's portion so\ndistributed shall be held and administered as the initial trust\nestate of a separate trust for the beneficiary.      However, if a\nContingent Trust is already in existence for that beneficiary, any\nadditional portion to be distributed to the trustee of a Contingent\nTrust for the beneficiary shall be added to the trust estate of the\nexisting contingent Trust.\nB-2. Distributions.      The income of each Contingent Trust may be\naccumulated and retained, in whole or in part, or the trustee may\ndistribute to the beneficiary for whom the trust was established,\nfrom time to time, so much or all of the trust estate as, in the\ntrustee's discretion, is in the beneficiary's best interests.\n\nB-3. Termination. Each Contingent Trust shall terminate when the\nbeneficiary for whom the trust was established has become age 30\nand is under no legal disability or upon the beneficiary's earlier\ndeath. Upon termination, the trust estate shall be distributed:\n\n     (a)    To the beneficiary.\n\n     (b)   If the beneficiary is not then living, to such one or\nmore persons, corporations or organizations as the beneficiary\nappoints by a will which specifically refers to this power of\nappointment.    If none of the beneficiary's descendants is then\nliving, this power may not be exercised in favor of the\nbenefici ary, the beneficiary's estate, the beneficiary's creditors\nor the creditors of the beneficiary's estate. If or to the extent\nthat the beneficiary does not effectively exercise this power of\nappointment, the trust estate shall be distributed:\n\n     (1)   To the beneficiary's descendants.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n                               EXHIBIT A\n\f     (2) If none of the beneficiary's descendants is then living,\nto the descendants of the beneficiary's nearest ancestor who was\none of trustors• descendants and who has descendants then living.\n\n     (3)  If none of these persons is then living, to trusters,\ndescendants.\n     ( 4) If none of trustors • descendants    is then   living,   to\ntrustors• heirs.\n\n       C.   DISTRIBUTIONS\nc-1. Distributions to or for Beneficiaries. During the term of a\ntrust, any distribution to be made to a beneficiary from the trust\nmay be made (i) to the beneficiary, {ii) if the beneficiary is\nunder a legal disability or if the trustee determines that the\nbeneficiary is unable to properly manage his affairs, to a person\nfurnishing support, maintenance or education for the beneficiary or\nwith whom the beneficiary is residing, for expenditure on the\nbeneficiary's behalf, or (iii) to a custodian for a minor\nbeneficiary, as selected by the trustee, under the Uniform Gifts to\nMinors Act of any state. Alternatively, the trustee may otherwise\napply all or a part of the distribution for the beneficiary • s\nbenefit. However, no such distribution shall be made to a trustor,\nto any spouse of a trustor, or in any manner that discharges a\nlegal obligation {including an obligation of support) of a trustor\nor any spouse of a trustor.

Each living child shall take one share and the share of\neach deceased child shall be divided among his then living\ndescendants in the same manner.   \"Trusters' descendants\" includes\nonly those persons descended from both trustors.\nF-3.   Heirs.   Any distribution to be made to the \"heirs\" of a\nperson shall be made to the individuals who would have inherited\nthe person's personal property if the person had died intestate at\nthe time the distribution is to be made, domiciled in Texas and not\nmarried, under the laws of Texas in force on the effective date of\nthis trust agreement, with the shares of taking determined by those\nlaws.

Unless\nwithin six months after the beneficiary's death the trustee has\nactual notice of the existence of proceedings to probate a will of\nthe beneficiary, the trustee shall assume that the beneficiary died\n                                -8-\n\fintestate. The foregoing provisions are intended to expedite the\nprompt and efficient administration of the trust and to protect the\ntrustee from any action taken or distribution made in accordance\nwith these provisions.

Warren (Daniel), Petitioner and Beneficiary of the Daniel Steven\n\nWeiner 1996 Trust, and files this Original Petition pursuant to the Court’s Order (attached\n\n“Exhibit A”) granting his Motion to Sever his causes of action from Cause No. 425,577, In Re\n\nDavid Abraham Weiner 1996 Trust. Petitioner seeks removal of Andy I. Weiner as Trustee of\n\nthe Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust and damages for breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n                                           PARTIES\n\n 1.    Daniel W. Warren, Petitioner, is an individual and Beneficiary of the Daniel Steven\n\n Weiner 1996 Trust (Daniel’s Trust). Daniel W. Warren resides in Harris County, Texas at\n\n 1226 Muirfield, Houston, TX 77055. The last three digits of his driver’s license number are\n\n 996. The last three digits of his Social Security number are 039.\n\n 2.    Andy I. Weiner, Respondent, is an individual acting as trustee of Daniel’s Trust. He\n\n appeared and answered as Respondent in Cause No. 425,577, from which this case was\n\n severed. Mr. Weiner currently resides at 111 Post Oak Blvd., Apartment 452, Houston,\n\n Texas 77056. He can be served through his attorney of record, Sarah Patel-Pacheco, Crain\n\n Caton & James, 1401 McKinney, 17th Floor, Houston, Texas 77010.\n\n 3. Katherine R. Warren, is an individual acting as trustee of Daniel’s Trust. She appeared and\n\n answered as a Respondent and Cross-Defendant in Cause No. 425,577 from which this case\n\n was severed. Petitioner released her of all liability in connection with her trusteeship\n                                                                                           EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                            exhibitsticker.com\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\n\n                                                                                             TAB L\n\fpursuant to Texas Property Code § 114.005 and on August 7, 2014, filed a Notice of Nonsuit\n\nagainst Ms. Warren in Cause No. 425,577, which applies to this case in the same manner as\n\nif it had been filed under this Cause No. 425,576-401.\n\n\n                              DISCOVERY CONTROL PLAN\n\n4.   This case is subject to the discovery control plan and deadlines set out in the Agreed\n\nDocket Control Order dated August 27, 2014 relating to Cause No. 425,577.\n\n                                           VENUE\n\n5.   Venue of this proceeding is proper in this Court pursuant to Texas Property Code §\n\n115.002(b).\n\n                                            FACTS\n\n6.     Daniel W. Warren is the sole beneficiary of the Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust\n\n(Daniel’s Trust), an irrevocable inter vivos trust created by Respondent Andy Weiner and\n\nKatherine Warren on March 20, 1996. A true and correct copy of the Trust Agreement is\n\nattached hereto as “Exhibit B” and is incorporated for all purposes. Although neither party\n\nhas a signed copy of Daniel’s Trust Agreement, the parties have admitted the authenticity of\n\nthe unsigned copy in pleadings and discovery.\n\n7.     Andy I. Weiner and Katherine R. Warren, are Trustors (settlors) and Trustees of\n\nDaniel’s Trust. Either trustee may serve alone if one of them should cease to act as trustee.\n\n[Paragraph D-1 of Daniel’s Trust Agreement].\n\n8.   The Trust Agreement grants the trustee discretion to make distributions for Daniel’s\n\nbest interest, considering his age, the income and transfer tax effects, the cost of his support,\n\nmaintenance, education, and comfort without regard to any other resources available to him\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\ffor these purposes, and any other factors the trustee deems relevant. [Paragraphs A-1 and C-2\n\nof Daniel’s Trust Agreement].\n\n9.    However, no distributions can be made “to a trustor, to any spouse of a trustor, or in\n\nany manner that discharges a legal obligation (including an obligation of support) of a trustor\n\nor any spouse of a trustor. Any distribution under this paragraph shall be a full discharge of\n\nthe trustee with respect thereto.” [Paragraph C-1 of the Trust Agreement].\n\n10.   Daniel’s Trust currently owns marketable securities worth approximately $108,043 as\n\nof September 30, 2014. The Trust assets came from a variety of sources, but primarily from\n\nDaniel’s grandparents who wrote checks payable to “Andy Weiner, Custodian for Daniel\n\nWeiner,” which Andy Weiner endorsed and deposited into Daniel’s Trust.\n\n11.   Daniel’s Trust Agreement provides that Daniel may withdraw the entire Trust corpus\n\nwithin 60 days after he becomes 21. To the extent Daniel does not exercise this withdrawal\n\nright, the Trust continues until Daniel becomes 30, or dies, whichever is earlier.\n\n12.   The Trust Agreement prohibits loans without adequate interest. It also prohibits loans to\n\na trustor as follows: “No power granted the trustee shall be construed to enable any person to\n\npurchase, exchange, or otherwise deal with or dispose of any trust estate for less than an\n\nadequate consideration in money or money’s worth or to authorize loans to any person\n\nwithout adequate interest. No part of any trust estate may be (i) loaned to a trustor or to any\n\nspouse of a trustor….” [Paragraph E-3(a) of the Trust Agreement]. Andy Weiner admits that\n\nhe read Paragraph E-3(a) before he borrowed the money. But he decided that “It was better\n\nto borrow money from this trust than go into bankruptcy.” [Deposition of Andy Weiner, Jan.\n\n16, 2014, page 33, lines 13-16].\n\n13.   The Trust Agreement waives the trustee’s common law duty to diversify the Trust\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\finvestments by permitting the trustee to invest in “property of any description,” including\n\n“property unproductive of income, 1 shares of open or closed end investment trusts or\n\ncompanies, wasting assets, 2 and any other property, regardless of location and without regard\n\nto any requirement of diversification as to kind or amount.” [Paragraph E-1(a) of Daniel’s\n\nTrust Agreement].\n\n14.   However, the Trust Agreement does not waive the trustee’s duty to exercise judgment\n\nor the duty not to speculate with Trust assets under Texas Property Code § 113.056, which\n\napplied prior to January 1, 2004, as follows:\n\n      Unless the terms of the trust instrument provide otherwise, in acquiring, investing,\n\n      reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, supervising, and managing trust\n\n      property… a trustee shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances\n\n      then prevailing that persons of ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence in\n\n      the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation but in regard\n\n      to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income from\n\n      as well as the probable increase in value and safety of their capital.\n\n15.   Nor does the Trust Agreement waive the trustee’s duty to prudently invest the Trust\n\nassets and make them productive. Texas Property Code § 117.004(a) provides that: “A\n\ntrustee shall invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor would, by considering the\n\npurposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust.” Langford\n\nv. Shamburger, 417 S.W.2d 438, 444-445, n.r.e. (It is a breach of fiduciary duty to\n\nunreasonably delay the investment of trust funds).\n\n\n1\n  “Property unproductive of income” is property that has with little or no income, but is expected to appreciate,\nsuch as raw land or growth oriented (low-yield) stocks. [Rest. 3rd, Trusts (Prudent Investor Rule § 227, cmts.]\n2\n  “Wasting assets” are those that are overproductive of income, such as an oil well or coal deposit that depletes\nitself through use over time. [Rest. 3rd, Trusts (Prudent Investor Rule § 227, cmts.]\n\n                                                       4\n\f16.   The Trust Agreement relieves the trustee of liability “for any act or omission except in\n\nthe case of gross negligence, bad faith or fraud. Specifically in assessing the propriety of any\n\ninvestment of a trust estate, the overall performance of the entire trust estate shall be taken\n\ninto account.” [Paragraph D-3(b) of the Trust Agreement] This Paragraph does not excuse\n\nAndy Weiner for intentionally breaching his fiduciary duty. Nor could it, because Texas\n\nProperty Code § 114.007(a) renders any term of a trust relieving a trustee of liability for an\n\nintentional breach of trust as unenforceable.\n\n17.   Andy Weiner began purchasing Weiners Stores Inc. stock for the Trust in 1999, shortly\n\nafter it began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board in August 1998. OTC stocks do not meet\n\nthe listing requirements of the national exchanges like NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ\n\nbecause they tend to be too small, closely held, thinly traded and risky.\n\n18.   Weiners Stores Inc. had just emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 1997, had\n\nonly 518 shareholders, and was trading at 12.5 cents to $1.50 a share in 1998 and 1999. 3 Its\n\nAnnual Report filed with the SEC in April 1999 reported that its sales were sliding and it had\n\nnot paid a dividend or had an operating profit in the last five years. Id.\n\n19.   Andy Weiner was aware that Weiners Stores Inc. was a risky investment. He was an\n\nexecutive officer of Weiners Stores Inc. for five to eight years before it filed for bankruptcy\n\nin 1995. [Andy Weiner Deposition, Jan. 16, 2014, p. 14, lines 1-17] Andy Weiner has a BA\n\nfrom Stanford and a Masters in Business from the University of Texas and is a retail\n\nshopping center developer. [Id. at p. 13, lines 16-25].\n\n20. Andy Weiner made several purchases of Weiner Stores Inc. stock for the Trust in May,\n\n\n\n3\n  Weiners Stores Inc. Annual Report - [X] Reg. S-K Item 405 - Form 10-K, available at\nhttp://www.secinfo.com/dRx61.68u.d.htm#6thPage.\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fJune, and August 1999, spending $28,764 of Trust money. By August 31, 1999, he had\n\naccumulated 52,000 shares of Weiners Stores Inc. stock in the Trust, which was over 65\n\npercent of its value. Intentionally placing such a large percentage of the Trust’s assets at a\n\nrisk of total loss was grossly negligent. [Dolan v. Dolan, 2009 Tex. App.-Houston Lexis\n\n4487 (The trustee, an experienced businessman, was grossly negligent and ordered to pay\n\nexemplary damages for placing nearly half the trust assets at risk of total loss.)]\n\n21. Weiner Stores Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again in October 2000. It\n\nannounced that it was closing all of its stores in June 2001. Andy Weiner sold the Trust’s\n\n52,000 shares in December 2001 for $2, resulting in a complete loss of the Trust’s $28,762\n\ninvestment. Weiners Stores Inc. converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy six months later.\n\n22.   During the three years that Daniel’s Trust funds were invested in Weiners Stores Inc.\n\nstock, Daniel’s Trust lost over 12 percent of its portfolio value each year. Investing in\n\nWeiners Stores Inc. was grossly negligent based on the “overall performance of the entire\n\ntrust estate,” which is the standard set forth in the Trust Agreement by which the propriety of\n\nan investment will be evaluated.\n\n23.   On March 30, 2009, Andy Weiner liquidated the Trust’s entire portfolio and on April 9,\n\n2009 he knowingly and intentionally instructed Fidelity to transfer $90,959.38 to his own\n\npersonal account at Fidelity. This left $1,000 in the Trust, with no promissory note, no\n\ninterest, and no security for the $90,959.38 loan to Andy Weiner, who was “on the edge of\n\nbankruptcy.” Andy Weiner knew that making the loan to himself was directly contrary to the\n\nTrust Agreement and that it would place the entire Trust portfolio at risk of loss by making\n\nan unsecured loan to a person on the edge of bankruptcy. [Dolan v. Dolan, 2009 Tex. App.-\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fHouston Lexis 4487 (The trustee was found to be grossly negligent and ordered to pay\n\nexemplary damages for loaning himself half the trust funds without interest or security.)]\n\n24.   On July 10, 2010, Andy Weiner repaid $90,959.38 to Daniel’s Trust without interest.\n\nThereafter, he purposely delayed reinvesting the Trust money for 26 months until September\n\n2012 when he finally invested the funds 51 percent in Fidelity Spartan 500 Index Fund\n\n(FUSEX), 31 percent in Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), and 18 percent in Fidelity Total Bond\n\nFund (FTBFX).\n\n25.   Had Andy Weiner invested Daniel’s Trust funds on April 9, 2009 in the same funds and\n\npercentages as he purchased for the Trust in September 2012, Daniel’s Trust would have\n\nearned $67,901 from April 9, 2009 to September 11, 2012. Yet the Trust earned less than\n\n$100 during this same time period. In fact, since its inception in 1996, Daniel’s Trust lost an\n\naverage of -1.167 percent per year. Based on the “overall performance of Daniel’s entire trust\n\nestate,” it was grossly negligent not to invest Daniel’s Trust money from April 9, 2009 to\n\nSeptember 11, 2012.\n\n26.   Failing to invest the Trust assets was also bad faith because Andy Weiner had an\n\nimproper motive for not investing the money. He planned to use the trust funds for his own\n\n“personal spending,” according to an email he wrote to Katherine in 2011 stating that he was\n\nready to consider investing the kid’s trust funds because “If we sell the Tractor’s in the near\n\nterm, we would not need their funds for our personal spending.” [Robson v. Gilbreath, 267\n\nS.W.3d 401, 407 (Tex. App.—Austin 2008, pet. denied) (“Improper motive is an essential\n\nelement of bad faith.”); In re Hubberd Testamentary Trust, 432 S.W.3d 358, 369 (Tex. App.\n\nSan Antonio 2014) (\"Bad faith is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but means the\n\nconscious doing of a wrong for dishonest, discriminatory, or malicious purpose.\").\n\n\n\n                                               7\n\f27.   Daniel W. Warren did not discover Andy Weiner’s breaches of fiduciary duty until\n\ndiscovery began in Cause No. 425,577. Daniel was a minor when the borrowings and\n\nimprudent investing occurred. The period of limitations does not begin to run against a\n\nperson entitled to bring an action for breach of fiduciary duty while the person is under 18\n\nyears old. [Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 16.001, 16.004.] Daniel W. Warren became age\n\n18 on March 11, 2014 and is thus within the limitations period for bringing this action.\n\n28.   On December 19, 2013, Daniel W. Warren, through his attorney, demanded an\n\naccounting of his Trust under Texas Property Code § 113.151-152. Andy Weiner has not yet\n\nprovided one.\n\n                                   CAUSES OF ACTION\n\n29.   Daniel W. Warren incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the\n\npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.\n\n30.   There is a real and justiciable controversy between Daniel W. Warren and Andy\n\nWeiner concerning Andy Weiner’s actions as trustee of Daniel’s Trust.\n\n31.   Andy Weiner has knowingly, intentionally, and with gross negligence breached his\n\nfiduciary duties in the following manner, resulting in a material loss to the Trust:\n\n      a.        By knowingly and intentionally exposing over 65 percent of Daniel’s Trust\n\n  funds to an extreme degree of risk by investing in Weiner Stores Inc., a highly speculative\n\n  unlisted penny stock with no earnings or dividend history, resulting in a complete loss of the\n\n  $28,762 investment, plus any future earnings it could have made, in violation of the duty to\n\n  prudently invest the Trust assets without speculation under the Texas Property Code §\n\n  113.056 as it applied prior to January 1, 2004, resulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\f    b.     By knowingly and intentionally instructing Fidelity to transfer nearly all of\n\nDaniel’s Trust funds to Andy Weiner’s own personal account at Fidelity on April 9, 2009, in\n\nviolation of the Trust Agreement, which expressly forbids “loans to a trustor or any spouse\n\nof a trustor” and “loans to any person without adequate interest” [Paragraph E-3(a) of the\n\nTrust Agreement], which Andy Weiner read before he transferred the money to himself,\n\nresulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n    c.     By knowingly and intentionally instructing Fidelity to transfer nearly all of\n\nDaniel’s Trust funds to Andy Weiner’s own personal account at Fidelity on April 9, 2009 in\n\nviolation of the Trust Agreement Paragraph C-1, which expressly forbids “distributions to a\n\ntrustor, or in any manner that discharges a legal obligation (including an obligation of\n\nsupport) of a trustor or any spouse of a trustor,” resulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n    d.     By failing to compensate Daniel’s Trust for Andy Weiner’s personal use of\n\n$90,959.38 belonging to the Trust, resulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n    e.     By knowingly and intentionally putting his own interest above the beneficiary’s\n\nby using Daniel’s Trust funds as Andy Weiner’s own money, in violation of the duty of\n\nloyalty under Texas Trust Code § 117.007, the duty not to profit by self-dealing with the\n\nTrust under Texas Trust Code § 114.0001(a), and the duty to segregate trust assets under\n\nRestatement of the Law Third (Trusts) § 179, resulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n    f.         By knowingly, intentionally, and with bad faith failing to invest Daniel’s\n\nTrust funds from April 9, 2009 to September 11, 2012 in violation of the duty to prudently\n\ninvest the Trust assets under Texas Property Code § 117.004 and the duty of loyalty under\n\nTexas Property Code § 117.007, resulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       g.          By refusing to render an accounting after written demand by Daniel W.\n\n   Warren on December 19, 2013 in violation of the duty to account under Texas Trust Code\n\n   §§ 113.151 and 113.152.\n\n 32.        Daniel and his Trust have suffered substantial economic damages as a direct result\n\n of Andy Weiner’s gross negligence and material breaches of fiduciary duty enumerated\n\n above.\n\n 33.      Removal of Andy Weiner as Trustee is necessary to prevent further harm to the Trust.\n\n\n                                   RELIEF REQUESTED\n\nWHEREFORE, Daniel W. Warren respectfully requests:\n\n  34. Judgment against Andy Weiner for a sum within the jurisdictional limits of the Court.\n\n  35. Monetary relief of over $200,000 but not more than $1,000,000.\n\n  36. Removal of Andy Weiner as Trustee of the Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust pursuant\n\n to Texas Property Code §§ 114.008(a)(7) and 113.082;\n\n  37. That Andy Weiner be ordered to pay money or restore property to Daniel’s Trust equal\n\n to the trust’s lost profits caused by Andy Weiner’s improper borrowing and failure to\n\n prudently invest the Trust funds, pursuant to Texas Property Code § 114.008(a)(3) and its\n\n predecessor Texas Property Code § 113.056;\n\n  38. That Andy Weiner be ordered to pay Daniel’s Trust exemplary damages of greater than\n\n two times the Trust’s economic damages based his knowing, intentional, and reckless dealing\n\n with Trust property worth over $20,000 in a manner that is contrary to the Trust Agreement\n\n and the Texas Property Code, and involved a substantial risk of loss to the Trust. [Tex. Civ.\n\n Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.008(b), 41.008(c)(10); Tex. Penal Code § 32.45].\n\n                                                10\n\f39. That Daniel W. Warren be awarded reasonable and necessary attorney fees, costs, and\n\nexpenses through trial and all appeals under applicable Texas law, including but not limited\n\nto Texas Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.001 and Texas Property Code §§ 114.064 and\n\n113.151(a).\n\n40. That Andy Weiner be ordered to submit an accounting that meets the requirements of\n\nTexas Property Code § 113.152 and personally bear the cost of the accounting pursuant to\n\nTexas Property Code § 113.151.\n\n41. That Daniel’s Trust be modified pursuant to Texas Property Code § 112.054(a)(3) to\n\nappoint Daniel Warren as co-Trustee with Katherine Warren, or alternatively to terminate the\n\nTrust and distribute the funds to Daniel Warren.\n\n42. That Daniel W. Warren and his Trust be awarded prejudgment and post judgment\n\ninterest at the rate of 5 percent as provided by the Texas Finance Code § 304.003(c), or as\n\notherwise appropriate.\n\n                                         PRAYER\n\n WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, Daniel W. Warren prays that the Court grant\n\n the requested relief and such further relief to which Daniel W.

Alternatively, the trustee may otherwise\napply all or a part of the distribution for the beneficiary's\nbenefit. However, no such distribution shall be made to a trustor,\nto any spouse of a trustor, or in any manner that discharges a\nlegal obligation (including an obligation of support) of a trustor\nor any spouse of a trustor. Any distribution under this paragraph\nshall be a full discharge of the trustee with respect thereto.\n\nc-2.  Best Interests of Beneficiary.    In making distributions in\nthe \"best interests\" of a beneficiary, the trustee may consider the\nage of the beneficiary, the costs of the beneficiary's support,\nmaintenance, education and comfort without regard to any other\nresources available to the beneficiary for these purposes, the\neffect of any distribution upon the income and transfer tax\nliability of the beneficiary or of the trust, and any other factors\ndeemed relevant by the trustee.\n\n       D.

If at\nany time there is no trustee acting and none has been appointed, a\nmajority of the beneficiaries (acting through the beneficiary's\nnatural or legal guardian or legal representative, in the case of\na beneficiary under a legal disability) who might then be entitled\nto receive a distribution from the trust estate shall appoint a\nsuccessor trustee.\n     (d)   Appointment of Co-Trustee.   The     trustee    (acting\nunanimously if more than one) may appoint one or more co-trustees.\n     (e) Who May Be Appointed.

Appointment shall be made by\nwritten instrument filed with the trust records.          Any such\nappointment may be changed or revoked prior to the date it becomes\neffective.   Any such appointment may be limited in any manner\ndeemed advisable by the person making the appointment, including,\nfor example, restricting the power over distributions as necessary\nto avoid the imposition of any tax upon the trust, the appointee or\nthe appointee's estate.\nD-2. Resignation of Trustee. A trustee may resign from a trust\nwithout the necessity of any court proceeding upon meeting these\nconditions:\n     (a) Notice . At least 30 days' written notice      (if not waived)\nshall be given to each beneficiary who might then       be entitled to\nreceive a distribution from the trust estate. If a      beneficiary is\nunder a legal disability, notice shall be given to       (or waived by)\nthe beneficiary's natural or legal guardian.\n     (b)   Accounting .  If and to the e x tent required by the\nsuccessor trustee, an accounting for the administration of the\ntrust shall be given to the successor trustee.      The successor\ntrustee shall be fully protected in relying upon such accounting.\nD-3.   Rights and Liabilities.\n\n       (a) Bond Not Required. No bond or other security shall be\n       required of any trustee.\n\n       (b)   Liabilities.

The trustee may maintain and\ndefend any claim or controversy by or against the trust without the\njoinder or consent of any beneficiary.\n      (h)    Additional Powers. In addition, the trustee shall have\nall rights, privileges and powers now or hereafter granted to\ntrustees in Texas, including those granted under the Texas Trust\nCode.     Any subsequent legislation or regulation expanding or\nlimiting the rights, privileges and powers granted a trustee shall\napply to all trusts hereunder unless the trustee elects not to have\nsuch legislation or regulation apply to a particular trust by a\nwritten instrument filed with the trust records.       However, the\nprovisions made for the various beneficiaries under this trust\nagreement are exclusive. Any statute that purports to enlarge the\nclass of beneficiaries to whom distributions may be made or the\npurposes for which distributions may be made shall not apply to any\ntrust.    All trust powers may be exercised upon such terms as the\ntrustee deems advisable and may affect trust properties for any\nlength of time regardless of the duration of the trust. Generally,\nand subject only to the terms of this trust agreement, the trustee\nshall hold, manage, control, use, invest, reinvest, and dispose of\nthe trust estate to the same extent as if the trustee were the fee\nsimple owner thereof.\nE-2.     Principal and Income Determinations.      The receipts,\ndisbursements and reserves of each trust may be allocated, on a\ncash or accrual basis, between principal and income in the\ntrustee's discretion without regard to the provisions of any\nstatute.

No part of any\ntrust estate may be (i) loaned to a trustor or to any spouse of a\ntrustor or (ii) applied to the payment of premiums on policies of\ninsurance on the life of a trustor or on the life of any spouse of\na trustor.\n\n                                -6-\n\f      (b)  Distributions to or for Trustee. Any power to make\ndiscretionary distributions to or for the benefit of a person who\nis serving as trustee of a trust (including distributions to the\nperson's spouse and distributions in discharge of any legal\nobligation of the person) shall be exercisable solely by the\ntrustee or trustees other than that person. If no other trustee is\nthen serving, such power shall not be exercisable.\n\nE-4. Release and Delegations of Powers. Any power granted to a\ntrustee may be released, in whole or in part, temporarily or\npermanently. Except as provided in Paragraph E-3, any such power\nmay be delegated, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently,\nto any other trustee then acting. A release or delegation shall be\nby written instrument filed with the records of each trust to which\nthe release or delegation applies.\n     F.   DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS\nF-1.

A\nposthumous child shall be considered as living at the death of his\nparent. Whenever a distribution is to be made to the descendants\nof any person, the property to be distributed shall be divided into\nas many equal shares as there are living children of the person and\ndeceased children of the person who left descendants who are then\nliving.  Each living child shall take one share and the share of\neach deceased child shall be divided among his then living\ndescendants in the same manner.   \"Trusters' descendants\" includes\nonly those persons descended from both trusters.\nF-3.   Heirs.   Any distribution to be made to the \"heirs\" of a\nperson shall be made to the individuals who would have inherited\nthe person's personal property if the person had died intestate at\nthe time the distribution is to be made, domiciled in Texas and not\nmarried, under the laws of Texas in force on the effective date of\nthis trust agreement, with the shares of taking determined by those\nlaws.

Powers of Appointment Exercisable by Beneficiaries.       In\nexercising a power of appointment given to a beneficiary by this\ntrust agreement, the beneficiary may appoint the property subject\nto the power outright to the appointee, in trust, or to a custodian\nfor the appointee under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act of any\nstate.

He may\nimpose lawful conditions on an appointment and,, in general, may\nappoint to or among the appointees in any lawful manner.\nIn determining whether, in what manner and to what extent a\ntestamentary power of appointment has been exercised by a\nbeneficiary, the trustee may act in reliance upon a court order\nadmitting an instrument to probate as the beneficiary's last will\nor an order finding that the beneficiary died intestate.     Unless\nwithin six months after the beneficiary's death the trustee has\nactual notice of the existence of proceedings to probate a will of\nthe beneficiary, the trustee shall assume that the beneficiary died\n                                -8-\n\fintestate. The foregoing provisions are intended to expedite the\nprompt and efficient administration of the trust and to protect the\ntrustee from any action taken or distribution made in accordance\nwith these provisions.   Nothing in this paragraph shall limit or\nqualify any power of appointment given by this trust agreement or\nany right which an appointee or taker in default of appointment may\nhave against any person receiving a distribution from the trustee\nirrespective of the place of probate or of the time of discovery of\na will exercising the power or any other action taken in the\nbeneficiary's estate.\n\n     G.

If Daniel's will contains no contrary\ndirections, the trustee shall pay from the trust estate the entire\nincrement in taxes payable by reason of Daniel's death (including\nany interest or penalties thereon) to the extent (if any) that the\ntotal of such taxes is greater than would have been imposed if no\nportion of the trust estate were taken into account in determining\nsuch taxes.\n\n     B.    CONTINGENT TRUSTS\nB-1. Trusts Established. Any portion of a trust estate upon the\ntrusts termination (other than a portion withdrawn by Daniel\npursuant to Paragraph A-2) which would be distributable to a\nbeneficiary who is under age 30 or to a beneficiary who is under a\nlegal disability instead shall be distributed to the trustee of a\nContingent Trust (unless otherwise directed by the valid exercise\nof a power of appointment) .       Each beneficiary's portion so\ndistributed shall be held and administered as the initial trust\nestate of a separate trust for the beneficiary.      However, if a\nContingent Trust is already in existence for that beneficiary, any\nadditional portion to be distributed to the trustee of a Contingent\nTrust for the beneficiary shall be added to the trust estate of the\nexisting contingent Trust.\nB-2. Distributions.      The income of each Contingent Trust may be\naccumulated and retained, in whole or in part, or the trustee may\ndistribute to the beneficiary for whom the trust was established,\nfrom time to time, so much or all of the trust estate as, in the\ntrustee's discretion, is in the beneficiary's best interests.\n\nB-3. Termination. Each Contingent Trust shall terminate when the\nbeneficiary for whom the trust was established has become age 30\nand is under no legal disability or upon the beneficiary's earlier\ndeath. Upon termination, the trust estate shall be distributed:\n\n     (a)    To the beneficiary.\n\n     (b)  If the beneficiary is not then living, to such one or\nmore persons, corporations or organizations as the beneficiary\nappoints by a will which specifically refers to this power of\nappointment.   If none of the beneficiary's descendants is then\nliving, this power may not be exercised in favor of the\nbeneficiary, the beneficiary's estate, the beneficiary's creditors\nor the creditors of the beneficiary's estate. If or to the extent\nthat the beneficiary does not effectively exercise this power of\nappointment, the trust estate shall be distributed:\n\n     (1)   To the beneficiary's descendants.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f     (2) If none of the beneficiary's descendants is then living,\nto the descendants of the beneficiary's nearest ancestor who was\none of trustors' descendants and who has descendants then living.\n     (3)  If none of these persons is then living, to trusters,\ndescendants.\n     ( 4) If none of trusters'    descendants   is then   living,   to\ntrusters' heirs.\n       C.

Alternatively, the trustee may otherwise\napply all or a part of the distribution for the beneficiary's\nbenefit. However, no such distribution shall be made to a trustor,\nto any spouse of a trustor, or in any manner that discharges a\nlegal obligation (including an obligation of support) of a trustor\nor any spouse of a trustor. Any distribution under this paragraph\nshall be a full discharge of the trustee with respect thereto.\n\nc-2.  Best Interests of Beneficiary.    In making distributions in\nthe \"best interests\" of a beneficiary, the trustee may consider the\nage of the beneficiary, the costs of the beneficiary's support,\nmaintenance, education and comfort without regard to any other\nresources available to the beneficiary for these purposes, the\neffect of any distribution upon the income and transfer tax\nliability of the beneficiary or of the trust, and any other factors\ndeemed relevant by the trustee.\n\n       D.   OFFICE OF TRUSTEE\n\nD-1.   Successor Trustee, Co-Trustee.  The following provisions\nshall apply to each separate trust established under this trust\nagreement:\n\n      (a) Successor Trustee.  Should Andy I. Weiner or Katherine\nFriedman Weiner cease to act as trustee, for any reason, the one\nremaining shall continue to act as trustee.   Should both Andy I.\nWeiner and Katherine Friedman Weiner cease to act as trustees, for\nany reason, trustors appoint Bayle Weiner Drubel as successor\ntrustee.\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f     (b) Appointment of Successor Trustee by Trustee. At any time\nafter qualifying as trustee, any trustee may appoint a successor\ntrustee to act in his place, either immediately or in the future\nupon any stated contingency, and may thereby supplement the\nprovisions of subparagraph (a).\n      (c) Appointment of Successor Trustee by Beneficiaries. If at\nany time there is no trustee acting and none has been appointed, a\nmajority of the beneficiaries (acting through the beneficiary's\nnatural or legal guardian or legal representative, in the case of\na beneficiary under a legal disability) who might then be entitled\nto receive a distribution from the trust estate shall appoint a\nsuccessor trustee.\n     (d)   Appointment of Co-Trustee.   The     trustee    (acting\nunanimously if more than one) may appoint one or more co-trustees.\n     (e) Who May Be Appointed. A successor trustee or co-trustee\nmay be any individual, bank or trust company and may be domiciled\nanywhere.\n      (f) Procedure for Appointment. Appointment shall be made by\nwritten instrument filed with the trust records.          Any such\nappointment may be changed or revoked prior to the date it becomes\neffective.   Any such appointment may be limited in any manner\ndeemed advisable by the person making the appointment, including,\nfor example, restricting the power over distributions as necessary\nto avoid the imposition of any tax upon the trust, the appointee or\nthe appointee's estate.\nD-2. Resignation of Trustee. A trustee may resign from a trust\nwithout the necessity of any court proceeding upon meeting these\nconditions:\n     (a) Notice. At least 30 days' written notice       (if not waived)\nshall be given to each beneficiary who might then       be entitled to\nreceive a distribution from the trust estate. If a      beneficiary is\nunder a legal disability, notice shall be given to       (or waived by)\nthe beneficiary's natural or legal guardian.\n     (b)   Accounting.   If and to the extent required by the\nsuccessor trustee, an accounting for the administration of the\ntrust shall be given to the successor trustee.      The successor\ntrustee shall be fully protected in relying upon such accounting.\nD-3.   Rights and Liabilities.\n\n       (a) Bond Not Required. No bond or other security shall be\n       required of any trustee.\n\n       (b)   Liabilities.   This agreement shall always be construed in\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffavor of the validity of any act by or omission of any trustee. A\ntrustee shall not be liable for any act or omission except in the\ncase of gross negligence, bad faith or fraud.

Each trustee shall be entitled to receive\nreasonable compensation for services actually rendered to a trust.\n\n     E.   ADMINISTRATION\n\nE-1. General Powers of Trustee.

The trustee may maintain and\ndefend any claim or controversy by or against the trust without the\njoinder or consent of any beneficiary.\n      (h)    Additional Powers. In addition, the trustee shall have\nall rights, privileges and powers now or hereafter granted to\ntrustees in Texas, including those granted under the Texas Trust\nCode.     Any subsequent legislation or regulation expanding or\nlimiting the rights, privileges and powers granted a trustee shall\napply to all trusts hereunder unless the trustee elects not to have\nsuch legislation or regulation apply to a particular trust by a\nwritten instrument filed with the trust records.       However, the\nprovisions made for the various beneficiaries under this trust\nagreement are exclusive. Any statute that purports to enlarge the\nclass of beneficiaries to whom distributions may be made or the\npurposes for which distributions may be made shall not apply to any\ntrust.    All trust powers may be exercised upon such terms as the\ntrustee deems advisable and may affect trust properties for any\nlength of time regardless of the duration of the trust. Generally,\nand subject only to the terms of this trust agreement, the trustee\nshall hold, manage, control, use, invest, reinvest, and dispose of\nthe trust estate to the same extent as if the trustee were the fee\nsimple owner thereof.\nE-2.     Principal and Income Determinations.      The receipts,\ndisbursements and reserves of each trust may be allocated, on a\ncash or accrual basis, between principal and income in the\ntrustee's discretion without regard to the provisions of any\nstatute.

If no other trustee is\nthen serving, such power shall not be exercisable.\n\nE-4. Release and Delegations of Powers. Any power granted to a\ntrustee may be released, in whole or in part, temporarily or\npermanently. Except as provided in Paragraph E-3, any such power\nmay be delegated, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently,\nto any other trustee then acting.

A\nposthumous child shall be considered as living at the death of his\nparent. Whenever a distribution is to be made to the descendants\nof any person, the property to be distributed shall be divided into\nas many equal shares as there are living children of the person and\ndeceased children of the person who left descendants who are then\nliving.  Each living child shall take one share and the share of\neach deceased child shall be divided among his then living\ndescendants in the same manner.   \"Trusters' descendants\" includes\nonly those persons descended from both trusters.\nF-3.   Heirs.   Any distribution to be made to the \"heirs\" of a\nperson shall be made to the individuals who would have inherited\nthe person's personal property if the person had died intestate at\nthe time the distribution is to be made, domiciled in Texas and not\nmarried, under the laws of Texas in force on the effective date of\nthis trust agreement, with the shares of taking determined by those\nlaws.

Any trust still in force at the end\nof such period shall terminate, and the trust estate shall be\ndistributed to the beneficiary for whom the trust was established.\nF-9.   Powers of Appointment Exercisable by Beneficiaries.       In\nexercising a power of appointment given to a beneficiary by this\ntrust agreement, the beneficiary may appoint the property subject\nto the power outright to the appointee, in trust, or to a custodian\nfor the appointee under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act of any\nstate. If the beneficiary appoints to a custodian, he may select\nthe custodian. If the beneficiary appoints in trust, he may select\nthe trustee or trustees, may establish such administrative terms\nfor the trust as he deems appropriate, and may impose lawful\nspendthrift restrictions.

He may create life interests\nor other limited interests in some appointees with future interests\nin favor of other appointees, may appoint different types of\ninterests among the appointees, and may create new powers of\nappointment in a trustee or trustees or in any appointee. He may\nimpose lawful conditions on an appointment and,, in general, may\nappoint to or among the appointees in any lawful manner.\nIn determining whether, in what manner and to what extent a\ntestamentary power of appointment has been exercised by a\nbeneficiary, the trustee may act in reliance upon a court order\nadmitting an instrument to probate as the beneficiary's last will\nor an order finding that the beneficiary died intestate.     Unless\nwithin six months after the beneficiary's death the trustee has\nactual notice of the existence of proceedings to probate a will of\nthe beneficiary, the trustee shall assume that the beneficiary died\n                                -8-\n\fintestate. The foregoing provisions are intended to expedite the\nprompt and efficient administration of the trust and to protect the\ntrustee from any action taken or distribution made in accordance\nwith these provisions.   Nothing in this paragraph shall limit or\nqualify any power of appointment given by this trust agreement or\nany right which an appointee or taker in default of appointment may\nhave against any person receiving a distribution from the trustee\nirrespective of the place of probate or of the time of discovery of\na will exercising the power or any other action taken in the\nbeneficiary's estate.\n\n     G.

As such, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are jointly\n\nresponsible for the administration and liabilities of David's Trust and Daniel's Trust\n\n(collectively, the \"Trusts\"), if any.\n\n2.       Accordingly, Mr. Weiner files the following cross-claims against Ms. Warren:\n\n         a. Contribution;\n         b. Breaches of Fiduciary Duty;\n         c. Removal of Trustee; and\n         d. Tortious Interference with Administration.\n\n                                                 II.\n                                        Factual Background\n\n3.       On December 13, 1994, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren established David's Trust for the\n\nbenefit of their then-minor son, David. See David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust agreement,\n\n                                                                                                     EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                                 exhibitsticker.com\n092865/000002\n376 -1273851vl                                                                                         TAB M\n\fattached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated by this reference. The irrevocable trust agreement\n\nprovides that David is the primary beneficiary and Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are the co-\n\ntrustees.\n\n4.       On March 11, 1996, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren established Daniel's Trust for the\n\nbenefit of their then-minor son, Daniel S. Weiner (\"Daniel\"). See Daniel Steven Weiner 1996\n\nTrust, attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated by this reference. The irrevocable trust\n\nagreement provides that Daniel is the primary beneficiary and Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are\n\nthe original co-trustees. Exhibit B.\n\n5.       Both David's Trust agreement and Daniel's Trust agreement specifically provide that:\n\n         a.      Ms. Warren and Mr. Weiner are to act jointly as co-trustees;\n         b.      A trustee shall not be held liable for any act or omission, except in the case of\n                 gross negligence, bad faith or fraud; and\n         c.      The overall performance of the Trust shall be taken into account when assessing\n                 the propriety of any investment of the Trust.\n\nSee Exhibits A and B.\n\n6.       Additionally, the agreements of the Trusts grant Ms. Warren and Mr. Weiner, as co-\n                                                                                          1\ntrustees of the Trusts, the general powers to: (i) invest and reinvest the Trust assets    ;   (ii) lease,\n\nsell, transfer or encumber, in any manner, all or any part of the Trust 2 ; and (iii) loan or borrow\n\nmoney from the Trust, in any manner. 3\n\n7.       Ms. Warren and David's original lawsuit, filed solely against Mr. Weiner, sought an\n\norder from this Court to either distribute David's Trust funds to David free of trust or,\n\nalternatively, to award Ms. Warren sole and exclusive control over a new account (a Uniform\n\nTransfers to Minors Act account created for David's benefit), even though the Trust agreement\n\n\n1\n  Exhibit A§ E-l(a); Exhibit B § E-l(a).\n2\n  Exhibit A§ E-l(c); Exhibit B § E·l(a).\n3\n  Exhibit A§ E-l(c); Exhibit B § E-l(a).\n\n\n                                                  2\n092865/000002\n376- 127385lvl\n\fand the Divorce Decree provide otherwise. In the original Petition, Ms. Warren and David stated\n\nthat Ms. Warren would submit an accounting and sought her discharge from any liabilities\n\nrelating to the Trust.\n\n8.       Since originally filed, counsel for Ms. Warren and David has filed an amended petition\n\nthat now names only David as the Petitioner, ·and Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren as Respondents.\n\nIn the amended petition, David instead sought to be his own trustee.\n\n9.       David testified in his partial deposition that he is not aware of any breaches of trust by\n\neither Mr. Weiner or Ms. Warren. Irrespective of this testimony under oath, David filed yet\n\nanother amended petition asserting various claims solely against Mr. Weiner, even though both\n\nMr. Weiner and Ms. Warren have served as co-trustees since the inception of David's Trust.\n\n10.      Since the filing of David's second amended petition, Daniel, David's younger brother,\n                                                                  4\nfiled an original petition in intervention in this proceeding.\n\nII.      As co-trustees of the Trust, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are jointly responsible for the\n\nadministration of the Trust. Accordingly, in the event damages are assessed against Mr. Weiner\n\ndue to his role as co-trustee of David's Trust and/or Daniel's Trust, Ms. Warren is responsible\n\nfor 50% of those damages, in addition to 50% of Mr. Weiner's attorneys' fees and costs incurred\n\nin defending this action.\n\n                                                     III.\n                              Cross-Claims Against Katherine Warren\n\n12.      Mr. Weiner incorporates by reference the factual allegations contained within the\n\npreceding Paragraphs 1 through 11.\n\n\n\n\n4\n Mr. Weiner does not concede that Daniel has standing to bring any claims against Mr. Weiner in this proceeding\nnor does Mr. Weiner agree with Daniel's alleged legal basis to intervene in the above-referenced proceeding.\n\n\n                                                      3\n092865/000002\n376- 127385lvl\n\f        A.       Cross-Claim for Contribution.\n\n13.     In David's Second Amended Petition, he seeks to hold Mr. Weiner liable for breaches of\n\nfiduciary duty in his capacity as David's Trust. See Second Amended Petition at         ~14,    on file\n\nwith this Court.\n\n14.     Likewise, in Daniel's Petition in Intervention, Daniel seeks to hold Mr. Weiner liable for\n\nbreaches of fiduciary duty in his capacity as co-trustee of Daniel's Trust.         See Petition in\n\nIntervention at ~34, on file with this Court.\n\n15.     It is undisputed that Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren were named as initial co-trustees of\n\nboth David's Trust and Daniel's Trust. Pursuant to Texas Property (Trust) Code, co-trustees are\n\nto act jointly in administering the Trust. TEX. PROP. CODE § 113.085. Ms. Warren has failed to\n\njointly administer the Trusts with Mr. Weiner.\n\n16.      Further, Ms. Warren has failed to delegate her powers or duties as co-trustee of the Trusts\n\nto Mr. Weiner. Pursuant to Texas Property (Trust) Code Section 113.085(c):\n\n                 (c)      A co-trustee shall participate in the performance of a trustee's\n                 function unless the co-trustee:\n                          ( 1) is unavailable to perform the function because of absence,\n                 illness, disqualification under other law, or other temporary incapacity; or\n                          (2) has delegated the performance of the function to another\n                 trustee in accordance with the terms of the trust or applicable law, has\n                 communicated the delegation to all other co-trustees, and has filed the\n                 delegation in the records of the trust.\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE§ 113.085 (c) (emphasis added).\n\n17.      And, the Trusts expressly provide that a co-trustee may only release or delegate her\n\npowers as follows:\n\n                 E-4. Release and Delegations of Powers. Any power granted to a trustee\n                 may be released, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently. Except\n                 as provided in Paragraph E-3, any such power may be delegated, in whole\n                 or in part, temporarily or permanently, to any other trustee then acting. A\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n092865/000002\n376- 127385Jvl\n\f1:0                    release or delegation shall be by written instrument filed with the records\n                       of each trust to which the release or delegation applies.\n\n      See Exhibit A § E-4 (emphasis added); Exhibit B § E-4 (emphasis added).\n\n      18.       Ms. Warren never communicated any intent to delegate her co-trustee duties to Mr.\n\n      Weiner nor has she filed a written instrument delegating or releasing any powers to Mr. Weiner,\n\n      as required by the terms of the Trusts. In short, there is no evidence that Ms. Warren has\n\n      delegated the performance of her co-trustee functions to Mr. Weiner.          TEX. PROP. CODE §\n\n      113.085(c)(2).\n\n      19.       Mr. Weiner seeks to hold Ms. Warren responsible for 50% of any liabilities assessed\n\n      against the Trusts and/or him relating to the actions sought by any beneficiary, including, but not\n\n      limited to, holding Ms. Warren liable for 50% of the attorneys' fees, accountant fees, and costs\n\n      incurred by Mr. Weiner as a result ofthe above-referenced litigation.\n\n      20.       Thus, pursuant to Section 33.016 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, Mr.\n\n      Weiner asserts a contribution claim against Ms. Warren for any liability that may be imposed on\n\n      him pursuant to the breach of fiduciary duty claims brought by David and/or Daniel in the instant\n\n      litigation.\n\n                B.     Cross-Claim for Breaches of Fiduciary Duty.\n\n      21.       Ms. Warren, as co-trustee, serves in various fiduciary capacities for David and Daniel.\n\n      Trustees are held to a \"very high and very strict standard of conduct which equity demands\".\n\n      Slay v. Burnett's Trust, 187 S.W.2d 377,387-88 (Tex. 1945).\n\n      22. _ As a fiduciary and co-trustee of the Trusts, Ms. Warren has breached the following\n\n      duties:\n\n                a. Duty of loyalty;\n                b. Duty of competence;\n                c. Duty of competence by failing to administer the Trusts pursuant to their terms;\n\n\n                                                        5\n      092865/000002\n      376- 1273851v1\n\f         d. Duty of full disclosure;\n         e. Duty to act with integrity of the strictest kind;\n         f.      Duty to act with due diligence;\n         g. Duty to exercise reasonable discretion; and\n         h. Duty to act as a reasonably prudent person.\n\n23.      Ms. Warren breached her fiduciary duties, which resulted in injury.\n\n24.      Thus, in accordance with recognized principles of fiduciary law, Mr. Weiner seeks an\n\naward of actual damages and, since Ms. Warren's conduct was intentional, punitive damages.\n\n         c.         Cross-Claim for the Removal of Ms. Warren as Trustee.\n\n25.      Ms. Warren, through her hostile actions and position of influence, has turned both Daniel\n\nand David against their father, Mr. Weiner. Despite Mr. Weiner's valiant attempts, Ms. Warren\n\nhas failed and refused to engage with Mr. Weiner to administer the Trusts.\n\n26.      By these acts, Ms. Warren has created a hostile environment for David, Daniel and Mr.\n\nWeiner.\n\n27.      Accordingly, Mr. Weiner files this cross-claim for the removal of Ms. Warren as trustee\n\nof the Trusts.\n\n         D.         Cross-Claim for Tortious Interference with Administration.\n\n28.      Through her actions, Ms. Warren has tortiously interfered with Mr. Weiner's ability to\n\nproperly administer the Trusts. Ms. Warren has interfered with the administration of the Trusts\n\nby initiating unnecessary litigious proceedings against Mr. Weiner, by and through David and\n\nDaniel, and continuously failing to act in the best interests of David and Daniel, to the detriment\n\nofMr. Weiner.\n\n29.      Such acts have proximately caused and prevented and interfered with the ability of Mr.\n\nWeiner to properly administer Decedent's Estate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n092865/000002\n376- 1273851vl                  ..\n\f       30.      Ms. Warren's acts have resulted in the incurrence of unnecessary expenses, damages or\n\n       loss to the Trusts, for which recovery from her is proper in an amount within the jurisdictional\nc~.o\n       limits of the Court.\n\n       31.      Mr. Weiner seeks actual and punitive damages for Ms. Warren's tortious interference with\n\n       administration and for her intentional and malicious conduct.\n\n                                                   IV.\n                                     Damages and Other Relief Requested\n\n       32.      Mr. Weiner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing background\n\n       allegations and causes of action in support of the damages sought below.\n\n                A.      Actual Damages.\n\n       33.      Based on the acts and occurrences set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Ms. Warren\n\n       breached her fiduciary duties, proximately causing significant loss to the Trusts and actual\n\n       damages to the Trusts.\n\n       34.      As a result of Ms. Warren's breaches of fiduciary duties, tortious interference with\n\n       administration, and bad acts constituting her removal as trustee of the Trusts, which were the\n\n       proximate cause of damages to Mr. Weiner and the Trusts, Mr. Weiner is entitled to damages\n\n       from Ms. Warren.\n\n                B.      Punitive Damages.\n\n       35.      As a result of Ms. Warren's intentional and willful breaches of fiduciary duty and tortious\n\n       interference with administration, Mr. Weiner seeks punitive damages from Ms. Warren.\n\n                C.      Additional Relief Sought.\n\n       36.      Mr. Weiner is entitled to pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and costs of court in\n\n       all amounts awarded hereunder as allowed by law. He specifically sues for recovery of pre-\n\n       judgment and post-judgment interest and recovery of costs of court under the applicable\n\n\n\n                                                         7\n       092865/000002\n       376- 1273851v1\n\f           provisions ofthe laws ofthe State ofTexas.\n\n           37.      With regard to claims by David and/or related to David's Trust, Mr. Weiner, individually\n\n           and as co-trustee, respectfully requests the following relief:\n\n                    a.      To the extent of any claims of David, Ms. Warren shall be held responsible for all\n                            actions and alleged inactions of the trustees;\n\nI   '\\1'            b.      To the extent of any claims of David, Ms. Warren shall be held equally liable for\n                            all claimed damages and relief sought by David, as finally determined, if any;\n\n                    c.      Ms. Warren shall be held liable for any and all violations of David's Trust\n                            agreement, including any plan or scheme to collude with David;\n\n                    d.      Ms. Warren shall be held equally responsible for the preparation and submission\n                            of any accounting determined to be due and personally bear one-half of the costs\n                            of the accounting pursuant to § 113.151 of the Texas Trust Code; and\n\n                    e.      Ms. Warren shall be ordered to pay one-half of Mr. Weiner's attorneys' fees and\n                            costs incurred as a result of defending the lawsuit.\n\n           38.      With regard to claims by Daniel and/or related to Daniel's Trust, Mr. Weiner,\n\n           individually and as co-trustee, respectfully requests the following relief:\n\n                    a.      To the extent any claims of Daniel are validly asserted in this proceeding, Ms.\n                            Warren shall be held responsible for all actions and alleged inactions of the\n                            trustees;\n\n                    b.      To the extent any claims of Daniel are validly asserted in this proceeding, Ms.\n                            Warren shall be held equally liable for all claimed damages and relief sought by\n                            Daniel, as finally determined, if any;\n\n                    c.      Ms. Warren shall be held liable for any and all violations of Daniel's Trust\n                            agreement, including any plan or scheme to collude with Daniel;\n\n                    d.      Ms. Warren shall be held equally responsible for the preparation and submission\n                            of any accounting determined to be due, and personally bear one-half of the costs\n                            ofthe accounting pursuant to §113.151 ofthe Texas Trust Code; and\n\n                    e.

So, she was out.\n\n19                   Andy Weiner had affirmative defenses but\n\n20   no counter-claims against Daniel.\n\n21                   Andy Weiner had cross-claims against\n\n22   Katherine but not in Daniel's case.      They were all in\n\n23   the case that David filed.      And so at the moment in time\n\n24   that he nonsuited, and at the time he was dismissed,\n\n25   under Greenberg versus Brookshire, the case was over.\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

What I have in Exhibit 1\n\n 6   for you, Sarah,   is the Daniel's nonsuit of his entire\n\n 7   case against Andy Weiner.      And I have this Ccurt's order\n\n 8   granting his nonsuit and dismissal.       His nonsuit was\n\n 9   March lOth; the dismissal was March 16th; anc the\n\n10   counter and cross-petition was March 24th.\n\n11                  MS.

I always fine it's\n\n16   easier to refer to each document separately in the\n\n17   record if that's okay.\n\n18                  MS. CANTRELL:     Okay.   That's fine.\n\n19                  We'll mark those Exhibit 1 for the notice\n\n20   of nonsuit.   Exhibit 2 for the dismissal.

And one of the footnotes in tte response\n\n 7   that,   I guess, Ms. Beduze or Ms. Pacheco filed last\n\n 8   night about 5:00, said that it was administrative error\n\n 9   that this cross-claim got left off of the liEt of\n\n10   documents that were transferred to Daniel's case.           And\n\n11   so, I would like to admit Exhibit 4 as the Second\n\n12   Amended Cross-Claims to show, number one,        that it was in\n\n13   David's case only.\n\n14                   MS.

It started with a draft of a, of a list that\n\n14   Ms. Beduze put together, and it's in substantial\n\n15   identical form as the one that was actually      ~igned.       And\n\n16   we went back and forth with certain changes to the\n\n17   language on it - who was going to pay for the cost and\n\n18   so forth; but essentially, it was negotiated.         It was\n\n19   in the email - this is from Judge Comstock tc me and\n\n20   Kathleen Beduze - she said,     \"Are there any acditional\n\n21   items that you would like to include in the crder to\n\n22   protect the order?\"\n\n23                  So we all,   I believe, had ample\n\n24   opportunity to add to, subtract, and it didn't make it.\n\n25   Just to clear the record that that is not pait of\n\n\n          HIPOLITA G.

It's hearsay, it's inappropriate, and this\n\n 6   doesn't constitute anything but the efforts of lawyers\n\n 7   trying to do the right thing.      The document speaks for\n\n 8   itself.\n\n 9                   MS.

PACHECO:    The Court's order speaks for\n\n20   itself.     And the Court's order specifically says that\n\n21   you are moving over, let me find the exact wcrding ...\n\n22                    \"All prior motions, discovery crders,\n\n23   responses and answers.\"     And then there is a laundry\n\n24   list of specific pleadings.

So,   I mean, if we're in agreemer.t that the\n\n 9   cross-claim does not apply to this case, ther.,          I'm okay\n\n10   not admitting the emails.\n\n11                   MS.

I believe I don't think I have\n\n13   anything else to add, and I'm just wasting ycur time\n\n14   reiterating the same thing.       It's for the   Co~rt   to rule.\n\n15   I believe the record speaks for itself, and it's for the\n\n16   appellate court to determine where somebody is going to\n\n17   go.\n\n18                   THE COURT:     Okay.

That is on all 4', - the\n\n2    supreme court case of Greenberg versus Brookshire.                 And\n\n 3   that case has been followed over a hundred times in all\n\n4    kinds of cases.

It's a landmark case.            It was\n\n 9   a case exactly like this where there was a suit and a\n\n10   nonsuit and a counter-claim following the nonsuit.

But\n\n 5   what she misses is when she chooses to nonsui t      1   my\n\n 6   client who'd been a defendant for a year and a half, had\n\n 7   substantial money invested in the education of this\n\n 8   Court and rulings obtained by this Court, had the\n\n 9   absolute right to, himself, institute a lawsuit and\n\n10   proceed on that lawsuit to resolve the very issues they\n\n11   have raised and vilified him for.     And that's exactly\n\n12   what -- you don't have to worry about the nonsuit.\n\n13                   I'll take the simple answer first.\n\n14                   When we filed days after she filed her\n\n15   nonsuit, we filed a cross and counter-petition.           We\n\n16   affirmatively stated in there, and it's her exhibit,\n\n17   that because of the convoluted procedural nature of this\n\n18   case, we drafted it just like an original petition.              And\n\n19   in fact,   it shows Paragraph 1 as discovery letter level\n\n20   just like an original petition.

And that is confirmed.   In fact,   when I was\n\n 4   looking at this issue, and it is an odd issue - because\n\n 5   what Ms. Cantrell focuses on her nonsuit.      If she filed\n\n 6   a nonsuit and then when we came down and got\n\n 7   affirmative relief against Daniel, which is what\n\n 8   happened in Greenberg,   I would be saying she's\n\n 9   absolutely right.   We can't do that.   All we did was\n\n10   reinstitute a lawsuit in the same cause number which\n\n11   Local Rule 2.2 tells us this is where this lawsuit goes.\n\n12   Once you choose the number, it goes back to that\n\n13   original number.\n\n14                  We instituted a new lawsuit and\n\n15   immediately attempted to effectuate service.\n\n16                  When they evaded it nine times, this Court\n\n17   entered a substituted service order.    This Court had\n\n18   absolutely every right to do that because every court\n\n19   has jurisdiction to enter a substituted order when a\n\n20   party is evading service.    And that's what's happened in\n\n21   this case.   That's all that's happened.\n\n22                  In Greenberg, after the party dismissed,\n\n23   the Court entered rulings.    Well they can't enter\n\n24   rulings because I would agree in that case the parties\n\n25   aren't before this Court.    The only thing that's\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

We haven't\n\n 4   gotten to any affirmative rulings.      They will be a\n\n 5   party.\n\n 6                 Greenberg is completely irrelevant to this\n\n 7   case 'cause your court has entered no rulings.       You've\n\n 8   done nothing other than approved substituted service\n\n 9   since we filed this pleading.      Now once the service date\n\n10   has passed, whatever she's going to do - she can argue\n\n11   then whether we should have the ruling or not, but\n\n12   they're before this Court; they've been joined.\n\n13                 The supreme court in Zachary versus Lane\n\n14   in 2001 looked at the issue of who is a party.       Do you\n\n15   have to be served to be a party or are you a party the\n\n16   second the pleading is filed?      The supreme court looked\n\n17   at the case and said,    \"No.   You are a party the second\n\n18   the case is filed.\"     They were rejoined as a party\n\n19   'cause we re-served her which I agree - if they claim\n\n20   they want a party - so be it.       But we didn't skip the\n\n21   step of personal service.       We did that; albeit, by\n\n22   substituted because they evaded.\n\n23                 But in that case, the supreme court said\n\n24   they are party the second the pleading is filed.

I disagree wholly this Court doesn't have\n\n 3   jurisdiction.     It's a statute of probate court.    As you\n\n 4   know very well,    it's concurrent jurisdiction in all\n\n 5   trust cases.    This is a trust case that had been pending\n\n 6   here.\n\n 7                   And on March 24th, before she went to the\n\n 8   district court, we initiated, at a minimum, what would\n\n 9   be deemed a new lawsuit.\n\n10                   I have a few exhibits to put in the\n\n11   record.    They are mainly attached to my pleading so I\n\n12   didn't make extra copies for Counsel, but I do feel like\n\n13   I want to go the extra step and have them in the record.\n\n14                   I'm offering as Exhibit A, and I\n\n15   apologize,   I'm just trying to use the same exhibit\n\n16   numbers I did to my response.

PACHECO:     And what those documents\n\n 7   establish is the procedural history in this court\n\n 8   including the severance because of Mr. Daniel Weiner's\n\n 9   now-Daniel-Warren's intervention; but more specifically,\n\n10   that Mr. Weiner's counter and cross-petition which fell\n\n11   to constitute the original pleading that was promptly\n\n12   served was filed before any attempt to initiate any\n\n13   jurisdiction, any other court which the supreme court\n\n14   has also said the first filing applies.           And that would\n\n15   reinstitute this Court's jurisdiction.\n\n16                   Even if you believe that we couldn't\n\n17   rejoin her,   even if you believed that there was no valid\n\n18   existing lawsuit as it relates to Daniel,          it's\n\n19   irrelevant because we reinstituted a lawsuit on March\n\n20   24th; we promptly served; service has been obtained.\n\n21                  And finally we ask the Court to take\n\n22   judicial notice of your order of substituted service.\n\n23                   THE COURT:      It is so noted.\n\n24                  MS.

CANTRELL:    The facts of this case are\n\n 6   what happened in Greenberg versus Brookshire\n\n 7   identically.   There was a counter-claim, a brand new\n\n 8   pleading into the case after the nonsuit, and that's in\n\n 9   the Court's -- the supreme court said that that -- the\n\n10   nonsuit ended the case.     It was over at that point.\n\n11   There should be no more claims - whether they're\n\n12   hearings or not - there's no more orders.       The case is\n\n13   over.\n\n14                  And so I also wanted to point out that in\n\n15   their responsive -- the response to our motion -- our\n\n16   plea to the jurisdiction which I'm not sure that you-all\n\n17   have because it was filed about 5:00 last night.       Did\n\n18   you-all get that?\n\n19                  THE COURT:    The response --\n\n20                  MS. CANTRELL:    Their response to our plea.\n\n21                  THE COURT:    Yes,   I got it right here.\n\n22   They gave me this notebook which is their courtesy copy.\n\n23                  MS.

The counter and cross-petition was filed after\n\n 8   the Court signing Daniel's request for dismissal - the\n\n 9   dates being March 24th for the counter and\n\n10   cross-petition and March 16 on signing the dismissal.\n\n11   And that error is repeated in Paragraph 36 where it\n\n12   says,   \"In subsequent to Daniel's nonsuit but prior to\n\n13   the entry of dismissal, Mr. Weiner's cross and\n\n14   counter-petition was filed.\"       That's the same error.       It\n\n15   is incorrect on the dates.      Daniel's nonsuit predated,\n\n16   and his dismissal predated, the cross or the counter and\n\n17   the cross-petition.    so·,   I would -- I'd 1 ike to correct\n\n18   the record on those two things.\n\n19                   THE COURT:    Okay.   Just quite simply:    We\n\n20   view the pleading filed on March 24th by Andy Weiner\n\n21   whose counter and cross-petition, we view that as an\n\n22   original petition.    I mean,    I know it's titled,   \"Counter\n\n23   and Cross-Petition\" but we view it as an original\n\n24   petition.    And so\n\n25                   MS.

CANTRELL:    \"All matters relating or\n\n12   appertaining to an estate or guardianship,\" which this\n\n13   does not,   \"that has not been closed as provided in the\n\n14   Probate Court Code including proceedings upon trust\n\n15   created by decedent's will,\" which this is not -this is\n\n16   an inter vivos trust,     \"shall remain in such court\n\n17   subject to an order of transfer as with any case and\n\n18   shall retain the original docket number with an\n\n19   appropriate sub file.\"\n\n20                   So,   if it's an original petition, it\n\n21   should have its own separate case number according to\n\n22   the way I read these rules.\n\n23                    \"Each subsequent matter filed involving\n\n24   the same decedent or Proposed Ward,\" which this does not\n\n25   involve,    \"shall be filed in the original file under the\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

I don't dispute that they could file a\n\n 6   brand new lawsuit and they're welcome to.          They will --\n\n 7   they've already raised the construction issues in the\n\n 8   district court case; so those are already before the\n\n 9   district court case.     So,   it would be duplication if it\n\n10   reads the same way as their counter and cross-petition.\n\n11                  MS. PACHECO:      Actually,   they're part of an\n\n12   affirmative answer, and there is a plea to abate in the\n\n13   district court case saying this court has jurisdiction.\n\n14                  MS.

So,   if we view this as\n\n17   an original petition, does it need to go back to\n\n18   should it have gone through the process of being\n\n19   assigned to another probate court?\n\n20                  MS. PACHECO:      I don't know the answer to\n\n21   that.   That's never been my experience.         My experience\n\n22   with the Clerk's Office in 20-plus years,         if it relates\n\n23   to the exact same cause number or style of the\n\n24   original - it always goes back to that case.

CANTRELL:     And, Your Honor,   I have the\n\n 4   Government Code Section 25.1034 which this Rule 2.2\n\n 5   refers to,   and it does talk about the random\n\n 6   assignments.   And it says,     \"The county clerks will keep\n\n 7   a separate docket for each court.      The County Clerk\n\n 8   shall assign and docket as random matters and\n\n 9   proceedings filed in the statutory probate courts\n\n10   according to the following percentages:\n\n11                   \"Probate Court Number 1 - 30 percent;\n\n12   Probate Court 2 - 30 percent; Probate Court 3 - 20\n\n13   percent; Probate Court 4 - 20 percent.\"\n\n14                   So, this is the random assignments.       You\n\n15   may be familiar with this.\n\n16                   MS. PACHECO:    That's a Clerk's Office\n\n17   function.    If the Court wants to tell them to reassign\n\n18   it a new cause number,   it doesn't change the filing it\n\n19   attaches to the courts - it's just a matter who hears\n\n20   it.   But I've never seen a case where the case was\n\n21   already before a court that even if it was assigned to\n\n22   another court, it wasn't immediately transferred back\n\n23   under administrative transfer powers.\n\n24                   MS.

CANTRELL:     It is not a game; it is\n\n14   called following the rules.\n\n15                   MS. PACHECO:     No,   this isn't following the\n\n16   rules.    This isn't the spirit of the Code of\n\n17   Professional Conduct.     This isn't the spirit of the\n\n18   Rules of Professional Procedure.        There is nothing\n\n19   appropriate about the actions that have been taken in\n\n20   this case.\n\n21                   MS. CANTRELL:     There is\n\n22                   MS.

And I'm not\n\n 2   going to do anything about the sending it to the Clerk\n\n 3   for random reassignment.       I really don't -- I've never\n\n 4   had this issue come up, and I'm just not going to do\n\n 5   anything about it.    And,   I mean, and you can, you can\n\n 6   appeal these decisions, of course.      And so,    I mean,\n\n 7   that's what I suggest you do.      But I view this as an\n\n 8   original petition and that's just, that's just how I\n\n 9   reasonably view it.    And so I could be wrong about that\n\n10   but --\n\n11                   MS. CANTRELL:    Your Honor,   there is a case\n\n12   by Justice Bland who is the same one that wrote the\n\n13   opinion in Michael's case --\n\n14                   MS. PACHECO:    Your Honor,    I have a\n\n15   proposed order on the dismissal of the plea and the\n\n16   jurisdiction.    I would ask that the Court enter it.\n\n17                   THE COURT:     Well what were you saying?\n\n18                   MS. CANTRELL:     The Court says this:\n\n19                   \"After the trial Court lost plenary\n\n20   power,\" this involved a nonsuit, and your plenary power\n\n21   expired 30 days after the March 16th dismissal under\n\n22   Section 329(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure,           \"after\n\n23   the Court, trial Court,      lost plenary power it granted a\n\n24   plea to the jurisdiction.       Because the trial Court had\n\n25   lost its plenary power,      the Trial Court's order granting\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

An appellate Court should declare\n\n 2   post-plenary power orders void.\"\n\n 3                    And that is my position that any order in\n\n 4   this case past April 16th, according to every case I\n\n 5   have read,   is void.\n\n 6                    In this case, now they can file a brand\n\n 7   new lawsuit, but the jurisdiction in this case is over\n\n 8   starting with the nonsuit and 30 days thereafter when\n\n 9   the plenary power expires.       That is just according to\n\n10   the rules.\n\n11                    You can call it gamesmanship as Ms.\n\n12   Pacheco likes to do frequently,         but it's playing by the\n\n13   rules.   It is to prevent this exact same thing\n\n14   happening; otherwise, the right to nonsuit would be\n\n15   illusory.    You could never nonsuit because someone could\n\n16   simply counter-claim you right back in which is exactly\n\n17   what happened.     And this case is -- this would be not\n\n18   only void but it would be an interlocutory order and\n\n19   that does not qualify for permissive appeal because it's\n\n20   not a situation where there's substantial ground for\n\n21   disagreement.\n\n22                REBUTTAL ARGUMENT BY MS.       PACHECO:\n\n23                    MS.

We did all\n\n3    that.   She, again,    incurred thousands and thousands of\n\n 4   dollars of legal fees.      And then she tried to get out of\n\n 5   this court 'cause she didn't like where it was going and\n\n 6   go find a different shore.       That is flat-out forum\n\n 7   shopping.     This isn't even a different county - it's a\n\n 8   different court; different floor; different court; same\n\n 9   courthouse.\n\n10                    So,   I don't see how any of that is\n\n11   appropriate or relevant to the issues in this case.\n\n12                    MS. CANTRELL:    The plaintiff has a perfect\n\n13   right to choose his forum that's why Wyatt versus Shaw\n\n14   Plumbing is the case that Michael's case went up on\n\n15   appeal over.\n\n16                    MS. PACHECO:    And Mr. Weiner has done that\n\n17   when they chose to take their ball and try and get\n\n18   different rulings at a different court.         And now he is\n\n19   the Plaintiff, and he has chosen the Harris County\n\n20   Probate Courts, wherever he be assigned,        including the\n\n21   judge who is very educated on this process.\n\n22                    MS. CANTRELL:    Your Honor,   I have an order\n\n23   dismissing Andy Weiner's counter and cross-claim and\n\n24   dismissing this entire case.\n\n25\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

I'm not going to\n\n 3   dismiss it.      And I could be wrong on when I sign this\n\n 4   order on the plea to the jurisdiction.          I guess,       I'm\n\n 5   just -- I'm frustrated because at the beginning of this\n\n 6   case then Andy Weiner wanted it moved over to the family\n\n 7   court.     And so we -- when I looked at the case,         I\n\n 8   thought, you know, clearly this is within the language\n\n 9   of the divorce decree, right?          The divorce decree.           And\n\n10   I know I'm going back years, but the divorce decree,                  if\n\n11   I remember right, said that they were to be trustees and\n\n12   that they weren't supposed to seek the removal of either\n\n13   of them.       I don't remember exactly what the language\n\n14   was.     So,   I thought, well, you know, a judge over there\n\n15   is one who signed that order or that decree, and they\n\n16   need to go back and determine if this is,         in fact,       a\n\n17   violation of that decree.       I was wrong about that.              So,\n\n18   that came back to us.\n\n19                     And now the Warren children are wanting to\n\n20   move their cases to district court.          And it's, in my\n\n21   view,    it doesn't serve the interest of either party or\n\n22   either -- or any of the parties to be jumping around\n\n23   courts especially you guys have both invested a lot of\n\n24   time, energy, and money in this court.          And it feels\n\n25   like forum shopping to me.       And they've invested a lot\n\n\n            HIPOLITA G.

And I could\n\n 3   be wrong.     I mean,    I could be wrong that my plenary\n\n 4   powers expire 30 days after I sign the order dismissing\n\n 5   the case.     But that's not the way I view it.         I view\n\n 6   this as,    in essence, an original petition being filed.\n\n 7   And maybe it should have been funneled through the\n\n 8   Clerk's Office and assigned to a different court.             I\n\n 9   don't know.        But I'm not going to dismiss it over\n\n10   something procedural like that.\n\n11                       So, you know,   I'm going to have to just do\n\n12   what I think is right and let the appeals court deal\n\n13   with it.     So,    that's all I know how to do.\n\n14                       MS. CANTRELL:    Yes, Your Honor.\n\n15                       MS. PACHECO:    Your Honor, while we're\n\n16   here, may I make one last request that has nothing to do\n\n17   with this motion.        And you raised this at the last\n\n18   hearing.\n\n19                       Ms. Cantrell has the propensity to contact\n\n20   your staff and email them and elicit comments and then\n\n21   quote them, now in mandamuses and other proceedings.              I\n\n22   recognize it's your prerogative to allow us to do that,\n\n23   and you've been very accommodating to move things along.\n\n24   Given what she has contorted some of those statements to\n\n25   be,   I would request that if any requests should be made,\n\n\n           HIPOLITA G.

I mean,    to\n\n12   the extent we request a hearing,     the request should be I\n\n13   want to set a hearing on ''X\" date - not the going back\n\n14   and forth because I feel like we have crossed the line,\n\n15   or perhaps all sides,    in this case.    And because of the\n\n16   nature of this case,    I would ask that you direct all\n\n17   parties to stop emailing anything substantive to the\n\n18   Court and put in a pleading.\n\n19                   THE COURT:   Okay.\n\n20                   MS. CANTRELL:   I thought you did that\n\n21   already, Your Honor, at the last hearing.         You did ask\n\n22   us -- well,   to put everything in emails so now the\n\n23   request I'm hearing is not to even email?\n\n24                   THE COURT:   Well,   I mean,   the thing is,\n\n25   this is the limits -- I mean, we're bound by judicial\n\n\n         HIPOLITA G.

What I said before is we've\n\n 2   kind of been -- we've done our best to abide by those\n\n 3   ethical requirements, but I will say that in estate and\n\n 4   guardianship matters where we're dealing with a lot of\n\n 5   pro se litigants then quite often we will give advice\n\n 6   that borders on, you know,      it may go beyond just\n\n 7   procedural, and it may be even bordering on legal\n\n 8   advice.   And we do that because we view that sometimes\n\n 9   it's just,   it's expeditious for the protection of a Ward\n\n10   especially, okay.    We don't want anything bad to happen\n\n11   to our Wards, and we view that as our highest priority.\n\n12                  This case is totally different, okay.        And\n\n13   the only thing that you guys, as you know, are permitted\n\n14   to visit with our staff about is procedural issues.             And\n\n15   so beyond that, we shouldn't receive any communication\n\n16   if it has nothing      if it goes beyond procedural, we\n\n17   are not permitted to receive it.\n\n18                   MS. CANTRELL:     Your Honor,    I understand\n\n19   that, and I think that was clear at the last hearing.\n\n20   I'm not sure why it's coming up again.\n\n21                   MS. PACHECO:     It's coming up because now\n\n22   she's quoting emails in mandamuses.       And what I've come\n\n23   to realize is you call it procedural issues, but\n\n24   technically, what she should be communicating with the\n\n25   Court about is setting hearings.

But what has happened in this case is she's\n\n 9   sort of contorting those communications into other\n\n10   things; and frankly,   I don't like having arguments with\n\n11   Counsel where, you know,   colleagues or anybody\n\n12   associated with the Court are copied on those.      It just,\n\n13   you know -- and there's embedded comments in there.\n\n14                  I understand -- I'm not saying it should\n\n15   be in every case, and I certainly,   I said this last time\n\n16   and I'm going to say it on the record - I am not\n\n17   implying this Court has done anything other than be\n\n18   excessively cooperative to both sides.    But Ms. Cantrell\n\n19   then contorts those into advice; and, you know,      it's not\n\n20   even with you, but your staff is an arm of you and it\n\n21   can be deemed as ex parte communication or she's trying\n\n22   to argue the Court told her to do something.       It's\n\n23   improper.   And she's not seeing the limits of those,       and\n\n24   yet again, when we're setting things,    there's a lot of\n\n25   back and forth that included Judge Comstock.

CANTRELL:   These emails with the order\n\n 8   on the severance,   I'm not sure who initiated those but\n\n 9   it certainly wasn't me.      I mean, but we have discussed\n\n10   this over and over at the last hearing.\n\n11                   THE COURT:   Well no, no because the Court\n\n12   can discuss procedural issues with lawyers, but when\n\n13   but that is such a -- you know, when you talk about\n\n14   procedure versus giving legal advice,     I think there is a\n\n15   lot of overlap there.     And here, you know, you guys are\n\n16   seasoned lawyers.    You guys know the procedures.\n\n17   There's no reason why you need to be visiting with us\n\n18   over -- about anything other than scheduling hearings.\n\n19   So,   I think it's very fair that Ms. Pacheco request that\n\n20   we limit our all-communication.\n\n21                   MS.

All of that is beyond what should\n\n 5   be communicated in emails.      They're not part of the\n\n 6   Court's record and yet she tries to admit them.\n\n 7                 Again,   I've never made this request, but\n\n 8   I've never had a case quite like this.        And I'm very\n\n 9   appreciative that we can approach you on any normal case\n\n10   and ask reasonable questions with Counsel copied.         This\n\n11   is just not that case.\n\n12                 MS. CANTRELL:        But Counsel was copied on\n\n13   those emails and it was initiated --\n\n14                 MS. PACHECO:      But it's a rally back and\n\n15   forth.   It's an ex parte communication and then Counsel\n\n16   is forced to respond and your staff is then watching\n\n17   this volley back and what do you do with that thing?           Do\n\n18   you show it to you?    Does it go in the Court's file?\n\n19                  THE COURT:    It doesn't get to me, but it\n\n20   does in a sense because if it gets to anyone of our\n\n21   staff it gets to me.     I mean,    it's deemed that I have\n\n22   viewed it, okay.   And so because they are an extension.\n\n23   The staff is, of course, an extension of me.\n\n24                  And, you know,      the truth is,   I view those\n\n25   emails as ex parte even though it copies Counsel.

I think that's a reasonable\n\n10   request and especially because you guys can call up any\n\n11   time and set a hearing, and you'll have it, you know.

Daniel Warren is the sole beneficiary of the Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust (the\n\n “Trust”). The Trust was created on March 20, 1996 by Andy I. Weiner and Katherine R.\n\n Warren (formerly Katherine F. Weiner), who are also the co-trustees.\n\n 3.       On April 22, 2014, Daniel Warren filed a Plea in Intervention in Cause No. 425,577,\n\n In Re David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust, suing Andy Weiner for breach of fiduciary duty\n\n for borrowing substantially all of the Trust assets for Andy Weiner’s own personal use,\n\n commingling the Trust assets with Andy’s personal funds, failing to prudently invest the\n\n Trust assets, and failing to render an accounting upon Daniel’s request.\n\n 4.    On July 8, 2014 Andy Weiner asserted various affirmative defenses, including that his\n\n\n                                                                                          EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                             exhibitsticker.com\n\n\n\n\n                                                  1\n\n\n                                                                                            TAB F\n\f“actions were justified, excused and/or authorized by the terms of the Daniel Steven Weiner\n\n1996 Trust” and “Ambiguity.” [See attached Exhibit A]\n\n5.    On October 24, 2014 Andy Weiner filed a Second Amended Cross-Claim against\n\nKatherine Warren in Cause No. 425,577 seeking to hold Katherine responsible for any\n\ndamages, actions, inactions, and violations of the Trust Agreement, breach of her fiduciary\n\nduty, removal, tortious interference with Andy’s ability to properly administer the Trust, and\n\nreimbursement of Andy’s legal fees in defending the lawsuit.\n\n6.   On November 17, 2014 the Court severed Daniel Warren’s suit against Andy Weiner\n\ninto a separate Cause No. 425,576-401, and ordered 24 docket entries to be moved to the\n\nnew case. [See attached Exhibit B] The Cross-Claim was not moved and remained in Cause\n\nNo. 425,577.\n\n7.   Pursuant to the November 17, 2014 Order, Daniel Warren filed an Original Petition in\n\nthis Cause No. 425,576-401 on December 1, 2014 asserting the same claims as in his Plea in\n\nIntervention filed in Cause No. 425,577. The Original Petition named Andy Weiner and\n\nKatherine Warren as parties, but expressly stated that his Notice of Nonsuit against Ms.\n\nWarren applies to this Cause No. 425,576-401.\n\n8.    On February 10, 2015, Daniel challenged Andy Weiner’s Answer and Supplemental\n\nAnswer by Special Exceptions. After a hearing on the matter on February 17, 2015, the Court\n\nordered Andy Weiner to replead nine (9) of his thirteen (13) defenses by March 17, 2015.\n\nAndy Weiner failed to do so.\n\n9.   On March 10, 2015, Daniel Warren nonsuited all of his claims in this case and on March\n\n16, 2015 the Court dismissed Daniel Warren without prejudice. [See attached Exhibit C].\n\n10. On March 24, 2015, two weeks after Daniel Warren nonsuited his claims, Andy Weiner\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\ffiled a Counter and Cross-Petition against Daniel and Katherine, attempting to join them as\n\nparties to the nonsuited case.\n\n                                 ARGUMENT & AUTHORITIES\n\n11. Daniel Warren asks the Court to dismiss Andy Weiner’s Counter and Cross-Petition for\n\nthe following reasons:\n\n12. Daniel Warren had an absolute right to nonsuit all of his claims on March 10, 2015 and\n\nbe dismissed from the case as long as it does not “prejudice the right of an adverse party to\n\nbe heard on a pending claim for affirmative relief.” (emphasis added) [TRCP 96, 162].\n\n13. The right to nonsuit should be liberally construed in favor of the nonsuiting plaintiff.\n\n[Greenberg v. Brookshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418995\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418995/greenberg-v-brookshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 872 (Tex. 1982)].\n\n14. When the defendant has no pending claims for affirmative relief, the plaintiff’s nonsuit\n\nrenders the merits of the underlying case moot and dismisses the entire case. A trial court\n\nmay not rule on a counter or cross claim filed after a nonsuit. [Greenberg, 640 S.W.2d at\n\n871].\n\n15.     Andy Weiner’s failure to replead the nine (9) affirmative defenses as ordered by the\n\nCourt left Andy’s only defenses as 1) that Daniel is not entitled to attorney fees, 2) Daniel\n\nlacks standing, legal authority or capacity to sue, 3) Daniel’s claims are barred by the statute\n\nof limitations, and 4) Daniel’s claims are barred because he has no legal or equitable basis\n\nfor recovery. [See attached Exhibit D]. These are not claims for affirmative relief under\n\nTRCP 162.\n\n16. Since Daniel has dropped all his claims, both the claims and the defenses in this case are\n\nmoot. A trial court has no jurisdiction to rule on a moot controversy. [Klein v. Hernandez,\n\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (Tex. 2010; Devon Energy Prod. Co., L.P. v. KCS Res., LLC, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">203</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209 (Tex. App.─Houston [14th Dist.] 2014, pet. pending on other grounds)].\n\n17. In Greenberg v. Brookshire, the wife filed a counterclaim against her husband two days\n\nafter he nonsuited his divorce case against her. Over the husband’s objections, the trial judge\n\nheld a hearing on the wife’s counterclaim and entered an order pertaining to it.            In a\n\nproceeding for mandamus relief, the Texas Supreme Court held that the trial judge should\n\nnot have proceeded with the hearing on the counterclaim and directed him to withdraw his\n\norder pertaining to it. [Greenberg v. Brookshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418995\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418995/greenberg-v-brookshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 1982)].\n\n18.   When a plaintiff files a nonsuit, the trial court loses jurisdiction of the entire case,\n\nexcept jurisdiction to render the order of dismissal without prejudice, which this Court has\n\ndone. [Ault v. Mulanax, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2434097\"><a href=\"/opinion/2434097/ault-v-mulanax/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828 (Tex. App.─Texarkana 1986, orig.\n\nproceeding), also citing Greenberg v. Brookshire].\n\n19. Similarly, in Ault v. Mulanax the defendant filed a cross-action against the plaintiff after\n\nshe had nonsuited all of her claims. The appeal court held that the trial court lost jurisdiction\n\nof the entire case immediately upon the filing of the plaintiff’s nonsuit, except jurisdiction to\n\nrender the order of dismissal without prejudice. [Ault, 724 S.W.2d at 829].\n\n20. Just as in Greenberg and Ault, when Daniel nonsuited this case, there were no pending\n\nclaims for affirmative relief filed by any party. As such, the trial court’s only recourse is to\n\ndismiss the entire case without prejudice, as the Court has done.\n\n21. Andy Weiner’s cross-claims against Katherine Warren have no impact on this case.\n\nThey were filed only in Cause No. 425,577, a separate cause of action. Nor do Andy\n\nWeiner’s Counter and Cross-Petition have any impact on this case because they were filed\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fafter Daniel nonsuited his entire case. According, Daniel had an absolute right to dismiss his\n\nentire case under the holding of Greenberg v. Brookshire.\n\n22. A trial court cannot deny a litigant's right to nonsuit his case when affirmative relief is\n\nnot sought by an adverse party before the nonsuit. [Greenberg v. Brookshire, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418995\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418995/greenberg-v-brookshire/\"><span class=\"volume\">640</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 871 (Tex. 1982)]. Andy Weiner had no claims for affirmative relief pending at the time\n\nof Daniel’s nonsuit.\n\n23. Accordingly, the Court should dismiss this entire case and Andy Weiner’s Counter and\n\nCross-Petition as it was filed after Daniel nonsuited his entire case.\n\n\n                                        RELIEF REQUESTED\n\n24. For these reasons, Daniel Warren asks the Court to set this Plea to the Jurisdiction for a\n\nhearing and sign an order dismissing Andy Weiner’s Counter and Cross-Petition and this\n\nentire case for lack of jurisdiction.\n\n                                                Respectfully submitted,\n                                                CANTRELL & CANTRELL, PLLC\n                                                By: /s/ Carol A.

Wro-ren (\"David\"), and in suppOlt\n\n   thereof respectfully shows the following:\n\n                                                  I.\n                                               Overview\n\n   1.       Tho Original Petition for Termination of Trust (\"Petition\") is just anothe1· sad stage in\n\n   Ms. Warren's systematic plan to exclude Mr. Weiner from his son's life. Mr. Weiner and Ms.\n\n   Warren are currently patties to a family coUlt proceeding that arises from Ms. Warren's failure to\n\n   comply with the terms of the Trust and a Judgment entered by the Family Court in their divorce,\n\n  pending in the 309111 Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas.\n\n  2.       The Petition filed Jn this Comt seeks to gain complete control of funds gifted by Mr.\n\n  Weiner's parents to the Trust established by both Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren prior to their\n\n  divorce. It cites no credible or legal basis to remove Mr. Weiner and/or terminate the Trust by\n\n  distributing said funds either free of trust to David or into a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act\n\n  account only Ms. Wan·en would control. And, while Mr. Weiner has historically attempted to\n\n  accommodate Ms. Warren's various requests, he is unwilling to risk funds needed for David's\n\n\n                                                                                                EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                          exhibitsticker.com\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                                   A\n  onawoo]()Ql\n l76- 942296vl\n\f        Oct. 23. 2013 3:35PM                                                                     No. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1344</span>    <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n\n                 future education or sanction her ignoring provisions of a Judgment entered by the Family Court\n\n                 in their divorce.\n\n                 3.     Neither Mr. Weiner nor the named successor trustee is disqualified to serve as a trustee of\n\n              the Trust. Mr. Weiner has never mishandled the Trust, has never harbored any hostility towai\"ds\n\n              David and has always acted in a prudent ffit\\lll\\er- even under the most difficult of circumstances\n\n              created by Ms. Warren. Mr. Weiner has done so because he recognizes that David and the T!.·ust\n\n              both need protection.\n\n                                                               II.\n                                                          B@ckgro!lnd\n\n             4.         On December 13, 1994, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren established the Tmst for the benefit\n\n             of their then-minor son, David. The irrevocable trust agreement provides that David is the\n\n             primaq beneficiary and Mr. Weiner and Ms. Wan·en are the original co-trustees. In the event\n\n             they are not able to serve, the tmst agreement provides that Bayle Weiner Dt-ubel shall serve as\n\n             successor trustee.\n\n             5.        Mr. Weiner's parents, David's grandparents, funded the Trust with the desire to provide\n\n            for their grandson's education,\n\n            6.         After David's grandparents' generous gifts, Ms. Warren systematically excluded Mr.\n\n            Wehter and his family from David and his siblings' lives. By way of example, Ms. Warren\n\n            facilitated in David changing his last name from his father's (Weiner) to a name with no family\n                                                                     ..\n            significance shortly after David's eighteenth birthday. And, Ms. Wan·en routinely belittled Mr.\n\n            Weiner, his mother and his sisters in front of his sons, includh1g David.\n\n            7.        Ms. Wanen filed for. divorce and, pursuant to an Agreed Decree of Divorce (\"Divorce\n\n            Decree\") entered into by the 309th Judicial District Court of Hat1'ls County, Texas in Cause No.\n\n\n\n\n                                                              2\n.. -·-- . --·0928651000001.\n           376 • 942296v I\n\fOd. 23. 2013 3:35PM                                                                                     No. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1344</span>   <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n    2011-01040 (the \"Family Court Proceeding\"), Mr. Weiner and Ms. Wanen were divorced on\n\n    March 29, 2012.

Subsequent to the parties' divorce, Ms. Warren has continued her eff011s to alienate their\n\n  children and has failed to comply with the terms of the Divorce Decree. For example, Ms.\n\n  Warren has refused to provide a simple invoice to confirm an alleged significant tuition payment\n\n  for David, who started his- fi·eshrnan year at Rice University this fall. Instead, she acknowledges\n\n  in her affidavit that she wired trust funds without Mr. Weiner's required permission and consent.\n\n  10.      The Petition seeks an order from this Cotu't to either distribute the Trust funds to David\n\n  free of trust or, alternatively, to awm·d Ms. Wan·en sole and exclusive control over a new account\n\n  (a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act account created for David's benefit), even though the Trust\n\n  agreement and the Divorce Decree provide otherwise.\n\n\n\n\n                                                             3\n 092865/000001\n 376 ·942296vl\n\fOct. 23. 2013 3:36PM                                                                    No. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1344</span>     <span class=\"reporter\">P.</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\n\n                                                        m.\n                                Answer to Petition fo1· Te1·mination of Trust\n\n    11.

Notwithstanding Daniel’s assertions to the contrary, Mr. Weiner’s claims against\n\nKatherine Warren f/k/a Katherine Weiner (“Ms. Warren”) were properly on file when Daniel\n\nfiled his nonsuit. But, regardless, Mr. Weiner has an absolute right to initiate a new lawsuit to\n\nresolve the construction and other issues pled in his Counter and Cross-Petition properly filed in\n\nthe above-referenced proceeding in accordance with Local Rule 2.2. Therefore, this Court\n\nshould retain the above-referenced lawsuit on its docket and deny Daniel’s Plea to the\n\nJurisdiction.\n\n                                          II.\n                                 FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n2.       On March 20, 1996, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren established the Daniel Steven Weiner\n\n1996 Trust (the “Trust”) for the benefit of their then-minor son, Daniel. The irrevocable trust\n\nagreement provides that Daniel is the primary beneficiary and Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                            EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                             exhibitsticker.com\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                             TAB F-1\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\fthe original co-trustees. In the event they are not able to serve, the trust agreement provides that\n\nBayle Weiner Drubel shall serve as successor trustee.\n\n3.         Mr. Weiner’s parents, Daniel’s grandparents, primarily funded the Trust with the desire\n\nto provide for Daniel’s education.\n\n4.         After Daniel’s grandparents’ generous gifts, Ms. Warren systematically excluded Mr.\n\nWeiner and his family from Daniel’s life, as well as the lives of his brothers, David and Michael.\n\nBy way of example, Ms. Warren likely facilitated the process of Daniel changing his last name\n\nfrom his father’s (Weiner) to a name with no family significance on his eighteenth birthday.\n\nAnd, in 2011, Ms. Warren deceitfully made ulterior plans to celebrate Daniel’s birthday to\n\npurposefully exclude Mr. Weiner. Further, Ms. Warren routinely belittled Mr. Weiner, his\n\nmother and his sisters in front of his sons.\n\n5.         On January 6, 2011, Ms. Warren filed for divorce from Mr. Weiner. Pursuant to an\n\nAgreed Decree of Divorce (“Divorce Decree”) entered into by the 309th Judicial District Court\n\nof Harris County, Texas in Cause No. 2011-01040 (the “Family Court Proceeding” or “Family\n\nCourt”), Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren were divorced on March 29, 2012.\n\n6.         Subsequent to the parties’ divorce, Ms. Warren has continued her efforts to alienate their\n\nchildren and has failed to comply with the terms of the Divorce Decree.\n\n7.         On September 30, 2013, Ms. Warren, as co-trustee of the Trust, filed a lawsuit1 against\n\nMr. Weiner, seeking an order from this Court to terminate the Trust and for the Trust funds to be\n\ndistributed to a Uniform Transfers to Minors Act account created for Daniel’s benefit over which\n\nMs. Warren would have sole control, even though the Trust agreement and the Divorce Decree\n\nprovide otherwise. See Original Petition, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit A and\n\nincorporated by this reference.\n1\n    Cause No. 425,576; In re: Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust, In Probate Court No. 4 of Harris County, Texas.\n\n\n                                                          2\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\f8.       On October 23, 2013, Mr. Weiner filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction in Cause No. 425576,\n\nalleging that the District Court had jurisdiction over the claims brought by Daniel because they\n\nrelated to the Family Court Proceeding.\n\n9.       On November 4, 2013, Ms. Warren, as next friend of Daniel, filed a First Amended\n\nOriginal Petition in Cause No. 425,576 in which she requests for the Trust to be modified to\n\nallow Daniel to become his own trustee upon reaching the age of 18. See First Amended\n\nPetition, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit B and incorporated by this reference.\n\n10.      On November 21, 2013, the Probate Court granted Mr. Weiner’s Plea to the Jurisdiction\n\nin Cause No. 425576.\n\n11.      On April 22, 2014, Daniel filed an Original Petition in Intervention in his older brother\n\nDavid Weiner’s proceeding against Mr. Weiner.2 See Original Petition in Intervention, attached\n\nhereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit C and incorporated by this reference.\n\n12.      On July 2, 2014, Mr. Weiner filed his Cross-Claims against Ms. Warren in Cause No.\n\n425,577 (where Daniel was an Intervenor), seeking to hold Ms. Warren equally responsible for\n\n(1) all actions and alleged inactions of the trustees, (2) all claimed damages and relief sought by\n\nDavid and Daniel, (3) all violations of the Trust agreements, including any scheme of collusion,\n\n(4) the preparation of an accounting, and (5) payment of one-half of Mr. Weiner’s attorneys’ fees\n\nand costs. See Cross-Claims, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit D and incorporated by\n\nthis reference.\n\n13.      On July 8, 2014, Mr. Weiner filed his First Supplement to Original Answer, alleging,\n\namong other claims and defenses, that Daniel has no standing to intervene in David’s case. See\n\n\n\n\n2\n Cause No. 425,577, In re: David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust, In Probate Court No. Four (4) of Harris County,\nTexas (“David’s Case”).\n\n\n                                                    3\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\fFirst Supplement to Original Answer, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit E and\n\nincorporated by this reference.\n\n14.      On July 15, 2014, Mr. Weiner filed his Motion for Partial Traditional Summary\n\nJudgment.\n\n15.      On August 7, 2014, Mr. Weiner filed his First Supplement to Cross-Claims against Ms.\n\nWarren, incorporating, by reference, the cross-claims and factual background supporting same\n\ncontained within his Motion for Partial Traditional Summary Judgment.\n\n16.      Also on August 7, 2014, David and Daniel (as Intervenor in David’s Case) nonsuited\n\ntheir claims against Ms. Warren in Cause No. 425,577.\n\n17.      On September 8, 2014, pursuant to an order of this Court, Daniel filed a Motion to Sever\n\nin David’s Case.\n\n18.      On September 25, 2014, the Probate Court partially granted and partially denied Mr.\n\nWeiner’s Motion for Partial Traditional Summary Judgment finding that, pursuant to the terms of\n\nDavid’s Trust: (i) a trustee of the trust may retain, invest or reinvest in assets unproductive of\n\ninterest and wasting assets, (ii) the diversification required under the Texas Trust Code and\n\nTexas common law, if any, does not apply to the Trust; (iii) Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren had a\n\nduty to jointly administer the Trust; (iv) in order to delegate her powers or duties to Movant as\n\nco-trustee of the Trust, Ms. Warren must have filed a written instrument with the records of the\n\nTrust; and (v) Mr. Weiner has no liability relating to his actions as trustee other than for acts and\n\nomissions found to be made with gross negligence, bad faith or fraud.\n\n19.      On October 24, 2014, Mr. Weiner filed his Second Amended Cross-Claims against Ms.\n\nWarren in Cause No. 425,577. See Second Amended Cross-Claims, attached hereto as Exhibit F\n\nand incorporated by this reference. As clearly expressed in the Second Amended Cross-Claims,\n\n\n\n\n                                                 4\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\fthe cross-claims relate to the David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust as well as Daniel’s Trust\n\nbecause, at the time of filing, Daniel’s intervention had not yet been severed into its own cause\n\nof action. Exhibit F ¶1.\n\n20.      On November 5, 2014, Daniel’s claims were severed into their own cause of action in the\n\ninstant proceeding. An amended order, specifically identifying the pleadings and orders to be\n\ntransferred into the new cause of action, was signed on November 17, 2014.3\n\n21.      On December 1, 2014, Daniel, pursuant to this Court’s order, filed his Original Petition in\n\nCause No. 425,576-401.\n\n22.      On March 10, 2015, Daniel nonsuited his claims against Mr. Weiner.\n\n23.      On March 24, 2015, Mr. Weiner filed his Counter and Cross-Petition. See Counter and\n\nCross-Petition, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit G and incorporated by this\n\nreference. In his Counter and Cross-Petition, Mr. Weiner (1) asked for the Court to construe the\n\nlanguage of the Trust agreement; (2) alleged the following cross/counterclaims against Ms.\n\nWarren: breaches of fiduciary duty, reimbursement, removal as trustee, tortious interference with\n\nadministration; and (3) requested the appointment of a corporate trustee. While no monetary\n\nclaims were brought against Daniel, he was joined as a necessary party because he is the primary\n\nbeneficiary of Daniel’s Trust. See TEX. PROP. CODE § 115.011.\n\n24.      On March 24, 2015, Mr. Weiner’s counsel took Ms. Warren’s court-ordered deposition.\n\nMs. Cantrell attended that deposition.\n\n25.      On April 2, 2015, Daniel, along with his brothers, David and Michael, jointly filed an\n\nOriginal Petition in the 133rd Judicial District of Harris County, Texas, Cause No. 2015-19320.\n\nSee Original Petition, attached hereto, without exhibits, as Exhibit H and incorporated by this\n\n\n3\n Due to an administrative error, Mr. Weiner’s Second Amended Cross-Claims were inadvertently left off of the list\nof documents to be transferred to Cause No. 425,576-401.\n\n\n                                                       5\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\freference. When the three related cases currently pending in Probate Court No. 4 of Harris\n\nCounty, Texas (Cause No. 425,576-401, Cause No. 425,577, and Cause No. 425,578) are\n\ncompared to the District Court case, the parties and issues are the same.\n\n26.      On April 17, 2015, Daniel filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction in this Court, alleging that Mr.\n\nWeiner’s cross-claims against Ms. Warren, pled in his Second Amended Cross Claims and his\n\nCounter and Cross-Petition, have “no impact on this case.” Motion at ¶21. As further discussed\n\nbelow, Daniel’s request for dismissal is misguided, as Mr. Weiner’s affirmative claims against\n\nMs. Warren were properly in front of this Court prior to the nonsuit being filed. But, regardless,\n\nMr. Weiner had every right – and did – initiate cross and counter claims. Even if considered a\n\nnew lawsuit, the Counter and Cross-Petition is validly before this Court and Mr. Weiner has\n\nproperly and diligently sought to serve Daniel, in compliance with the Texas Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure.\n\n27.      On May 4, 2015, Mr. Weiner filed a Plea in Abatement and, subject thereto, Original\n\nAnswer in Cause No. 2015-19320.\n\n                                           III.\n                                   ARGUMENT & AUTHORITY\n\n28.      Daniel’s Plea to the Jurisdiction is his last ditch effort to have his case tried in the District\n\nCourt, instead of this Court where he originally filed his claims against his father, Mr. Weiner.\n\n29.      Daniel’s nonsuit nullifies the controversy by and between Daniel and Mr. Weiner; it does\n\nnot affect any pending claims for relief made by Mr. Weiner.

Rule 162\n\nprovides that “[a]ny dismissal pursuant to this rule shall not prejudice the right of an adverse\n\nparty to be heard on a pending claim for affirmative relief.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 162. A claim for\n\naffirmative relief is one “on which the claimant could recover compensation or relief even if the\n\nplaintiff abandons his cause of action.” Univ. of Tex. Med. Branch at Galveston v.

Daniel falsely asserts that Mr. Weiner had no affirmative claims for relief pending at the\n\ntime of Daniel’s nonsuit.

Further, in his Counter and Cross-Petition, filed prior to this Court signing Daniel’s\n\nrequest for dismissal, Mr. Weiner alleged the following claims: (1) construction of the Trust\n\nAgreement, (2) breach of fiduciary duty, (3) reimbursement, (4) removal as trustee, (5) tortious\n\ninterference with administration, and (6) petition to modify trust and request for appointment of a\n\ncorporate trustee.

However, these cases are readily distinguishable.\n\nGreenberg was a divorce action wherein the lower court conducted a hearing on an amended\n\npleading after the husband nonsuited his claims. Unlike the facts to the instant case, there were\n\nonly two parties to the lawsuit – a husband and a wife – and the wife filed a counterclaim against\n\nher husband and requested a hearing on same after her husband filed a nonsuit. The lower court\n\nconducted a hearing on the counterclaims, which the Texas Supreme Court held was in error, as\n\na plaintiff has an absolute, unqualified right to a nonsuit. Greenberg, 640 S.W.2d at 872. Ault\n\nv. Mulanax is another divorce proceeding, specifically involving custody and child support issues\n\nand; not relating, whatsoever, to the factual disputes at issue in the instant litigation. Ault v.\n\nMulanax, 724 S.W.2d at 828. Notwithstanding the factual differences, the Ault cases specifically\n\nrelated to and involved the imposition of the Texas Family Code. Id. Furthermore, the legal\n\nissues in Ault were jurisdictional – which court had dominant jurisdiction at the time the nonsuit\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\fwas filed. Id. at 828. Like in Greenberg, the Texarkana Court of Appeal’s ruling in Ault is not\n\ninstructive to this Court, as the factual and legal matters at issue in Ault are grossly different and\n\nirrelevant to the case at hand.\n\n35.      Regardless of the gamesmanship of Daniel and his mother, Ms. Warren, and their\n\npersistent litigious acts, Daniel’s nonsuit does not summarily dismiss the affirmative claims\n\nbrought by Mr. Weiner against Ms. Warren, which were filed prior to the nonsuit; Daniel cannot\n\nnonsuit Mr. Weiner’s claims against Ms. Warren. Tex. Mut. Ins. Co., 251 S.W.3d at 37.\n\n                                              V.\n                                          CONCLUSION\n\n36.      Mr. Weiner’s Second Amended Cross-Claims were properly on file prior to Daniel’s\n\nNonsuit. And, subsequent to Daniel’s nonsuit, but prior to the entry of dismissal, Mr. Weiner’s\n\nCross and Counter-Petition was filed.\n\n37.      While Daniel’s nonsuit effectively eliminates the affirmative claims he had against Mr.\n\nWeiner, it does nothing with respect to the claims alleged by Mr. Weiner against Ms. Warren.\n\nThis Court has jurisdiction over this case and the remaining claims between Mr. Weiner and Ms.\n\nWarren.\n\n38.      Accordingly, it would be improper to dismiss this case, in its entirety, because of the\n\nremaining claims by Mr. Weiner against Ms. Warren.\n\n         WHEREFORE, Andy Weiner respectfully requests that this Court, after oral hearing,\n\ndeny the Plea to the Jurisdiction filed by Daniel Warren f/k/a Daniel Steven Weiner, and for such\n\nother and further relief, either at law or in equity, to which he may be justly entitled.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n092865/000001\n376 - 1495732v1\n\f                                                      Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                      CRAIN, CATON & JAMES,\n                                                      A PROFESSIONAL CORPORATION\n\n                                                      By: /s/ Kathleen Tanner Beduze\n                                                          SARAH PATEL PACHECO\n                                                          (TBA # 00788164)\n                                                          spacheco@craincaton.com\n                                                          KATHLEEN TANNER BEDUZE\n                                                          (TBA # 24052205)\n                                                          kbeduze@craincaton.com\n                                                          1401 McKinney, 17th Floor\n                                                          Houston, Texas 77010\n                                                          (713) 658-2323\n                                                          (713) 658-1921 (Facsimile)\n\n                                                      Attorneys for Andy Weiner\n\n\n\n\n                                 CERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nI hereby certify that a true and correct copy of the foregoing instrument has been forwarded to:\n\n           Carol A.

Texas Tmst Code§ 115.013(c)(3) permits a parent to\n\n    represent her child as guardian ad litem or next of fi·iend if there is no conflict of interest\n\n    and no guardian of the estate or guardian ad litem has been appointed.\n\n                                      JURISDICTION\n\n4. This Court has jurisdiction to grant the relief requested in this petition pursuant to Texas\n\n   Tmst Code§ 115.001(d)(l) and Texas Probate Code§ 4G.\n\n                                          VENUE\n\n5. Venue of this proceeding is proper in tllis Court pursuant to Tex.as Tmst Code §\n\n   115.002(b-2) and Texas Probate Code§ 8.\n\n                                          FACTS\n\n6. The Twst is an inter vivos trust created under Internal Revenue Code § 2503( c) by\n\n   Katheline F. Wan·en and Andy I. Weiner by agreement dated March 20, 1996 for the\n\n   benefit of their son, the Primary Beneficiary.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f 7. At the present time, the only pennissible beneficiary of the Trust is the Primary\n\n     Beneficiary. The Trust is authorized under Section A-I to make distributions to the\n\n    Primary Beneficiary as follows:\n\n            During the tenn of the trust, the trustees may distribute as much or\n\n            all of the Trust estate as, in the trustees' discretion, is in the\n\n            Primary Beneficiary's best interests.\n\n8. Pursuant to Section A-2 of the Trust, the Plimary Beneficiary may withdraw all or part of\n\n    the Tn1st estate within 60 days after becoming age 21, and may thereby terminate the\n\n    trust as to the part withdrawn.      If the Primaty Beneficiary does not exercise his\n\n    withdrawal right, the T!ust continues 1mtil the Primary Beneficiary becomes age 30.\n\n9. Section A-2 of the Tmst provides that in the event the Primary Beneficiary should die\n\n    before the Trust tenninates, then all assets remaining in the T1ust shall be held or\n\n    distributed by the T1ustee for the benefit of those in favor of whom the Primary\n\n    Beneficiary exercises a power of appointment, or otherwise in the following order: (I) to\n\n   the Primary Beneficiary's descendants, (2) if none of the descendants are then Jiving, to\n\n   the hustors' descendants, (3) if none of the trusters' descendants are then living, to the\n\n   trustors' heirs.\n\nI 0. Section C-1 T1ust agreement provides that any distribution made to a beneficiary of the\n\n   Trust may be made to a custodian for a minor beneficiary under the Uniform Gifts to\n\n   Minors Act.\n\nII. The trust had marketable securities and cash in the approximate value of $113,000 as of\n\n   August 31, 2013.\n\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f 12. The initial co-trustees of the Trust were Katherine A. Warren and Andy I. Weiner. Both\n\n    of the initial co-hustees of the Trust remain the current co-trustees, and no other co-\n\n    trustees have been appointed. In the event that Andy I. Weiner and Katherine F. Warren\n\n    cease to act as tmstee, Bayle Weiner Drubel, Andy I. Weiner's sister, is appointed\n\n    successor trustee under Section D-l(a) of the Tmst.\n\n 13. The co-hustees of the Tn.1st are the parents of the Primary Beneficiary. Although the co-\n\n    hustees were manied at the time the Trust was created, they were granted a divorce on\n\n    March 29, 2012. From the time that the div01'ce was finalized, the co-trustees have been\n\n    unable to agree on proper administration of the Trust.\n\n14. Pursuant to the divorce decree attached as \"Exhibit B,\" the Court ruled that the Trust\n\n    should be administered according to its te1ms. Tltis requixes the co-trustees to act jointly,\n\n    which has proved detrimental to the best interests of the Primary Beneficiary and\n\n    contrary to the purposes ofthe Trust.\n\n15. Texas Trust Code § 112.054(a)(3) provides that on the petition of a trustee, a Comt may\n\n   order that the trustee be changed or that the Tmst be terminated if modification of\n\n   administrative, non-dispositive terms of the tmst is necessary or appropriate to prevent\n\n   waste or avoid impairment ofthe Tmst's administration.\n\n16. Texas Trust Code§ 112.054(a)(2) provides that on the petition of a trustee, a Court may\n\n   order that the tmstee be changed or that the Tmst be tenninated if, because of\n\n   circumstances not known to or anticipated by the hustors, termination or modification of\n\n   the Tmst will further the purposes oft he Trust.\n\n17. Petitioner claims that the inability of the co-llustees to agree on the appropriate\n\n   administration of the Trust assets has impaired the Tn1st's administration. The purposes\n\n\n\n                                            4\n\f     of the Tmst, to provide for the Primary Beneficiary, cannot be fulfilled if the co-tmstees\n\n     cannot agree regarding what actions constitute the \"best interests\" of the Primary\n\n     Beneficiary. Additionally, the cunent circumstances, i.e. the divorce of the co-tmstees,\n\n     was not known to or anticipated by the tmstors. Tetmination or modification of the Trust\n\n     is necessary due to the disharmony between the Tmst's co-trustees which prevents the\n\n    co-trustees from administering the Tmst in the best interests of the Primary Beneficiary.\n\n                                  RELIEF REQUESTED\n\n l. Petitioner requests that the Court order that the Tmst be tetminated and that the Trust\n\n    estate be distributed to the Unifmm Transfers to Minors Act account created for the\n\n    benefit of the DanielS. Weiner, Fidelity Account ending in #6843, over which Katherine\n\n    F. Wanen was awarded sole and exclusive control in the divorce decree attached as\n\n    \"Exhibit B\"; that continued administration of the Trust would defeat or substantially\n\n    impair the accomplislm1ent of the Tmst; that such circumstances were not known to or\n\n    anticipated by the tmstms upon creation of the Tmst; that termination of the Tmst will\n\n    further the purposes of the Trust; that the Petitioner be awarded Court costs and expenses\n\n    and legal fees fi·om the Trust estate; that the remaining assets of the Tmst, after payment\n\n    of Court costs and expenses and legal fees, be distributed to the Fidelity Account ending\n\n   in #6843; and that the Court enter such other orders as may be approp1iate to provide for\n\n    the delivery of all Tmst assets fi·om Katherine F. Warren and Andy I. Weiner to the\n\n   Fidelity Account ending in #6843.\n\n2. Petitioner altematively requests that the Comi order that the co-trustees be changed; that\n\n   the Court appoint an independent corporate tmstce; that replacing the co-trustees with an\n\n   independent corporate tmstee will ftniher the purposes of the Trust; that modification of\n\n\n\n                                            5\n\f    the Trust is necessary or appropriate to prevent waste or avoid impairment of the Ttust's\n\n    administration; that the Petitioner be awarded Court costs and expenses and legal fees\n\n    from the Trust estate; that the remaining assets of the Trust, after payment of Court costs\n\n    and expenses and legal fees, be distributed to an independent corporate trustee; and that\n\n    the Court enter such other orders as may be appropriate to provide for the delivery of all\n\n    Trust assets fi·om Katherine F. Wall'en and Andy I. Weiner to the independent corporate\n\n    trustee.\n\n3. After the hearing on this petition, if the Comt tenninates the Trust or appoints a corporate\n\n    trustee in place of the current co-trustees, Katherine F. Warren will submit a final\n\n    accounting that describes all of the actions she has taken as co-tntstee of the Tmst. In\n\n    that event, Petitioner asks the Court to review the final accounting, and to enter an order\n\n   approving the accounting and discharging Katherine F. Wanen from any liabilities in\n\n   connection with her actions as co-trustee of this Trust, including the termination.\n\n4. Petitioner brings this action for the puqJose of preserving and protecting the interests of\n\n   the Trust and its Primary Beneficiary. The relief sought herein is necessary to enable the\n\n   Tntst to fulfill its purposes as created by the tmstors. Accordingly, Petitioner is entitled\n\n   to recover reasonable attorney's fees and coutt costs fi·om the Trust pursuant to Texas\n\n   Trust Code§ 114.064. If any of the other parties to this proceeding retain counsel to\n\n   represent their interests in this cause, including counsel appointed by this Comt, the\n\n   Court should detetmine whether all or any portion of the attorney's fees and court costs\n\n   incuJTed by these parties should be paid by the Trust.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f                                            PRAYER\n\n        WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, Petitioner prays that the Com! grant the\n\nrequested relief. Petitioner further prays for such other and further relief to which Petitioner is\n\njustly entitled.\n\n                                                     Respectfully submitted,\n\n\n\n                                                    Cantrell & Cowan, PLLC\n\n\n\n\n                                                    By:    !JJ~\n                                                    Carol A.

Petitioner appeared\n\nthrough her duly authorized representative and attomey of record and mmounced ready for trial.\n\nRespondent Andy I. Weiner appeared by and through his duly authorized representative and\n\nattomey of record and allllounced ready for trial. No jury having been demanded by any patiy,\n\nall issues of fact and law were submitted to the Court for decision.\n\n       Having reviewed the pleadings and other papers on file in this cause; and having\n\nconsidered the evidence presented at trial and the arguments of counsel, the Court finds as\n\nfollows:\n\n   1. This Court has jurisdiction and venue of this action.\n\n   2. All necessary patiies to this action are properly before the Court and have been duly\n\n       served with citation in the mallller required by law.\n\n   3. The DANIEL STEPHEN WEINER 1996 TRUST (hereinafter referred to as the \"Trust\")\n\n       is an inter vivos trust created by Katherine F. Warren and Andy I. Weiner by agreement\n\n       dated March 20, 1996 for the benefit of their son, Daniel S. Weiner (hereinafter referred\n\n       to as the \"Primary Beneficiary\").\n\n   4. The current co-trustees of the Trust are Katherine F. Warren and Andy I. Weiner.\n\f 5. Texas Trust Code§ 112.054(a)(3) provides that on the petition of a trustee or beneficiary,\n\n    a Comt may order that the tmstee be changed or that the Trust be te1minated if\n\n    modification of administrative, non-dispositive terms of the trust is necessary or\n\n    appropriate to prevent waste or avoid impairment of the Tmst's administration.\n\n6. Texas Tmst Code§ 112.054(a)(2) provides that on the petition of a trustee or beneficiary,\n\n    a Comt may order that the tmstee be changed or that the Trust be tem1inated if,· because\n\n    of circumstances not known to or anticipated by the trustors, termination or modification\n\n    of the Tmst will fmther the purposes of the Tmst.\n\n7. Petitioner has requested termination of the Trust contingent on the Court's finding that:\n\n    (a) the inability of the co-hustees to agree on the appropriate administration of the Trust\n\n    assets has impaired the Trust's administration; and (b) due to the divorce of the co-\n\n    trustees, a circumstance not known to or anticipated by the trustors when they created the\n\n   Trust, termination will further the purposes of the Trust, which is to provide for the best\n\n   interests of the Primary Beneficiary.\n\n8. Petitioners have alternatively requested that the co-trustees be replaced by an independent\n\n   cmporate trustee, if available, contingent on the Court's finding that: (a) the inability of\n\n   the co-trustees to agree on the appropriate administration of the Trust assets has impaired\n\n   the Trust's administration; and (b) due to the divorce of the co-trustees, a circumstance\n\n   not known to or anticipated by the trustors when they created the Tmst, modification of\n\n   the Tmst will further the p\\ll'poses of the Trust, which is to provide for the best interests\n\n   of the Primary Beneficiary.\n\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f     9. The co-trustees have tendered an accounting of their actions as co-trustee of the Tn1st\n\n         (the \"Final Accounting\").     The Final Accounting reflects that the co-trustees have\n\n         administered the Tmst in accordance with the requirements of Texas law.\n\n     10. The Final Accounting should be approved in all respects, and the co-trustees should be\n\n        released and discharged from any and all liabilities arising out of or in any way related to\n\n        the administration of the Trust or the Trust termination.\n\n     11. The Tmst should be tenninated and the remaining Trust estate, after payment of all Comt\n\n        costs and expenses and legal fees should be distributed to the Unifonn Transfers to\n\n        Minors Act account created for the benefit of the Daniel S. Weiner, Fidelity Acco<mt\n\n        ending in #6843.\n\n    12. Katherine F. Warren brought this action for the purpose of preserving and protecting the\n\n        interests of the Trust and its Primary Beneficiary. The relief sought in this action was\n\n        necessary to enable the Trust to accomplish the purposes of the Trust as established by\n\n        the trustors. Accordingly, Katherine F. Warren is entitled to recover her reasonable and\n\n        necessary attorney's fees and litigation expenses fi·om the Trust pursuant to Texas Trust\n\n        Code § 114.064.\n\n\n\n       It is therefore, ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that the Trust is hereby\n\nterminated; that the termination shall be effective immediately upon the entry of this Final\n\nJudgment by the Court; that the co-trustees are directed to deliver the remaining Trust estate,\n\nafter payment of all Court costs and expenses and legal fees to the Fidelity Account ending in\n\n#6843. The provisions of this Final Judgment shall constitute sufficient legal authority to all\n\npersons owing any money to the Trust, having custody of any property of the Trust, or acting as\n\n\n\n                                                3\n\f transfer agent of any property of the Tn1st, for payment or transfer of such money, property, or\n\n right without liability to Daniel S.

However, no such distribution shall be made to a trustor,\nto any spouse of a trustor, or in any manner that discharges a\nlegal obligation (including an obligation of support) of a trustor\nor any spouse of a trustor.

Weiner and I created the DAVID ABRAHAM WEINER\n\n       1994 TRUST (the \"Trust\") for the benefit of our son, David W. Warren, formerly known\n\n       as David A. Weiner. Andy I. Weiner and I are the trustors and co-ttustees of the Trust.\n\n  3. The purpose of the Trust is to provide for the best interests of our son, David. A primary\n\n       purpose of the Trust is to fund his educational costs. I believe that it is in David's best\n\n      interest to receive a quality education.\n\n  4. David is enrolled as a freshman at Rice University in Houston, Texas.             He began\n\n      attending classes in August 2013.\n\n  5. Andy I. Weiner and I were granted a divorce on March 29, 2012. As part of the divorce\n\n      decree, the trust was to continue as provided under the tmst agreement. Under the trust\n\n      agreement, Andy I. Weiner and I are required to act jointly as co-trustees.\n\n\n                                                 1\n                                      txh;hrf             ~\n\f  6. Although David is the primary beneficiary of the Trust, he applied for fmancial aid with\n\n      Rice University prior to the start of the Fall 2013 semester. David was denied financial\n\n     aid because of the Trust. The financial aid department of Rice University explained that\n\n     where students are the beneficiaries of trusts like the DAVID ABRAHAM WEINER\n\n     1994 TRUST, that the school assumes that the trust funds are intended for the payment of\n\n     college expenses.\n\n 7. David received a tuition bill from Rice University in July 2013. I wrote a check from the\n\n     Trust's Fidelity account for $20,000 or around August 1, 2013. The check was returned\n\n     to Rice University unpaid because Andy I. Weiner requested that Fidelity not honor the\n\n     check.\n\n8. After the check was returned to Rice University unpaid, David received a letter from the\n\n    university advising him that his tuition payment was overdue. I requested that Fidelity\n\n    wire $20,000 to David, with which he paid his tuition. It took approximately six weeks\n\n    for the tuition payment to be credited to David's account with Rice University.\n\n9. I believe that it is detrimental to the best interests of David for Andy I. Weiner and I to\n\n    continue acting as co-trustees of the Trust. Our disagreements regarding distributions of\n\n    David's behalf could seriously inhibit his ability to receive a wonderful education.\n\n10. David is an intelligent adult and is capable of using the Trust assets for his best interests.\n\n   I believe that David has shown maturity beyond most other college students his age. It\n\n   would be in his best interests to be given the Trust assets for his college tuition, rather\n\n   than to face the uncertainty inherent in the current situation.\n\f                                                                        _ _ 2013.\nSworn to and subscribed before me by Katherine F.

Petitioner respectfully shows the Court as\n\nfollows:\n\n                                            PARTIES\n\n   I. Katherine F. Warren appears as next fi'iend of Daniel S. Weiner pursuant to Rule 44 of\n\n       the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure and files this action on his behalf in his capacity as\n\n       beneficiary of the DANIEL STEPHEN WEINER 1996 TRUST (\"Trust\"). Daniel S.\n\n       Weiner, a minor, was born on March 11, 1996. He will be an adult on March II, 2014.\n\n       No legal guardian or attorney ad litem has been appointed for DanielS. Weiner.\n\n   2. Daniel S. Weiner (\"Primary Beneficiary\") has an interest in tltis proceeding under Texas\n\n       Trust Code § 111.004(7). He is also a necessary pmiy under Texas Trust Code §\n\n       115.011(2) because he is the primary beneficiary named in the Trust.\n\n   3. Katherine F. Warren has the exclusive right to represent Daniel S. Weiner in legal action\n\n       and to make decisions of substantial legal significance concerning him pursuant to the\n                                                                                                        EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                                             exhibitsticker.com\n\n\n\n\n                                                  I\n\n                                                                                                             TAB H\n\f    Agreed Final Decree of Divorce (\"Divorce Decree\"), Cause No. 2011-01040 in the\n\n    District Court of the 309'\" Judicial District in Hanis County, Texas, which is attached as\n\n    \"Exhibit B\" and incorporated for all pmposes. Texas Trust Code§ 115.013(c)(3) petmits\n\n    a parent to represent her child as guardian ad litem or next friend if there is no conflict of\n\n    interest and no guardian of the estate or guardian ad litem has been appointed. Ms.\n\n    Wan·en's interests do not conflict with those of DanielS. Weiner.\n\n4. Katherine F. Wanen is an individual acting as tmstee of the Tmst. Ms. WmTen is joined\n\n    as a Respondent herein because she has an interest in the proceeding under Texas Tmst\n\n    Code § 111.004(7) and is a necessary party pursuant to Texas Tmst Code §\n\n    115.011(b)(4).   She cmTently resides at 1226 Muirfield Place, Houston, Hanis County,\n\n   Texas 77055.\n\n5. Andy I. Weiner is an individual acting as trustee of the Tmst. Mr. Weiner is joined as a\n\n   Respondent herein because he has an interest in this proceeding under Texas Tmst Code\n\n   § 111.004(7) and is a necessary party pursuant to Texas Trust Code§ 115.011(b)(4). Mr.\n\n   Weiner currently resides at 1200 Post Oak Blvd., Apmiment 907, Houston, Texas 77056.\n\n6. The situs of the Trust is Houston, Hanis County, Texas.\n\n\n                                     JURISDICTION\n\n7. The subject matter of this dispute involves the management and modification of the Trust\n\n   estate of the DANIEL STEPHEN WEINER 1996 TRUST. This Court has jurisdiction\n\n   over this subject matter pursuant to Texas Trust Code§ 115.001(d)(1) and Texas Probate\n\n   Code§ 4G.\n\n\n\n\n                                             2\n\f                           RESPONSE TO PLEA IN ABATEMENT\n\n8. Respondent Andy I. Weiner filed a Plea in Abatement in this action alleging that he had\n\n    commenced an earlier suit on the same subject matter involving the same patties in the\n\n    3091h Judicial Disllict. In order to succeed on his Plea in Abatement, Mr. Weiner must\n\n   show that I) he commenced suit first, 2) the suit is still pending, 3) the same parties are\n\n   involved, and 4) the controversies are the same. In re Sims, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 303 (Tex.\n\n   App. - San Antonio 2002, Wiit granted).        The undisputed record shows that the Mr.\n\n   Weiner cannot meet the last two requirements. On their face, Mr. Weiner's pleadings\n\n   show that the parties are not the same in the District Comt and the Probate Court. Daniel\n\n   S. Weiner is not a party in the District Court action. Daniel S. Weiner would be a\n\n   necessary party to a suit involving the DANIEL STEPHEN WEINER 1996 TRUST\n\n   because he is a named beneficiary. Tex. Trust Code§ 115.01l(b)(2). A lack of necessary\n\n   parties deprives the first court of dominant jurisdiction. Mission Res. v. Garza Energy\n\n   Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">268</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328 (Tex.

A defendant, however, is not at libetty to decline to do battle in the\n\n   forum chosen by the plaintiff. Id. Accordingly, Mr. Weiner's Plea in Abatement should\n\n   be denied.\n\n9. Nor can Mr. Weiner show that he had a prior case involving the same subject matter\n\n   when Petitioner filed his case in the Probate Comt. Two controversies involve the same\n\n   subject matter when the issues presented in each case are \"inherently intenelated\" - i.e.\n\n   one controversy cannot be resolved without resolving the other. In re Puig, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895341\"><a href=\"/opinion/895341/in-re-puig/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n   <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 305 (Tex. 2011); Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 247. That is not the case here. The pleadings\n\n\n\n                                            3\n\f          on their face reveal that the subject matters in the two actions are wholly dissimilar. The\n\n          alienation issues can be resolved without modifying the Tmst and the Trust can be\n\n          modified without resolving the alienation issues.\n\n     10. The hemi of Mr. Weiner's Petition to Modify Parent-Child Relationship (\"SAPCR\" 1)\n\n         filed on August 14, 2013 is a claim of alienation from his children allegedly caused by\n\n         Katherine F. Wan·en, his ex-wife. See Suppotiing Affidavit to Exhibit A to Mr. Weiner's\n\n         Plea in Abatement. Mr. Weiner's SAPCR contained a litany of grievances and relief\n\n         requested in order to stop the alienation. Among them was a request for the exclusive\n\n         right to consent to the children's psychiattic and psychological treatment, to manage their\n\n         estates, 2 to represent them in legal action, and to exercise a fully expanded Standard\n\n         Possession Order. Mr. Weiner also requested temporary orders for psychological\n\n         evaluation of the whole family, the appointment of an Amicus Attorney, mandatory\n\n         alternative dispute resolution (\"ADR\"), access to the children's health care records, and\n\n         enforcement of the Divorce Decree's order that the Fidelity Trust accounts be changed to\n\n         \"and\" accounts. He also requested a temporary restraining order to prevent Ms. Wan·en\n\n         from withdrawing the children from school where they are presently enrolled and making\n\n         disparaging remarks about him in front of the children. And finally, he requested a\n\n         permanent injunction to prevent Ms. Wan·en from changing the names of the children.\n\n         There was no mention of Trust management or modification and hence no inherent\n\n         intenelation of the initial subject matter of the two suits. In re Puig, 351 S.W.3d at 305;\n\n         Wyatt, 760 S.W.2d at 247.\n\n1\n  Suit Affecting the Parent-Child Relationship (\"SAPCR\") means a suit filed in which the appointment of a\nmanaging conservator or a possessory conservator, access to or support of a child, or establishment or termination of\nthe parent-child relationship is requested. Tex. Family Code§ 101.032.\n2\n  The children have a Unifonn Transfer to Minors Account (\"UTMA\"), which Ms. WaiTen was awarded sole and\nexclusive control of on page 9 of the original Divorce Decree dated March 29, 2012.\n\n                                                         4\n\fII. It was only after Petitioner filed suit to modify the Trust on September 30, 2013 that Mr.\n\n   Weiner amended hiss pleadings in the District Court on October 18, 2013 to request \"the\n\n   exclusive right to manage the existing ttusts of the children.\" See page 2 of Exhibit B to\n\n   Mr. Weiner's Plea in Abatement. This addition is the only change that was made in the\n\n   amended pleadings. See Mr. Weiner's Exhibits A and B to his Plea in Abatement. In\n\n   essence, Mr. Weiner amended his pleading to set up a new subject matter in order to\n\n   obtain dominant jurisdiction in the District Court. But this is directly contrary to the\n\n   Texas Supreme Court's ruling in State of Texas v. Boyd, in which the Court held that a\n\n   party cannot obtain dominant jurisdiction by amending its pleadings in the first court to\n\n   set up a subject matter similar to a different case in a second court involving the same\n\n  parties. State of Texas v. Boyd, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">136</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">II</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 07 (Tex. 1940). The plaintiff in Boyd\n\n   amended its pleading in the Ha!Tis County District Court to set up a similar subject matter\n\n  as another suit involving the same defendant in Travis County. The plaintiff then filed a\n\n  plea in abatement alleging that it had a prior suit on the same subject matter pending in\n\n  Han-is County. The Court held that such action did not bestow dominant jurisdiction on\n\n  the first case because they were wholly dissimilar prior to the amendment. Id. These\n\n  facts are identical to the case at bar in which Mr. Weiner amended his parent-child\n\n  alienation case against his ex-wife to add a new subject matter- management of the Trust\n\n  estate - and then alleged that he had a prior suit pending on the same subject matter as\n\n  Petitioner's case in the Probate Court. But the law is clear that amending a pleading to\n\n  set up a subject matter similar to a second action does not give the first action dominant\n\n  jurisdiction where the subject matter of the two cases were \"wholly dissimilar\" prior to\n\n  the amendment. Id.\n\n\n\n                                           5\n\f                        RESPONSE TO PLEA TO THE JURISDICTION\n\n12. Mr. Weiner also filed a Plea to the Jurisdiction on October 23, 2013 alleging that the\n\n    District Court has continuing exclusive jurisdiction over matters pertaining to the Trust\n\n    estate.   But that asse1iion is directly contrary to the statute. Texas Family Code §\n\n    155.001(a) confers exclusive continuing exclusive jurisdiction over only the matters\n\n   provided for in Title 5 of the Texas Family Code. These include \"orders regarding\n\n   managing conservatorship, possessory conservatorship, possession of and access to the\n\n   child, and support of the child.\" Tex. Family Code§ 155.003(a). The limits of the District\n\n   Comi's continuing exclusive jurisdiction are not boundless. They include only those\n\n   matters expressly enumerated in Texas Family Code § 155.003(a), which are not\n\n   involved in Petitioner's action to modifY the Trust. Accordingly, this Court should deny\n\n   Mr. Weiner's Plea to the Jurisdiction.\n\n13. A hearing is scheduled on the Plea in Abatement and the Plea to the Jurisdiction for\n\n   November II, 2013 at I :30 p.m. in this Court.\n\n                                        VENUE\n\n14. Venue of this proceeding is proper in this Comi pursuant to Texas Trust Code §\n\n   115.002(b-2) and Texas Probate Code§ 8.\n\n                                        FACTS\n\n15. The Trust is an inter vivos minor's trust created under Internal Revenue Code§ 2503(c)\n\n   by Ms. Wan·en and Mr. Weiner by agreement dated March 20, 1996 for the benefit of\n\n   their son, DanielS. Weiner, the Primary Beneficimy and Petitioner.\n\n\n\n\n                                            6\n\f16. At the present time, Daniel S. Weiner is the only beneficiary of the Trust. Daniel S.\n\n    Weiner is a high school senior and straight-A student at The Kincaid School in Houston,\n\n    Texas. He is completing applications to attend college in the Fall of 2014 and is\n\n    concemed about being able to depend on distributions fi·om the Tmst to help pay for his\n\n    college.\n\n17. The Tmst estate consists of marketable securities and cash in the approximate value of\n\n    $113,000 as of August 31, 2013.\n\n18. The Trust is authorized under Section A-1 to make disttibutions to the Ptimary\n\n   Beneficiary as follows:\n\n           \"The income of the trust may be accumulated and retained, in\n\n           whole or in pati, or the tmstee may distribute to Daniel, fi·om time\n\n           to time, so much or all of the bust estate as, in the trustee's\n\n           discretion, is in Daniel's best interests.\"\n\n19. Pursuant to Section A-2 of the Trust, the Ptimary Beneficiary may withdraw all or part of\n\n   the Trust estate within 60 days after becoming age 21, and may thereby te1minate the\n\n   trust as to the pati withdrawn.        If the Primaty Beneficiary does not exercise his\n\n   withdrawal tight, the Trust continues until the Ptimary Beneficiary becomes age 30.\n\n20. Section A-2 of the Trust provides that in the event the Primary Beneficiary should die\n\n   before the Trust tenninates, then all assets remaining in the Trust shall be held or\n\n   distributed by the Trustee for the benefit of those in favor of whom the Primary\n\n   Beneficiary exercises a power of appointment, or otherwise in the following order:(!) to\n\n   the Ptimary Beneficiary's descendants, (2) if none of the descendants are then living, to\n\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\f    the trustors' descendants, (3) if none of the trustors' descendants are then living, to the\n\n    trustors' heirs.\n\n21. The initial and current bus tees of the Trust are Ms. Warren and Mr. Weiner. In the event\n\n    that both Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren cease to act as tmstee, Bayle Weiner Drubel, Mr.\n\n    Weiner's sister, who is believed to live in Dmtmouth, Massachusetts, is appointed\n\n    successor tmstee under Section D-l(a) of the Trust.\n\n22. The tmstees were granted a divorce on March 29, 2012.

The Texas Trust Code provides that on the petition of a beneficiary, a Court may order\n\n   that the trustee be changed or that the trust be otherwise modified if modification of\n\n   administrative, non-dispositive tenns of the trust is necessary or appropriate to prevent\n\n   waste or avoid impainnent of the Trust's administration.

Petitioner believes that the inability of the trustees to agree on management of the Trust\n\n    has impaired the Tmst's administration. Modification of the Tmst is necessary to prevent\n\n    the tmstees' personal issues fi·om hindering their ability to effectively administer the\n\n    Trust.\n\n                                  RELIEF REQUESTED\n\n25. Petitioner requests that the Court order that the Tmst be modified to allow Daniel S.\n\n   Weiner to become trustee of the Trust upon attaining age 18 on March 11, 2014; that\n\n   modification of the Trust will further the purposes of the Trust; that modifying the Trust\n\n   is necessary or appropriate to prevent waste or avoid impaitment of the Tmst's\n\n   administration; and that the Court enter such other orders to effect the modification of the\n\n   Trust.\n\n26. Petitioner brings this action for the purpose of preserving and protecting the interests of\n\n   the Trust estate and its Primary Beneficiary. The relief sought herein is necessary to\n\n   enable the Tmst to fulfill its intended purposes. Accordingly, Petitioner is entitled to\n\n   recover reasonable attomey's fees and court costs from the Trust pursuant to Texas Trust\n\n   Code § 114.064 (\"In any proceeding under this code the comt may make such award of\n\n   costs and reasonable and necessary attomey's fees as may seem equitable and just\"). If\n\n   any of the other patties to this proceeding retain counsel to represent their interests in this\n\n   cause, the Court should detennine whether all or any portion of the attorney's fees and\n\n   court costs incurred by these parties should be paid by the Tmst.\n\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\f                                              PRAYER\n\n        WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, Petitioner prays that the Court grant the\n\nrequested relief and deny Mr. Weiner's Plea in Abatement and Plea to the Jurisdiction.\n\nPetitioner further prays for such other and further relief to which Petitioner is justly entitled.\n\n                                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                                       Cantrell & Cantrell, PLLC\n\n\n                                                       By:~·\n                                                       Carol A.

However, property\nacceptable to the trustee may be added to any trust from time to\ntime in the future by trusters or by any other person (including\nadditions pursuant to the provisions of the last will of any\nperson).\n\n     All references to \"trustee\" shall refer to the person or\npersons then acting as such.\n\n     A.

WARREN\n\n        Before me, the undersigned notary, on this ·day personally appeared KATHERINE F.\n\nWARREN, the affiant, whose identity is known to me. After I administered an oath, affiant\n\niestified as follows:·\n\n   1. My name is Katherine F. Warren. I am over eighteen years of age, of ~ound mind, and\n\n        capable of making this affidavit. The facts stated in this affidavit are within my personal\n\n       knowledge and are true and correct.\n\n   2. On December 13, 1994, Andy I. Weiner and I created the DAVID ABRAHAM WEJNER\n\n       1994 TRUST (the \"Trust\") for the benefit of our son, David W. Warren, formerly known\n\n      as David A. Weiner. Andy I. Weiner and I are the trustors and co-trustees of the Ttust.\n\n  3. The purpose of the Trust is to provide for the best interests of our son, David. A primary\n\n      purpose of the Trust is to fund his educational costs. I believe that it is in David's best\n\n    . interest to receive a quality education.\n\n 4. David is enrolled as a freshman at Rice University in Houston, Texas.             He began\n\n     attending classes in August 2013.\n\n5. Andy I. Weiner and I were granted a divorce on March 29, 2012. As part of the divorce\n\n    decree, the trust was to continue as provided under the trust agreement. Under the trust\n\n    agreement, Andy I. Weiner and I are required to act jointly as co-trustees.\n\n\n                                                 1\n\f     6. Although David is the primary beneficiary of the Trust, he applied for fmancial aid with\n\n         Rice University prior to the start of the Fall 2013 semester. David was denied fmancial\n\n         aid because of the Trust. The financial aid department of Rice University explained that\n\n        where students are the beneficiaries of trusts like the DAVID ABRAHAM WEINER\n\n        1994 TRUST, that the school assumes that the trust funds are intended for the payment of\n\n        college expenses.\n\n    7. David received a tuition bill from Rice University in July 2013. I wrote a check from the\n\n       Trust's Fidelity account for $20,000 or around August 1, 2013. The check was returned\n\n       to Rice University unpaid because Andy I. Weiner requested that Fidelity not honor the\n\n       check.\n\n   8. After the check was returned to Rice University unpaid, David received a letter from the\n\n      university advising him that his tuition payment was overdue. I requested that Fidelity\n\n      wire $20,000 to David, with which he paid his tuition. It took approximately six weeks\n\n      for the tuition payment to be credited to David's account with Rice University.\n\n  9. I believe that it is detrimental to the best interests of David for Andy I. Weiner and I to\n\n     continue acting as co-trustees of the Trust. Our disagreements regarding distributions of\n\n     David's behalf could seriously inhibit his ability to receive a wonderful educatio!J .\n\n. 10. David is an intelligent adult and is capable of using the Trust assets for his best interests.\n\n     I believe that David has shown maturity beyond most otber college students his age. It\n\n    would be in his best interests to be given the Tlust assets for his college tuition, rather\n\n    than to face the uncetiaintyinherent in the current situation.\n\n\n\n\n                                           ' 2\n\fSworn to and subscribed before me by Katherine F.

Venue of this proceeding is proper in this Court pursuant to Texas Trust Code §\n\n115.002(b).\n\n                                  THE ORIGINAL LAWSUIT\n\n    6. Plaintiff David W. Warren filed an Original Petition for Termination of Trust on\n\n September 30, 2013 seeking to terminate the David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust.\n\n Respondents Andy I. Weiner and Katherine R. Warren were joined as necessary parties\n\n under Texas Property Code § 115.011 because they are trustees of the trust.\n\n    7. On October 23, 2013, Respondent Weiner filed an answer to plaintiff’s original petition\n\n asserting a general denial as well as affirmative defenses of res judicata, collateral estoppel,\n\n the doctrine of unclean hands, and the terms of the trust.\n\n    8. On November 1, 2013, plaintiff David Warren filed a First Amended Original Petition\n\n for Modification of Trust and sought to remove both trustees and appoint himself as trustee\n\n rather than to terminate the trust.\n\n    9. On January 15, 2014 Respondent Warren filed an answer to plaintiff’s First Amended\n\n Original Petition for Modification of Trust and asserted a general denial.\n\n    10. On March 13, 2014 David W. Warren filed his Second Amended Original Petition\n\n seeking to remove only Andy I. Weiner as trustee and obtain damages against Andy I.\n\n Weiner for breach of fiduciary duty by failing to prudently invest David’s Trust funds and\n\n borrowing substantially all of David’s Trust’s funds, which is expressly prohibited by the\n\fTexas Trust Code § 113.052 and the terms of the trust instrument.\n\n                       INTERVENOR’S INTEREST IN LAWSUIT\n\n  11. Daniel S. Weiner has a justiciable interest in this lawsuit because he will be harmed if\n\nthe Court finds that Andy I. Weiner did nothing wrong by borrowing substantially all of the\n\nfunds from David’s Trust on April 9, 2009 for his own personal use and benefit while he was\n\ntrustee. Andy I. Weiner also borrowed substantially all of the funds from Daniel’s Trust on\n\nthe same day in the same transaction for Respondent Weiner’s his own personal use and\n\nbenefit without interest or collateral while he was trustee of Daniel’s Trust. The trust\n\ninstruments of both David’s Trust and Daniel’s Trust expressly prohibit borrowing by the\n\ntrustee.\n\n  12. Daniel S. Weiner will also be harmed in this lawsuit if the Court finds that Andy I.\n\nWeiner did nothing wrong by maintaining the assets of David’s Trust in cash for 3.5 years\n\nwhile the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 Index, and the NASDAQ advanced by\n\n72 to 203 percent during that time period. Andy I. Weiner also maintained the assets of\n\nDaniel’s Trust in cash during that same time period.\n\n  13. Daniel S. Weiner will also be harmed in this lawsuit if the Court finds that Andy I.\n\nWeiner did nothing wrong by investing more than half of David’s Trust portfolio in Weiners\n\nStores, Inc. when the company had a history of bankruptcy and was ultimately sold for a\n\ncomplete loss. Andy I. Weiner also invested over 65 percent of Daniel’s Trust portfolio in\n\nWeiner Stores, Inc. during the same time period and sold the stock for a complete loss.\n\n  14. Daniel S. Weiner will also be harmed in this lawsuit if the Court finds that Andy I.\n\nWeiner did nothing wrong by failing to diversify David’s Trust portfolio and consequently\n\nselling the stocks for a significant loss. Andy I Weiner also failed to diversify Daniel’s Trust\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\fDaniel’s Trust by investing in the same stocks (Autozone Inc., Kohls Corp, Lowes\n\nCompanies, Whole Foods Market, and 99 Cents Only Stores) as David’s Trust and selling\n\nthem at the same time for a loss of $30,586.\n\n  15. Because Daniel Weiner challenges the very same transactions that David Warren is\n\nalready challenging, his claims arise from the same transactions or occurrences and involve\n\ncommon questions of law and fact with David’s claims – namely, whether the actions of\n\nAndy I. Weiner in failing to prudently invest the trust assets and borrowing nearly all of the\n\ntrust corpus for Respondent Weiner’s own benefit constitute breaches of fiduciary duty. The\n\noutcome of David W. Warren’s case will substantially affect the interest of Daniel S. Weiner\n\nbecause they complain of the same transactions by the same trustee during the same time\n\nperiod pertaining to identical trusts with identical assets.\n\n  16. A party has a justiciable interest in a lawsuit when its interests will be affected by the\n\nlitigation. {In re Union Carbide Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895059\"><a href=\"/opinion/895059/in-re-union-carbide-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">152</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 155 (Tex. 2008); Law Offices of\n\nWindle Turley, P.C. v.

Weiner is the beneficiary of the Daniel Steven Weiner 1996\n\nTrust (Daniel’s Trust), an irrevocable inter vivos trust created by Respondents (trustors)\n\nWarren and Weiner on March 20, 1996. A true and correct copy of the trust agreement is\n\nattached hereto as “Exhibit A” and is incorporated for all purposes.\n\f18.   Respondents Andy I. Weiner and Katherine R. Weiner, are Trustees of the Trust.\n\nRespondent Weiner’s sister Bayle Weiner Drubel is successor trustee in the event that both\n\nRespondents Weiner and Warren cease to serve.\n\n19. Daniel S. Weiner was born on March 18, 1996 and is an adult.\n\n20. The primary purpose of Daniel’s Trust is to pay for Daniel’s education. He is presently\n\na senior student at Kinkaid High School in Houston, Texas. He has accepted enrollment at\n\nRice University in Houston, Texas to attend classes in the fall of 2014.\n\n21. Daniel’s Trust owns marketable securities worth approximately $124,983 as of January\n\n31, 2014. The Trust assets came from various sources including Daniel’s own income tax\n\nrefunds, birthday and Hanukkah gifts, and checks payable to the Custodian of his Uniform\n\nGifts to Minors Account. Respondent Weiner “endorsed” these checks over to Daniel’s Trust\n\nwithout Daniel’s knowledge.\n\n22. The Trustee is authorized to make discretionary distributions to the beneficiary as are\n\nin the beneficiary's best interest. The beneficiary may withdraw the entire Trust corpus upon\n\nreaching age 21.\n\n23. On March 25, 2009, Respondent Andy I. Weiner liquidated the entire portfolio of\n\nDaniel’s Trust and incurred a capital loss of $30,586.\n\n24. On April 9, 2009 Respondent Weiner borrowed $90,959.38 from Daniel’s Trust,\n\nleaving $1,000 in the trust. On the same day Respondent Weiner borrowed $126,641.40 from\n\nDavid’s Trust and $82,474.40 from his other son Michael Weiner’s trust, leaving only\n\n$1,000 in each of those trusts. In all, Respondent borrowed $300,075.18 from his sons’ trusts\n\nfor his own personal use and benefit while he was trustee.\n\n\n\n\n                                               5\n\f25. On December 19, 2013, Daniel S. Weiner demanded an accounting of his trust under\n\nTexas Trust Code § 113.151-152. Respondent Weiner has ignored his demand.\n\n26. In 1999, Daniel’s Trust purchased 34,000 shares of Wieners Stores, Inc. stock, in\n\naddition to the 18,000 shares it already owned. On August 31, 1999, Weiners Stores, Inc.\n\naccounted for over 65 percent of Daniel’s Trust’s portfolio.\n\n27. Respondent Weiner was an Executive Vice President of Weiner Stores, Inc. until 1995\n\nwhen it declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Weiners Stores emerged from bankruptcy on\n\nAugust 26, 1997 and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again on October 16, 2000.\n\n 28. On December 6, 2001, Daniel’s Trust sold 52,000 shares of Wieners Stores, Inc. for\n\n2/10ths of a cent per share for a total loss of $28,762.44.\n\n29. From July 1, 1999 to March 25, 2009 Daniel’s Trust invested in only five to eight\n\nindividual stocks in a portfolio worth less than $90,000.\n\n30. From March 26, 2009 to September 11, 2012 Daniel’s Trust’s account at Fidelity\n\nconsisted entirely of cash. During this time the trust earned $99.13 of interest income, while\n\nthe Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 72 percent, the S&P 500 Index increased by\n\n79 percent, and the NASDAQ Composite increased by over 203 percent.\n\n31. Daniel S. Weiner did not discover Respondent Weiner’s borrowing or failure to\n\nprudently invest his Trust funds until discovery began in David Warren’s case. Daniel\n\nWeiner was a minor when the borrowings and other breaches occurred. The period of\n\nlimitations does not begin to run against a person entitled to bring an action for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty while the person is under 18 years of age. {Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§\n\n16.001, 16.004.} Daniel S. Weiner became 18 on March 18, 2014 and is thus within the\n\nlimitations period for bringing this action.\n\f                                   CAUSES OF ACTION\n\n32. Daniel S. Weiner incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the\n\npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.\n\n33. There is a real and justiciable controversy between Daniel S. Weiner and Respondent\n\nAndy I. Weiner concerning Respondent Weiner’s actions as trustee of Daniel’s Trust.\n\n34. Respondent Weiner has materially breached his fiduciary duties in the following\n\nmanner:\n\n      a.         By borrowing substantially all of the assets of Daniel’s Trust for his own\n\n  personal use and benefit on April 9, 2009 without interest or collateral in violation of\n\n  Paragraph E-3(a) of the Trust Agreement and the Texas Trust Code § 113.052, both of\n\n  which expressly forbid borrowing by the trustee;\n\n      b.         By commingling substantially all of Daniel’s Trust assets with Respondent\n\n  Weiner's own personal funds in violation of the duty of loyalty under Texas Trust Code §\n\n  117.007, the duty not to profit by self-dealing with the trust under Texas Trust Code §\n\n  114.0001(a), and the common law duty to segregate trust assets;\n\n      c.         By investing over 65 percent of Daniel’s Trust assets in Weiner Stores, Inc. in\n\n  1999, resulting in a material loss to the trust in violation of the prudent investor rule under\n\n  Texas Trust Code § 117.004;\n\n      d.         By failing to properly diversify Daniel’s Trust property resulting in a material\n\n  loss to the trust in violation of the duty to diversify under Texas Trust Code § 117.005;\n\n      e.         By failing to prudently invest Daniel’s Trust property resulting in a material\n\n  loss to the trust in violation of the prudent investor rule under Texas Trust Code § 117.004;\n\n\n\n\n                                                7\n\f       f.         By failing to render an accounting despite written demand by Daniel S.\n\n    Weiner on December 19, 2013 in violation of the duty to account under Texas Trust Code\n\n    §§ 113.151 and 113.152.\n\n   Daniel and his trust have suffered substantial economic damages as a direct result of\n\nRespondent Weiner’s material breaches of fiduciary duty enumerated above.\n\n  35. Daniel Weiner further claims that Respondent Weiner’s sister, Bayle Weiner Drubel,\n\n should not be named as successor trustee in the event Respondents are unable to serve\n\n because she has a material conflict of interest with respect to this Trust due to her\n\n relationship with Respondent Weiner. As a result of her conflict, Ms. Drubel would not be\n\n capable of properly performing her fiduciary duties. {Kappus v.

WARREN\n\nBy:_/s/ Carol A. Cantrell\n\f                   DANIEL STEVEN WEINER 1996 TRUST\n\n     By this trust agreement, Andy I .

Each living child shall take one share and the share of\neach deceased child shall be divided among his then living\ndescendants in the same manner.   \"Trusters' descendants\" includes\nonly those persons descended from both trustors.\nF-3.   Heirs.   Any distribution to be made to the \"heirs\" of a\nperson shall be made to the individuals who would have inherited\nthe person's personal property if the person had died intestate at\nthe time the distribution is to be made, domiciled in Texas and not\nmarried, under the laws of Texas in force on the effective date of\nthis trust agreement, with the shares of taking determined by those\nlaws.

Warren (Daniel), Petitioner and Beneficiary of the Daniel Steven\n\nWeiner 1996 Trust, and files this Original Petition pursuant to the Court’s Order (attached\n\n“Exhibit A”) granting his Motion to Sever his causes of action from Cause No. 425,577, In Re\n\nDavid Abraham Weiner 1996 Trust. Petitioner seeks removal of Andy I. Weiner as Trustee of\n\nthe Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust and damages for breach of fiduciary duty.\n\n                                           PARTIES\n\n 1.    Daniel W. Warren, Petitioner, is an individual and Beneficiary of the Daniel Steven\n\n Weiner 1996 Trust (Daniel’s Trust). Daniel W. Warren resides in Harris County, Texas at\n\n 1226 Muirfield, Houston, TX 77055. The last three digits of his driver’s license number are\n\n 996. The last three digits of his Social Security number are 039.\n\n 2.    Andy I. Weiner, Respondent, is an individual acting as trustee of Daniel’s Trust. He\n\n appeared and answered as Respondent in Cause No. 425,577, from which this case was\n\n severed. Mr. Weiner currently resides at 111 Post Oak Blvd., Apartment 452, Houston,\n\n Texas 77056. He can be served through his attorney of record, Sarah Patel-Pacheco, Crain\n\n Caton & James, 1401 McKinney, 17th Floor, Houston, Texas 77010.\n\n 3. Katherine R. Warren, is an individual acting as trustee of Daniel’s Trust. She appeared and\n\n answered as a Respondent and Cross-Defendant in Cause No. 425,577 from which this case\n\n was severed. Petitioner released her of all liability in connection with her trusteeship\n                                                                                           EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                            exhibitsticker.com\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\n\n                                                                                             TAB L\n\fpursuant to Texas Property Code § 114.005 and on August 7, 2014, filed a Notice of Nonsuit\n\nagainst Ms. Warren in Cause No. 425,577, which applies to this case in the same manner as\n\nif it had been filed under this Cause No. 425,576-401.\n\n\n                              DISCOVERY CONTROL PLAN\n\n4.   This case is subject to the discovery control plan and deadlines set out in the Agreed\n\nDocket Control Order dated August 27, 2014 relating to Cause No. 425,577.\n\n                                           VENUE\n\n5.   Venue of this proceeding is proper in this Court pursuant to Texas Property Code §\n\n115.002(b).\n\n                                            FACTS\n\n6.     Daniel W. Warren is the sole beneficiary of the Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust\n\n(Daniel’s Trust), an irrevocable inter vivos trust created by Respondent Andy Weiner and\n\nKatherine Warren on March 20, 1996. A true and correct copy of the Trust Agreement is\n\nattached hereto as “Exhibit B” and is incorporated for all purposes. Although neither party\n\nhas a signed copy of Daniel’s Trust Agreement, the parties have admitted the authenticity of\n\nthe unsigned copy in pleadings and discovery.\n\n7.     Andy I. Weiner and Katherine R. Warren, are Trustors (settlors) and Trustees of\n\nDaniel’s Trust. Either trustee may serve alone if one of them should cease to act as trustee.\n\n[Paragraph D-1 of Daniel’s Trust Agreement].\n\n8.   The Trust Agreement grants the trustee discretion to make distributions for Daniel’s\n\nbest interest, considering his age, the income and transfer tax effects, the cost of his support,\n\nmaintenance, education, and comfort without regard to any other resources available to him\n\n\n\n\n                                                2\n\ffor these purposes, and any other factors the trustee deems relevant. [Paragraphs A-1 and C-2\n\nof Daniel’s Trust Agreement].\n\n9.    However, no distributions can be made “to a trustor, to any spouse of a trustor, or in\n\nany manner that discharges a legal obligation (including an obligation of support) of a trustor\n\nor any spouse of a trustor. Any distribution under this paragraph shall be a full discharge of\n\nthe trustee with respect thereto.” [Paragraph C-1 of the Trust Agreement].\n\n10.   Daniel’s Trust currently owns marketable securities worth approximately $108,043 as\n\nof September 30, 2014. The Trust assets came from a variety of sources, but primarily from\n\nDaniel’s grandparents who wrote checks payable to “Andy Weiner, Custodian for Daniel\n\nWeiner,” which Andy Weiner endorsed and deposited into Daniel’s Trust.\n\n11.   Daniel’s Trust Agreement provides that Daniel may withdraw the entire Trust corpus\n\nwithin 60 days after he becomes 21. To the extent Daniel does not exercise this withdrawal\n\nright, the Trust continues until Daniel becomes 30, or dies, whichever is earlier.\n\n12.   The Trust Agreement prohibits loans without adequate interest. It also prohibits loans to\n\na trustor as follows: “No power granted the trustee shall be construed to enable any person to\n\npurchase, exchange, or otherwise deal with or dispose of any trust estate for less than an\n\nadequate consideration in money or money’s worth or to authorize loans to any person\n\nwithout adequate interest. No part of any trust estate may be (i) loaned to a trustor or to any\n\nspouse of a trustor….” [Paragraph E-3(a) of the Trust Agreement]. Andy Weiner admits that\n\nhe read Paragraph E-3(a) before he borrowed the money. But he decided that “It was better\n\nto borrow money from this trust than go into bankruptcy.” [Deposition of Andy Weiner, Jan.\n\n16, 2014, page 33, lines 13-16].\n\n13.   The Trust Agreement waives the trustee’s common law duty to diversify the Trust\n\n\n\n                                               3\n\finvestments by permitting the trustee to invest in “property of any description,” including\n\n“property unproductive of income, 1 shares of open or closed end investment trusts or\n\ncompanies, wasting assets, 2 and any other property, regardless of location and without regard\n\nto any requirement of diversification as to kind or amount.” [Paragraph E-1(a) of Daniel’s\n\nTrust Agreement].\n\n14.   However, the Trust Agreement does not waive the trustee’s duty to exercise judgment\n\nor the duty not to speculate with Trust assets under Texas Property Code § 113.056, which\n\napplied prior to January 1, 2004, as follows:\n\n      Unless the terms of the trust instrument provide otherwise, in acquiring, investing,\n\n      reinvesting, exchanging, retaining, selling, supervising, and managing trust\n\n      property… a trustee shall exercise the judgment and care under the circumstances\n\n      then prevailing that persons of ordinary prudence, discretion, and intelligence in\n\n      the management of their own affairs, not in regard to speculation but in regard\n\n      to the permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income from\n\n      as well as the probable increase in value and safety of their capital.\n\n15.   Nor does the Trust Agreement waive the trustee’s duty to prudently invest the Trust\n\nassets and make them productive. Texas Property Code § 117.004(a) provides that: “A\n\ntrustee shall invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor would, by considering the\n\npurposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust.” Langford\n\nv. Shamburger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2420410\"><a href=\"/opinion/2420410/langford-v-shamburger/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 444-445, n.r.e. (It is a breach of fiduciary duty to\n\nunreasonably delay the investment of trust funds).\n\n\n1\n  “Property unproductive of income” is property that has with little or no income, but is expected to appreciate,\nsuch as raw land or growth oriented (low-yield) stocks. [Rest. 3rd, Trusts (Prudent Investor Rule § 227, cmts.]\n2\n  “Wasting assets” are those that are overproductive of income, such as an oil well or coal deposit that depletes\nitself through use over time. [Rest. 3rd, Trusts (Prudent Investor Rule § 227, cmts.]\n\n                                                       4\n\f16.   The Trust Agreement relieves the trustee of liability “for any act or omission except in\n\nthe case of gross negligence, bad faith or fraud. Specifically in assessing the propriety of any\n\ninvestment of a trust estate, the overall performance of the entire trust estate shall be taken\n\ninto account.” [Paragraph D-3(b) of the Trust Agreement] This Paragraph does not excuse\n\nAndy Weiner for intentionally breaching his fiduciary duty. Nor could it, because Texas\n\nProperty Code § 114.007(a) renders any term of a trust relieving a trustee of liability for an\n\nintentional breach of trust as unenforceable.\n\n17.   Andy Weiner began purchasing Weiners Stores Inc. stock for the Trust in 1999, shortly\n\nafter it began trading on the OTC Bulletin Board in August 1998. OTC stocks do not meet\n\nthe listing requirements of the national exchanges like NYSE, AMEX, and NASDAQ\n\nbecause they tend to be too small, closely held, thinly traded and risky.\n\n18.   Weiners Stores Inc. had just emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in August 1997, had\n\nonly 518 shareholders, and was trading at 12.5 cents to $1.50 a share in 1998 and 1999. 3 Its\n\nAnnual Report filed with the SEC in April 1999 reported that its sales were sliding and it had\n\nnot paid a dividend or had an operating profit in the last five years. Id.\n\n19.   Andy Weiner was aware that Weiners Stores Inc. was a risky investment. He was an\n\nexecutive officer of Weiners Stores Inc. for five to eight years before it filed for bankruptcy\n\nin 1995. [Andy Weiner Deposition, Jan. 16, 2014, p. 14, lines 1-17] Andy Weiner has a BA\n\nfrom Stanford and a Masters in Business from the University of Texas and is a retail\n\nshopping center developer. [Id. at p. 13, lines 16-25].\n\n20. Andy Weiner made several purchases of Weiner Stores Inc. stock for the Trust in May,\n\n\n\n3\n  Weiners Stores Inc. Annual Report - [X] Reg. S-K Item 405 - Form 10-K, available at\nhttp://www.secinfo.com/dRx61.68u.d.htm#6thPage.\n\n\n                                                     5\n\fJune, and August 1999, spending $28,764 of Trust money. By August 31, 1999, he had\n\naccumulated 52,000 shares of Weiners Stores Inc. stock in the Trust, which was over 65\n\npercent of its value. Intentionally placing such a large percentage of the Trust’s assets at a\n\nrisk of total loss was grossly negligent. [Dolan v. Dolan, 2009 Tex. App.-Houston Lexis\n\n4487 (The trustee, an experienced businessman, was grossly negligent and ordered to pay\n\nexemplary damages for placing nearly half the trust assets at risk of total loss.)]\n\n21. Weiner Stores Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again in October 2000. It\n\nannounced that it was closing all of its stores in June 2001. Andy Weiner sold the Trust’s\n\n52,000 shares in December 2001 for $2, resulting in a complete loss of the Trust’s $28,762\n\ninvestment. Weiners Stores Inc. converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy six months later.\n\n22.   During the three years that Daniel’s Trust funds were invested in Weiners Stores Inc.\n\nstock, Daniel’s Trust lost over 12 percent of its portfolio value each year. Investing in\n\nWeiners Stores Inc. was grossly negligent based on the “overall performance of the entire\n\ntrust estate,” which is the standard set forth in the Trust Agreement by which the propriety of\n\nan investment will be evaluated.\n\n23.   On March 30, 2009, Andy Weiner liquidated the Trust’s entire portfolio and on April 9,\n\n2009 he knowingly and intentionally instructed Fidelity to transfer $90,959.38 to his own\n\npersonal account at Fidelity. This left $1,000 in the Trust, with no promissory note, no\n\ninterest, and no security for the $90,959.38 loan to Andy Weiner, who was “on the edge of\n\nbankruptcy.” Andy Weiner knew that making the loan to himself was directly contrary to the\n\nTrust Agreement and that it would place the entire Trust portfolio at risk of loss by making\n\nan unsecured loan to a person on the edge of bankruptcy. [Dolan v. Dolan, 2009 Tex. App.-\n\n\n\n\n                                                6\n\fHouston Lexis 4487 (The trustee was found to be grossly negligent and ordered to pay\n\nexemplary damages for loaning himself half the trust funds without interest or security.)]\n\n24.   On July 10, 2010, Andy Weiner repaid $90,959.38 to Daniel’s Trust without interest.\n\nThereafter, he purposely delayed reinvesting the Trust money for 26 months until September\n\n2012 when he finally invested the funds 51 percent in Fidelity Spartan 500 Index Fund\n\n(FUSEX), 31 percent in Fidelity Contrafund (FCNTX), and 18 percent in Fidelity Total Bond\n\nFund (FTBFX).\n\n25.   Had Andy Weiner invested Daniel’s Trust funds on April 9, 2009 in the same funds and\n\npercentages as he purchased for the Trust in September 2012, Daniel’s Trust would have\n\nearned $67,901 from April 9, 2009 to September 11, 2012. Yet the Trust earned less than\n\n$100 during this same time period. In fact, since its inception in 1996, Daniel’s Trust lost an\n\naverage of -1.167 percent per year. Based on the “overall performance of Daniel’s entire trust\n\nestate,” it was grossly negligent not to invest Daniel’s Trust money from April 9, 2009 to\n\nSeptember 11, 2012.\n\n26.   Failing to invest the Trust assets was also bad faith because Andy Weiner had an\n\nimproper motive for not investing the money. He planned to use the trust funds for his own\n\n“personal spending,” according to an email he wrote to Katherine in 2011 stating that he was\n\nready to consider investing the kid’s trust funds because “If we sell the Tractor’s in the near\n\nterm, we would not need their funds for our personal spending.” [Robson v.

Daniel W. Warren did not discover Andy Weiner’s breaches of fiduciary duty until\n\ndiscovery began in Cause No. 425,577. Daniel was a minor when the borrowings and\n\nimprudent investing occurred. The period of limitations does not begin to run against a\n\nperson entitled to bring an action for breach of fiduciary duty while the person is under 18\n\nyears old. [Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code §§ 16.001, 16.004.] Daniel W. Warren became age\n\n18 on March 11, 2014 and is thus within the limitations period for bringing this action.\n\n28.   On December 19, 2013, Daniel W. Warren, through his attorney, demanded an\n\naccounting of his Trust under Texas Property Code § 113.151-152. Andy Weiner has not yet\n\nprovided one.\n\n                                   CAUSES OF ACTION\n\n29.   Daniel W. Warren incorporates by reference each and every allegation contained in the\n\npreceding paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.\n\n30.   There is a real and justiciable controversy between Daniel W. Warren and Andy\n\nWeiner concerning Andy Weiner’s actions as trustee of Daniel’s Trust.\n\n31.   Andy Weiner has knowingly, intentionally, and with gross negligence breached his\n\nfiduciary duties in the following manner, resulting in a material loss to the Trust:\n\n      a.        By knowingly and intentionally exposing over 65 percent of Daniel’s Trust\n\n  funds to an extreme degree of risk by investing in Weiner Stores Inc., a highly speculative\n\n  unlisted penny stock with no earnings or dividend history, resulting in a complete loss of the\n\n  $28,762 investment, plus any future earnings it could have made, in violation of the duty to\n\n  prudently invest the Trust assets without speculation under the Texas Property Code §\n\n  113.056 as it applied prior to January 1, 2004, resulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n\n\n\n                                                8\n\f    b.     By knowingly and intentionally instructing Fidelity to transfer nearly all of\n\nDaniel’s Trust funds to Andy Weiner’s own personal account at Fidelity on April 9, 2009, in\n\nviolation of the Trust Agreement, which expressly forbids “loans to a trustor or any spouse\n\nof a trustor” and “loans to any person without adequate interest” [Paragraph E-3(a) of the\n\nTrust Agreement], which Andy Weiner read before he transferred the money to himself,\n\nresulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n    c.     By knowingly and intentionally instructing Fidelity to transfer nearly all of\n\nDaniel’s Trust funds to Andy Weiner’s own personal account at Fidelity on April 9, 2009 in\n\nviolation of the Trust Agreement Paragraph C-1, which expressly forbids “distributions to a\n\ntrustor, or in any manner that discharges a legal obligation (including an obligation of\n\nsupport) of a trustor or any spouse of a trustor,” resulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n    d.     By failing to compensate Daniel’s Trust for Andy Weiner’s personal use of\n\n$90,959.38 belonging to the Trust, resulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n    e.     By knowingly and intentionally putting his own interest above the beneficiary’s\n\nby using Daniel’s Trust funds as Andy Weiner’s own money, in violation of the duty of\n\nloyalty under Texas Trust Code § 117.007, the duty not to profit by self-dealing with the\n\nTrust under Texas Trust Code § 114.0001(a), and the duty to segregate trust assets under\n\nRestatement of the Law Third (Trusts) § 179, resulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n    f.         By knowingly, intentionally, and with bad faith failing to invest Daniel’s\n\nTrust funds from April 9, 2009 to September 11, 2012 in violation of the duty to prudently\n\ninvest the Trust assets under Texas Property Code § 117.004 and the duty of loyalty under\n\nTexas Property Code § 117.007, resulting in a material loss to the Trust;\n\n\n\n\n                                              9\n\f       g.          By refusing to render an accounting after written demand by Daniel W.\n\n   Warren on December 19, 2013 in violation of the duty to account under Texas Trust Code\n\n   §§ 113.151 and 113.152.\n\n 32.        Daniel and his Trust have suffered substantial economic damages as a direct result\n\n of Andy Weiner’s gross negligence and material breaches of fiduciary duty enumerated\n\n above.\n\n 33.      Removal of Andy Weiner as Trustee is necessary to prevent further harm to the Trust.\n\n\n                                   RELIEF REQUESTED\n\nWHEREFORE, Daniel W. Warren respectfully requests:\n\n  34. Judgment against Andy Weiner for a sum within the jurisdictional limits of the Court.\n\n  35. Monetary relief of over $200,000 but not more than $1,000,000.\n\n  36. Removal of Andy Weiner as Trustee of the Daniel Steven Weiner 1996 Trust pursuant\n\n to Texas Property Code §§ 114.008(a)(7) and 113.082;\n\n  37. That Andy Weiner be ordered to pay money or restore property to Daniel’s Trust equal\n\n to the trust’s lost profits caused by Andy Weiner’s improper borrowing and failure to\n\n prudently invest the Trust funds, pursuant to Texas Property Code § 114.008(a)(3) and its\n\n predecessor Texas Property Code § 113.056;\n\n  38. That Andy Weiner be ordered to pay Daniel’s Trust exemplary damages of greater than\n\n two times the Trust’s economic damages based his knowing, intentional, and reckless dealing\n\n with Trust property worth over $20,000 in a manner that is contrary to the Trust Agreement\n\n and the Texas Property Code, and involved a substantial risk of loss to the Trust. [Tex. Civ.\n\n Prac. & Rem. Code § 41.008(b), 41.008(c)(10); Tex. Penal Code § 32.45].\n\n                                                10\n\f39. That Daniel W. Warren be awarded reasonable and necessary attorney fees, costs, and\n\nexpenses through trial and all appeals under applicable Texas law, including but not limited\n\nto Texas Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code § 38.001 and Texas Property Code §§ 114.064 and\n\n113.151(a).\n\n40. That Andy Weiner be ordered to submit an accounting that meets the requirements of\n\nTexas Property Code § 113.152 and personally bear the cost of the accounting pursuant to\n\nTexas Property Code § 113.151.\n\n41. That Daniel’s Trust be modified pursuant to Texas Property Code § 112.054(a)(3) to\n\nappoint Daniel Warren as co-Trustee with Katherine Warren, or alternatively to terminate the\n\nTrust and distribute the funds to Daniel Warren.\n\n42. That Daniel W. Warren and his Trust be awarded prejudgment and post judgment\n\ninterest at the rate of 5 percent as provided by the Texas Finance Code § 304.003(c), or as\n\notherwise appropriate.\n\n                                         PRAYER\n\n WHEREFORE PREMISES CONSIDERED, Daniel W. Warren prays that the Court grant\n\n the requested relief and such further relief to which Daniel W.

Alternatively, the trustee may otherwise\napply all or a part of the distribution for the beneficiary's\nbenefit. However, no such distribution shall be made to a trustor,\nto any spouse of a trustor, or in any manner that discharges a\nlegal obligation (including an obligation of support) of a trustor\nor any spouse of a trustor. Any distribution under this paragraph\nshall be a full discharge of the trustee with respect thereto.\n\nc-2.  Best Interests of Beneficiary.    In making distributions in\nthe \"best interests\" of a beneficiary, the trustee may consider the\nage of the beneficiary, the costs of the beneficiary's support,\nmaintenance, education and comfort without regard to any other\nresources available to the beneficiary for these purposes, the\neffect of any distribution upon the income and transfer tax\nliability of the beneficiary or of the trust, and any other factors\ndeemed relevant by the trustee.\n\n       D.

If at\nany time there is no trustee acting and none has been appointed, a\nmajority of the beneficiaries (acting through the beneficiary's\nnatural or legal guardian or legal representative, in the case of\na beneficiary under a legal disability) who might then be entitled\nto receive a distribution from the trust estate shall appoint a\nsuccessor trustee.\n     (d)   Appointment of Co-Trustee.   The     trustee    (acting\nunanimously if more than one) may appoint one or more co-trustees.\n     (e) Who May Be Appointed. A successor trustee or co-trustee\nmay be any individual, bank or trust company and may be domiciled\nanywhere.\n      (f) Procedure for Appointment. Appointment shall be made by\nwritten instrument filed with the trust records.          Any such\nappointment may be changed or revoked prior to the date it becomes\neffective.   Any such appointment may be limited in any manner\ndeemed advisable by the person making the appointment, including,\nfor example, restricting the power over distributions as necessary\nto avoid the imposition of any tax upon the trust, the appointee or\nthe appointee's estate.\nD-2. Resignation of Trustee. A trustee may resign from a trust\nwithout the necessity of any court proceeding upon meeting these\nconditions:\n     (a) Notice . At least 30 days' written notice      (if not waived)\nshall be given to each beneficiary who might then       be entitled to\nreceive a distribution from the trust estate.

If and to the e x tent required by the\nsuccessor trustee, an accounting for the administration of the\ntrust shall be given to the successor trustee.      The successor\ntrustee shall be fully protected in relying upon such accounting.\nD-3.   Rights and Liabilities.\n\n       (a) Bond Not Required. No bond or other security shall be\n       required of any trustee.\n\n       (b)   Liabilities.

The trustee may maintain and\ndefend any claim or controversy by or against the trust without the\njoinder or consent of any beneficiary.\n      (h)    Additional Powers. In addition, the trustee shall have\nall rights, privileges and powers now or hereafter granted to\ntrustees in Texas, including those granted under the Texas Trust\nCode.     Any subsequent legislation or regulation expanding or\nlimiting the rights, privileges and powers granted a trustee shall\napply to all trusts hereunder unless the trustee elects not to have\nsuch legislation or regulation apply to a particular trust by a\nwritten instrument filed with the trust records.       However, the\nprovisions made for the various beneficiaries under this trust\nagreement are exclusive. Any statute that purports to enlarge the\nclass of beneficiaries to whom distributions may be made or the\npurposes for which distributions may be made shall not apply to any\ntrust.    All trust powers may be exercised upon such terms as the\ntrustee deems advisable and may affect trust properties for any\nlength of time regardless of the duration of the trust. Generally,\nand subject only to the terms of this trust agreement, the trustee\nshall hold, manage, control, use, invest, reinvest, and dispose of\nthe trust estate to the same extent as if the trustee were the fee\nsimple owner thereof.\nE-2.     Principal and Income Determinations.      The receipts,\ndisbursements and reserves of each trust may be allocated, on a\ncash or accrual basis, between principal and income in the\ntrustee's discretion without regard to the provisions of any\nstatute.

No part of any\ntrust estate may be (i) loaned to a trustor or to any spouse of a\ntrustor or (ii) applied to the payment of premiums on policies of\ninsurance on the life of a trustor or on the life of any spouse of\na trustor.\n\n                                -6-\n\f      (b)  Distributions to or for Trustee. Any power to make\ndiscretionary distributions to or for the benefit of a person who\nis serving as trustee of a trust (including distributions to the\nperson's spouse and distributions in discharge of any legal\nobligation of the person) shall be exercisable solely by the\ntrustee or trustees other than that person. If no other trustee is\nthen serving, such power shall not be exercisable.\n\nE-4. Release and Delegations of Powers. Any power granted to a\ntrustee may be released, in whole or in part, temporarily or\npermanently. Except as provided in Paragraph E-3, any such power\nmay be delegated, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently,\nto any other trustee then acting. A release or delegation shall be\nby written instrument filed with the records of each trust to which\nthe release or delegation applies.\n     F.   DEFINITIONS AND GENERAL PROVISIONS\nF-1.

A\nposthumous child shall be considered as living at the death of his\nparent. Whenever a distribution is to be made to the descendants\nof any person, the property to be distributed shall be divided into\nas many equal shares as there are living children of the person and\ndeceased children of the person who left descendants who are then\nliving.  Each living child shall take one share and the share of\neach deceased child shall be divided among his then living\ndescendants in the same manner.   \"Trusters' descendants\" includes\nonly those persons descended from both trusters.\nF-3.   Heirs.   Any distribution to be made to the \"heirs\" of a\nperson shall be made to the individuals who would have inherited\nthe person's personal property if the person had died intestate at\nthe time the distribution is to be made, domiciled in Texas and not\nmarried, under the laws of Texas in force on the effective date of\nthis trust agreement, with the shares of taking determined by those\nlaws.

Powers of Appointment Exercisable by Beneficiaries.       In\nexercising a power of appointment given to a beneficiary by this\ntrust agreement, the beneficiary may appoint the property subject\nto the power outright to the appointee, in trust, or to a custodian\nfor the appointee under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act of any\nstate.

He may\nimpose lawful conditions on an appointment and,, in general, may\nappoint to or among the appointees in any lawful manner.\nIn determining whether, in what manner and to what extent a\ntestamentary power of appointment has been exercised by a\nbeneficiary, the trustee may act in reliance upon a court order\nadmitting an instrument to probate as the beneficiary's last will\nor an order finding that the beneficiary died intestate.     Unless\nwithin six months after the beneficiary's death the trustee has\nactual notice of the existence of proceedings to probate a will of\nthe beneficiary, the trustee shall assume that the beneficiary died\n                                -8-\n\fintestate. The foregoing provisions are intended to expedite the\nprompt and efficient administration of the trust and to protect the\ntrustee from any action taken or distribution made in accordance\nwith these provisions.   Nothing in this paragraph shall limit or\nqualify any power of appointment given by this trust agreement or\nany right which an appointee or taker in default of appointment may\nhave against any person receiving a distribution from the trustee\nirrespective of the place of probate or of the time of discovery of\na will exercising the power or any other action taken in the\nbeneficiary's estate.\n\n     G.

Any portion of a trust estate upon the\ntrusts termination (other than a portion withdrawn by Daniel\npursuant to Paragraph A-2) which would be distributable to a\nbeneficiary who is under age 30 or to a beneficiary who is under a\nlegal disability instead shall be distributed to the trustee of a\nContingent Trust (unless otherwise directed by the valid exercise\nof a power of appointment) .

Alternatively, the trustee may otherwise\napply all or a part of the distribution for the beneficiary's\nbenefit. However, no such distribution shall be made to a trustor,\nto any spouse of a trustor, or in any manner that discharges a\nlegal obligation (including an obligation of support) of a trustor\nor any spouse of a trustor. Any distribution under this paragraph\nshall be a full discharge of the trustee with respect thereto.\n\nc-2.  Best Interests of Beneficiary.    In making distributions in\nthe \"best interests\" of a beneficiary, the trustee may consider the\nage of the beneficiary, the costs of the beneficiary's support,\nmaintenance, education and comfort without regard to any other\nresources available to the beneficiary for these purposes, the\neffect of any distribution upon the income and transfer tax\nliability of the beneficiary or of the trust, and any other factors\ndeemed relevant by the trustee.\n\n       D.

If at\nany time there is no trustee acting and none has been appointed, a\nmajority of the beneficiaries (acting through the beneficiary's\nnatural or legal guardian or legal representative, in the case of\na beneficiary under a legal disability) who might then be entitled\nto receive a distribution from the trust estate shall appoint a\nsuccessor trustee.\n     (d)   Appointment of Co-Trustee.   The     trustee    (acting\nunanimously if more than one) may appoint one or more co-trustees.\n     (e) Who May Be Appointed. A successor trustee or co-trustee\nmay be any individual, bank or trust company and may be domiciled\nanywhere.\n      (f) Procedure for Appointment. Appointment shall be made by\nwritten instrument filed with the trust records.          Any such\nappointment may be changed or revoked prior to the date it becomes\neffective.   Any such appointment may be limited in any manner\ndeemed advisable by the person making the appointment, including,\nfor example, restricting the power over distributions as necessary\nto avoid the imposition of any tax upon the trust, the appointee or\nthe appointee's estate.\nD-2. Resignation of Trustee. A trustee may resign from a trust\nwithout the necessity of any court proceeding upon meeting these\nconditions:\n     (a) Notice. At least 30 days' written notice       (if not waived)\nshall be given to each beneficiary who might then       be entitled to\nreceive a distribution from the trust estate. If a      beneficiary is\nunder a legal disability, notice shall be given to       (or waived by)\nthe beneficiary's natural or legal guardian.\n     (b)   Accounting.   If and to the extent required by the\nsuccessor trustee, an accounting for the administration of the\ntrust shall be given to the successor trustee.      The successor\ntrustee shall be fully protected in relying upon such accounting.\nD-3.   Rights and Liabilities.\n\n       (a) Bond Not Required. No bond or other security shall be\n       required of any trustee.\n\n       (b)   Liabilities.

Any subsequent legislation or regulation expanding or\nlimiting the rights, privileges and powers granted a trustee shall\napply to all trusts hereunder unless the trustee elects not to have\nsuch legislation or regulation apply to a particular trust by a\nwritten instrument filed with the trust records.       However, the\nprovisions made for the various beneficiaries under this trust\nagreement are exclusive. Any statute that purports to enlarge the\nclass of beneficiaries to whom distributions may be made or the\npurposes for which distributions may be made shall not apply to any\ntrust.

Whenever a distribution is to be made to the descendants\nof any person, the property to be distributed shall be divided into\nas many equal shares as there are living children of the person and\ndeceased children of the person who left descendants who are then\nliving.  Each living child shall take one share and the share of\neach deceased child shall be divided among his then living\ndescendants in the same manner.   \"Trusters' descendants\" includes\nonly those persons descended from both trusters.\nF-3.   Heirs.   Any distribution to be made to the \"heirs\" of a\nperson shall be made to the individuals who would have inherited\nthe person's personal property if the person had died intestate at\nthe time the distribution is to be made, domiciled in Texas and not\nmarried, under the laws of Texas in force on the effective date of\nthis trust agreement, with the shares of taking determined by those\nlaws.

Powers of Appointment Exercisable by Beneficiaries.       In\nexercising a power of appointment given to a beneficiary by this\ntrust agreement, the beneficiary may appoint the property subject\nto the power outright to the appointee, in trust, or to a custodian\nfor the appointee under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act of any\nstate.

He may\nimpose lawful conditions on an appointment and,, in general, may\nappoint to or among the appointees in any lawful manner.\nIn determining whether, in what manner and to what extent a\ntestamentary power of appointment has been exercised by a\nbeneficiary, the trustee may act in reliance upon a court order\nadmitting an instrument to probate as the beneficiary's last will\nor an order finding that the beneficiary died intestate.     Unless\nwithin six months after the beneficiary's death the trustee has\nactual notice of the existence of proceedings to probate a will of\nthe beneficiary, the trustee shall assume that the beneficiary died\n                                -8-\n\fintestate. The foregoing provisions are intended to expedite the\nprompt and efficient administration of the trust and to protect the\ntrustee from any action taken or distribution made in accordance\nwith these provisions.   Nothing in this paragraph shall limit or\nqualify any power of appointment given by this trust agreement or\nany right which an appointee or taker in default of appointment may\nhave against any person receiving a distribution from the trustee\nirrespective of the place of probate or of the time of discovery of\na will exercising the power or any other action taken in the\nbeneficiary's estate.\n\n     G.

Warren f/k/a Katherine Weiner (\"Ms. Warren\"), and, in support thereof,\n\nrespectfully shows the following:\n\n                                                I.\n                                            Overview\n\n1.       Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are co-trustees of the David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust\n\n(\"David's Trust\"). Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are likewise co-trustees of the Daniel Stephen\n\nWeiner 1996 Trust (\"Daniel's Trust\").       As such, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are jointly\n\nresponsible for the administration and liabilities of David's Trust and Daniel's Trust\n\n(collectively, the \"Trusts\"), if any.\n\n2.       Accordingly, Mr. Weiner files the following cross-claims against Ms. Warren:\n\n         a. Contribution;\n         b. Breaches of Fiduciary Duty;\n         c. Removal of Trustee; and\n         d. Tortious Interference with Administration.\n\n                                                 II.\n                                        Factual Background\n\n3.       On December 13, 1994, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren established David's Trust for the\n\nbenefit of their then-minor son, David. See David Abraham Weiner 1994 Trust agreement,\n\n                                                                                                     EXHIBIT\n                                                                                                                 exhibitsticker.com\n092865/000002\n376 -1273851vl                                                                                         TAB M\n\fattached hereto as Exhibit A and incorporated by this reference. The irrevocable trust agreement\n\nprovides that David is the primary beneficiary and Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are the co-\n\ntrustees.\n\n4.       On March 11, 1996, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren established Daniel's Trust for the\n\nbenefit of their then-minor son, Daniel S. Weiner (\"Daniel\"). See Daniel Steven Weiner 1996\n\nTrust, attached hereto as Exhibit B and incorporated by this reference. The irrevocable trust\n\nagreement provides that Daniel is the primary beneficiary and Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are\n\nthe original co-trustees. Exhibit B.\n\n5.       Both David's Trust agreement and Daniel's Trust agreement specifically provide that:\n\n         a.      Ms. Warren and Mr. Weiner are to act jointly as co-trustees;\n         b.      A trustee shall not be held liable for any act or omission, except in the case of\n                 gross negligence, bad faith or fraud; and\n         c.      The overall performance of the Trust shall be taken into account when assessing\n                 the propriety of any investment of the Trust.\n\nSee Exhibits A and B.\n\n6.       Additionally, the agreements of the Trusts grant Ms. Warren and Mr. Weiner, as co-\n                                                                                          1\ntrustees of the Trusts, the general powers to: (i) invest and reinvest the Trust assets    ;   (ii) lease,\n\nsell, transfer or encumber, in any manner, all or any part of the Trust 2 ; and (iii) loan or borrow\n\nmoney from the Trust, in any manner. 3\n\n7.       Ms. Warren and David's original lawsuit, filed solely against Mr. Weiner, sought an\n\norder from this Court to either distribute David's Trust funds to David free of trust or,\n\nalternatively, to award Ms. Warren sole and exclusive control over a new account (a Uniform\n\nTransfers to Minors Act account created for David's benefit), even though the Trust agreement\n\n\n1\n  Exhibit A§ E-l(a); Exhibit B § E-l(a).\n2\n  Exhibit A§ E-l(c); Exhibit B § E·l(a).\n3\n  Exhibit A§ E-l(c); Exhibit B § E-l(a).\n\n\n                                                  2\n092865/000002\n376- 127385lvl\n\fand the Divorce Decree provide otherwise. In the original Petition, Ms. Warren and David stated\n\nthat Ms. Warren would submit an accounting and sought her discharge from any liabilities\n\nrelating to the Trust.\n\n8.       Since originally filed, counsel for Ms. Warren and David has filed an amended petition\n\nthat now names only David as the Petitioner, ·and Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren as Respondents.\n\nIn the amended petition, David instead sought to be his own trustee.\n\n9.       David testified in his partial deposition that he is not aware of any breaches of trust by\n\neither Mr. Weiner or Ms. Warren. Irrespective of this testimony under oath, David filed yet\n\nanother amended petition asserting various claims solely against Mr. Weiner, even though both\n\nMr. Weiner and Ms. Warren have served as co-trustees since the inception of David's Trust.\n\n10.      Since the filing of David's second amended petition, Daniel, David's younger brother,\n                                                                  4\nfiled an original petition in intervention in this proceeding.\n\nII.      As co-trustees of the Trust, Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren are jointly responsible for the\n\nadministration of the Trust. Accordingly, in the event damages are assessed against Mr. Weiner\n\ndue to his role as co-trustee of David's Trust and/or Daniel's Trust, Ms. Warren is responsible\n\nfor 50% of those damages, in addition to 50% of Mr. Weiner's attorneys' fees and costs incurred\n\nin defending this action.\n\n                                                     III.\n                              Cross-Claims Against Katherine Warren\n\n12.      Mr. Weiner incorporates by reference the factual allegations contained within the\n\npreceding Paragraphs 1 through 11.\n\n\n\n\n4\n Mr. Weiner does not concede that Daniel has standing to bring any claims against Mr. Weiner in this proceeding\nnor does Mr. Weiner agree with Daniel's alleged legal basis to intervene in the above-referenced proceeding.\n\n\n                                                      3\n092865/000002\n376- 127385lvl\n\f        A.       Cross-Claim for Contribution.\n\n13.     In David's Second Amended Petition, he seeks to hold Mr. Weiner liable for breaches of\n\nfiduciary duty in his capacity as David's Trust. See Second Amended Petition at         ~14,    on file\n\nwith this Court.\n\n14.     Likewise, in Daniel's Petition in Intervention, Daniel seeks to hold Mr. Weiner liable for\n\nbreaches of fiduciary duty in his capacity as co-trustee of Daniel's Trust.         See Petition in\n\nIntervention at ~34, on file with this Court.\n\n15.     It is undisputed that Mr. Weiner and Ms. Warren were named as initial co-trustees of\n\nboth David's Trust and Daniel's Trust. Pursuant to Texas Property (Trust) Code, co-trustees are\n\nto act jointly in administering the Trust. TEX. PROP. CODE § 113.085. Ms. Warren has failed to\n\njointly administer the Trusts with Mr. Weiner.\n\n16.      Further, Ms. Warren has failed to delegate her powers or duties as co-trustee of the Trusts\n\nto Mr. Weiner. Pursuant to Texas Property (Trust) Code Section 113.085(c):\n\n                 (c)      A co-trustee shall participate in the performance of a trustee's\n                 function unless the co-trustee:\n                          ( 1) is unavailable to perform the function because of absence,\n                 illness, disqualification under other law, or other temporary incapacity; or\n                          (2) has delegated the performance of the function to another\n                 trustee in accordance with the terms of the trust or applicable law, has\n                 communicated the delegation to all other co-trustees, and has filed the\n                 delegation in the records of the trust.\n\nTEX. PROP. CODE§ 113.085 (c) (emphasis added).\n\n17.      And, the Trusts expressly provide that a co-trustee may only release or delegate her\n\npowers as follows:\n\n                 E-4. Release and Delegations of Powers. Any power granted to a trustee\n                 may be released, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently. Except\n                 as provided in Paragraph E-3, any such power may be delegated, in whole\n                 or in part, temporarily or permanently, to any other trustee then acting. A\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n092865/000002\n376- 127385Jvl\n\f1:0                    release or delegation shall be by written instrument filed with the records\n                       of each trust to which the release or delegation applies.\n\n      See Exhibit A § E-4 (emphasis added); Exhibit B § E-4 (emphasis added).\n\n      18.       Ms. Warren never communicated any intent to delegate her co-trustee duties to Mr.\n\n      Weiner nor has she filed a written instrument delegating or releasing any powers to Mr. Weiner,\n\n      as required by the terms of the Trusts. In short, there is no evidence that Ms. Warren has\n\n      delegated the performance of her co-trustee functions to Mr. Weiner.          TEX. PROP. CODE §\n\n      113.085(c)(2).\n\n      19.       Mr. Weiner seeks to hold Ms. Warren responsible for 50% of any liabilities assessed\n\n      against the Trusts and/or him relating to the actions sought by any beneficiary, including, but not\n\n      limited to, holding Ms. Warren liable for 50% of the attorneys' fees, accountant fees, and costs\n\n      incurred by Mr. Weiner as a result ofthe above-referenced litigation.\n\n      20.       Thus, pursuant to Section 33.016 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code, Mr.\n\n      Weiner asserts a contribution claim against Ms. Warren for any liability that may be imposed on\n\n      him pursuant to the breach of fiduciary duty claims brought by David and/or Daniel in the instant\n\n      litigation.\n\n                B.     Cross-Claim for Breaches of Fiduciary Duty.\n\n      21.       Ms. Warren, as co-trustee, serves in various fiduciary capacities for David and Daniel.\n\n      Trustees are held to a \"very high and very strict standard of conduct which equity demands\".\n\n      Slay v. Burnett's Trust, 187 S.W.2d 377,387-88 (Tex. 1945).\n\n      22. _ As a fiduciary and co-trustee of the Trusts, Ms. Warren has breached the following\n\n      duties:\n\n                a. Duty of loyalty;\n                b. Duty of competence;\n                c. Duty of competence by failing to administer the Trusts pursuant to their terms;\n\n\n                                                        5\n      092865/000002\n      376- 1273851v1\n\f         d. Duty of full disclosure;\n         e. Duty to act with integrity of the strictest kind;\n         f.      Duty to act with due diligence;\n         g. Duty to exercise reasonable discretion; and\n         h. Duty to act as a reasonably prudent person.\n\n23.      Ms. Warren breached her fiduciary duties, which resulted in injury.\n\n24.      Thus, in accordance with recognized principles of fiduciary law, Mr. Weiner seeks an\n\naward of actual damages and, since Ms. Warren's conduct was intentional, punitive damages.\n\n         c.         Cross-Claim for the Removal of Ms. Warren as Trustee.\n\n25.      Ms. Warren, through her hostile actions and position of influence, has turned both Daniel\n\nand David against their father, Mr. Weiner. Despite Mr. Weiner's valiant attempts, Ms. Warren\n\nhas failed and refused to engage with Mr. Weiner to administer the Trusts.\n\n26.      By these acts, Ms. Warren has created a hostile environment for David, Daniel and Mr.\n\nWeiner.\n\n27.      Accordingly, Mr. Weiner files this cross-claim for the removal of Ms. Warren as trustee\n\nof the Trusts.\n\n         D.         Cross-Claim for Tortious Interference with Administration.\n\n28.      Through her actions, Ms. Warren has tortiously interfered with Mr. Weiner's ability to\n\nproperly administer the Trusts. Ms. Warren has interfered with the administration of the Trusts\n\nby initiating unnecessary litigious proceedings against Mr. Weiner, by and through David and\n\nDaniel, and continuously failing to act in the best interests of David and Daniel, to the detriment\n\nofMr. Weiner.\n\n29.      Such acts have proximately caused and prevented and interfered with the ability of Mr.\n\nWeiner to properly administer Decedent's Estate.\n\n\n\n\n                                                   6\n092865/000002\n376- 1273851vl                  ..\n\f       30.      Ms. Warren's acts have resulted in the incurrence of unnecessary expenses, damages or\n\n       loss to the Trusts, for which recovery from her is proper in an amount within the jurisdictional\nc~.o\n       limits of the Court.\n\n       31.      Mr. Weiner seeks actual and punitive damages for Ms. Warren's tortious interference with\n\n       administration and for her intentional and malicious conduct.\n\n                                                   IV.\n                                     Damages and Other Relief Requested\n\n       32.      Mr. Weiner re-alleges and incorporates by reference the foregoing background\n\n       allegations and causes of action in support of the damages sought below.\n\n                A.      Actual Damages.\n\n       33.      Based on the acts and occurrences set forth in the preceding paragraphs, Ms. Warren\n\n       breached her fiduciary duties, proximately causing significant loss to the Trusts and actual\n\n       damages to the Trusts.\n\n       34.      As a result of Ms. Warren's breaches of fiduciary duties, tortious interference with\n\n       administration, and bad acts constituting her removal as trustee of the Trusts, which were the\n\n       proximate cause of damages to Mr. Weiner and the Trusts, Mr. Weiner is entitled to damages\n\n       from Ms. Warren.\n\n                B.      Punitive Damages.\n\n       35.      As a result of Ms. Warren's intentional and willful breaches of fiduciary duty and tortious\n\n       interference with administration, Mr. Weiner seeks punitive damages from Ms. Warren.\n\n                C.      Additional Relief Sought.\n\n       36.      Mr. Weiner is entitled to pre-judgment and post-judgment interest and costs of court in\n\n       all amounts awarded hereunder as allowed by law. He specifically sues for recovery of pre-\n\n       judgment and post-judgment interest and recovery of costs of court under the applicable\n\n\n\n                                                         7\n       092865/000002\n       376- 1273851v1\n\f           provisions ofthe laws ofthe State ofTexas.\n\n           37.      With regard to claims by David and/or related to David's Trust, Mr. Weiner, individually\n\n           and as co-trustee, respectfully requests the following relief:\n\n                    a.      To the extent of any claims of David, Ms. Warren shall be held responsible for all\n                            actions and alleged inactions of the trustees;\n\nI   '\\1'            b.      To the extent of any claims of David, Ms. Warren shall be held equally liable for\n                            all claimed damages and relief sought by David, as finally determined, if any;\n\n                    c.      Ms. Warren shall be held liable for any and all violations of David's Trust\n                            agreement, including any plan or scheme to collude with David;\n\n                    d.      Ms. Warren shall be held equally responsible for the preparation and submission\n                            of any accounting determined to be due and personally bear one-half of the costs\n                            of the accounting pursuant to § 113.151 of the Texas Trust Code; and\n\n                    e.      Ms. Warren shall be ordered to pay one-half of Mr. Weiner's attorneys' fees and\n                            costs incurred as a result of defending the lawsuit.\n\n           38.
