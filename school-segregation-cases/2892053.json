The questioning was part of a survey the\nPalmdale School District was conducting regarding psycho-\nlogical barriers to learning. The parents brought an action in\ndistrict court against the School District and two of its offi-\ncials for violating their right to privacy and their right “to con-\ntrol the upbringing of their children by introducing them to\nmatters of and relating to sex.” They brought both federal and\nstate claims. The district court dismissed the federal causes of\naction for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted and dismissed the state claims without prejudice to\ntheir right to re-file in state court. We agree, and hold that\nthere is no fundamental right of parents to be the exclusive\nprovider of information regarding sexual matters to their chil-\ndren, either independent of their right to direct the upbringing\nand education of their children or encompassed by it. We also\nhold that parents have no due process or privacy right to over-\nride the determinations of public schools as to the information\nto which their children will be exposed while enrolled as stu-\n\f15064              FIELDS v.

Finally, we hold that the defendants’ actions were ratio-\nnally related to a legitimate state purpose.\n\n                                     I.\n\n   Kristi Seymour volunteered as a “mental health counselor”\nat Mesquite Elementary School while she was enrolled in a\nmaster’s degree program at the California School of Profes-\nsional Psychology. The Palmdale School District, of which\nMesquite was a part, collaborated with the School of Profes-\nsional Psychology, the Children’s Bureau of Southern Califor-\nnia, and Seymour to develop and administer a psychological\nassessment questionnaire for first, third, and fifth grade stu-\ndents with the announced goal of “establish[ing] a community\nbaseline measure of children’s exposure to early trauma (for\nexample, violence).”\n\n   Prior to administering the survey, Seymour mailed a letter\nto the parents of the children to be surveyed informing them\nof the questionnaire’s nature and purpose, and requesting their\nconsent to its administration.1 The parental consent letter was\n  1\n   The letter states:\n“Parental Consent\nDear Parent or Caregiver:\n   The Palmdale School District is asking your support in participating in\na district-wide study of our first, third and fifth grade children.

Among the questions\nare the following: Have you ever “[B]een threatened or\nchased by a gang?”, “Seen someone get shot?”, “Been in a car\naccident?”, “Been touched by someone, on your body, that\nmade your feel uncomfortable?”, and “Know[n] anyone who\nhas or is being abused?” The final part is limited to demo-\ngraphic information such as the student’s grade, race, and\nfamilial living arrangement.\n\n   Plaintiffs James and Tammany Fields, Stuart and Kathleen\nHaberman, Robert and Kathie Hoaglin, and Vanessa Shetler\nare parents of minor children who were enrolled at Mesquite\nElementary School. All of them had children who participated\nin the survey. The parent-plaintiffs learned of the sexual\nnature of some of the questions on the survey when their chil-\ndren informed them of the questions after they had completed\nthe questionnaires. The parents allege that if they had known\nthe true nature of the survey, they would not have consented\nto their children’s involvement. Prior to filing in federal court,\nthe parents initially sought redress for their alleged injuries\nthrough an administrative tort claim filed with the Palmdale\nSchool Board. Therein, they alleged that their “basic constitu-\ntional right to control” their children’s upbringing had been\n“robbed” by the defendants’ actions. Their claim was denied\nand they subsequently filed a complaint in district court alleg-\ning four causes of action: (1) violation of their federal consti-\ntutional right to privacy; (2) violation of their California\nconstitutional right to privacy; (3) deprivation of civil rights\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and (4) negligence. The parents\nsought damages and injunctive relief.\n\n   Defendant Michael Geisser is the Palmdale School Dis-\ntrict’s Director of Psychological Services, and Arland Atwood\nis the principal of Mesquite Elementary School; both Atwood\nand Geisser are sued in their official capacities.5 The defen-\n   5\n     Although Seymour was named as a defendant in the complaint, she is\nnot a party to the case. In the notice of appeal, the parent-appellants admit\nthat she “was not served, has not appeared, and is not a party to this\nappeal.”\n\f15068           FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\ndants did not file an answer to the complaint. Instead, they\nmoved under Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 12(b)(6) to dismiss the entire\naction for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted. They asserted that there is no deeply rooted and fun-\ndamental right of parents “to control the upbringing of their\nchildren by introducing them to matters of and relating to sex\nin accordance with their personal and religious values and\nbeliefs.” They further contended that the § 1983 claim was\nnot viable because the parents’ civil rights had not been vio-\nlated and that even if they had, the School District is immune\nfrom suit and the individual defendants are entitled to quali-\nfied immunity. Finally, they argued that they are not liable\nunder California law because their actions were discretionary\nand state law immunity applies.\n\n   The parents countered that the administration of the survey\nviolated their constitutional privacy right as well as their right\nto control their children’s exposure to sexual subjects, that the\ndefendants arrogated unto themselves the parents’ right to\ndetermine how their children learn about sexual matters, and\nthat the defendants are not immune from suit.\n\n   After holding a hearing on the motion, the district court dis-\nmissed the federal claims for “lack of a cognizable legal theo-\nry.” In doing so, it first recharacterized the parents’ privacy\nclaim as a substantive due process claim because “all of the\nParents’ arguments concerning the claim are grounded in the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Substantive Due Process Clause.\nOther than citing generally to privacy cases outside the Four-\nteenth Amendment’s scope, the Parents do not connect their\nasserted interest . . . to the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth,\nor Tenth Amendments.” The court ruled next that the right “to\ncontrol the upbringing of their children by introducing them\nto matters of and relating to sex in accordance with their per-\nsonal and religious values and beliefs” does not rise to the\nlevel of a fundamental right protected by Substantive Due\nProcess. It further concluded that the fundamental right to\ndirect the upbringing and education of one’s children does not\n\f                   FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.                   15069\nencompass the right “to control the upbringing of their chil-\ndren by introducing them to matters of and relating to sex in\naccordance with their personal and religious values and\nbeliefs.” Finally, the court declined to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the state law causes of action and dismissed\nthem without prejudice. The parents now appeal.\n\n                                    II.\n\n  On appeal, the parents challenge the district court’s dis-\nmissal of their federal claims for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief may be granted.6 The district court’s dismissal\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim is\nreviewed de novo. See Zimmerman v. City of Oakland, 255\nF.3d 734, 737 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\n   The parents argue that the defendants’ actions deprived\nthem of their free-standing fundamental right “to control the\nupbringing of their children by introducing them to matters of\nand relating to sex in accordance with their personal and reli-\ngious values and beliefs.” They also contend that the right to\n“determine when and how their children are exposed to sexu-\nally explicit subject matter” is encompassed within their fun-\ndamental due process right to control their children’s\nupbringing and their constitutional right to privacy to make\nintimate familial decisions. They argue that under both doc-\ntrines they have a fundamental right “to control the upbring-\ning of their children by introducing them to matters of and\nrelating to sex in accordance with their personal and religious\nvalues and beliefs” and that the defendants’ actions infringing\n  6\n    Subsequent to the district court’s dismissal of the federal causes of\naction, the court also dismissed without prejudice the state law causes of\naction on jurisdictional grounds. The parent-appellants’ opening brief does\nnot renew their opposition to the district court’s dismissal of the state law\ncauses of action. Those issues are therefore waived. See Alaska Ctr. for\nthe Env’t v. U.S. Forest Serv., 189 F.3d 851, 858 n.4 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(“Arguments not raised in [an] opening brief are waived.”). Of course, the\nparents may pursue the state law causes of action in state court.\n\f15070           FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\nthat right are therefore subject to strict scrutiny. Finally, they\nmaintain that even if the court concludes that the deprivation\nof their liberty interest in “control[ling] the upbringing of\ntheir children by introducing them to matters of and relating\nto sex” is not subject to strict scrutiny, the School District’s\nadministration of the psychological survey was not rationally\nrelated to a legitimate state end.\n\n  A.    Meyer-Pierce\n\n   We note at the outset that it is not our role to rule on the\nwisdom of the School District’s actions. That is a matter that\nmust be decided in other fora. The question before us is sim-\nply whether the parents have a constitutional right to exclu-\nsive control over the introduction and flow of sexual\ninformation to their children. It is clear, and the parents agree,\nthat no court has ever held that parents have a specific funda-\nmental right “to control the upbringing of their children by\nintroducing them to matters of and relating to sex in accor-\ndance with their personal and religious values and beliefs.” In\nfact, no such specific right can be found in the deep roots of\nthe nation’s history and tradition or implied in the concept of\nordered liberty. See Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702,\n720-21 (1997). Thus, whether the parents have a constitu-\ntional right to exclusive control over the introduction and flow\nof sexual information to their children depends entirely upon\nwhether the asserted right is encompassed within some\nbroader constitutional right.\n\n   [1] The parents next argue that the right they seek to invoke\nis encompassed within the fundamental due process right to\n“control the education and upbringing of one’s children.” The\nSupreme Court has held that the right of parents to make deci-\nsions concerning the care, custody, and control of their chil-\ndren is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due\nProcess Clause. See Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66\n(2000) (plurality opinion) (“[I]t cannot now be doubted that\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment pro-\n\f                FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.            15071\ntects the fundamental right of parents to make decisions con-\ncerning the care, custody, and control of their children.”).\nThis right is commonly referred to as the Meyer-Pierce right\nbecause it finds its origin in two Supreme Court cases, Meyer\nv. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390 (1923), and Pierce v. Society of\nSisters, 268 U.S. 510 (1925).\n\n   [2] As with all constitutional rights, the right of parents to\nmake decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of\ntheir children is not without limitations. In Prince v. Massa-\nchusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), the Court recognized that par-\nents’ liberty interest in the custody, care, and nurture of their\nchildren resides “first” in the parents, but does not reside there\nexclusively, nor is it “beyond regulation [by the state] in the\npublic interest.” Id. at 166. For example, the state “as parens\npatriae” may restrict parents’ interest in the custody, care, and\nnurture of their children “by requiring school attendance, reg-\nulating or prohibiting the child’s labor and in many other\nways.” Id. (footnotes omitted). See also Runyon v. McCrary,\n427 U.S. 160, 177 (1976) (holding that there is no parental\nright to educate children in private segregated schools); Nor-\nwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 461-62 (1973) (discussing\nthe limited scope of Pierce); Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S.\n205, 239 (1972) (White, J., concurring) (stating that the\nPierce right “lends no support to the contention that parents\nmay replace state educational requirements with their own\nidiosyncratic views of what knowledge a child needs to be a\nproductive and happy member of society”); Pierce, 268 U.S.\nat 534 (“No question is raised concerning the power of the\nstate reasonably to regulate all schools, to inspect, supervise\nand examine them, their teachers and pupils; to require that all\nchildren of proper age attend some school, that teachers shall\nbe of good moral character and patriotic disposition, that cer-\ntain studies plainly essential to good citizenship must be\ntaught, and that nothing be taught which is manifestly inimi-\ncal to the public welfare.”); Hooks v. Clark County Sch. Dist.,\n228 F.3d 1036, 1042 (9th Cir. 2000) (subjecting the Meyer-\n\f15072           FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\nPierce right to reasonable regulation by the state), cert.\ndenied, 532 U.S. 971 (2001).\n\n   Likewise, lower courts have recognized the constitutional-\nity of a wide variety of state actions that intrude upon the lib-\nerty interest of parents in controlling the upbringing and\neducation of their children. See Littlefield v. Forney Indep.\nSch. Dist., 268 F.3d 275 (5th Cir. 2001) (upholding school\ndistrict’s mandatory school uniform policy); Hooks, 228 F.3d\nat 1036 (upholding state statute denying speech therapy ser-\nvices to home-schooled children); Hutchins v. District of\nColumbia, 188 F.3d 531 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (plurality opinion)\n(upholding a municipality’s curfew ordinance that was only\napplicable to minors); Swanson v. Guthrie Indep. Sch. Dist.\nNo. 1-L, 135 F.3d 694 (10th Cir. 1998) (upholding school dis-\ntrict’s full-time attendance policy); Herndon v. Chapel Hill-\nCarrboro City Bd. of Educ., 89 F.3d 174 (4th Cir. 1996)\n(upholding school district’s mandatory community service\nprogram).\n\n   Finally, there are a number of cases that have upheld the\nconstitutionality of school programs that educate children in\nsexuality and health. See, e.g., Leebaert v. Harrington, 332\nF.3d 134 (2d Cir. 2003) (upholding school district’s manda-\ntory health classes against a father’s claim of a violation of his\nfundamental rights); Parents United for Better Sch., Inc. v.\nSchool Dist. of Philadelphia Bd. of Educ., 148 F.3d 260 (3d\nCir. 1998) (upholding school district’s consensual condom\ndistribution program); Brown v. Hot, Sexy & Safer Prods.,\nInc., 68 F.3d 525 (1st Cir. 1995) (upholding compulsory high\nschool sex education assembly program); Citizens for Paren-\ntal Rights v. San Mateo County Bd. of Educ., 51 Cal. App. 3d\n1 (1975) (upholding school district’s non-compulsory health\nand sex education program against parental challenge).\n\n  [3] Of particular import to this case is Brown, in which a\ncompulsory high school assembly presentation aimed at edu-\ncating students on AIDS and other health concerns included\n\f               FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.            15073\nexplicit references to sexuality. See 68 F.3d at 529. The\nBrown plaintiffs alleged that the compelled attendance of\nschoolchildren at the assembly deprived the minors and their\nparents of their privacy rights, substantive due process rights,\nand their right to an educational environment free from sexual\nharassment. Rejecting those claims, the First Circuit\nexplained that,\n\n    [t]he Meyer and Pierce cases, we think, evince the\n    principle that the state cannot prevent parents from\n    choosing a specific educational program — whether\n    it be religious instruction at a private school or\n    instruction in a foreign language. That is, the state\n    does not have the power to “standardize its children”\n    or “foster a homogenous people” by completely\n    foreclosing the opportunity of individuals and groups\n    to choose a different path of education. We do not\n    think, however, that this freedom encompasses a\n    fundamental constitutional right to dictate the curric-\n    ulum at the public school to which they have chosen\n    to send their children. We think it is fundamentally\n    different for the state to say to a parent, “You can’t\n    teach your child German or send him to a parochial\n    school,” than for the parent to say to the state, “You\n    can’t teach my child subjects that are morally offen-\n    sive to me.” The first instance involves the state pro-\n    scribing parents from educating their children, while\n    the second involves parents prescribing what the\n    state shall teach their children. If all parents had a\n    fundamental constitutional right to dictate individu-\n    ally what the schools teach their children, the\n    schools would be forced to cater a curriculum for\n    each student whose parents had genuine moral dis-\n    agreements with the school’s choice of subject mat-\n    ter. We cannot see that the Constitution imposes\n    such a burden on state educational systems, and\n    accordingly find that the rights of parents as\n    described by Meyer and Pierce do not encompass a\n\f15074          FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\n    broad-based right to restrict the flow of information\n    in the public schools.\n\nId. at 533-34 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). We agree\nwith and adopt the First Circuit’s analysis. Meyer, Pierce, and\ntheir progeny “evince the principle that the state cannot pre-\nvent parents from choosing a specific educational program,”\nbut they do not afford parents a right to compel public schools\nto follow their own idiosyncratic views as to what information\nthe schools may dispense. Parents have a right to inform their\nchildren when and as they wish on the subject of sex; they\nhave no constitutional right, however, to prevent a public\nschool from providing its students with whatever information\nit wishes to provide, sexual or otherwise, when and as the\nschool determines that it is appropriate to do so.\n\n   Neither Meyer nor Pierce provides support for the view\nthat parents have a right to prevent a school from providing\nany kind of information — sexual or otherwise — to its stu-\ndents. As the Brown court said, “Meyer and Pierce do not\nencompass [the] broad-based right [the parent-plaintiffs seek]\nto restrict the flow of information in the public schools.” Id.\nat 534. Although the parents are legitimately concerned with\nthe subject of sexuality, there is no constitutional reason to\ndistinguish that concern from any of the countless moral, reli-\ngious, or philosophical objections that parents might have to\nother decisions of the School District — whether those objec-\ntions regard information concerning guns, violence, the mili-\ntary, gay marriage, racial equality, slavery, the dissection of\nanimals, or the teaching of scientifically-validated theories of\nthe origins of life. Schools cannot be expected to accommo-\ndate the personal, moral or religious concerns of every parent.\nSuch an obligation would not only contravene the educational\nmission of the public schools, but also would be impossible\nto satisfy.\n\n  As the First Circuit made clear in Brown, once parents\nmake the choice as to which school their children will attend,\n\f                 FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.               15075\ntheir fundamental right to control the education of their chil-\ndren is, at the least, substantially diminished. The constitution\ndoes not vest parents with the authority to interfere with a\npublic school’s decision as to how it will provide information\nto its students or what information it will provide, in its class-\nrooms or otherwise. See Yoder, 406 U.S. at 205. Perhaps the\nSixth Circuit said it best when it explained, “While parents\nmay have a fundamental right to decide whether to send their\nchild to a public school, they do not have a fundamental right\ngenerally to direct how a public school teaches their child.\nWhether it is the school curriculum, the hours of the school\nday, school discipline, the timing and content of examina-\ntions, the individuals hired to teach at the school, the extracur-\nricular activities offered at the school or, as here, a dress code,\nthese issues of public education are generally ‘committed to\nthe control of state and local authorities.’ ” (citations omitted)\n(emphasis in original). Blau v. Fort Thomas Pub. Sch. Dist.,\n401 F.3d 381, 395-96 (6th Cir. 2005). We endorse and adopt\nthe Sixth Circuit’s view.7\n\n   The parents argue that the reasoning in Brown should not\nbe followed in this case because the AIDS assembly being\nchallenged in that case was part of the general curriculum,\nand there is a “curriculum exception” to the Meyer-Pierce\nright which supported that court’s disposition of that case.\nThe parents cite no case recognizing such a curriculum excep-\ntion. They simply urge that we create one, and then hold that\nin all other respects Meyer-Pierce controls all matters relating\nto education and the educational system. That is not how the\ncourts have analyzed the issue, see, e.g., Blau, and we see no\nreason to follow a different course.\n\n   [4] Brown and Blau compel the conclusion that what\nMeyer-Pierce establishes is the right of parents to be free\nfrom state interference with their choice of the educational\n  7\n   We offer no comment as to any First Amendment issues that may arise\nwith respect to any of these matters.\n\f15076             FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\nforum itself, a choice that ordinarily determines the type of\neducation one’s child will receive. The School District’s\ndesign and administration of the survey in no way interfered\nwith that right. Indeed, it was only because the parents had\nselected the school they did that their children were asked the\nquestions to which the parents objected. The state action at\nissue simply does not fall within the Meyer-Pierce proscrip-\ntion.\n\n   In sum, we affirm that the Meyer-Pierce right does not\nextend beyond the threshold of the school door. The parents’\nasserted right “to control the upbringing of their children by\nintroducing them to matters of and relating to sex in accor-\ndance with their personal and religious values and beliefs,” by\nwhich they mean the right to limit what public schools or\nother state actors may tell their children regarding sexual mat-\nters, is not encompassed within the Meyer-Pierce right to con-\ntrol their children’s upbringing and education. Accordingly,\nMeyer-Pierce provides no basis for finding a substantive due\nprocess right that could have been violated by the defendants’\nauthorization and administration of the survey.\n\n  B.    Privacy\n\n   The parents argue alternatively that the right “to control the\nupbringing of their children by introducing them to matters of\nand relating to sex in accordance with their personal and reli-\ngious values and beliefs” is encompassed within their consti-\ntutional “right to privacy with respect to intimate decisions.”\nThe defendants argue that no such right to privacy exists inde-\npendent of the substantive due process rights already ana-\nlyzed, and that, in any event, any such right to privacy is not\nimplicated by the state’s actions here.\n\n   [5] The nature of the relationship between the privacy right\nprotecting intimate decision-making and the Meyer-Pierce\nright is far from clear. The parents suggest that “the two sepa-\nrate rights are inextricably intertwined in modern constitu-\n\f                  FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.                 15077\ntional jurisprudence.” Some courts, including the district\ncourt, have construed the two rights as one and the same when\ndiscussing a parent’s privacy interest in controlling the\nupbringing and education of children. See, e.g., Brown, 68\nF.3d at 532-34. Both theories find their roots in substantive\ndue process. To the extent that the two are “inextricably inter-\ntwined,” the failure of the parents to state a claim under\nMeyer-Pierce disposes of their privacy argument. For pur-\nposes of this opinion, however, we will also analyze the pri-\nvacy right separately.\n\n   Although the right to privacy provides a different source\nfor the right the parents seek to assert than does Meyer-\nPierce, like Meyer-Pierce it does not encompass that right.\nThe Supreme Court has identified at least two constitutionally\nprotected privacy interests: the right to control the disclosure\nof sensitive information and the right to “independence when\nmaking certain kinds of important decisions.” Whalen v. Roe,\n429 U.S. 589, 599-600 (1977). The parents do not allege that\ntheir children were forced to disclose private information.\nTheir argument here is only that the survey violated their own\nright to make important decisions regarding the manner and\ntiming of exposing their children to sexual matters.8\n\n   [6] In its earliest formulation, the right to privacy was used\nessentially to protect the family structure. See Pierce, 268\nU.S. at 510 (affirming family’s right to be free from all but\nthe most necessary state interference); Meyer, 262 U.S. at 390\n(same). Courts have since found, however, that the right to\nprivacy also protects important parental decisions such as\nwhether to bear children, who has control over children, and\nother decisions related to procreative autonomy. See Carey v.\nPopulation Servs. Int’l, 431 U.S. 678, 684-86 (1977) (holding\n  8\n   No claim is asserted that either the childrens’ or the parent’s rights\nwere violated because the children were compelled to disclose personal or\nsensitive information. Thus, we do not consider any question of compul-\nsory disclosure of such information here.\n\f15078           FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\nstate’s restrictions on sale of contraceptives an unconstitu-\ntional intrusion on the right to decide privately whether to\nhave children); Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973) (holding\nthat the right to abortion falls within the right to privacy);\nStanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972) (affirming the\nequal rights of unmarried fathers to the custody of their chil-\ndren); Eisenstadt v. Baird, 405 U.S. 438, 453-54 (1972) (dis-\ncussing privacy right to beget children). It also encompasses\na right of sexual intimacy. See Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S.\n558 (2003). We cannot overstate the significance of these\nrights. They symbolize the importance of our evolving under-\nstanding of the nature of our Constitution. See Stephen G.\nBreyer, Active Liberty: Interpreting Our Democratic Consti-\ntution (2005). Here, however, the survey simply did not inter-\nfere with the right of the parents to make intimate decisions.\nMaking intimate decisions and controlling the state’s determi-\nnation of information regarding intimate matters are two\nentirely different subjects. No constitutional provision prohib-\nits the dissemination of information to children, or to adults\n(unless it is the Treason Clause). Thus, the right of the parents\n“to control the upbringing of their children by introducing\nthem to matters of and relating to sex in accordance with their\npersonal and religious values and beliefs” is not protected by\nthe constitutional right to privacy, at least not as that pur-\nported right is understood by the parents in this case.\n\n  C.    Rational Basis Review\n\n   [7] Governmental actions that infringe upon a fundamental\nright receive strict scrutiny. See Mullins v. Oregon, 57 F.3d\n789, 793 (9th Cir. 1995). However, government actions that\ndo not affect fundamental rights or liberty interests and do not\ninvolve suspect classifications will be upheld if it they are\nrationally related to a legitimate state interest. See Vacco v.\nQuill, 521 U.S. 793 (1997); Doe v. Tandeske, 361 F.3d 594,\n597 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 125 S. Ct. 56 (2004). Because we\nhold that the School District’s administration of the survey\ndid not violate a fundamental right, strict scrutiny does not\n\f               FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.            15079\napply. We therefore review the parents’ federal claims by\napplying the rational basis test. Id. We start from the premise\nthat courts must be wary of “[j]udicial interposition in the\noperation of the public school system of the Nation.” Goss v.\nLopez, 419 U.S. 565, 578 (1975) (quoting Epperson v. Arkan-\nsas, 393 U.S. 97, 104 (1968)); see also Vernonia Sch. Dist.\n47J v. Acton, 515 U.S. 646, 656-57 (1995); Yoder, 406 U.S.\nat 235; Blau, 401 F.3d at 393.\n\n   The parents offer two arguments with respect to our ratio-\nnal basis review. First, the complaint alleges on information\nand belief that there was no legitimate governmental purpose\nto the survey and that it was undertaken in order to benefit\nSeymour’s academic career. The allegation is entirely specu-\nlative and conclusory in nature. No facts are offered in sup-\nport of the parents’ theory. Although in other circumstances\nwe might dismiss such an allegation with leave to amend, it\nis apparent here that such a dismissal could not in the end aid\nthe parents in stating a claim. Attached to the complaint is\ndetailed information setting forth the legitimate governmental\npurpose of the survey and explaining with specificity how the\ninformation obtained will be used for educational purposes\nand how it will ultimately benefit the School District and its\nchildren. Given the inclusion in the complaint of this specific\ninformation establishing the legitimacy of the School Dis-\ntrict’s action, we must, even for purposes of a motion to dis-\nmiss, approach the application of the rational basis test from\nthe premise that the School District had a legitimate educa-\ntional purpose in undertaking the survey.\n\n   The parents also argue that the survey cannot pass review\nbecause it was not a part of the school’s curriculum, and\ninformation regarding sexual matters may be conveyed only\nas part of a student’s academic studies. The curriculum argu-\nment also fails. First, neither education itself nor the legiti-\nmate functions of a public school are limited to the\ncurriculum. See Blau discussed supra at pp. 15075-76 and\nadopted herein. Such a view construes too narrowly the aims\n\f15080           FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\nof education and fails to recognize the unique role that it plays\nin American society. See Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 221\n(1982) (stating that public education is not “merely some gov-\nernmental ‘benefit’ indistinguishable from other forms of\nsocial welfare legislation”); Sch. Dist. of Abington v.\nSchempp, 374 U.S. 203, 230 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring)\n(calling public education “a most vital civic institution for the\npreservation of a democratic system of government”). One\nneed review only the Supreme Court’s unanimous decision in\nBrown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954), for a\nreminder of the state’s compelling interest in the broad ends\nof education, the scope of which extend far beyond “curricu-\nlum”:\n\n    Today, education is perhaps the most important\n    function of state and local governments. Compulsory\n    school attendance laws and the great expenditures\n    for education both demonstrate our recognition of\n    the importance of education to our democratic soci-\n    ety. It is required in the performance of our most\n    basic public responsibilities, even service in the\n    armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citi-\n    zenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awak-\n    ening the child to cultural values, in preparing him\n    for later professional training, and in helping him to\n    adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it\n    is doubtful that any child may reasonably be\n    expected to succeed in life if he is denied the oppor-\n    tunity of an education.\n\nId. at 493. In fine, education is not merely about teaching the\nbasics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Education serves\nhigher civic and social functions, including the rearing of chil-\ndren into healthy, productive, and responsible adults and the\ncultivation of talented and qualified leaders of diverse back-\ngrounds. See Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003). The\ndefendants prepared the psychological survey as an “assess-\nment [ ] to establish a community baseline measure of chil-\n\f                FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.             15081\ndren’s exposure to early trauma.” Protecting the mental health\nof children falls well within the state’s broad interest in edu-\ncation.\n\n   Second, the psychological survey’s ultimate objective was,\naccording to an exhibit to the complaint, to improve students’\nability to learn. The exhibit reveals that the survey was\nintended to gauge exposure to early trauma and to assist in\ndesigning an intervention program to help the School District\nreduce barriers to students’ ability to learn. Although the stu-\ndents who were questioned may or may not have “learned”\nanything from the survey itself and may or may not have been\n“taught” anything by the questions they were asked, the facili-\ntation of their ability to absorb the education the school pro-\nvides is without question a legitimate educational objective. It\nis indeed more directly within the school’s basic educational\nmission, than, for example, requiring students to wear uni-\nforms or to participate in community service, both of which\nsome courts have held constitutional. See Littlefield, 268 F.3d\nat 291 (“While [p]arents may have a fundamental right in the\nupbringing and education of their children, this right does not\ncover the [p]arents’ objection to a public school Uniform Pol-\nicy.”); Herndon, 89 F.3d at 176 (requiring high school stu-\ndents to perform community service in order to graduate does\nnot violate parents’ right to control the education of their chil-\ndren). See also Swanson, 135 F.3d at 699 (“Federal courts\naddressing the issue have held that parents have no right to\nexempt their children from certain reading programs the par-\nents found objectionable, or from a school’s community-\nservice requirement, or from an assembly program that\nincluded sexually explicit topics.”) (citations omitted).\n\n   Finally, apart from any discussion of whether the survey\nwas intended to aid the educational process, the questioning\ncan also be justified on the basis of an alternative state interest\n— namely, parens patriae. See Prince, 321 U.S. at 166-67.\nThe defendants argue that the survey was intended to gauge\nthe mental health of the School District’s students by “iden-\n\f15082           FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\ntify[ing] internal behaviors such as anxiety and depression\nand external behaviors such as aggression and verbal abuse.”\nIn this respect, the School District’s interest in the mental\nhealth of its students falls well within the state’s authority as\nparens patriae. As such, the School District may legitimately\nplay a role in the care and nurture of children entrusted to\nthem for schooling. See id. at 166 (ruling that the state “as\nparens patriae” may supplement or even in some circum-\nstances supplant parents’ interest in the custody, care, and\nnurture of their children “by requiring school attendance, reg-\nulating or prohibiting the child’s labor and in many other\nways”) (citations omitted). See also Parham v. J.R., 442 U.S.\n584 (1979) (holding that a state’s scheme for committing chil-\ndren to mental health care in state hospitals, when the child\nis the ward of the state, comported with due process); Stanley,\n405 U.S. at 652 (“We do not question the assertion that\nneglectful parents may be separated from their children.”);\nJacobson v. Massachusetts, 197 U.S. 11 (1905) (upholding\nstate mandatory vaccination laws, as reasonable protection of\npublic health and safety, against a parental challenge).\n\n   [8] Given the broad aims of education and the state’s inter-\nest as parens patriae, there can be no question that the School\nDistrict’s interests in effective education and the mental\nhealth of its students are legitimate ends. See Parham, 442\nU.S. at 603 (“[A] state is not without constitutional control\nover parental discretion in dealing with children when their\nphysical or mental health is jeopardized.”) (citation omitted);\nHunter v. Regents, 190 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir. 1999)\n(“California has a compelling interest in providing effective\neducation . . . .”). Equally so, it is reasonable for the School\nDistrict to believe that the students’ answers to questions\nposed by its employee, who was trained in evaluating mental\nhealth, would aid the establishment of a district-wide inter-\nvention program to identify and treat barriers to learning\ncaused by exposure to childhood trauma. Accordingly, the\nSchool District’s administration of the survey was rationally\n\f                FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.            15083\nrelated to its legitimate state interest in effective education\nand the mental welfare of its students.\n\n   Although we reach our conclusions with little difficulty and\nfirmly endorse the School District’s authority to conduct a\nsurvey for the purposes involved here, we reiterate that we\nexpress no view on the wisdom of posing some of the particu-\nlar questions asked or of conducting an inquiry into some of\nthe particular areas surveyed by the School District. That\ndetermination is properly left to the school authorities.\n\n                              III.\n\n   In summary, we hold that there is no free-standing funda-\nmental right of parents “to control the upbringing of their chil-\ndren by introducing them to matters of and relating to sex in\naccordance with their personal and religious values and\nbeliefs” and that the asserted right is not encompassed by any\nother fundamental right. In doing so, we do not quarrel with\nthe parents’ right to inform and advise their children about the\nsubject of sex as they see fit. We conclude only that the par-\nents are possessed of no constitutional right to prevent the\npublic schools from providing information on that subject to\ntheir students in any forum or manner they select. We further\nhold that a psychological survey is a reasonable state action\npursuant to legitimate educational as well as health and wel-\nfare interests of the state. Accordingly, the parent-appellants\nhave failed to state a federal claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. The decision of the district court is affirmed.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f",

The questioning was part of a survey the\nPalmdale School District was conducting regarding psycho-\nlogical barriers to learning. The parents brought an action in\ndistrict court against the School District and two of its offi-\ncials for violating their right to privacy and their right “to con-\ntrol the upbringing of their children by introducing them to\nmatters of and relating to sex.” They brought both federal and\nstate claims. The district court dismissed the federal causes of\naction for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted and dismissed the state claims without prejudice to\ntheir right to re-file in state court. We agree, and hold that\nthere is no fundamental right of parents to be the exclusive\nprovider of information regarding sexual matters to their chil-\ndren, either independent of their right to direct the upbringing\nand education of their children or encompassed by it. We also\nhold that parents have no due process or privacy right to over-\nride the determinations of public schools as to the information\nto which their children will be exposed while enrolled as stu-\n\f15064              FIELDS v.

The Palmdale School District, of which\nMesquite was a part, collaborated with the School of Profes-\nsional Psychology, the Children’s Bureau of Southern Califor-\nnia, and Seymour to develop and administer a psychological\nassessment questionnaire for first, third, and fifth grade stu-\ndents with the announced goal of “establish[ing] a community\nbaseline measure of children’s exposure to early trauma (for\nexample, violence).”\n\n   Prior to administering the survey, Seymour mailed a letter\nto the parents of the children to be surveyed informing them\nof the questionnaire’s nature and purpose, and requesting their\nconsent to its administration.1 The parental consent letter was\n  1\n   The letter states:\n“Parental Consent\nDear Parent or Caregiver:\n   The Palmdale School District is asking your support in participating in\na district-wide study of our first, third and fifth grade children.

The parents allege that if they had known\nthe true nature of the survey, they would not have consented\nto their children’s involvement. Prior to filing in federal court,\nthe parents initially sought redress for their alleged injuries\nthrough an administrative tort claim filed with the Palmdale\nSchool Board. Therein, they alleged that their “basic constitu-\ntional right to control” their children’s upbringing had been\n“robbed” by the defendants’ actions. Their claim was denied\nand they subsequently filed a complaint in district court alleg-\ning four causes of action: (1) violation of their federal consti-\ntutional right to privacy; (2) violation of their California\nconstitutional right to privacy; (3) deprivation of civil rights\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983; and (4) negligence.

Pro. 12(b)(6) to dismiss the entire\naction for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be\ngranted. They asserted that there is no deeply rooted and fun-\ndamental right of parents “to control the upbringing of their\nchildren by introducing them to matters of and relating to sex\nin accordance with their personal and religious values and\nbeliefs.” They further contended that the § 1983 claim was\nnot viable because the parents’ civil rights had not been vio-\nlated and that even if they had, the School District is immune\nfrom suit and the individual defendants are entitled to quali-\nfied immunity. Finally, they argued that they are not liable\nunder California law because their actions were discretionary\nand state law immunity applies.\n\n   The parents countered that the administration of the survey\nviolated their constitutional privacy right as well as their right\nto control their children’s exposure to sexual subjects, that the\ndefendants arrogated unto themselves the parents’ right to\ndetermine how their children learn about sexual matters, and\nthat the defendants are not immune from suit.\n\n   After holding a hearing on the motion, the district court dis-\nmissed the federal claims for “lack of a cognizable legal theo-\nry.” In doing so, it first recharacterized the parents’ privacy\nclaim as a substantive due process claim because “all of the\nParents’ arguments concerning the claim are grounded in the\nFourteenth Amendment’s Substantive Due Process Clause.\nOther than citing generally to privacy cases outside the Four-\nteenth Amendment’s scope, the Parents do not connect their\nasserted interest . . . to the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Ninth,\nor Tenth Amendments.” The court ruled next that the right “to\ncontrol the upbringing of their children by introducing them\nto matters of and relating to sex in accordance with their per-\nsonal and religious values and beliefs” does not rise to the\nlevel of a fundamental right protected by Substantive Due\nProcess. It further concluded that the fundamental right to\ndirect the upbringing and education of one’s children does not\n\f                   FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.                   15069\nencompass the right “to control the upbringing of their chil-\ndren by introducing them to matters of and relating to sex in\naccordance with their personal and religious values and\nbeliefs.” Finally, the court declined to exercise supplemental\njurisdiction over the state law causes of action and dismissed\nthem without prejudice. The parents now appeal.\n\n                                    II.\n\n  On appeal, the parents challenge the district court’s dis-\nmissal of their federal claims for failure to state a claim upon\nwhich relief may be granted.6 The district court’s dismissal\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim is\nreviewed de novo.

Finally, they\nmaintain that even if the court concludes that the deprivation\nof their liberty interest in “control[ling] the upbringing of\ntheir children by introducing them to matters of and relating\nto sex” is not subject to strict scrutiny, the School District’s\nadministration of the psychological survey was not rationally\nrelated to a legitimate state end.\n\n  A.    Meyer-Pierce\n\n   We note at the outset that it is not our role to rule on the\nwisdom of the School District’s actions. That is a matter that\nmust be decided in other fora. The question before us is sim-\nply whether the parents have a constitutional right to exclu-\nsive control over the introduction and flow of sexual\ninformation to their children. It is clear, and the parents agree,\nthat no court has ever held that parents have a specific funda-\nmental right “to control the upbringing of their children by\nintroducing them to matters of and relating to sex in accor-\ndance with their personal and religious values and beliefs.” In\nfact, no such specific right can be found in the deep roots of\nthe nation’s history and tradition or implied in the concept of\nordered liberty.

Glucksberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118144\"><a href=\"/opinion/118144/washington-v-glucksberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n720-21 (1997). Thus, whether the parents have a constitu-\ntional right to exclusive control over the introduction and flow\nof sexual information to their children depends entirely upon\nwhether the asserted right is encompassed within some\nbroader constitutional right.\n\n   [1] The parents next argue that the right they seek to invoke\nis encompassed within the fundamental due process right to\n“control the education and upbringing of one’s children.” The\nSupreme Court has held that the right of parents to make deci-\nsions concerning the care, custody, and control of their chil-\ndren is a fundamental liberty interest protected by the Due\nProcess Clause.

PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.            15073\nexplicit references to sexuality. See 68 F.3d at 529. The\nBrown plaintiffs alleged that the compelled attendance of\nschoolchildren at the assembly deprived the minors and their\nparents of their privacy rights, substantive due process rights,\nand their right to an educational environment free from sexual\nharassment. Rejecting those claims, the First Circuit\nexplained that,\n\n    [t]he Meyer and Pierce cases, we think, evince the\n    principle that the state cannot prevent parents from\n    choosing a specific educational program — whether\n    it be religious instruction at a private school or\n    instruction in a foreign language. That is, the state\n    does not have the power to “standardize its children”\n    or “foster a homogenous people” by completely\n    foreclosing the opportunity of individuals and groups\n    to choose a different path of education. We do not\n    think, however, that this freedom encompasses a\n    fundamental constitutional right to dictate the curric-\n    ulum at the public school to which they have chosen\n    to send their children. We think it is fundamentally\n    different for the state to say to a parent, “You can’t\n    teach your child German or send him to a parochial\n    school,” than for the parent to say to the state, “You\n    can’t teach my child subjects that are morally offen-\n    sive to me.” The first instance involves the state pro-\n    scribing parents from educating their children, while\n    the second involves parents prescribing what the\n    state shall teach their children. If all parents had a\n    fundamental constitutional right to dictate individu-\n    ally what the schools teach their children, the\n    schools would be forced to cater a curriculum for\n    each student whose parents had genuine moral dis-\n    agreements with the school’s choice of subject mat-\n    ter. We cannot see that the Constitution imposes\n    such a burden on state educational systems, and\n    accordingly find that the rights of parents as\n    described by Meyer and Pierce do not encompass a\n\f15074          FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\n    broad-based right to restrict the flow of information\n    in the public schools.\n\nId. at 533-34 (citations omitted) (emphasis added). We agree\nwith and adopt the First Circuit’s analysis. Meyer, Pierce, and\ntheir progeny “evince the principle that the state cannot pre-\nvent parents from choosing a specific educational program,”\nbut they do not afford parents a right to compel public schools\nto follow their own idiosyncratic views as to what information\nthe schools may dispense. Parents have a right to inform their\nchildren when and as they wish on the subject of sex; they\nhave no constitutional right, however, to prevent a public\nschool from providing its students with whatever information\nit wishes to provide, sexual or otherwise, when and as the\nschool determines that it is appropriate to do so.\n\n   Neither Meyer nor Pierce provides support for the view\nthat parents have a right to prevent a school from providing\nany kind of information — sexual or otherwise — to its stu-\ndents. As the Brown court said, “Meyer and Pierce do not\nencompass [the] broad-based right [the parent-plaintiffs seek]\nto restrict the flow of information in the public schools.” Id.\nat 534. Although the parents are legitimately concerned with\nthe subject of sexuality, there is no constitutional reason to\ndistinguish that concern from any of the countless moral, reli-\ngious, or philosophical objections that parents might have to\nother decisions of the School District — whether those objec-\ntions regard information concerning guns, violence, the mili-\ntary, gay marriage, racial equality, slavery, the dissection of\nanimals, or the teaching of scientifically-validated theories of\nthe origins of life. Schools cannot be expected to accommo-\ndate the personal, moral or religious concerns of every parent.\nSuch an obligation would not only contravene the educational\nmission of the public schools, but also would be impossible\nto satisfy.\n\n  As the First Circuit made clear in Brown, once parents\nmake the choice as to which school their children will attend,\n\f                 FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.               15075\ntheir fundamental right to control the education of their chil-\ndren is, at the least, substantially diminished. The constitution\ndoes not vest parents with the authority to interfere with a\npublic school’s decision as to how it will provide information\nto its students or what information it will provide, in its class-\nrooms or otherwise. See Yoder, 406 U.S. at 205. Perhaps the\nSixth Circuit said it best when it explained, “While parents\nmay have a fundamental right to decide whether to send their\nchild to a public school, they do not have a fundamental right\ngenerally to direct how a public school teaches their child.\nWhether it is the school curriculum, the hours of the school\nday, school discipline, the timing and content of examina-\ntions, the individuals hired to teach at the school, the extracur-\nricular activities offered at the school or, as here, a dress code,\nthese issues of public education are generally ‘committed to\nthe control of state and local authorities.’ ” (citations omitted)\n(emphasis in original).

That is not how the\ncourts have analyzed the issue, see, e.g., Blau, and we see no\nreason to follow a different course.\n\n   [4] Brown and Blau compel the conclusion that what\nMeyer-Pierce establishes is the right of parents to be free\nfrom state interference with their choice of the educational\n  7\n   We offer no comment as to any First Amendment issues that may arise\nwith respect to any of these matters.\n\f15076             FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\nforum itself, a choice that ordinarily determines the type of\neducation one’s child will receive. The School District’s\ndesign and administration of the survey in no way interfered\nwith that right. Indeed, it was only because the parents had\nselected the school they did that their children were asked the\nquestions to which the parents objected. The state action at\nissue simply does not fall within the Meyer-Pierce proscrip-\ntion.\n\n   In sum, we affirm that the Meyer-Pierce right does not\nextend beyond the threshold of the school door. The parents’\nasserted right “to control the upbringing of their children by\nintroducing them to matters of and relating to sex in accor-\ndance with their personal and religious values and beliefs,” by\nwhich they mean the right to limit what public schools or\nother state actors may tell their children regarding sexual mat-\nters, is not encompassed within the Meyer-Pierce right to con-\ntrol their children’s upbringing and education. Accordingly,\nMeyer-Pierce provides no basis for finding a substantive due\nprocess right that could have been violated by the defendants’\nauthorization and administration of the survey.\n\n  B.    Privacy\n\n   The parents argue alternatively that the right “to control the\nupbringing of their children by introducing them to matters of\nand relating to sex in accordance with their personal and reli-\ngious values and beliefs” is encompassed within their consti-\ntutional “right to privacy with respect to intimate decisions.”\nThe defendants argue that no such right to privacy exists inde-\npendent of the substantive due process rights already ana-\nlyzed, and that, in any event, any such right to privacy is not\nimplicated by the state’s actions here.\n\n   [5] The nature of the relationship between the privacy right\nprotecting intimate decision-making and the Meyer-Pierce\nright is far from clear. The parents suggest that “the two sepa-\nrate rights are inextricably intertwined in modern constitu-\n\f                  FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.                 15077\ntional jurisprudence.” Some courts, including the district\ncourt, have construed the two rights as one and the same when\ndiscussing a parent’s privacy interest in controlling the\nupbringing and education of children. See, e.g., Brown, 68\nF.3d at 532-34. Both theories find their roots in substantive\ndue process. To the extent that the two are “inextricably inter-\ntwined,” the failure of the parents to state a claim under\nMeyer-Pierce disposes of their privacy argument. For pur-\nposes of this opinion, however, we will also analyze the pri-\nvacy right separately.\n\n   Although the right to privacy provides a different source\nfor the right the parents seek to assert than does Meyer-\nPierce, like Meyer-Pierce it does not encompass that right.\nThe Supreme Court has identified at least two constitutionally\nprotected privacy interests: the right to control the disclosure\nof sensitive information and the right to “independence when\nmaking certain kinds of important decisions.” Whalen v. Roe,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109592\"><a href=\"/opinion/109592/whalen-v-roe/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">589</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 599-600 (1977). The parents do not allege that\ntheir children were forced to disclose private information.\nTheir argument here is only that the survey violated their own\nright to make important decisions regarding the manner and\ntiming of exposing their children to sexual matters.8\n\n   [6] In its earliest formulation, the right to privacy was used\nessentially to protect the family structure. See Pierce, 268\nU.S. at 510 (affirming family’s right to be free from all but\nthe most necessary state interference); Meyer, 262 U.S. at 390\n(same). Courts have since found, however, that the right to\nprivacy also protects important parental decisions such as\nwhether to bear children, who has control over children, and\nother decisions related to procreative autonomy. See Carey v.\nPopulation Servs. Int’l, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109679\"><a href=\"/opinion/109679/carey-v-population-services-intl/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 684-86 (1977) (holding\n  8\n   No claim is asserted that either the childrens’ or the parent’s rights\nwere violated because the children were compelled to disclose personal or\nsensitive information.

We cannot overstate the significance of these\nrights. They symbolize the importance of our evolving under-\nstanding of the nature of our Constitution. See Stephen G.\nBreyer, Active Liberty: Interpreting Our Democratic Consti-\ntution (2005). Here, however, the survey simply did not inter-\nfere with the right of the parents to make intimate decisions.\nMaking intimate decisions and controlling the state’s determi-\nnation of information regarding intimate matters are two\nentirely different subjects. No constitutional provision prohib-\nits the dissemination of information to children, or to adults\n(unless it is the Treason Clause). Thus, the right of the parents\n“to control the upbringing of their children by introducing\nthem to matters of and relating to sex in accordance with their\npersonal and religious values and beliefs” is not protected by\nthe constitutional right to privacy, at least not as that pur-\nported right is understood by the parents in this case.\n\n  C.

First, the complaint alleges on information\nand belief that there was no legitimate governmental purpose\nto the survey and that it was undertaken in order to benefit\nSeymour’s academic career. The allegation is entirely specu-\nlative and conclusory in nature. No facts are offered in sup-\nport of the parents’ theory. Although in other circumstances\nwe might dismiss such an allegation with leave to amend, it\nis apparent here that such a dismissal could not in the end aid\nthe parents in stating a claim. Attached to the complaint is\ndetailed information setting forth the legitimate governmental\npurpose of the survey and explaining with specificity how the\ninformation obtained will be used for educational purposes\nand how it will ultimately benefit the School District and its\nchildren. Given the inclusion in the complaint of this specific\ninformation establishing the legitimacy of the School Dis-\ntrict’s action, we must, even for purposes of a motion to dis-\nmiss, approach the application of the rational basis test from\nthe premise that the School District had a legitimate educa-\ntional purpose in undertaking the survey.\n\n   The parents also argue that the survey cannot pass review\nbecause it was not a part of the school’s curriculum, and\ninformation regarding sexual matters may be conveyed only\nas part of a student’s academic studies. The curriculum argu-\nment also fails. First, neither education itself nor the legiti-\nmate functions of a public school are limited to the\ncurriculum. See Blau discussed supra at pp. 15075-76 and\nadopted herein. Such a view construes too narrowly the aims\n\f15080           FIELDS v.

Compulsory\n    school attendance laws and the great expenditures\n    for education both demonstrate our recognition of\n    the importance of education to our democratic soci-\n    ety. It is required in the performance of our most\n    basic public responsibilities, even service in the\n    armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citi-\n    zenship. Today it is a principal instrument in awak-\n    ening the child to cultural values, in preparing him\n    for later professional training, and in helping him to\n    adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it\n    is doubtful that any child may reasonably be\n    expected to succeed in life if he is denied the oppor-\n    tunity of an education.\n\nId. at 493. In fine, education is not merely about teaching the\nbasics of reading, writing, and arithmetic. Education serves\nhigher civic and social functions, including the rearing of chil-\ndren into healthy, productive, and responsible adults and the\ncultivation of talented and qualified leaders of diverse back-\ngrounds. See Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003). The\ndefendants prepared the psychological survey as an “assess-\nment [ ] to establish a community baseline measure of chil-\n\f                FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.             15081\ndren’s exposure to early trauma.” Protecting the mental health\nof children falls well within the state’s broad interest in edu-\ncation.\n\n   Second, the psychological survey’s ultimate objective was,\naccording to an exhibit to the complaint, to improve students’\nability to learn. The exhibit reveals that the survey was\nintended to gauge exposure to early trauma and to assist in\ndesigning an intervention program to help the School District\nreduce barriers to students’ ability to learn. Although the stu-\ndents who were questioned may or may not have “learned”\nanything from the survey itself and may or may not have been\n“taught” anything by the questions they were asked, the facili-\ntation of their ability to absorb the education the school pro-\nvides is without question a legitimate educational objective. It\nis indeed more directly within the school’s basic educational\nmission, than, for example, requiring students to wear uni-\nforms or to participate in community service, both of which\nsome courts have held constitutional. See Littlefield, 268 F.3d\nat 291 (“While [p]arents may have a fundamental right in the\nupbringing and education of their children, this right does not\ncover the [p]arents’ objection to a public school Uniform Pol-\nicy.”); Herndon, 89 F.3d at 176 (requiring high school stu-\ndents to perform community service in order to graduate does\nnot violate parents’ right to control the education of their chil-\ndren). See also Swanson, 135 F.3d at 699 (“Federal courts\naddressing the issue have held that parents have no right to\nexempt their children from certain reading programs the par-\nents found objectionable, or from a school’s community-\nservice requirement, or from an assembly program that\nincluded sexually explicit topics.”) (citations omitted).\n\n   Finally, apart from any discussion of whether the survey\nwas intended to aid the educational process, the questioning\ncan also be justified on the basis of an alternative state interest\n— namely, parens patriae. See Prince, 321 U.S. at 166-67.\nThe defendants argue that the survey was intended to gauge\nthe mental health of the School District’s students by “iden-\n\f15082           FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.\ntify[ing] internal behaviors such as anxiety and depression\nand external behaviors such as aggression and verbal abuse.”\nIn this respect, the School District’s interest in the mental\nhealth of its students falls well within the state’s authority as\nparens patriae. As such, the School District may legitimately\nplay a role in the care and nurture of children entrusted to\nthem for schooling. See id. at 166 (ruling that the state “as\nparens patriae” may supplement or even in some circum-\nstances supplant parents’ interest in the custody, care, and\nnurture of their children “by requiring school attendance, reg-\nulating or prohibiting the child’s labor and in many other\nways”) (citations omitted).

Equally so, it is reasonable for the School\nDistrict to believe that the students’ answers to questions\nposed by its employee, who was trained in evaluating mental\nhealth, would aid the establishment of a district-wide inter-\nvention program to identify and treat barriers to learning\ncaused by exposure to childhood trauma. Accordingly, the\nSchool District’s administration of the survey was rationally\n\f                FIELDS v. PALMDALE SCHOOL DIST.            15083\nrelated to its legitimate state interest in effective education\nand the mental welfare of its students.\n\n   Although we reach our conclusions with little difficulty and\nfirmly endorse the School District’s authority to conduct a\nsurvey for the purposes involved here, we reiterate that we\nexpress no view on the wisdom of posing some of the particu-\nlar questions asked or of conducting an inquiry into some of\nthe particular areas surveyed by the School District. That\ndetermination is properly left to the school authorities.\n\n                              III.\n\n   In summary, we hold that there is no free-standing funda-\nmental right of parents “to control the upbringing of their chil-\ndren by introducing them to matters of and relating to sex in\naccordance with their personal and religious values and\nbeliefs” and that the asserted right is not encompassed by any\nother fundamental right. In doing so, we do not quarrel with\nthe parents’ right to inform and advise their children about the\nsubject of sex as they see fit. We conclude only that the par-\nents are possessed of no constitutional right to prevent the\npublic schools from providing information on that subject to\ntheir students in any forum or manner they select. We further\nhold that a psychological survey is a reasonable state action\npursuant to legitimate educational as well as health and wel-\nfare interests of the state. Accordingly, the parent-appellants\nhave failed to state a federal claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. The decision of the district court is affirmed.\n\n  AFFIRMED.\n\f</pre>",
