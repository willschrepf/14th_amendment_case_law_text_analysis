During the 1969-70 school year the Board of Public Instruction of Broward County operated 115 schools to educate more than 112,000 students, approximately 77 percent white and 23 percent black.  Under the Board's projections for the 1970-71 school year, 116 schools will educate more than 118,000 students, approximately 78 percent white and 22 percent black.  A substantial percentage of the students in the Broward County system are transported to and from school by bus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present desegregation suit was filed by Negro plaintiffs on January 9, 1970.  The first hearing to consider this action was held on January 16, 1970.  As a result of facts adduced at that hearing the district court found that the Board was operating a dual school system.  The Board was ordered to file by February 16, 1970, 'a comprehensive plan to establish a unitary school system' in Broward County.  The court suggested that the Board, in formulating its plan, consult with the Florida School Desegregation Consulting Center at the University of Miami.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plan was duly submitted, objections were filed with the court, and a hearing was held on March 3, 1970.  At that hearing the court expressed the view that it needed more information to measure the plan against constitutional standards.  The Board was directed to 'consult and cooperate with and accept the aid of' the Florida School Desegregation Consulting Center in revising its plan 'with special emphasis on eliminating the remaining all-black elementary schools.'  The Center was requested to make a report with recommendations 'designed to assure a desegregation plan which meets the constitutional standard of a unitary system.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the court's directives, the Board filed an amended plan and the Center submitted its recommendations.  The principal difference between the two proposals was in their approach to the problem of desegregating all-black and overwhelmingly black elementary schools.  The Center suggested use of school pairing as a means of desegregating these elementary schools, but the Board's plan rejected pairing.  The plan submitted by the Board merely amended some of the discretionary zone lines which had previously been proposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held a hearing on April 3, 1970, to consider the Board plan and the Center's proposal.  At that hearing the court heard the views of the Board, the Center, the plaintiffs, and various parties who had been allowed to intervene.  On April 30, 1970, the court entered its final order.  With regard to the hotly disputed issue of student desegregation in the elementary schools, the court's order rejected the Center's approach and accepted the boundaries of school attendance zones as proposed in the Board's amended plan.  From that order plaintiffs have perfected this appeal.  An appeal has also been taken by intervenors Blanche Ely High School Parent Teachers Association and Irene S. Clark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">THE DISTRICT COURT'S ORDER</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities, the desegregation order entered by the district court on April 30, 1970, is unexceptional and is not challenged by any of the parties.  Except for the problem noted in the next paragraph of this opinion, the order is in compliance with all of our Singleton<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> requirements, including the requirement that faculty and staff members be assigned in such a manner that the ratio of whites to blacks in each school is substantially the same as the ratio of whites to blacks in the entire system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The order further provides for a bi-racial committee of twelve members-- six blacks and six whites-- to be appointed by the court to make recommendations to the Board with respect to such matters as 'the operation of (the) majority to minority pupil transfer rule, the transportation system, and selection of school sites.'  The record indicates that this committee has been appointed, and it is apparently functioning now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties have not put it in issue, we note one deficiency in the district court's order.  This deficiency has to do with the majority-to-minority transfer provision.  The order approves the following transfer rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Any pupil, with parental consent, shall have the right to transfer from a school at which his race is in the majority to the next nearest school at which his race is in the minority and the board shall furnish free transportation provided the distance involved meets state transportation statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Other reassignment requests will be considered providing the request does not involve the transfer of a pupil (from a school) in which his race is in the minority to a school in which his race is in the majority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision is not entirely in accord with our recent decisions.  See Hightower v. West, 5 Cir. 1970, 430 F.2d 552; Carr v. Montgomery County Board of Education, 5 Cir. 1970, 429 F.2d 382; Davis v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County, 5 Cir. 1970, 430 F.2d 883; Singleton v. Jackson Municipal Separate School District, 5 Cir. 1970, 426 F.2d 1364.  On remand the district court's order must be modified to make it clear that (1) any pupil shall have the right to transfer from a school at which his race is in the majority to any school (not just the next nearest school) at which his race is in the minority and (2) transferees shall be given priority for space.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">STUDENT DESEGREGATION: SECONDARY SCHOOLS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Student assignment to secondary schools-- high schools, junior high schools, and middle schools-- presents no problem on this appeal.  The plaintiffs are not unhappy with the court-approved plan insofar as it relates to pupil assignment to secondary schools, and our examination of this aspect of the plan does not disclose any deficiencies to be remedied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intervenors, however, raise an issue with regard to the closing of Blanche Ely High School.  Blanche Ely, located in a black neighborhood in Pompano Beach, has been a junior-senior high school.  During the 1969-70 school year its student enrollment was 100 percent black.  For the 1970-71 school year the court approved the Board's proposal to close the school as a high school facility, send its students elsewhere, and use the building to house the Coleman Elementary School.  Intervenors object to the closing of Blanche Ely High School, arguing (1) that the community which has been served by the school will suffer if the school ceases to exist and (2) that the district court was erroneous in finding that the Blanche Ely physical plant is not an adequate secondary school facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded that we should order the district court to require the reopening of Blanche Ely as a high school.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that the Board's decision to close Blanche Ely was based on anything other than sound educational criteria.  Moreover, the record amply supports the district court's finding that the Blanche Ely facility is not an adequate physical facility for conducting a high school program.  In the light of these factors we find no merit in the intervenors' objection to the closing of the school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">STUDENT DESEGREGATION: ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real bone of contention in this case is student assignment at the elementary school level.  As we have noted, the Florida School Desegregation Consulting Center, whose recommendations were generally endorsed by the plaintiffs, recommended the use of the pairing/clustering technique to desegregate all-black and virtually all-black schools, but the school board strongly opposed the use of this technique at the elementary level.  The district court agreed with the Board's position vis-a-vis pairing, requiring only that the Board redraw some of its discretionary zone lines.  The results achieved under the amended zoning plan approved by the district court are decidedly unimpressive.  Of the 83 elementary schools projected for the 1970-71 school year, 13 are to have an enrollment that is 90 percent or more black.  The projected student enrollment for these schools is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <pre>                                           Percentage\nSchool and Location   Black  White  Total    Black\nCarver Ranches\n   (in South Area)     663    37     700       95%\nC.

The plaintiffs contend that the existence of these all-black and virtually all-black elementary schools in Broward County is unacceptable.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason for the existence of so many all-black and virtually all-black elementary schools under the court-approved plan is clear from an examination of the record: the trial judge achieved as much desegregation of formerly black elementary schools as he thought practicable by the redrawing of discretionary zone lines, but he refused to pair or cluster any elementary schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In the factual situation here presented we think the trial court's rejection of the pairing technique must be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the conversion from dual school systems based on race to unitary school systems, the continued existence of all-black or virtually all-black schools is unacceptable where reasonable alternatives exist.  And it is clear that one acceptable way to achieve reasonable alternatives is by pairing schools.  The tenor of our decisions is unmistakable: where all-black or virtually all-black schools remain under a zoning plan, but it is practicable to desegregate some or all of the black schools by using the tool of pairing, the tool must be used.  Thus we have required the pairing or clustering of schools in Dade County, Florida,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> in Pinellas County, Florida,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> in Hillsborough County, Florida,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> in Alachua County, Florida,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> in Clarksdale, Mississippi,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and in Jackson Mississippi,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> to mention only a few instances.  It is now clear beyond peradventure that the tool of school pairing-- a most viable tool in the school desegregation process-- must be embraced where it is practicable and desegregation cannot be achieved by other means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has told us that 'there is no universal answer to complex problems of desegregation; there is obviously no one plan that will do the job in every case.  The matter must be assessed in light of the circumstances present and the options available in each instance.'  Green v. New Kent County School Board 1968, 391 U.S. 430, 439, 88 S.Ct. 1689, 20 L.Ed.2d 716.  There are indeed many roads to Rome, and the pairing road must not be avoided like the plague simply because it presents some problems to the school board and the community.  We are not insensitive to the abrasions and dislocations that can sometimes be caused by the paring technique-- and in every case the courts must strive to keep such problems to a minimum-- but the pairing technique cannot be totally eschewed because it is not perfect.  The Supreme Court has commanded courts and school boards to eliminate school segregation 'root and branch,' Green, supra, 391 U.S. at 438, 88 S.Ct. 1689, and to do it now.  See Green, supra; Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 1969, 396 U.S. 19, 90 S.Ct. 29, 24 L.Ed.2d 19; Carter v. West Feliciana Parish School Board, 1970, 396 U.S. 290, 90 S.Ct. 608, 24 L.Ed.2d 477.  We must be responsive to this constitutional mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our examination of the record before us indicates that the pairing/clustering technique can be utilized to desegregate every one of the 13 all-black or virtually all-black elementary schools envisioned in the plan approved by the district court.  This desegregation can be accomplished 'without creating impractical attendance zones or inordinate transportation problems.'  Bradley v. Board of Public Instruction of Pinellas County, 5 Cir. 1970, 431 F.2d 1377 (July 28, 1970).  Accordingly, we hereby order the following modifications in the district court's desegregation order for the 1970-71 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">South Area</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The area designated by the school board as the South Area includes two all-black or virtually all-black schools, Carver Ranches and C. A. Moore.  These schools present an obvious opportunity for application of the pairing/clustering technique, for both the Carver Ranches zone and the Moore zone are surrounded by predominantly white school zones.  The district court shall order the following groupings:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Carver Ranches, Orange Brook, Watkins, and Lake Forest</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Moore, Colbert, Hollywood Central, and Hallendale</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The projected student enrollments in the attendance zones created by these groupings are set out in the Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Central Area</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Central Area contains a core area of black population concentration in which seven elementary schools are more than 90 percent black, including three schools that are 100 percent black and one that is 99.6 percent black.  The seven schools are Larkdale, Broward Estates, Sabal Palm, Lincoln Park, Walker, Dillard, and Rock Island.  Our study of this area indicates that it is practicable to effectively desegregate every one of these seven schools by use of the pairing/clustering technique.  The district court shall order the following groupings:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Larkdale, Lauderhill and Castle Hill</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Broward Estates, Plantation, and Pine Ridge</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Sabal Palm, Westwood Heights, and Sunset</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Lincoln Park, North Fork, Hortt, and Riverland</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(5) Walker, North Side, and East Side</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(6) Dillard, Lauderdale Manors, and Wilton Manors</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(7) Rock Island, Oriole, and Lloyd Estates</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The projected student enrollments in the attendance zones created by these groupings are set out in the Appendix to this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">North Area</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The North Area contains a bloc of four schools-- Charles Drew, Markham, Coleman, and Sanders Park-- which are more than 90 percent black.  Several nearby schools, however, are predominantly white or all-white.  Thus all four schools can be desegregated by use of the pairing/clustering technique.  In fact, because of the arrangement of the zones in this area, several reasonable alternatives exist.  We have listed these alternative arrangements below as Plans 'A' through 'F.'  The decision as to which plan to implement is left to the district court.  Each plan includes a slightly different combination of pairing and grouping, although the result in each case is a total of four attendance zones.  We express no preference for any particular plan, for each plan presents a satisfactory method of desegregating the four overwhelmingly black schools.

However, in deciding which grades will attend which schools, the district court is ordered to comply with the following requirements: (1) In every attendance zone created by pairing and clustering the court must make every reasonable effort to avoid 'splitting' a grade, i.e., assigning any particular grade to more than one school.  (2) If in some instances it does become necessary to split a grade, the court will assign the students in that grade in such a manner that the degree of desegregation ordered by this court for that attendance zone will not be diminished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to all other aspects of the desegregation plan as modified by this opinion, the district court shall be free to exercise his discretion to order alterations and adjustments submitted by the school board or by any other party.

During the 1969-70 school year the Board of Public Instruction of Broward County operated 115 schools to educate more than 112,000 students, approximately 77 percent white and 23 percent black.  Under the Board's projections for the 1970-71 school year, 116 schools will educate more than 118,000 students, approximately 78 percent white and 22 percent black.  A substantial percentage of the students in the Broward County system are transported to and from school by bus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present desegregation suit was filed by Negro plaintiffs on January 9, 1970.  The first hearing to consider this action was held on January 16, 1970.  As a result of facts adduced at that hearing the district court found that the Board was operating a dual school system.  The Board was ordered to file by February 16, 1970, 'a comprehensive plan to establish a unitary school system' in Broward County.  The court suggested that the Board, in formulating its plan, consult with the Florida School Desegregation Consulting Center at the University of Miami.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plan was duly submitted, objections were filed with the court, and a hearing was held on March 3, 1970.  At that hearing the court expressed the view that it needed more information to measure the plan against constitutional standards.  The Board was directed to 'consult and cooperate with and accept the aid of' the Florida School Desegregation Consulting Center in revising its plan 'with special emphasis on eliminating the remaining all-black elementary schools.'  The Center was requested to make a report with recommendations 'designed to assure a desegregation plan which meets the constitutional standard of a unitary system.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to the court's directives, the Board filed an amended plan and the Center submitted its recommendations.  The principal difference between the two proposals was in their approach to the problem of desegregating all-black and overwhelmingly black elementary schools.  The Center suggested use of school pairing as a means of desegregating these elementary schools, but the Board's plan rejected pairing.  The plan submitted by the Board merely amended some of the discretionary zone lines which had previously been proposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held a hearing on April 3, 1970, to consider the Board plan and the Center's proposal.  At that hearing the court heard the views of the Board, the Center, the plaintiffs, and various parties who had been allowed to intervene.  On April 30, 1970, the court entered its final order.  With regard to the hotly disputed issue of student desegregation in the elementary schools, the court's order rejected the Center's approach and accepted the boundaries of school attendance zones as proposed in the Board's amended plan.  From that order plaintiffs have perfected this appeal.  An appeal has also been taken by intervenors Blanche Ely High School Parent Teachers Association and Irene S. Clark.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">THE DISTRICT COURT'S ORDER</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to faculty, staff, transportation, extracurricular activities, and facilities, the desegregation order entered by the district court on April 30, 1970, is unexceptional and is not challenged by any of the parties.  Except for the problem noted in the next paragraph of this opinion, the order is in compliance with all of our Singleton<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> requirements, including the requirement that faculty and staff members be assigned in such a manner that the ratio of whites to blacks in each school is substantially the same as the ratio of whites to blacks in the entire system.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The order further provides for a bi-racial committee of twelve members-- six blacks and six whites-- to be appointed by the court to make recommendations to the Board with respect to such matters as 'the operation of (the) majority to minority pupil transfer rule, the transportation system, and selection of school sites.'  The record indicates that this committee has been appointed, and it is apparently functioning now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the parties have not put it in issue, we note one deficiency in the district court's order.  This deficiency has to do with the majority-to-minority transfer provision.  The order approves the following transfer rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1.  Any pupil, with parental consent, shall have the right to transfer from a school at which his race is in the majority to the next nearest school at which his race is in the minority and the board shall furnish free transportation provided the distance involved meets state transportation statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2.  Other reassignment requests will be considered providing the request does not involve the transfer of a pupil (from a school) in which his race is in the minority to a school in which his race is in the majority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision is not entirely in accord with our recent decisions.

On remand the district court's order must be modified to make it clear that (1) any pupil shall have the right to transfer from a school at which his race is in the majority to any school (not just the next nearest school) at which his race is in the minority and (2) transferees shall be given priority for space.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">STUDENT DESEGREGATION: SECONDARY SCHOOLS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Student assignment to secondary schools-- high schools, junior high schools, and middle schools-- presents no problem on this appeal.  The plaintiffs are not unhappy with the court-approved plan insofar as it relates to pupil assignment to secondary schools, and our examination of this aspect of the plan does not disclose any deficiencies to be remedied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The intervenors, however, raise an issue with regard to the closing of Blanche Ely High School.  Blanche Ely, located in a black neighborhood in Pompano Beach, has been a junior-senior high school.  During the 1969-70 school year its student enrollment was 100 percent black.  For the 1970-71 school year the court approved the Board's proposal to close the school as a high school facility, send its students elsewhere, and use the building to house the Coleman Elementary School.  Intervenors object to the closing of Blanche Ely High School, arguing (1) that the community which has been served by the school will suffer if the school ceases to exist and (2) that the district court was erroneous in finding that the Blanche Ely physical plant is not an adequate secondary school facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded that we should order the district court to require the reopening of Blanche Ely as a high school.  There is nothing in the record to indicate that the Board's decision to close Blanche Ely was based on anything other than sound educational criteria.  Moreover, the record amply supports the district court's finding that the Blanche Ely facility is not an adequate physical facility for conducting a high school program.  In the light of these factors we find no merit in the intervenors' objection to the closing of the school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">STUDENT DESEGREGATION: ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The real bone of contention in this case is student assignment at the elementary school level.  As we have noted, the Florida School Desegregation Consulting Center, whose recommendations were generally endorsed by the plaintiffs, recommended the use of the pairing/clustering technique to desegregate all-black and virtually all-black schools, but the school board strongly opposed the use of this technique at the elementary level.  The district court agreed with the Board's position vis-a-vis pairing, requiring only that the Board redraw some of its discretionary zone lines.  The results achieved under the amended zoning plan approved by the district court are decidedly unimpressive.  Of the 83 elementary schools projected for the 1970-71 school year, 13 are to have an enrollment that is 90 percent or more black.  The projected student enrollment for these schools is as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <pre>                                           Percentage\nSchool and Location   Black  White  Total    Black\nCarver Ranches\n   (in South Area)     663    37     700       95%\nC.

The plaintiffs contend that the existence of these all-black and virtually all-black elementary schools in Broward County is unacceptable.  We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason for the existence of so many all-black and virtually all-black elementary schools under the court-approved plan is clear from an examination of the record: the trial judge achieved as much desegregation of formerly black elementary schools as he thought practicable by the redrawing of discretionary zone lines, but he refused to pair or cluster any elementary schools.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  In the factual situation here presented we think the trial court's rejection of the pairing technique must be reversed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the conversion from dual school systems based on race to unitary school systems, the continued existence of all-black or virtually all-black schools is unacceptable where reasonable alternatives exist.  And it is clear that one acceptable way to achieve reasonable alternatives is by pairing schools.  The tenor of our decisions is unmistakable: where all-black or virtually all-black schools remain under a zoning plan, but it is practicable to desegregate some or all of the black schools by using the tool of pairing, the tool must be used.  Thus we have required the pairing or clustering of schools in Dade County, Florida,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> in Pinellas County, Florida,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> in Hillsborough County, Florida,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> in Alachua County, Florida,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> in Clarksdale, Mississippi,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> and in Jackson Mississippi,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> to mention only a few instances.  It is now clear beyond peradventure that the tool of school pairing-- a most viable tool in the school desegregation process-- must be embraced where it is practicable and desegregation cannot be achieved by other means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has told us that 'there is no universal answer to complex problems of desegregation; there is obviously no one plan that will do the job in every case.  The matter must be assessed in light of the circumstances present and the options available in each instance.'  Green v. New Kent County School Board 1968, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">430</span></a></span>, 439, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There are indeed many roads to Rome, and the pairing road must not be avoided like the plague simply because it presents some problems to the school board and the community.  We are not insensitive to the abrasions and dislocations that can sometimes be caused by the paring technique-- and in every case the courts must strive to keep such problems to a minimum-- but the pairing technique cannot be totally eschewed because it is not perfect.  The Supreme Court has commanded courts and school boards to eliminate school segregation 'root and branch,' Green, supra, 391 U.S. at 438, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107705\"><a href=\"/opinion/107705/green-v-county-school-board/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Our study of this area indicates that it is practicable to effectively desegregate every one of these seven schools by use of the pairing/clustering technique.

Several nearby schools, however, are predominantly white or all-white.  Thus all four schools can be desegregated by use of the pairing/clustering technique.  In fact, because of the arrangement of the zones in this area, several reasonable alternatives exist.  We have listed these alternative arrangements below as Plans 'A' through 'F.'  The decision as to which plan to implement is left to the district court.  Each plan includes a slightly different combination of pairing and grouping, although the result in each case is a total of four attendance zones.  We express no preference for any particular plan, for each plan presents a satisfactory method of desegregating the four overwhelmingly black schools.

However, in deciding which grades will attend which schools, the district court is ordered to comply with the following requirements: (1) In every attendance zone created by pairing and clustering the court must make every reasonable effort to avoid 'splitting' a grade, i.e., assigning any particular grade to more than one school.  (2) If in some instances it does become necessary to split a grade, the court will assign the students in that grade in such a manner that the degree of desegregation ordered by this court for that attendance zone will not be diminished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to all other aspects of the desegregation plan as modified by this opinion, the district court shall be free to exercise his discretion to order alterations and adjustments submitted by the school board or by any other party.
