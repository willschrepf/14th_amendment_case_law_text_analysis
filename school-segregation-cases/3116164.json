Smith, all of Birmingham, for appellant.\n\nThe verdict is so excessive as to induce the conviction that it was due to passion, prejudice, partiality, corruption, or mistake, and should have been set aside on defendant's motion. Alabama By-Products Corp. v. Cosby,  217 Ala. 144 ,  115 So. 31 ; Nashville C.  St. L. v. Crosby,  194 Ala. 338 ,  70 So. 7 ; Code 1923, &#167; 6150; 46 C.J. 197; Birmingham R.  E. Co. v.

If a person when injured was riding on the running board of an automobile, the law presumes he was guilty of contributory negligence, and casts upon him the burden of proving that his so riding did not proximately contribute to his injury. Alabama City, G.  A. R. Co. v. Ventress,  171 Ala. 285 , 54 So. 652 ; Crider v. Yolande Coal Co.,  206 Ala. 71 , 89 So. 285 ; Beyer v. L.  N. R. Co.,  114 Ala. 424 ,  21 So. 952 ; Smith v.

Palmer,  196 Ala. 67 ,  71 So. 422 .\n\nAltman  Koenig, of Birmingham, for appellee.\n\nThe Supreme Court will not reverse for insufficiency of evidence when the evidence is in direct conflict.

Trammell,  199 Ala. 536 ,  74 So. 469 ; Hatfield v. Riley,  199 Ala. 388 ,  74 So. 380 ; Louisville  N. Co. v. Blankenship,  199 Ala. 521 ,  74 So. 960 . A charge on contributory negligence hypothesizing plaintiff took a position of peril when there was no necessity for so doing is properly refused for not hypothesizing the danger was obvious to plaintiff or a person of ordinary care and prudence and similarly circumstanced. Vulcan R. Co. v. Lawrence,  214 Ala. 378 , 108 So. 3 . It is not negligence as matter of law to ride on the running board of an automobile; negligence vel non is a question for the jury after consideration of all the evidence. Grabau v.
