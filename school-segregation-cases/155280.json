Horowitz also\nappeals the district court’s denial of his request for access to the\nsame document under the Privacy Act. Finally, the Peace Corps\nappeals the denial of its attempt to protect the name of the\ncomplainant under FOIA Exemption 6.\n\n     We conclude the district court properly exempted the draft\ndocument from release under FOIA Exemption 5 and properly\nfound the document was not part of a system of records subject\nto disclosure under the Privacy Act. However, we conclude\nFOIA Exemption 6 also applies; therefore, the name of the\nalleged victim is not subject to release as a segregable fact.\n\n                                 I\n\n     From 1998 to 2001, Arturo Giron was Peace Corps Country\nDirector for the Kingdom of Tonga; his duties included supervi-\nsion of Peace Corps volunteers stationed in Tonga. On March 7,\n1999, a female volunteer told Giron a young Tongan man\nclaimed he had been the victim of sexual misconduct involving\nMichael Horowitz. The young man, a student at ’Atenisi High\nSchool, was 18 or 19 years old and appeared to have been under\n18 at the time of the incident.\n\f                                3\n\n     Giron consulted the Peace Corps Manual and contacted the\nGeneral Counsel’s office for advice. He also interviewed the\nTongan student, who repeated substantially the same allegations.\nGiron and Sally Olsonoski, another Peace Corps worker, then\nmet with Horowitz. Horowitz remembered the incident but\nexplained that the encounter was consensual and assured Giron\nthe student had been 18 years old at the time. Olsonoski testified\nthat Horowitz said, “I always card them,” but acknowledged that\nit was difficult to do so in a foreign country. Giron again sought\nassistance from the General Counsel’s office, stating in an\ne-mail that “[t]here is no clear age of majority [in Tonga], but\nhomosexual acts are illegal under the law here.” Giron confessed\nhe was “now completely confused about how to proceed,” and\nrequested guidance.\n\n     Within a week of receiving the volunteer’s report, Giron\nprepared “a single, cohesive document” that summarized his\ninvestigations and notes from various meetings, and generally\noutlined the events and the actions he had taken. He used the\ncomputer template designed for creating ASRs but completed\nonly three of the template’s five sections. At that point, accord-\ning to Giron, “no final decision had been made with respect to\nthe incident and the volunteer involved. We were still in the\nprocess of deliberating.”\n\n     On March 16, 1999, Giron e-mailed the document to senior\nofficials at Peace Corps headquarters, asking them to review the\ndraft and submit changes and comments. Later that day,\nHorowitz informed Giron that he was resigning from the Peace\nCorps. Horowitz now claims he resigned only after Giron read\nparts of the draft ASR to him, told him a final decision to\nadministratively separate him had been made, and informed him\nthat the ASR would be sent to headquarters unless Horowitz\nresigned. Giron denies ever making a final decision or informing\n\f                                4\n\nHorowitz that he had done so. At Horowitz’s request, however,\nGiron kept the draft ASR in his office safe.\n\n     On June 18, 1999, Horowitz requested a copy of the draft\nASR through FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552. The Peace Corps denied his\nrequest on August 17, 1999. On November 15, 1999, Horowitz\nadministratively appealed the denial, but the Peace Corps again\ndenied his request on April 19, 2000. Horowitz then filed suit in\nthe United States District Court for the District of Columbia,\nseeking disclosure of the draft ASR under FOIA and the Privacy\nAct, 5 U.S.C. § 552a. The Peace Corps contended the draft ASR\nwas a predecisional document exempt from release under FOIA\nand that releasing the student’s name would be a clearly\nunwarranted invasion of his privacy. The Peace Corps also\nargued the document was not contained in a system of records\nand thus was not subject to release under the Privacy Act.\n\n     The district court granted partial summary judgment to the\nPeace Corps, ruling that the document was not subject to release\nunder the Privacy Act, and partial summary judgment to\nHorowitz, ruling that release of the student’s name would not be\na clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy under FOIA. After an\nevidentiary hearing, the district court ruled in favor of the Peace\nCorps, allowing the document to be withheld as predecisional.\nHowever, the court confirmed that the identity of the student\nwas a segregable fact that must be released to Horowitz; release\nof the name was stayed pending this appeal.\n\n                                II\n\n    We review orders granting summary judgment de novo.\nComputer Prof’ls for Soc. Responsibility v. U.S. Secret Serv., 72\nF.3d 897, 902 (D.C. Cir. 1996). We will not set aside the district\ncourt’s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous, giving\ndue regard to the district court’s opportunity to judge the\n\f                                 5\n\ncredibility of witnesses. Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a); see Berger v. Iron\nWorkers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395, 1407\n(D.C. Cir. 1988).\n\n                                A\n\n     FOIA provides that “each agency, upon any request for\nrecords which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is\nmade in accordance with published rules stating the time, place,\nfees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the\nrecords promptly available to any person.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552(a)(3)(A). The statute also provides a list of exemptions\nfrom this command. 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). “[T]he burden is on the\nagency to sustain its action” in claiming these exemptions. 5\nU.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). Exemption 5 allows agencies to withhold\n“inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which\nwould not be available by law to a party other than an agency in\nlitigation with the agency.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(5). This exemp-\ntion privileges “those documents, and only those documents,\nnormally privileged in the civil discovery context.” NLRB v.\nSears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132, 149 (1975).\n\n     The privilege is meant to protect “predecisional communica-\ntions” from disclosure so as to “prevent injury to the quality of\nagency decisions.” Id. at 151. Thus, the exemption “protects\nmaterials that are both predecisional and deliberative.”\nMapother v. Dep’t of Justice, 3 F.3d 1533, 1537 (D.C. Cir.\n1993). We previously have stated that “the key question in\nExemption 5 cases [is] whether the disclosure of materials\nwould expose an agency’s decisionmaking process in such a\nway as to discourage candid discussion within the agency and\nthereby undermine the agency’s ability to perform its functions.”\nDudman Commc’ns Corp. v. Dep’t of the Air Force, 815 F.2d\n1565, 1568 (D.C. Cir. 1987). “Finally, even if the document is\npredecisional at the time it is prepared, it can lose that status if\n\f                                6\n\nit is adopted, formally or informally, as the agency position on\nan issue or is used by the agency in its dealings with the public.”\nCoastal States Gas Corp. v. Dep’t of Energy, 617 F.2d 854, 866\n(D.C. Cir. 1980).\n\n     Whether the draft ASR properly qualified as a deliberative\ndocument was the subject of an evidentiary hearing. The\nevidence before the court included section 284 of the Peace\nCorps Manual, which outlines the required process for early\ntermination of service of Peace Corps volunteers; the deposi-\ntions of Giron and Horowitz; and the testimony of Giron,\nHorowitz, and Sally Olsonoski at the evidentiary hearing. The\nmanual authorizes administrative separation for conduct ranging\nfrom minor infractions like failing to wear a motorcycle helmet,\nto criminal convictions, to espionage. Under these provisions,\nthe volunteer is entitled to be informed of the specific conduct\nat issue, have an opportunity to respond, and be apprised of the\nalternative of resignation. The disciplinary options range from\ntaking no action, to imposing conditions on further service, to\nadministrative separation. If a volunteer resigns before a final\ndecision to terminate him is made, the ASR is not completed. If\nthe volunteer resigns “after the decision to administratively\nseparate has been made but before the process is completed, the\nAdministrative Separation Report must be completed and\nforwarded” to the Peace Corps’s Office of Volunteer Services.\n\n     During the evidentiary hearing, Giron and Olsonoski\ntestified that no final decision was ever made to administratively\nseparate Horowitz. Giron testified it was “the first time [he] had\nencountered [so serious] an incident,” and it was his first\nexperience with an administrative separation. He sought further\nguidance from senior staff in Tonga and consulted on a daily\nbasis with Peace Corps headquarters, the Office of the General\nCounsel, and regional senior staff. He spent “literally hours and\nhours on the telephone with Washington, D.C., talking to the\n\f                                7\n\n[G]eneral [C]ounsel.” On March 16, 1999, prior to the meeting\nwhere Horowitz announced his intention to resign, Giron\ne-mailed the draft document to headquarters with a cover e-mail\nthat asked the recipients to “review and send comments/changes\nto Sally [Olsonoski].” Giron asked that comments be sent to\nOlsonoski because he had to leave Tonga to attend a funeral and\nhe anticipated that she would need to make the final decision in\nhis absence. Giron testified that he had reached no final decision\nprior to the time Horowitz announced his intention to resign, and\nthat he was unwilling to make a unilateral decision:\n\n    [W]hatever final disposition was going to be reached on this\n    case was going to be a consensus among all the senior\n    officials involved, myself included, but also the [O]ffice of\n    the [G]eneral [C]ounsel and the senior staff of the region,\n    and we had not at that point come to any particular consen-\n    sus as to which course of action we were going to follow.\n\nAccording to Giron’s testimony, at no time did Giron tell\nHorowitz that he had made a decision to administratively\nseparate him or that he was on the verge of doing so.\n\n     Giron explained that, complying with the provisions of\nsection 284, he never completed or officially filed the draft ASR\nhe was crafting. He believed “the opportunity to ‘think aloud’ in\nsuch a draft document” was “an essential part” of the section\n284 decision-making process; in his opinion, making such\ndocuments publicly available would deter Country Directors\nfrom creating them and deprive such officials of the benefit of\nreview and comment from other departments. Horowitz argues,\nhowever, that the document lost its predecisional status by being\nadopted as the official agency position regarding his administra-\ntive separation; in essence, he contends that Giron had already\ndecided to terminate his service before he resigned, even though\nthe decision was not formally executed. After evaluating the\n\f                                8\n\nwitnesses’ testimony and credibility, the district court concluded\nGiron had not made a final decision about separating Horowitz.\nThe document was prepared as an aid for Giron’s\ndecision-making process and for consultation with other Peace\nCorps officials. Hence, the document qualified as deliberative\nand predecisional.\n\n     We are not persuaded the district court’s findings on these\npoints are clearly erroneous. The draft is remarkably candid.\nMoreover, Giron’s thought processes are woven into the\ndocument to such an extent that any attempt to segregate\nnon-deliberative portions would effectively disclose the content\nand context of intra-agency deliberations. Accordingly, as the\ndocument did not lose its predecisional and deliberative status,\nit was properly withheld under FOIA Exemption 5.\n\n                                B\n\n     In providing exemptions from the general requirement of\ndisclosure, FOIA also provides that “[a]ny reasonably\nsegregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person\nrequesting such record after deletion of the portions which are\nexempt under this subsection.” 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). Thus, the\ndistrict court correctly concluded the student’s name, which\ncould be segregated, was not protected from disclosure by\nExemption 5. That conclusion does not fully resolve the\nquestion of whether the student’s name is nevertheless exempt\nfrom disclosure.\n\n                                C\n\n    FOIA Exemption 6 allows agencies to withhold “personnel\nand medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would\nconstitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.”\n5 U.S.C. § 552(b)(6). Horowitz agrees that the ASR qualifies as\n\f                                 9\n\na “similar file” as described in Exemption 6; thus, the remaining\nquestion is whether the release of the ASR—specifically, the\nportions identifying the student—would be a clearly unwar-\nranted invasion of the student’s privacy. In the district court, the\nPeace Corps argued Exemption 6 should apply; however, as\ncounsel for the Peace Corps acknowledged during oral argu-\nment, the Corps’s desire to be discreet and shield the privacy\ninterests of all parties may have led the district court to underes-\ntimate the private interest and overstate the public benefit at\nissue. Horowitz’s lack of reticence has allowed the Peace Corps\nto correct this defect on appeal.\n\n     To determine whether release of a file would result in a\nclearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, we must\nbalance the private interest involved (namely, “the individual’s\nright of privacy”) against the public interest (namely, “the basic\npurpose of the Freedom of Information Act,” which is “to open\nagency action to the light of public scrutiny”). Dep’t of the Air\nForce v. Rose, 425 U.S. 352, 372-73 (1976) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n     The focus of the public interest analysis is the citizens’ right\nto know “‘what their government is up to.’” U.S. Dep’t of\nJustice v. Reporters Comm. for Freedom of the Press, 489 U.S.\n749, 773 (1989) (citations omitted); see also Beck v. Dep’t of\nJustice, 997 F.2d 1489, 1491 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (stating that the\nstandard from Reporters Committee “is applicable in the case of\nExemption 6”). Neither “the identity of the requesting party” nor\n“the particular purpose for which the document is being re-\nquested” is relevant, Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 771-72,\nbecause “[a]s a general rule, if the information is subject to\ndisclosure, it belongs to all.” Nat’l Archives & Records Admin.\nv. Favish, 541 U.S. 157, 172 (2004). Hence, release under FOIA\nis equivalent to making the information publicly available.\n\f                                 10\n\n     The availability of information through other sources\nlessens the public interest in its release through FOIA. See U.S.\nDep’t of Def., Dep’t of Military Affairs v. Fed. Labor Relations\nAuth., 964 F.2d 26, 29 (D.C. Cir. 1992). If there is no public\ninterest in the disclosure of certain information, “something,\neven a modest privacy interest, outweighs nothing every time.”\nNat’l Ass’n. of Retired Fed. Employees v. Horner, 879 F.2d 873,\n879 (D.C. Cir. 1989). “We generally accord Government records\nand official conduct a presumption of legitimacy.” U.S. Dep’t of\nState v. Ray, 502 U.S. 164, 179 (1991). Furthermore, “clear\nevidence is usually required to displace” the presumption and\nshow the presence of a public interest in investigating an\nagency. Favish, 541 U.S. at 174.\n\n     The public interest in this case is virtually nonexistent.\nHorowitz alleges the Peace Corps mistreated him, and that\nrevealing the student’s name will allow investigation of the\nagency’s actions. However, he offered no credible evidence of\nmisconduct by the Peace Corps; the district court found Giron’s\ntestimony “forthright” and Horowitz’s testimony “continually\nevasive.” Horowitz’s real complaint is that he had to choose\nbetween two unpalatable alternatives. It is difficult to see how\nthe Peace Corps’s long-established procedure of allowing\nvolunteers to resign rather than face public charges of miscon-\nduct could be deemed improper. Horowitz simply alleges that in\norder to prove the Peace Corps’s perfidy, “it may be necessary\nto confirm the relation of Complainant, if any, to the Kingdom\nof Tonga’s political, military, and/or criminal factions.” Appel-\nlant’s Reply Br. at 44. Horowitz offers no further details to\nsupport these extremely speculative allegations; he has not\noffered the “clear evidence” required to overcome the presump-\ntion that the Peace Corps’s official conduct was proper.1 In no\n\n\n    1\n      Horowitz’s unsupported allegation that the Peace Corps is\nprotecting the student’s name in order to cover up for its failure to\n\f                                  11\n\nway would release of the student’s name serve the civic good.\nAdditionally, Horowitz’s need to obtain the information for a\npending civil suit is irrelevant, as the public interest to be\nweighed has nothing to do with Horowitz’s personal situation.\n\n     The privacy interest implicated in a case such as this is the\nindividual’s right to “avoid[] disclosure of personal matters.”\nReporters Comm., 489 U.S. at 762 (internal quotation marks and\ncitation omitted).2 Under Exemption 6, “the fact that an event\nis not wholly private does not mean that an individual has no\ninterest in limiting disclosure or dissemination of the informa-\ntion,” id. at 770 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted),\nas “there are few facts that are not at one time or another\ndivulged to another,” id. at 763.\n\n     Even seemingly innocuous information can be enough to\ntrigger the protections of Exemption 6. In United States Depart-\nment of Defense v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, the\nSupreme Court held Exemption 6 shielded the names and home\naddresses of agency employees from being released to unions\nthat requested the lists under FOIA. 510 U.S. 487, 502 (1994).\nBecause “[m]any people simply do not want to be disturbed at\nhome by work-related matters,” the Court was “reluctant to\ndisparage the privacy of the home, which is accorded special\n\n\nprotect Horowitz from the student’s purported blackmail attempt\nsimilarly fails to defeat the presumption of official regularity.\n     2\n      In Reporters Committee, the Court examined FOIA Exemption\n7(C), applicable to law enforcement files, rather than Exemption 6.\nNevertheless, the Court has held that the difference between the\nstandards for the two exemptions “is of little import” except when\nanalyzing “the magnitude of the public interest that is required to\noverride the respective privacy interests protected by the exemptions.”\nU.S. Dep’t of Def. v. Fed. Labor Relations Auth., 510 U.S. 487, 496\nn.6 (1994).\n\f                                12\n\nconsideration in our Constitution, laws, and traditions.” Id. at\n501. Additionally, “other parties, such as commercial advertisers\nand solicitors, must have the same access under FOIA as the\nunions”; releasing the lists to the unions would have necessitated\ngiving other parties access as well. Id. Thus, the Court found\nthat the privacy interests outweighed the “negligible” public\ninterest at stake. Id. at 502.\n\n     The scope of privacy protection under FOIA is not the same\nas in the constitutional context, Reporters Comm., 489 U.S. at\n762 n.13, although being “accorded special consideration in our\nConstitution, laws, and traditions” can give additional weight to\na privacy interest. U.S. Dep’t of Def., 510 U.S. at 501. Hence,\neven if the incident between Horowitz and the student was\nconsensual, the student might have a privacy interest in avoiding\ndisclosure of his identity. See generally Lawrence v. Texas, 539\nU.S. 558, 567 (2003) (stating that sexual behavior is “the most\nprivate human conduct”).\n\n     Victims of sexual assaults have an arguably greater interest\nin the protection of their privacy. For example, the Sixth Circuit\nhas reasoned that the occurrence of a rape “implicates both a\nprivate and a public interest, but the details of the rape primarily\nimplicate a private interest until such time as the public interest\nin prosecution predominates.” Bloch v. Ribar, 156 F.3d 673,\n685-86 (6th Cir. 1998). The private interest in nondisclosure\nmay predominate in such a case because of the personal trauma\ninvolved and the moral and social opprobrium disclosure often\npresages. The “interest in protecting the victims of sexual\nviolence from humiliation, among other injuries, has prompted\nstates to pass rape shield laws and to advocate against the\npublication of rape victims’ names.” Id. at 685. Similarly,\nFederal Rule of Evidence 412 limits the admissibility of\nevidence regarding the past sexual behavior or predispositions\nof an alleged victim of a sexual offense. “The rule aims to\n\f                                 13\n\nsafeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of privacy,\npotential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that is associ-\nated with public disclosure of intimate sexual details and the\ninfusion of sexual innuendo into the factfinding process.” Fed.\nR. Evid. 412 advisory committee’s note.\n\n      In Hunt v. FBI, the Ninth Circuit held that the FBI should\nnot release files from its internal investigation of an agent who\nhad been accused of sexual misconduct; even if the agent’s\nname was redacted from the files, she would have been identifi-\nable based on other information in the files. 972 F.2d 286 (9th\nCir. 1992). Although Hunt involved Exemption 7(C), under\nwhich only a reasonable expectation of an invasion of privacy\nmust be shown to prevent releasing information, the court’s\nreasoning is still relevant. That court found identification of the\nagent could have caused her “great personal and professional\nembarrassment,” while not serving a significant public interest,\nas “[t]he single file sought . . . will not shed any light on whether\nall such FBI investigations are comprehensive or whether sexual\nmisconduct by agents is common.” Id. at 288-89.\n\n     While we do not confront the constitutional question that\nwas before the Sixth Circuit in Bloch, the reasoning of the court\naptly describes the contours of the public/private balance at\nstake here. We are persuaded that the student’s interest in\navoiding disclosure of his name is at least as strong as the\nprivacy interest of a government agent accused of sexual\nmisconduct, and that it is certainly as strong as the interest of\nfederal employees in avoiding disclosure of their names and\naddresses. If released, the student’s name would be associated\nnot merely with an employer, or even personal sexual miscon-\nduct, but with a disputed sexual incident that he claims was not\nconsensual. Even though the student did reveal his allegation to\ntwo Peace Corps workers, and did not receive an explicit\npromise of confidentiality, he still has an interest in avoiding\n\f                                14\n\nfurther dissemination of his identity. Our law uniformly recog-\nnizes that strong privacy interests are implicated when dealing\nwith an individual’s sexual activity, especially when the\nindividual has reported a sexual assault. Unwanted public\nattention could lead to further trauma for the victim, who in this\ncase did not even choose to subject himself to public scrutiny by\npursuing criminal charges. His choice of virtual anonymity\nwould be undermined by releasing his identity under FOIA, as\nreleasing it to one person is equivalent to authorizing its release\nto anyone.\n\n     Accordingly, with a strong privacy interest in non-disclo-\nsure being weighed against a de minimis public interest in the\ndisclosure, the invasion of privacy resulting from the release of\nthe student’s name would be “clearly unwarranted.” The Peace\nCorps may therefore withhold the student’s name under Exemp-\ntion 6.\n\n                                III\n\n     We turn now to the Privacy Act, which requires any\n“agency that maintains a system of records” to allow a request-\ning individual to review and make a copy of “his record or . . .\nany information pertaining to him which is contained in the\nsystem.” 5 U.S.C. § 552a(d)(1). The agency must show the\nabsence of a genuine issue of any material fact in order to be\ngranted summary judgment. Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). “Rule 56(c)\nmandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time\nfor discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to\nmake a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an\nelement essential to that party’s case, and on which that party\nwill bear the burden of proof at trial.” Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,\n477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986). The district court held that Horowitz\nwas not entitled to the document under the Privacy Act because\nthe document is neither maintained, nor required to be main-\n\f                                15\n\ntained, in a “system of records.” This ruling is unassailable. The\nPeace Corps’s regulations dictate that an ASR should not be\nmaintained in the agency’s records if a volunteer resigns prior\nto an official decision to administratively separate him. In fact,\nthe Peace Corps’s manual states that an ASR should not even be\ncompleted if a volunteer resigns before such a decision is made.\nSince Horowitz resigned before any final decision was made, the\nreport was never completed and—pursuant to the procedure\nspecified by the manual—was not maintained in the Peace\nCorps’s official files.\n\n     Nor has Horowitz shown that Giron nevertheless placed the\ndraft ASR in a “system of records.” The Act defines “system of\nrecords” to mean “a group of any records under the control of\nany agency from which information is retrieved by the name of\nthe individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other\nidentifying particular assigned to the individual.” 5 U.S.C.\n§ 552a(a)(5). We have held that the words “is retrieved”\n“suggest strongly that a group of records should generally not be\nconsidered a system of records unless there is actual retrieval of\nrecords keyed to individuals.” Henke v. U.S. Dep’t of Com-\nmerce, 83 F.3d 1453, 1460 (D.C. Cir. 1996). In the district court,\nthe Peace Corps presented affidavits from two of its officials\nstating that they had searched the Peace Corps’s records and had\nfound no ASR regarding Horowitz. Horowitz presented no\nevidence to counter this assertion. He alleges a copy of the draft\nASR was stored in Giron’s safe for some period of time, a\ncontention the Peace Corps does not deny, and also claims the\ndraft ASR was retrieved by his name at least one time. That\n“retrieval,” however, occurred when Giron e-mailed the draft\nASR to headquarters, and thus involved an electronic copy, not\nthe physical document in the safe. Horowitz has not shown that\nfiles in the safe are, in practice, retrieved by individuals’ names;\nhence, he has not “establish[ed] the existence of an element\nessential to his case,” namely, whether the safe qualifies as a\n\f                                 16\n\nsystem of records. The district court properly granted summary\njudgment to the Peace Corps on the ground that the document is\nnot subject to release under the Privacy Act.3\n\n     Finally, we note that because the document is predecisional,\nit can attest to nothing. It has no official existence and continues\nto be held only because of pending litigation. In fact, the Peace\nCorps indicated at oral argument that the document will be\ndestroyed once it is no longer needed in relation to Horowitz’s\nvarious civil suits.\n\n                                 IV\n\n     Horowitz raises several other points on appeal. First, he\nclaims that the district court abused its discretion in choosing to\nreview a copy of the draft ASR in camera after conducting the\nevidentiary hearing. A court “may examine the contents of such\nagency records in camera to determine whether such records or\nany part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions”\nwhich apply to FOIA. 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(B). The decision of\nwhether to conduct an in camera review of a document is within\nthe trial court’s “broad discretion” and is reviewed only for\nabuse of discretion. Spirko v. U.S. Postal Serv., 147 F.3d 992,\n996 (D.C. Cir. 1998). Horowitz claims reviewing a document\ncontaining such disturbing allegations necessarily prejudiced the\ndistrict court judge against him. However, he points to no\ncredible evidence relating to this claim or to any abuse of\ndiscretion in reviewing the document. Indeed, the district court\nrefused the Peace Corps’s request to view the document at an\n\n\n     3\n      The status of the copy of the draft ASR that Giron e-mailed to\nheadquarters is not before us. Horowitz has not argued that the Peace\nCorps’s e-mail system qualifies as a “system of records” under the\nPrivacy Act. Our ruling is confined solely to the copy of the ASR that\nwas stored in Giron’s safe.\n\f                                 17\n\nearlier point in the proceeding, choosing instead to wait until\nafter the evidentiary hearing to do so. Horowitz’s claim on this\npoint is without merit.\n\n      Additionally, Horowitz now claims the Fifth and Sixth\nAmendments, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act,\nentitle him to know the allegations contained in the draft ASR.\n“It is well settled that issues and legal theories not asserted at the\nDistrict Court level ordinarily will not be heard on appeal.”\nDistrict of Columbia v. Air Fla., Inc., 750 F.2d 1077, 1084 (D.C.\nCir. 1984). At the same time, “[t]here may always be excep-\ntional cases or particular circumstances which will prompt a\nreviewing or appellate court, where injustice might otherwise\nresult, to consider questions of law which were neither pressed\nnor passed upon by the court or administrative agency below.”\nHormel v. Helvering, 312 U.S. 552, 557 (1941). Horowitz\npresents no compelling reason why he was not able to present\nthese issues in the district court; therefore, he may not assert\nthese claims on appeal.\n\n     Finally, Horowitz claims the district court abused its\ndiscretion in two ways: by denying his motion to present more\nevidence after the court’s ruling was entered, and by adopting\nthe Peace Corps’s findings of fact. “[U]pon such terms as are\njust,” Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) allows a party to be\nrelieved from a final judgment due to, among other reasons,\nmistake, surprise, or misconduct of an adverse party. We review\nthe denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion unless\nthe decision was rooted in an error of law. Andrx Pharm. Inc. v.\nBiovail Corp. Int’l, 256 F.3d 799, 805 (D.C. Cir. 2001).\nHorowitz points to no misconduct on the part of Peace Corps’s\ncounsel, nor does he explain why any surprise was unjust rather\nthan a result of a mistake by his attorney. Similarly, Horowitz’s\nexamples of “clear error” in the findings adopted by the court\nare either immaterial or based on evidence that the court found\n\f                              18\n\nto be more credible than the evidence Horowitz presented.\nHence, Horowitz has not shown that the district court abused its\ndiscretion in either instance.\n\n                               V\n\n     For the above reasons, we hold that the Peace Corps may\nwithhold the student’s identity from release under FOIA\nExemption 6. In all other respects, we affirm the judgments of\nthe district court.\n\n                                                    So ordered.\n\f",

Horowitz also appeals the district court's denial of his request for access to the same document under the Privacy Act. Finally, the Peace Corps appeals the denial of its attempt to protect the name of the complainant under FOIA Exemption 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude the district court properly exempted the draft document from release under FOIA Exemption 5 and properly found the document was not part of a system of records subject to disclosure under the Privacy Act. However, we conclude FOIA Exemption 6 also applies; therefore, the name of the alleged victim is not subject to release as a segregable fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* From 1998 to 2001, Arturo Giron was Peace Corps Country Director for the Kingdom of Tonga; his duties included supervision of Peace Corps volunteers stationed in Tonga. On March 7, 1999, a female volunteer told Giron a young Tongan man claimed he had been the victim of sexual misconduct involving Michael Horowitz. The young man, a student at 'Atenisi High School, was 18 or 19 years old and appeared to have been under 18 at the time of the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giron consulted the Peace Corps Manual and contacted the General Counsel's office for advice. He also interviewed the Tongan student, who repeated substantially the same allegations. Giron and Sally Olsonoski, another Peace Corps worker, then met with Horowitz. Horowitz remembered the incident but explained that the encounter was consensual and assured Giron the student had been 18 years old at the time. Olsonoski testified that Horowitz said, \"I always card them,\" but acknowledged that it was difficult to do so in a foreign country. Giron again sought assistance from the General Counsel's office, stating in an e-mail that \"[t]here is no clear age of majority [in Tonga], but homosexual acts are illegal under the law here.\" Giron confessed he was \"now completely confused about how to proceed,\" and requested guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a week of receiving the volunteer's report, Giron prepared \"a single, cohesive document\" that summarized his investigations and notes from various meetings, and generally outlined the events and the actions he had taken. He used the computer template designed for creating ASRs but completed only three of the template's five sections. At that point, according to Giron, \"no final decision had been made with respect to the incident and the volunteer involved. We were still in the process of deliberating.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 1999, Giron e-mailed the document to senior officials at Peace Corps headquarters, asking them to review the draft and submit changes and comments. Later that day, Horowitz informed Giron that he was resigning from the Peace Corps. Horowitz now claims he resigned only after Giron read parts of the draft ASR to him, told him a final decision to administratively separate him had been made, and informed him that the ASR would be sent to headquarters unless Horowitz resigned. Giron denies ever making a final decision or informing Horowitz that he had done so. At Horowitz's request, however, Giron kept the draft ASR in his office safe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 18, 1999, Horowitz requested a copy of the draft ASR through FOIA, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552. The Peace Corps denied his request on August 17, 1999. On November 15, 1999, Horowitz administratively appealed the denial, but the Peace Corps again denied his request on April 19, 2000. Horowitz then filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking disclosure of the draft ASR under FOIA and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552a. The Peace Corps contended the draft ASR was a predecisional document exempt from release under FOIA and that releasing the student's name would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of his privacy. The Peace Corps also argued the document was not contained in a system of records and thus was not subject to release under the Privacy Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted partial summary judgment to the Peace Corps, ruling that the document was not subject to release under the Privacy Act, and partial summary judgment to Horowitz, ruling that release of the student's name would not be a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy under FOIA. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court ruled in favor of the Peace Corps, allowing the document to be withheld as predecisional. However, the court confirmed that the identity of the student was a segregable fact that must be released to Horowitz; release of the name was stayed pending this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review orders granting summary judgment <i>de novo.

The statute also provides a list of exemptions from this command. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b). \"[T]he burden is on the agency to sustain its action\" in claiming these exemptions. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a)(4)(B). Exemption 5 allows agencies to withhold \"inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(5). This exemption privileges \"those documents, and only those documents, normally privileged in the civil discovery context.\" <i>NLRB v.

The evidence before the court included section 284 of the Peace Corps Manual, which outlines the required process for early termination of service of Peace Corps volunteers; the depositions of Giron and Horowitz; and the testimony of Giron, Horowitz, and Sally Olsonoski at the evidentiary hearing. The manual authorizes administrative separation for conduct ranging from minor infractions like failing to wear a motorcycle helmet, to criminal convictions, to espionage. Under these provisions, the volunteer is entitled to be informed of the specific conduct at issue, have an opportunity to respond, and be apprised of the alternative of resignation. The disciplinary options range from taking no action, to imposing conditions on further service, to administrative separation. If a volunteer resigns before a final decision to terminate him is made, the ASR is not completed. If the volunteer resigns \"after the decision to administratively separate has been made but before the process is completed, the Administrative Separation Report must be completed and forwarded\" to the Peace Corps's Office of Volunteer Services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the evidentiary hearing, Giron and Olsonoski testified that no final decision was ever made to administratively separate Horowitz. Giron testified it was \"the first time [he] had encountered [so serious] an incident,\" and it was his first experience with an administrative separation. He sought further guidance from senior staff in Tonga and consulted on a daily basis with Peace Corps headquarters, the Office of the General Counsel, and regional senior staff. He spent \"literally hours and hours on the telephone with Washington, D.C., talking to the [G]eneral [C]ounsel.\" On March 16, 1999, prior to the meeting where Horowitz announced his intention to resign, Giron e-mailed the draft document to headquarters with a cover e-mail that asked the recipients to \"review and send comments/changes to Sally [Olsonoski].\" Giron asked that comments be sent to Olsonoski because he had to leave Tonga to attend a funeral and he anticipated that she would need to make the final decision in his absence. Giron testified that he had reached no final decision prior to the time Horowitz announced his intention to resign, and that he was unwilling to make a unilateral decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hatever final disposition was going to be reached on this case was going to be a consensus among all the senior officials involved, myself included, but also the [O]ffice of the [G]eneral [C]ounsel and the senior staff of the region, and we had not at that point come to any particular consensus as to which course of action we were going to follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Giron's testimony, at no time did Giron tell Horowitz that he had made a decision to administratively separate him or that he was on the verge of doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giron explained that, complying with the provisions of section 284, he never completed or officially filed the draft ASR he was crafting. He believed \"the opportunity to `think aloud' in such a draft document\" was \"an essential part\" of the section 284 decision-making process; in his opinion, making such documents publicly available would deter Country Directors from creating them and deprive such officials of the benefit of review and comment from other departments. Horowitz argues, however, that the document lost its predecisional status by being adopted as the official agency position regarding his administrative separation; in essence, he contends that Giron had already decided to terminate his service before he resigned, even though the decision was not formally executed. After evaluating the witnesses' testimony and credibility, the district court concluded Giron had not made a final decision about separating Horowitz. The document was prepared as an aid for Giron's decision-making process and for consultation with other Peace Corps officials. Hence, the document qualified as deliberative and predecisional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded the district court's findings on these points are clearly erroneous. The draft is remarkably candid. Moreover, Giron's thought processes are woven into the document to such an extent that any attempt to segregate non-deliberative portions would effectively disclose the content and context of intra-agency deliberations. Accordingly, as the document did not lose its predecisional and deliberative status, it was properly withheld under FOIA Exemption 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In providing exemptions from the general requirement of disclosure, FOIA also provides that \"[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b). Thus, the district court correctly concluded the student's name, which could be segregated, was not protected from disclosure by Exemption 5. That conclusion does not fully resolve the question of whether the student's name is nevertheless exempt from disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOIA Exemption 6 allows agencies to withhold \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(6). Horowitz agrees that the ASR qualifies as a \"similar file\" as described in Exemption 6; thus, the remaining question is whether the release of the ASR &#8212; specifically, the portions identifying the student &#8212; would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of the student's privacy. In the district court, the Peace Corps argued Exemption 6 should apply; however, as counsel for the Peace Corps acknowledged during oral argument, the Corps's desire to be discreet and shield the privacy interests of all parties may have led the district court to underestimate the private interest and overstate the public benefit at issue. Horowitz's lack of reticence has allowed the Peace Corps to correct this defect on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether release of a file would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, we must balance the private interest involved (namely, \"the individual's right of privacy\") against the public interest (namely, \"the basic purpose of the Freedom of Information Act,\" which is \"to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny\"). <i>Dep't of the Air Force v.

Furthermore, \"clear evidence is usually required to displace\" the presumption and show the presence of a public interest in investigating an agency. <i>Favish,</i> 541 U.S. at 174, 124 S.Ct. 1570.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The public interest in this case is virtually nonexistent. Horowitz alleges the Peace Corps mistreated him, and that revealing the student's name will allow investigation of the agency's actions. However, he offered no credible evidence of misconduct by the Peace Corps; the district court found Giron's testimony \"forthright\" and Horowitz's testimony \"continually evasive.\" Horowitz's real complaint is that he had to choose between two unpalatable alternatives. It is difficult to see how the Peace Corps's long-established procedure of allowing volunteers to resign rather than face public charges of misconduct could be deemed improper. Horowitz simply alleges that in order to prove the Peace Corps's perfidy, \"it may be necessary to confirm the relation of Complainant, if any, to the Kingdom of Tonga's political, military, and/or criminal factions.\" Appellant's Reply Br. at 44. Horowitz offers no further details to support these extremely speculative allegations; he has not offered the \"clear evidence\" required to overcome the presumption that the Peace Corps's official conduct was proper.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In no way would release of the student's name serve the civic good. Additionally, Horowitz's need to obtain the information for a pending civil suit is irrelevant, as the public interest to be weighed has nothing to do with Horowitz's personal situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The privacy interest implicated in a case such as this is the individual's right to \"avoid[ ] disclosure of personal matters.\" <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 762, 109 S.Ct. 1468 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Under Exemption 6, \"the fact that an event is not wholly private does not mean that an individual has no interest in limiting disclosure or dissemination of the information,\" <i>id.</i> at 770, 109 S.Ct. 1468 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted), as \"there are few facts that are not at one time or another divulged to another,\" <i>id.</i> at 763, 109 S.Ct. 1468.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even seemingly innocuous information can be enough to trigger the protections of Exemption 6. In <i>United States Department of Defense v. Federal Labor Relations Authority,</i> the Supreme Court held Exemption 6 shielded the names and home addresses of agency employees from being released to unions that requested the lists under FOIA. 510 U.S. 487, 502, 114 S.Ct. 1006, 127 L.Ed.2d 325 (1994). Because \"[m]any people simply do not want to be disturbed at home by work-related matters,\" the Court was \"reluctant to disparage the privacy of the home, which is accorded special consideration in our Constitution, laws, and traditions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 501, 114 S.Ct. 1006. Additionally, \"other parties, such as commercial advertisers and solicitors, must have the same access under FOIA as the unions\"; releasing the lists to the unions would have necessitated giving other parties access as well. <i>Id.</i> Thus, the Court found that the privacy interests outweighed the \"negligible\" public interest at stake. <i>Id.</i> at 502, 114 S.Ct. 1006.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scope of privacy protection under FOIA is not the same as in the constitutional context, <i>Reporters Comm.,</i> 489 U.S. at 762 n. 13, 109 S.Ct. 1468, although being \"accorded special consideration in our Constitution, laws, and traditions\" can give additional weight to a privacy interest. <i>U.S. Dep't of Def.,</i> 510 U.S. at 501, 114 S.Ct. 1006. Hence, even if the incident between Horowitz and the student was consensual, the student might have a privacy interest in avoiding disclosure of his identity. <i>See generally Lawrence v. Texas,</i> 539 U.S. 558, 567, 123 S.Ct. 2472, 156 L.Ed.2d 508 (2003) (stating that sexual behavior is \"the most private human conduct\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Victims of sexual assaults have an arguably greater interest in the protection of their privacy. For example, the Sixth Circuit has reasoned that the occurrence of a rape \"implicates both a private and a public interest, but the details of the rape primarily implicate a private interest until such time as the public interest in prosecution predominates.\" <i>Bloch v. Ribar,</i> 156 F.3d 673, 685-86 (6th Cir.1998). The private interest in nondisclosure may predominate in such a case because of the personal trauma involved and the moral and social opprobrium disclosure often presages. The \"interest in protecting the victims of sexual violence from humiliation, among other injuries, has prompted states to pass rape shield laws and to advocate against the publication of rape victims' names.\" <i>Id.</i> at 685. Similarly, Federal Rule of Evidence 412 limits the admissibility of evidence regarding the past sexual behavior or predispositions of an alleged victim of a sexual offense. \"The rule aims to safeguard the alleged victim against the invasion of privacy, potential embarrassment and sexual stereotyping that is associated with public disclosure of intimate sexual details and the infusion of sexual innuendo into the factfinding process.\" Fed.R.Evid. 412 advisory committee's note.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Hunt v. FBI,</i> the Ninth Circuit held that the FBI should not release files from its internal investigation of an agent who had been accused of sexual misconduct; even if the agent's name was redacted from the files, she would have been identifiable based on other information in the files. 972 F.2d 286 (9th Cir.1992). Although <i>Hunt</i> involved Exemption 7(C), under which only a reasonable expectation of an invasion of privacy must be shown to prevent releasing information, the court's reasoning is still relevant. That court found identification of the agent could have caused her \"great personal and professional embarrassment,\" while not serving a significant public interest, as \"[t]he single file sought . . . will not shed any light on whether all such FBI investigations are comprehensive or whether sexual misconduct by agents is common.\" <i>Id.</i> at 288-89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we do not confront the constitutional question that was before the Sixth Circuit in <i>Bloch,</i> the reasoning of the court aptly describes the contours of the public/private balance at stake here. We are persuaded that the student's interest in avoiding disclosure of his name is at least as strong as the privacy interest of a government agent accused of sexual misconduct, and that it is certainly as strong as the interest of federal employees in avoiding disclosure of their names and addresses. If released, the student's name would be associated not merely with an employer, or even personal sexual misconduct, but with a disputed sexual incident that he claims was not consensual. Even though the student did reveal his allegation to two Peace Corps workers, and did not receive an explicit promise of confidentiality, he still has an interest in avoiding further dissemination of his identity. Our law uniformly recognizes that strong privacy interests are implicated when dealing with an individual's sexual activity, especially when the individual has reported a sexual assault. Unwanted public attention could lead to further trauma for the victim, who in this case did not even choose to subject himself to public scrutiny by pursuing criminal charges. His choice of virtual anonymity would be undermined by releasing his identity under FOIA, as releasing it to one person is equivalent to authorizing its release to anyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, with a strong privacy interest in non-disclosure being weighed against a <i>de minimis</i> public interest in the disclosure, the invasion of privacy resulting from the release of the student's name would be \"clearly unwarranted.\" The Peace Corps may therefore withhold the student's name under Exemption 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the Privacy Act, which requires any \"agency that maintains a system of records\" to allow a requesting individual to review and make a copy of \"his record or . . . any information pertaining to him which is contained in the system.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552a(d)(1). The agency must show the absence of a genuine issue of any material fact in order to be granted summary judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \"Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\" <i>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). The district court held that Horowitz was not entitled to the document under the Privacy Act because the document is neither maintained, nor required to be maintained, in a \"system of records.\" This ruling is unassailable. The Peace Corps's regulations dictate that an ASR should not be maintained in the agency's records if a volunteer resigns prior to an official decision to administratively separate him. In fact, the Peace Corps's manual states that an ASR should not even be completed if a volunteer resigns before such a decision is made. Since Horowitz resigned before any final decision was made, the report was never completed and &#8212; pursuant to the procedure specified by the manual &#8212; was not maintained in the Peace Corps's official files.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor has Horowitz shown that Giron nevertheless placed the draft ASR in a \"system of records.\" The Act defines \"system of records\" to mean \"a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552a(a)(5). We have held that the words \"is retrieved\" \"suggest strongly that a group of records should generally not be considered a system of records unless there is actual retrieval of records keyed to individuals.\" <i>Henke v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce,</i> 83 F.3d 1453, 1460 (D.C.Cir.1996). In the district court, the Peace Corps presented affidavits from two of its officials stating that they had searched the Peace Corps's records and had found no ASR regarding Horowitz. Horowitz presented no evidence to counter this assertion. He alleges a copy of the draft ASR was stored in Giron's safe for some period of time, a contention the Peace Corps does not deny, and also claims the draft ASR was retrieved by his name at least one time. That \"retrieval,\" however, occurred when Giron e-mailed the draft ASR to headquarters, and thus involved an electronic copy, not the physical document in the safe. Horowitz has not shown that files in the safe are, in practice, retrieved by individuals' names; hence, he has not \"establish[ed] the existence of an element essential to his case,\" namely, whether the safe qualifies as a system of records. The district court properly granted summary judgment to the Peace Corps on the ground that the document is not subject to release under the Privacy Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that because the document is predecisional, it can attest to nothing. It has no official existence and continues to be held only because of pending litigation. In fact, the Peace Corps indicated at oral argument that the document will be destroyed once it is no longer needed in relation to Horowitz's various civil suits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horowitz raises several other points on appeal. First, he claims that the district court abused its discretion in choosing to review a copy of the draft ASR in camera after conducting the evidentiary hearing. A court \"may examine the contents of such agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions\" which apply to FOIA. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a)(4)(B). The decision of whether to conduct an in camera review of a document is within the trial court's \"broad discretion\" and is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <i>Spirko v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> 147 F.3d 992, 996 (D.C.Cir.1998). Horowitz claims reviewing a document containing such disturbing allegations necessarily prejudiced the district court judge against him. However, he points to no credible evidence relating to this claim or to any abuse of discretion in reviewing the document. Indeed, the district court refused the Peace Corps's request to view the document at an earlier point in the proceeding, choosing instead to wait until after the evidentiary hearing to do so. Horowitz's claim on this point is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Horowitz now claims the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act, entitle him to know the allegations contained in the draft ASR. \"It is well settled that issues and legal theories not asserted at the District Court level ordinarily will not be heard on appeal.\" <i>District of Columbia v. Air Fla., Inc.,</i> 750 F.2d 1077, 1084 (D.C.Cir.1984). At the same time, \"[t]here may always be exceptional cases or particular circumstances which will prompt a reviewing or appellate court, where injustice might otherwise result, to consider questions of law which were neither pressed nor passed upon by the court or administrative agency below.\" <i>Hormel v. Helvering,</i> 312 U.S. 552, 557, 61 S.Ct. 719, 85 L.Ed. 1037 (1941). Horowitz presents no compelling reason why he was not able to present these issues in the district court; therefore, he may not assert these claims on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Horowitz claims the district court abused its discretion in two ways: by denying his motion to present more evidence after the court's ruling was entered, and by adopting the Peace Corps's findings of fact. \"[U]pon such terms as are just,\" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) allows a party to be relieved from a final judgment due to, among other reasons, mistake, surprise, or misconduct of an adverse party. We review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion unless the decision was rooted in an error of law. <i>Andrx Pharm. Inc. v. Biovail Corp. Int'l,</i> 256 F.3d 799, 805 (D.C.Cir.2001). Horowitz points to no misconduct on the part of Peace Corps's counsel, nor does he explain why any surprise was unjust rather than a result of a mistake by his attorney. Similarly, Horowitz's examples of \"clear error\" in the findings adopted by the court are either immaterial or based on evidence that the court found to be more credible than the evidence Horowitz presented. Hence, Horowitz has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in either instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, we hold that the Peace Corps may withhold the student's identity from release under FOIA Exemption 6.

Horowitz also appeals the district court's denial of his request for access to the same document under the Privacy Act. Finally, the Peace Corps appeals the denial of its attempt to protect the name of the complainant under FOIA Exemption 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude the district court properly exempted the draft document from release under FOIA Exemption 5 and properly found the document was not part of a system of records subject to disclosure under the Privacy Act.

On March 7, 1999, a female volunteer told Giron a young Tongan man claimed he had been the victim of sexual misconduct involving Michael Horowitz. The young man, a student at 'Atenisi High School, was 18 or 19 years old and appeared to have been under 18 at the time of the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giron consulted the Peace Corps Manual and contacted the General Counsel's office for advice. He also interviewed the Tongan student, who repeated substantially the same allegations. Giron and Sally Olsonoski, another Peace Corps worker, then met with Horowitz. Horowitz remembered the incident but explained that the encounter was consensual and assured Giron the student had been 18 years old at the time. Olsonoski testified that Horowitz said, \"I always card them,\" but acknowledged that it was difficult to do so in a foreign country. Giron again sought assistance from the General Counsel's office, stating in an e-mail that \"[t]here is no clear age of majority [in Tonga], but homosexual acts are illegal under the law here.\" Giron confessed he was \"now completely confused about how to proceed,\" and requested guidance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within a week of receiving the volunteer's report, Giron prepared \"a single, cohesive document\" that summarized his investigations and notes from various meetings, and generally outlined the events and the actions he had taken. He used the computer template designed for creating ASRs but completed only three of the template's five sections. At that point, according to Giron, \"no final decision had been made with respect to the incident and the volunteer involved. We were still in the process of deliberating.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 16, 1999, Giron e-mailed the document to senior officials at Peace Corps headquarters, asking them to review the draft and submit changes and comments. Later that day, Horowitz informed Giron that he was resigning from the Peace Corps. Horowitz now claims he resigned only after Giron read parts of the draft ASR to him, told him a final decision to administratively separate him had been made, and informed him that the ASR would be sent to headquarters unless Horowitz resigned. Giron denies ever making a final decision or informing Horowitz that he had done so. At Horowitz's request, however, Giron kept the draft ASR in his office safe.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 18, 1999, Horowitz requested a copy of the draft ASR through FOIA, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552. The Peace Corps denied his request on August 17, 1999. On November 15, 1999, Horowitz administratively appealed the denial, but the Peace Corps again denied his request on April 19, 2000. Horowitz then filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, seeking disclosure of the draft ASR under FOIA and the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552a. The Peace Corps contended the draft ASR was a predecisional document exempt from release under FOIA and that releasing the student's name would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of his privacy. The Peace Corps also argued the document was not contained in a system of records and thus was not subject to release under the Privacy Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted partial summary judgment to the Peace Corps, ruling that the document was not subject to release under the Privacy Act, and partial summary judgment to Horowitz, ruling that release of the student's name would not be a clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy under FOIA. After an evidentiary hearing, the district court ruled in favor of the Peace Corps, allowing the document to be withheld as predecisional. However, the court confirmed that the identity of the student was a segregable fact that must be released to Horowitz; release of the name was stayed pending this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review orders granting summary judgment <i>de novo.

The evidence before the court included section 284 of the Peace Corps Manual, which outlines the required process for early termination of service of Peace Corps volunteers; the depositions of Giron and Horowitz; and the testimony of Giron, Horowitz, and Sally Olsonoski at the evidentiary hearing. The manual authorizes administrative separation for conduct ranging from minor infractions like failing to wear a motorcycle helmet, to criminal convictions, to espionage. Under these provisions, the volunteer is entitled to be informed of the specific conduct at issue, have an opportunity to respond, and be apprised of the alternative of resignation. The disciplinary options range from taking no action, to imposing conditions on further service, to administrative separation. If a volunteer resigns before a final decision to terminate him is made, the ASR is not completed. If the volunteer resigns \"after the decision to administratively separate has been made but before the process is completed, the Administrative Separation Report must be completed and forwarded\" to the Peace Corps's Office of Volunteer Services.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the evidentiary hearing, Giron and Olsonoski testified that no final decision was ever made to administratively separate Horowitz. Giron testified it was \"the first time [he] had encountered [so serious] an incident,\" and it was his first experience with an administrative separation. He sought further guidance from senior staff in Tonga and consulted on a daily basis with Peace Corps headquarters, the Office of the General Counsel, and regional senior staff. He spent \"literally hours and hours on the telephone with Washington, D.C., talking to the [G]eneral [C]ounsel.\" On March 16, 1999, prior to the meeting where Horowitz announced his intention to resign, Giron e-mailed the draft document to headquarters with a cover e-mail that asked the recipients to \"review and send comments/changes to Sally [Olsonoski].\" Giron asked that comments be sent to Olsonoski because he had to leave Tonga to attend a funeral and he anticipated that she would need to make the final decision in his absence. Giron testified that he had reached no final decision prior to the time Horowitz announced his intention to resign, and that he was unwilling to make a unilateral decision:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[W]hatever final disposition was going to be reached on this case was going to be a consensus among all the senior officials involved, myself included, but also the [O]ffice of the [G]eneral [C]ounsel and the senior staff of the region, and we had not at that point come to any particular consensus as to which course of action we were going to follow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Giron's testimony, at no time did Giron tell Horowitz that he had made a decision to administratively separate him or that he was on the verge of doing so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Giron explained that, complying with the provisions of section 284, he never completed or officially filed the draft ASR he was crafting. He believed \"the opportunity to `think aloud' in such a draft document\" was \"an essential part\" of the section 284 decision-making process; in his opinion, making such documents publicly available would deter Country Directors from creating them and deprive such officials of the benefit of review and comment from other departments. Horowitz argues, however, that the document lost its predecisional status by being adopted as the official agency position regarding his administrative separation; in essence, he contends that Giron had already decided to terminate his service before he resigned, even though the decision was not formally executed. After evaluating the witnesses' testimony and credibility, the district court concluded Giron had not made a final decision about separating Horowitz. The document was prepared as an aid for Giron's decision-making process and for consultation with other Peace Corps officials. Hence, the document qualified as deliberative and predecisional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are not persuaded the district court's findings on these points are clearly erroneous. The draft is remarkably candid. Moreover, Giron's thought processes are woven into the document to such an extent that any attempt to segregate non-deliberative portions would effectively disclose the content and context of intra-agency deliberations. Accordingly, as the document did not lose its predecisional and deliberative status, it was properly withheld under FOIA Exemption 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In providing exemptions from the general requirement of disclosure, FOIA also provides that \"[a]ny reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b). Thus, the district court correctly concluded the student's name, which could be segregated, was not protected from disclosure by Exemption 5. That conclusion does not fully resolve the question of whether the student's name is nevertheless exempt from disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">FOIA Exemption 6 allows agencies to withhold \"personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(b)(6). Horowitz agrees that the ASR qualifies as a \"similar file\" as described in Exemption 6; thus, the remaining question is whether the release of the ASR &#8212; specifically, the portions identifying the student &#8212; would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of the student's privacy. In the district court, the Peace Corps argued Exemption 6 should apply; however, as counsel for the Peace Corps acknowledged during oral argument, the Corps's desire to be discreet and shield the privacy interests of all parties may have led the district court to underestimate the private interest and overstate the public benefit at issue. Horowitz's lack of reticence has allowed the Peace Corps to correct this defect on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To determine whether release of a file would result in a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, we must balance the private interest involved (namely, \"the individual's right of privacy\") against the public interest (namely, \"the basic purpose of the Freedom of Information Act,\" which is \"to open agency action to the light of public scrutiny\"). <i>Dep't of the Air Force v.

It is difficult to see how the Peace Corps's long-established procedure of allowing volunteers to resign rather than face public charges of misconduct could be deemed improper.

Although <i>Hunt</i> involved Exemption 7(C), under which only a reasonable expectation of an invasion of privacy must be shown to prevent releasing information, the court's reasoning is still relevant. That court found identification of the agent could have caused her \"great personal and professional embarrassment,\" while not serving a significant public interest, as \"[t]he single file sought . . . will not shed any light on whether all such FBI investigations are comprehensive or whether sexual misconduct by agents is common.\" <i>Id.</i> at 288-89.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we do not confront the constitutional question that was before the Sixth Circuit in <i>Bloch,</i> the reasoning of the court aptly describes the contours of the public/private balance at stake here. We are persuaded that the student's interest in avoiding disclosure of his name is at least as strong as the privacy interest of a government agent accused of sexual misconduct, and that it is certainly as strong as the interest of federal employees in avoiding disclosure of their names and addresses. If released, the student's name would be associated not merely with an employer, or even personal sexual misconduct, but with a disputed sexual incident that he claims was not consensual. Even though the student did reveal his allegation to two Peace Corps workers, and did not receive an explicit promise of confidentiality, he still has an interest in avoiding further dissemination of his identity. Our law uniformly recognizes that strong privacy interests are implicated when dealing with an individual's sexual activity, especially when the individual has reported a sexual assault. Unwanted public attention could lead to further trauma for the victim, who in this case did not even choose to subject himself to public scrutiny by pursuing criminal charges. His choice of virtual anonymity would be undermined by releasing his identity under FOIA, as releasing it to one person is equivalent to authorizing its release to anyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, with a strong privacy interest in non-disclosure being weighed against a <i>de minimis</i> public interest in the disclosure, the invasion of privacy resulting from the release of the student's name would be \"clearly unwarranted.\" The Peace Corps may therefore withhold the student's name under Exemption 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn now to the Privacy Act, which requires any \"agency that maintains a system of records\" to allow a requesting individual to review and make a copy of \"his record or . . . any information pertaining to him which is contained in the system.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552a(d)(1). The agency must show the absence of a genuine issue of any material fact in order to be granted summary judgment. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \"Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery and upon motion, against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\" <i>Celotex Corp. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span> (1986). The district court held that Horowitz was not entitled to the document under the Privacy Act because the document is neither maintained, nor required to be maintained, in a \"system of records.\" This ruling is unassailable. The Peace Corps's regulations dictate that an ASR should not be maintained in the agency's records if a volunteer resigns prior to an official decision to administratively separate him. In fact, the Peace Corps's manual states that an ASR should not even be completed if a volunteer resigns before such a decision is made. Since Horowitz resigned before any final decision was made, the report was never completed and &#8212; pursuant to the procedure specified by the manual &#8212; was not maintained in the Peace Corps's official files.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor has Horowitz shown that Giron nevertheless placed the draft ASR in a \"system of records.\" The Act defines \"system of records\" to mean \"a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other identifying particular assigned to the individual.\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552a(a)(5). We have held that the words \"is retrieved\" \"suggest strongly that a group of records should generally not be considered a system of records unless there is actual retrieval of records keyed to individuals.\" <i>Henke v. U.S. Dep't of Commerce,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"718314\"><a href=\"/opinion/718314/wanda-henke-v-united-states-department-of-commerce-and-national-science/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1453</span></a></span>, 1460 (D.C.Cir.1996). In the district court, the Peace Corps presented affidavits from two of its officials stating that they had searched the Peace Corps's records and had found no ASR regarding Horowitz. Horowitz presented no evidence to counter this assertion. He alleges a copy of the draft ASR was stored in Giron's safe for some period of time, a contention the Peace Corps does not deny, and also claims the draft ASR was retrieved by his name at least one time. That \"retrieval,\" however, occurred when Giron e-mailed the draft ASR to headquarters, and thus involved an electronic copy, not the physical document in the safe. Horowitz has not shown that files in the safe are, in practice, retrieved by individuals' names; hence, he has not \"establish[ed] the existence of an element essential to his case,\" namely, whether the safe qualifies as a system of records. The district court properly granted summary judgment to the Peace Corps on the ground that the document is not subject to release under the Privacy Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that because the document is predecisional, it can attest to nothing. It has no official existence and continues to be held only because of pending litigation. In fact, the Peace Corps indicated at oral argument that the document will be destroyed once it is no longer needed in relation to Horowitz's various civil suits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Horowitz raises several other points on appeal. First, he claims that the district court abused its discretion in choosing to review a copy of the draft ASR in camera after conducting the evidentiary hearing. A court \"may examine the contents of such agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions\" which apply to FOIA. 5 U.S.C. &#167; 552(a)(4)(B). The decision of whether to conduct an in camera review of a document is within the trial court's \"broad discretion\" and is reviewed only for abuse of discretion. <i>Spirko v. U.S. Postal Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184617\"><a href=\"/opinion/184617/spirko-john-g-v-usps/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span>, 996 (D.C.Cir.1998). Horowitz claims reviewing a document containing such disturbing allegations necessarily prejudiced the district court judge against him. However, he points to no credible evidence relating to this claim or to any abuse of discretion in reviewing the document. Indeed, the district court refused the Peace Corps's request to view the document at an earlier point in the proceeding, choosing instead to wait until after the evidentiary hearing to do so. Horowitz's claim on this point is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, Horowitz now claims the Fifth and Sixth Amendments, as well as the Administrative Procedure Act, entitle him to know the allegations contained in the draft ASR. \"It is well settled that issues and legal theories not asserted at the District Court level ordinarily will not be heard on appeal.\" <i>District of Columbia v. Air Fla., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"445562\"><a href=\"/opinion/445562/district-of-columbia-a-municipal-corporation-v-air-florida-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">750</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1077</span></a></span>, 1084 (D.C.Cir.1984). At the same time, \"[t]here may always be exceptional cases or particular circumstances which will prompt a reviewing or appellate court, where injustice might otherwise result, to consider questions of law which were neither pressed nor passed upon by the court or administrative agency below.\" <i>Hormel v. Helvering,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103487\"><a href=\"/opinion/103487/hormel-v-helvering/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">552</span></a></span>, 557, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103487\"><a href=\"/opinion/103487/hormel-v-helvering/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103487\"><a href=\"/opinion/103487/hormel-v-helvering/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1037</span></a></span> (1941). Horowitz presents no compelling reason why he was not able to present these issues in the district court; therefore, he may not assert these claims on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Horowitz claims the district court abused its discretion in two ways: by denying his motion to present more evidence after the court's ruling was entered, and by adopting the Peace Corps's findings of fact. \"[U]pon such terms as are just,\" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b) allows a party to be relieved from a final judgment due to, among other reasons, mistake, surprise, or misconduct of an adverse party. We review the denial of a Rule 60(b) motion for abuse of discretion unless the decision was rooted in an error of law. <i>Andrx Pharm. Inc. v. Biovail Corp. Int'l,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185459\"><a href=\"/opinion/185459/andrx-pharm-inc-v-biovail-corp-intl/\"><span class=\"volume\">256</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">799</span></a></span>, 805 (D.C.Cir.2001). Horowitz points to no misconduct on the part of Peace Corps's counsel, nor does he explain why any surprise was unjust rather than a result of a mistake by his attorney. Similarly, Horowitz's examples of \"clear error\" in the findings adopted by the court are either immaterial or based on evidence that the court found to be more credible than the evidence Horowitz presented. Hence, Horowitz has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in either instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the above reasons, we hold that the Peace Corps may withhold the student's identity from release under FOIA Exemption 6.
