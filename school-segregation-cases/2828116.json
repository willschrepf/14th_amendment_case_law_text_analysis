The appropriate legal standards are\nwhether Jones is being denied a benefit due to her disability,\nand whether the modification she seeks is a fundamental\nalteration.

Conclusion\n  As stated above, I contend that the majority improperly             As the First Circuit has noted, the ADA “did not emerge in\napplies an abuse of discretion standard of review in this case,     a vacuum.” Dudley, 333 F.3d at 303. Congress found that\nwhen a de novo standard is required. However, the legal             “society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with\narguments in favor of Jones in this case are so strong that         disabilities,” creating “a serious and pervasive social\napplication of a clearly erroneous standard would not change        problem.” 42 U.S.C. § 12101(a)(2).

In order\n                                                                    to ensure full participation of disabled individuals in our\n  Because Jones is being denied the benefit of free and             society, Congress enacted the ADA to “address the major\naccessible all-day parking due to her disability, and because       areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with\nthe modification she requests is not a fundamental alteration,      disabilities.” Id. § 12101(b)(4).\nthe district court “improperly applied governing law,” and the\ndecision was therefore an abuse of discretion.

In short, the City’s     Choate, 469 U.S. at 301; and because we cannot read the\nparking plan seems to comply with the federally mandated            ADA in a manner that “renders the word ‘fundamentally’\nstandard of equal access.” Whether the parking plan, on its         largely superfluous,” Martin, 532 U.S. at 689 n.51, I would\nface, seems to violate the ADA is not the appropriate legal         reverse the district court and grant Helen Jones’s motion for\nstandard, nor is whether the plan seems to comply with the          a preliminary injunction.\nstandard of equal access. The appropriate legal standards are\nwhether Jones is being denied a benefit due to her disability,\nand whether the modification she seeks is a fundamental\nalteration. The district court therefore used erroneous legal\nstandards in disposing of this case.
