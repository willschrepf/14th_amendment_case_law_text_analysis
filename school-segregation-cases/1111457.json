See 42 U.S.C. § 1983. After review, we affirm.\n\n\n                                                 I.\n\n       The complaint 1 alleges that on July 20, 2010, while Mr. Gooden was housed\n\nin segregation at the Autry State Prison in Pelham, Georgia, inmates serving as\n\ndorm orderlies came into his cell to clean up a water spill. While the cleanup was\n\nunderway, Officer Mormon handcuffed Mr. Gooden, and left him in the cell\n\nunsupervised for five minutes or less. During that time, Mr. Gooden was sexually\n\nassaulted by another inmate. This incident caused Mr. Gooden to suffer scratches\n\nin his groin area, and to experience painful urination and erectile dysfunction.\n\n\n       The complaint further alleges that Mr. Gooden filed a witness statement\n\nform the next day addressed to Deputy Warden Williams explaining that he had\n\nnot been seen by medical or mental health staff within the past 24 hours “of his\n\nassault” in violation of the prison’s standard operating procedure. One week later,\n\nMr. Gooden filed an informal grievance with Deputy Warden Williams describing\n\nthe July 20th incident. His grievance, however, neglected to mention the severity\n\nof his injury or the need for medical care, and the only relief he requested was to\n       1\n         After Mr. Gooden filed his complaint, the district court determined that “additional\ninformation [was] needed to screen [Mr. Gooden’s] complaint” and ordered Mr. Gooden to\nanswer a series of questions seeking greater specificity with respect to his factual allegations. See\nOrder, D.E. 8. In assessing the merits of Mr. Gooden’s claim, we rely on both the initial\ncomplaint and the supplemental response, just as the district court did in its initial screening.\n                                                 2\n\f              Case: 11-14725     Date Filed: 07/31/2013   Page: 3 of 8\n\n\npress charges against Officer Mormon and to speak to Internal Affairs. Mr.\n\nGooden was not seen by prison medical staff for approximately 22 days until after\n\nhe filed a second informal grievance complaining about his lack of medical care.\n\n\n      Mr. Gooden eventually brought suit under § 1983 against Officer Mormon\n\nand Deputy Warden Williams for deliberate indifference. He claims that Officer\n\nMormon left him unsupervised, defenseless, and exposed to a risk of serious harm.\n\nHe also claims that Deputy Warden Williams knew that he was in need of medical\n\ncare and nevertheless failed to timely respond. Pursuant to § 1915A, the district\n\ncourt conducted an initial screening of Mr. Gooden’s complaint to determine if it\n\nwas “frivolous, malicious, or fail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief may be\n\ngranted.” 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b)(1). After reviewing the complaint, the district\n\ncourt held that Mr. Gooden’s claims warranted dismissal.\n\n\n                                         II.\n\n      We review de novo a district court’s dismissal for failure to state a claim\n\npursuant to § 1915A(b)(1). See Leal v. Georgia Dept. of Corr., 254 F.3d 1276,\n\n1278-79 (11th Cir. 2001). Dismissal is appropriate if the complaint, on its face,\n\ndoes not state a plausible claim for relief. See Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678-\n\n79, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 1949-50 (2009). We must accept as true all factual allegations\n\nin the complaint. Id. at 678. And because Mr. Gooden is proceeding pro se, his\n\n\n                                          3\n\f              Case: 11-14725     Date Filed: 07/31/2013   Page: 4 of 8\n\n\npleadings must be liberally construed. See Tannenbaum v. United States, 148 F.3d\n\n1262, 1263 (11th Cir. 1998).\n\n\n      We first address Mr. Gooden’s claim against Officer Mormon for failure to\n\nprotect him from serious harm. “[P]rison officials have a duty . . . to protect\n\nprisoners from violence at the hands of other prisoners. . . . It is not, however,\n\nevery injury suffered by one prisoner at the hands of another that translates into\n\nconstitutional liability for prison officials responsible for the victim’s safety.”\n\nFarmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 833-34, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 1976-77 (1994)\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). For that reason, prison officials are only liable\n\nfor a constitutional violation under § 1983 when they “(1) have subjective\n\nknowledge of the risk of serious harm, and (2) nevertheless fail to reasonably\n\nrespond to the risk.” Id. at 837. Officer Mormon’s alleged conduct in this case does\n\nnot meet this standard.\n\n\n      According to Mr. Gooden, he was left unattended in his cell for no more\n\nthan five minutes while other inmates cleaned a water spill. Mr. Gooden claims\n\nthat Officer Mormon should have known that this would have exposed him to\n\nserious risk of injury because the other inmates appeared to be in a hostile mood\n\nand made aggravating remarks about having to clean up the spill in his cell.\n\nThough this purportedly led to an unfortunate incident, the allegations fail to\n\nestablish that Officer Mormon had subjective knowledge that Mr. Gooden could be\n                                         4\n\f                 Case: 11-14725     Date Filed: 07/31/2013     Page: 5 of 8\n\n\nseriously harmed. There are no allegations, for example, that Mr. Gooden alerted\n\nOfficer Mormon about a specific threat from any of the inmates or that Officer\n\nMormon knew of prior attacks by these particular inmates. See Brown v. Hughes,\n\n894 F.2d 1533, 1537 (11th Cir. 1990) (“The known risk of injury must be a strong\n\nlikelihood, rather than a mere possibility before a guard’s failure to act can\n\nconstitute deliberate indifference.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on\n\nthese allegations, Officer Mormon’s decision to leave Mr. Gooden handcuffed and\n\nunsupervised for approximately five minutes may have been negligent, but it was\n\nnot deliberately indifferent. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 838 (“But an official’s failure\n\nto alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no\n\ncause for commendation, cannot under our cases be condemned as [a constitutional\n\nviolation].”).\n\n\n       We next address Mr. Gooden’s claim against Deputy Warden Williams for\n\ndeliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.2 Under the Eighth\n\nAmendment, a prison has an “obligation to provide medical care for those whom it\n\nis punishing by incarceration.” Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 103, 97 S. Ct. 285,\n\n290 (1976). The failure to address those medical needs can serve as grounds for\n\n\n       2\n         Mr. Gooden’s complaint also appeared to state a claim against Deputy Warden\nWilliams for rejecting his grievance against Officer Mormon without conducting a proper and\nprompt investigation. This claim fails because prison inmates do not have a constitutionally-\nprotected liberty interest in the inmate grievance process. See Bingham v. Thomas, 654 F.3d\n1171, 1177 (11th Cir. 2011).\n                                             5\n\f                Case: 11-14725        Date Filed: 07/31/2013       Page: 6 of 8\n\n\nliability under § 1983 when “that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs\n\nof prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.” Id. at 104\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In order to state a claim for deliberate\n\nindifference against Deputy Warden Williams, Mr. Gooden had to establish her\n\n“(1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregard of that risk; and\n\n(3) by conduct that is more than mere negligence.” Brown v. Johnson, 387 F.3d\n\n1344, 1351 (11th Cir. 2004). Much like the claim against Officer Mormon, the\n\nallegations against Deputy Warden Williams do not meet this standard because\n\nthey fail to establish her subjective knowledge of serious harm.\n\n\n       Mr. Gooden alleges that he made Deputy Warden Williams aware of his\n\nserious medical needs by filing a witness statement form on July 21, 2010, and an\n\ninformal grievance six days later explaining that he was the victim of a sexual\n\nassault.3 Yet he did not allege that either document mentioned the nature of the\n\nassault or of his injuries or the need for any prompt medical attention, and the\n\ngrievance form itself did not describe the assault. These omissions are significant\n\nbecause not all sexual assaults—as that term is used in Georgia—necessarily cause\n\nserious physical injury requiring immediate medical care. For example, under\n\n       3\n         Mr. Gooden attached a copy of the informal grievance to his complaint, but he did not\ninclude a copy of the witness statement form. We therefore rely on the complaint’s description of\nthe form’s contents, which allegedly “explain[ed] how [he] had not seen medical or mental\nhealth within 24 hours of [his] assault as stated in the [prison’s standard operating procedures].”\nSupplement, D.E. 9 at 2. The supplement does not contain any other description of the witness\nstatement form.\n                                                6\n\f                Case: 11-14725      Date Filed: 07/31/2013      Page: 7 of 8\n\n\nGeorgia law, simple assault is defined as either an “attempt[] to commit a violent\n\ninjury” or “an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of immediately\n\nreceiving a violent injury.” GA. CODE ANN. § 16-5-20. 4 See also Mathis v. State,\n\n361 S.E.2d 856, 859 (Ga. App. 1987) (“[A]ssault, simple or aggravated, does not\n\nrequire physical contact or harm, but rather the apprehension of harm.”) (emphasis\n\nin original). Because sexual assault may be committed without causing physical\n\nharm, we cannot assume that Deputy Warden Williams knew that Mr. Gooden\n\nrequired medical attention by virtue of the witness statement form or the informal\n\ngrievance.\n\n\n       We also cannot infer Deputy Warden Williams’ subjective knowledge based\n\nupon Mr. Gooden’s contention that it is standard prison policy to conduct a\n\nmedical and mental examination of any victim of sexual assault within 24 hours of\n\nthe incident. Deputy Warden Williams’ alleged failure to comply with prison\n\npolicies may very well be negligent, but it is not, in and of itself, a constitutional\n\nviolation. Cf. Vodicka v. Phelps, 624 F.2d 569, 575 (5th Cir. 1980) (implying that\n\nwarden’s violation of an internal prison regulation did not justify relief under §\n\n1983). Consequently, Mr. Gooden has failed to establish that Deputy Warden\n\n       4\n          We note that Georgia law has the separate crime of “sexual assault.” See GA. CODE\nANN. § 16-6-5.1. But that crime is limited to individuals—such as school employees, parole\nofficers, law enforcements officials, hospital staff, correctional officers, psychotherapists,\nnursing home staff, or at-home caretakers—who engage in sexual contact towards those in their\ncare or custody. Notably, the crime of sexual assault encompasses “any sexual contact” and also\ndoes not require proof of physical harm. See id.\n                                              7\n\f              Case: 11-14725    Date Filed: 07/31/2013   Page: 8 of 8\n\n\nWilliams knew about a serious medical need and deliberately chose to ignore it. Cf.\n\nRay v. Foltz, 370 F.3d 1079, 1084 (11th Cir. 2004) (“At most, their claim is that\n\nthe defendants were negligent or careless in not gathering the information, or that\n\nthey negligently or carelessly failed to follow Department guidelines.”).\n\n\n                                        III.\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of Mr. Gooden’s\n\ncomplaint pursuant to § 1915A(b)(1) for failing to state claims upon which relief\n\ncan be granted.\n\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f",

It is not, however,\n\nevery injury suffered by one prisoner at the hands of another that translates into\n\nconstitutional liability for prison officials responsible for the victim’s safety.”\n\nFarmer v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">825</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 833-34, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087956\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087956/farmer-v-brennan/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For that reason, prison officials are only liable\n\nfor a constitutional violation under § 1983 when they “(1) have subjective\n\nknowledge of the risk of serious harm, and (2) nevertheless fail to reasonably\n\nrespond to the risk.” Id. at 837. Officer Mormon’s alleged conduct in this case does\n\nnot meet this standard.\n\n\n      According to Mr. Gooden, he was left unattended in his cell for no more\n\nthan five minutes while other inmates cleaned a water spill. Mr. Gooden claims\n\nthat Officer Mormon should have known that this would have exposed him to\n\nserious risk of injury because the other inmates appeared to be in a hostile mood\n\nand made aggravating remarks about having to clean up the spill in his cell.\n\nThough this purportedly led to an unfortunate incident, the allegations fail to\n\nestablish that Officer Mormon had subjective knowledge that Mr. Gooden could be\n                                         4\n\f                 Case: 11-14725     Date Filed: 07/31/2013     Page: 5 of 8\n\n\nseriously harmed. There are no allegations, for example, that Mr. Gooden alerted\n\nOfficer Mormon about a specific threat from any of the inmates or that Officer\n\nMormon knew of prior attacks by these particular inmates.

Hughes,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536020\"><a href=\"/opinion/536020/arlington-leon-brown-036932-v-sgt-chris-hughes-chief-deputy-charles/\"><span class=\"volume\">894</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1533</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1537 (11th Cir. 1990) (“The known risk of injury must be a strong\n\nlikelihood, rather than a mere possibility before a guard’s failure to act can\n\nconstitute deliberate indifference.”) (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on\n\nthese allegations, Officer Mormon’s decision to leave Mr. Gooden handcuffed and\n\nunsupervised for approximately five minutes may have been negligent, but it was\n\nnot deliberately indifferent. See Farmer, 511 U.S. at 838 (“But an official’s failure\n\nto alleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no\n\ncause for commendation, cannot under our cases be condemned as [a constitutional\n\nviolation].”).\n\n\n       We next address Mr. Gooden’s claim against Deputy Warden Williams for\n\ndeliberate indifference to his serious medical needs.2 Under the Eighth\n\nAmendment, a prison has an “obligation to provide medical care for those whom it\n\nis punishing by incarceration.” Estelle v. Gamble, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">429</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 103, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109561\"><a href=\"/opinion/109561/estelle-v-gamble/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The failure to address those medical needs can serve as grounds for\n\n\n       2\n         Mr. Gooden’s complaint also appeared to state a claim against Deputy Warden\nWilliams for rejecting his grievance against Officer Mormon without conducting a proper and\nprompt investigation. This claim fails because prison inmates do not have a constitutionally-\nprotected liberty interest in the inmate grievance process. See Bingham v. Thomas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"613095\"><a href=\"/opinion/613095/bingham-v-thomas/\"><span class=\"volume\">654</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1171</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1177 (11th Cir. 2011).\n                                             5\n\f                Case: 11-14725        Date Filed: 07/31/2013       Page: 6 of 8\n\n\nliability under § 1983 when “that deliberate indifference to serious medical needs\n\nof prisoners constitutes the unnecessary and wanton infliction of pain.” Id. at 104\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In order to state a claim for deliberate\n\nindifference against Deputy Warden Williams, Mr. Gooden had to establish her\n\n“(1) subjective knowledge of a risk of serious harm; (2) disregard of that risk; and\n\n(3) by conduct that is more than mere negligence.” Brown v. Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76758\"><a href=\"/opinion/76758/john-ruddin-brown-v-lisa-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1351 (11th Cir. 2004). Much like the claim against Officer Mormon, the\n\nallegations against Deputy Warden Williams do not meet this standard because\n\nthey fail to establish her subjective knowledge of serious harm.\n\n\n       Mr. Gooden alleges that he made Deputy Warden Williams aware of his\n\nserious medical needs by filing a witness statement form on July 21, 2010, and an\n\ninformal grievance six days later explaining that he was the victim of a sexual\n\nassault.3 Yet he did not allege that either document mentioned the nature of the\n\nassault or of his injuries or the need for any prompt medical attention, and the\n\ngrievance form itself did not describe the assault. These omissions are significant\n\nbecause not all sexual assaults—as that term is used in Georgia—necessarily cause\n\nserious physical injury requiring immediate medical care. For example, under\n\n       3\n         Mr. Gooden attached a copy of the informal grievance to his complaint, but he did not\ninclude a copy of the witness statement form. We therefore rely on the complaint’s description of\nthe form’s contents, which allegedly “explain[ed] how [he] had not seen medical or mental\nhealth within 24 hours of [his] assault as stated in the [prison’s standard operating procedures].”\nSupplement, D.E. 9 at 2. The supplement does not contain any other description of the witness\nstatement form.\n                                                6\n\f                Case: 11-14725      Date Filed: 07/31/2013      Page: 7 of 8\n\n\nGeorgia law, simple assault is defined as either an “attempt[] to commit a violent\n\ninjury” or “an act which places another in reasonable apprehension of immediately\n\nreceiving a violent injury.” GA. CODE ANN. § 16-5-20. 4 See also Mathis v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1311655\"><a href=\"/opinion/1311655/mathis-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 859 (Ga. App. 1987) (“[A]ssault, simple or aggravated, does not\n\nrequire physical contact or harm, but rather the apprehension of harm.”) (emphasis\n\nin original). Because sexual assault may be committed without causing physical\n\nharm, we cannot assume that Deputy Warden Williams knew that Mr. Gooden\n\nrequired medical attention by virtue of the witness statement form or the informal\n\ngrievance.\n\n\n       We also cannot infer Deputy Warden Williams’ subjective knowledge based\n\nupon Mr. Gooden’s contention that it is standard prison policy to conduct a\n\nmedical and mental examination of any victim of sexual assault within 24 hours of\n\nthe incident. Deputy Warden Williams’ alleged failure to comply with prison\n\npolicies may very well be negligent, but it is not, in and of itself, a constitutional\n\nviolation. Cf. Vodicka v. Phelps, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"379508\"><a href=\"/opinion/379508/john-vodicka-and-gary-tyler-v-c-paul-phelps-individually-and-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">569</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 575 (5th Cir. 1980) (implying that\n\nwarden’s violation of an internal prison regulation did not justify relief under §\n\n1983). Consequently, Mr. Gooden has failed to establish that Deputy Warden\n\n       4\n          We note that Georgia law has the separate crime of “sexual assault.” See GA. CODE\nANN. § 16-6-5.1. But that crime is limited to individuals—such as school employees, parole\nofficers, law enforcements officials, hospital staff, correctional officers, psychotherapists,\nnursing home staff, or at-home caretakers—who engage in sexual contact towards those in their\ncare or custody. Notably, the crime of sexual assault encompasses “any sexual contact” and also\ndoes not require proof of physical harm. See id.\n                                              7\n\f              Case: 11-14725    Date Filed: 07/31/2013   Page: 8 of 8\n\n\nWilliams knew about a serious medical need and deliberately chose to ignore it.
