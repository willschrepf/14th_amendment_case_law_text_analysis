property-and-casualty insurance policy issued by Farmers \r\nGroup, Inc.  <span class=\"GramE\"><i>Id. </i>at 1202.</span>  Although \r\n<span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo</span> has never made a claim on his homeowner’s policy, \r\nFarmers raised <span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo’s</span> insurance premium by nine \r\npercent.  <i>Id.  </i><span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo</span> alleges that \r\nFarmers increased the premium as a result of unfavorable credit information \r\nacquired though its automated credit-scoring system.  <i>Id.</i></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">            \r\nOn behalf of himself and other racial minorities whose premiums increased as a \r\nresult of Farmers’ use of a credit-scoring system, <span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo</span> \r\nsued Farmers and its affiliates, subsidiaries, and reinsurers in federal \r\ncourt.  <i>Id.</i>  <span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo</span> alleges that the \r\ndefendants’ credit-scoring systems employ several “undisclosed factors” which \r\nresult in disparate impacts for minorities and violate the federal Fair Housing \r\nAct (FHA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601–3619.  <span class=\"SpellE\"><i>Ojo</i></span>, \r\n<span class=\"GramE\">600 F.3d at

all of <span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo’s</span> \r\nclaims.  <i>Id.  </i>Applying the McCarran-Ferguson Act’s (MFA) \r\nreverse-preemption standard, 15 U.S.C. § 1012(b), the district court \r\nconcluded that the Texas Insurance Code preempted <span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo’s</span> FHA claims.  <span class=\"GramE\"><i>Id. </i>at \r\n1203.</span>  Accordingly, the district court declined to answer whether \r\n<span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo’s</span> disparate-impact discrimination claim \r\nsufficiently complied with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>6).  <span class=\"GramE\"><i>Id. </i>at \r\n1202.</span>  On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth \r\nCircuit, a divided three-judge panel held that Texas law did not reverse-preempt

Forsyth</i>, 525 U.S. 299, 307 \r\n(1999)).<i>  </i>The Ninth Circuit, hearing this case en banc, held that \r\n“it is undisputed that the FHA does not specifically relate to insurance,” thus \r\nsatisfying the first prong of MFA reverse-preemption.<span><sup>3</sup></span><span></span><span></span>  <i>Id. </i>at 1203.  It is \r\nalso undisputed that “the relevant provisions of Texas law . . . are enacted for \r\nthe purpose of insurance regulation,” thus satisfying the second prong.  \r\n<i>Id.  </i>The certified question before us specifically deals with the \r\nthird prong, and asks whether allowing <span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo’s</span> claim \r\nunder the FHA might invalidate, impair, or supersede Texas law.  <i>See id. \r\n</i><span class=\"GramE\">at</span> 1204–05.  In light of the fact that Texas \r\nonly prohibits the use of credit score factors or rates <i>based on </i>race, or \r\nrates that differ <i>because of </i>race, we answer that application of the FHA \r\nto permit a cause of action for disparate impact resulting from the use of \r\ncredit scoring in the field of insurance certainly <span>might </span>invalidate, impair, or supersede Texas \r\nlaw.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>III.<span class=\"GramE\">  The</span> Texas Insurance Code Does Not Provide for a Cause \r\nof Action</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>Based on a \r\nRacially Disparate Impac<span>t</span></b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">            \r\nThe Texas Insurance Code expressly prohibits “unfair discrimination” and \r\nspecifically states that “[a] person may not charge . . . an individual a rate \r\nthat is different from the rate charged to other individuals for the same \r\ncoverage because of the individual’s race, color, religion, or national \r\norigin.”  <span>Tex. Ins. Code</span> § \r\n544.002(a<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>2).  An exception to this provision \r\nprovides that “[a] person does not violate Section 544.002 if the refusal, \r\nlimitation, or charge is required or authorized by law or a regulatory \r\nmandate.”  <span class=\"GramE\"><i>Id.</i> § 544.003(c).</span>  Farmers \r\npoints out that § 559.051 authorizes the use of race-neutral credit score \r\nfactors, and that this authorization is the exception to § 544.002<span class=\"GramE\">,which</span> is  recognized in § 544.003.  Section \r\n559.051 permits an insurer to “use credit scoring, except for factors that \r\nconstitute unfair discrimination, to develop rates, rating classifications, or \r\nunderwriting criteria.”  <i>Id. </i>§ 559.051; <i>see also id. \r\n</i>§ 559.052(a<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>1) (“An insurer may not use a \r\ncredit score that is computed using factors that constitute unfair \r\ndiscrimination . . . .”).  The factors that “constitute unfair \r\ndiscrimination” are not defined in the Texas Insurance Code.  However, the \r\nCode does define an “unfairly discriminatory” rate as one that “is <i>based \r\nwholly or partly on the race</i>, creed, color, ethnicity, or national origin of \r\nthe policyholder or an insured.”  <i>Id.</i> § 560.002(c<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>3)(C) (emphasis added).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">            \r\nUnder Texas Insurance Code § 559.201, the use of credit score factors defined by \r\n§ 559.052(a<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>1) that constitute “unfair \r\ndiscrimination” is deemed an “unfair practice in violation of Chapter \r\n541.”  <span class=\"GramE\"><i>Id.</i> § 559.201 (making violations of Chapter \r\n559 an unfair practice under Chapter 541).</span>  Unfair practices under \r\nChapter 541 are subject to private civil suits, including class actions.  \r\n<i>Id. </i>§§ 541.151 (Private Action for Damages Authorized), 541.251(a) (Class \r\nAction Authorized); <i>see Farmers Group, Inc. v. <span class=\"SpellE\">Lubin</span></i>, 222 S.W.3d 417, 421–22 (Tex. 2007).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">            \r\nNo Texas courts have interpreted whether these Insurance Code provisions \r\nprohibit only intentional discrimination or also discrimination based on \r\ndisparate impact.  We derive from these provisions that insurance rates may \r\nnot be “based wholly or partly on” race, and that an individual may not be \r\ncharged a rate that is “different from the rate charged to other individuals for \r\nthe same coverage<b><i> </i></b><i>because of </i>the individual’s race.”  \r\n<span>Tex. Ins. Code</span> §§ 544.002(a<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>1) (emphasis added), 560.002(c)(3)(C).  Additionally, \r\nwhile credit scoring is authorized, it may not be based on “factors that \r\nconstitute unfair discrimination.”  <i>Id. </i>§§ 559.051, 559.052(a<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>1).  We can only assume that a credit score<span class=\"GramE\">  <i>factor</i></span><i> </i>constitutes unfair discrimination \r\nif it is “based wholly or partly on” race, or if it is used to arrive at an \r\ninsurance rate that is “different from the rate charged to other individuals for \r\nthe same coverage<b><i> </i></b><i>because of </i>the individual’s race.”  \r\n<i>See id. </i>§§ 544.002(a<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>1), \r\n560.002(c)(3)(C).  <span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo</span> alleges these provisions \r\nnot only prohibit intentional discrimination—the use of race-based \r\nclassifications to price insurance differently—but also prohibit disparate \r\nimpact discrimination—the use of race-neutral pricing schemes that effectuate \r\ndisparate results (in this case, racial minorities alleging they have suffered \r\nhigher premium rates as a direct consequence of race-neutral credit \r\nscoring).  However, nothing in the Insurance Code prohibits the use of \r\nrace-neutral credit scoring.  In fact, the Code requires that the factors \r\nused in credit scoring to price insurance be race-neutral, or not <i>based \r\non</i> race.  <i>See id. </i>§§ 544.002(a<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>1), 560.002(c)(3)(C). The nature of <span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo’s</span> disparate impact claim presupposes that these factors \r\nare race neutral, which is exactly what the Code requires.  Nevertheless, \r\nto support his argument that the “based on” and “because of” race language in \r\nthe Texas Insurance Code implies the availability of a cause of action for \r\ndisparate impact discrimination, <span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo</span> draws our \r\nattention to the same language used in the FHA, an act which has been \r\ninterpreted to provide for disparate impact protection.  <i>See </i>42 \r\nU.S.C. § 3604;<i> see, e.g.</i>,<i> City of Black Jack</i>, 508 F.2d at \r\n1184.  <span class=\"SpellE\">Ojo</span> also relies on the United States \r\nSupreme Court’s interpretation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act as providing \r\nfor a disparate impact cause of action, an act that also prohibits \r\ndiscrimination “because of” race.  <i>See </i>42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2; <i>Smith \r\nv. City of Jackson</i>, 544 U.S. 228, 240 (2005); <i>Griggs v. Duke Power \r\nCo.</i>, 401 U.S. 424, 436 (1971).  However, given the numerous other \r\nconsiderations, addressed below, that have led federal courts to broadly \r\ninterpret the FHA and Title VII, we find this argument unavailing.  We are \r\nalso guided by the fact that the use of the “because of” race and “based on” \r\nrace language in Texas case law and the Texas Labor Code has been more in \r\nassociation with intentional discrimination claims than claims for disparate \r\nimpacts.  We first address the use of this language within Texas statutes \r\nand case law.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><b>A.  The \r\nLanguage of the Insurance Code Is Inconsistent</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\" align=\"center\"><span class=\"GramE\"><b>with</b></span><b> a Disparate Impact Theory \r\nof Liability</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">            \r\nThe Texas Insurance Code prohibits “unfairly discriminatory” insurance rates as \r\nthose that charge differently “because of” or “based wholly or partly on” \r\nrace.  <i>See </i><span>Tex.  <span class=\"GramE\">Ins.</span>  Code</span> §§ 544.002(a<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>1), 560.002(c)(3).  Texas courts considering this \r\nlanguage in the employment context have used the “because of” and “based . . . \r\non” race language in the disparate treatment context, but not in the area of \r\ndisparate impacts.  In <i>University of Texas v. Poindexter</i>, 306 S.W.3d \r\n798 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, no pet.), the court of appeals held that “[d]<span class=\"SpellE\">isparate</span>-treatment discrimination addresses employment \r\nactions that treat an employee worse than others <i>based on</i> the employee’s \r\nrace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  In such \r\ndisparate-treatment cases, proof and finding of discriminatory motive is \r\nrequired.”  <i>Id. </i>at 804 n.1 (emphasis added); <i>accord</i> <span class=\"SpellE\"><i>Massarsky</i></span><i> v. Gen. Motors Corp.</i>, 706 F.2d 111, \r\n117 (3d Cir. 1983) (noting that a plaintiff could establish intentional \r\ndiscrimination when his “employer applied an expressly <i>race-based</i> or \r\n<i>sex-based</i> standard in its treatment of the plaintiff” (emphasis \r\nadded)).  In <i>Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Davis</i>,<i> </i>979 S.W.2d 30 \r\n(Tex. App.—Austin 1998, pet. denied), the court of appeals described disparate \r\nimpact claims as <span class=\"SpellE\">ethose</span> that “involve facially neutral \r\npractices . . . that operate to exclude a disproportionate percentage of persons \r\nin a protected group and cannot be justified by business necessity. . . .  \r\nDisparate treatment [exists where] the defendant . . . treats some people less \r\nfavorably than others <i>because of </i>their race, color, religion, sex, or \r\nnational origin.”  <i>Id. </i>at 44 (emphasis added).  The United \r\nStates Supreme Court has similarly distinguished between disparate treatment \r\ndiscrimination and disparate impact discrimination, noting that the former is \r\ndiscrimination against others “because of their race,” while the latter \r\nencompasses “practices that are facially neutral . . . but that in fact fall \r\nmore harshly on one group than another.”  <i>Int’l Bhd. of Teamsters v. \r\nUnited States</i>, 431 U.S. 324, 335–36 n.15 (1976); <i>see also</i> \r\n<i>Smith</i>, 544 U.S. at 239 (plurality opinion).</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">            \r\nSignificantly, the phrase “because of race” is also used in the Texas Labor \r\nCode, which makes an employer liable for taking action adverse to an employee \r\n“because of race.”  <i>See </i><span>Tex. \r\n<span class=\"GramE\">Lab.</span> <span class=\"GramE\">Code<span> § 21.051.</span></span></span>  Under the \r\nLabor Code, a plaintiff must show causation by demonstrating that race was a \r\nmotivating factor in the employer’s decision, the standard for proving \r\nintentional discrimination, or disparate treatment.  <i>See id.</i> § \r\n21.125(a) (“Except as otherwise provided by this chapter, an unlawful employment \r\npractice is established when the complainant demonstrates that race . . . was a \r\nmotivating factor for an employment practice, even if other factors also \r\nmotivated the practice . . . .”);<i> cf.

Sch. Dist. v. <span class=\"SpellE\">Meno</span></i>, 917 S.W.2d 717, 726 (Tex. 1995)<i> \r\n</i>(recognizing that it is not our responsibility “to judge the wisdom of the \r\npolicy choices of the Legislature, or to impose a different policy of our own \r\nchoosing.”).  The decision to either allow or prohibit the use of credit \r\nscoring in pricing insurance that creates disparate impacts properly rests with \r\nthe Legislature, and we leave to the Legislature’s judgment the question of \r\nwhether to expressly create a cause of action for disparate impact in the field \r\nof insurance, as it expressly created within the Texas Labor Code.  <i>See \r\n</i><span>Tex. Labor \r\nCode</span><span> § 21.122(a<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>1)</span> (defining the burden of proof in asserting a \r\ncause of action for discrimination based on disparate impact).  Allowing a \r\nclaim against Texas insurers for using completely race-neutral factors in credit \r\nscoring would frustrate the regulatory policy of Texas that the MFA is meant to \r\nprotect, which is the continued regulation of the field of insurance by the \r\nstates without unintentional congressional intrusion.<i>  See </i>15 U.S.C. \r\n§§ 1011 (“[T]he continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the \r\nbusiness of insurance is in the public interest . . . .”), 1012(b) (“No Act of \r\nCongress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted \r\nby any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance<span class=\"GramE\">, .</span> . . unless such Act specifically \r\nrelates to the business of insurance . . . .”).   Therefore, we answer \r\nthe certified question by holding that Texas law does not prohibit an insurer \r\nfrom using race-neutral factors in credit-scoring to price insurance, even if \r\ndoing so creates a racially disparate impact.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">                                                                                    \r\n______________________________</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">                                    \r\n                                                \r\nPaul W.

Labor \r\nCode</span><span> § 21.122(a<span class=\"GramE\">)(</span>1)</span> (defining the burden of proof in asserting a \r\ncause of action for discrimination based on disparate impact).  Allowing a \r\nclaim against Texas insurers for using completely race-neutral factors in credit \r\nscoring would frustrate the regulatory policy of Texas that the MFA is meant to \r\nprotect, which is the continued regulation of the field of insurance by the \r\nstates without unintentional congressional intrusion.<i>  See </i>15 U.S.C. \r\n§§ 1011 (“[T]he continued regulation and taxation by the several States of the \r\nbusiness of insurance is in the public interest . . . .”), 1012(b) (“No Act of \r\nCongress shall be construed to invalidate, impair, or supersede any law enacted \r\nby any State for the purpose of regulating the business of insurance<span class=\"GramE\">, .</span> . . unless such Act specifically \r\nrelates to the business of insurance . . . .”).   Therefore, we answer \r\nthe certified question by holding that Texas law does not prohibit an insurer \r\nfrom using race-neutral factors in credit-scoring to price insurance, even if \r\ndoing so creates a racially disparate impact.</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\"> </p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">                                                                                    \r\n______________________________</p>\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">                                    \r\n                                                \r\nPaul W.
