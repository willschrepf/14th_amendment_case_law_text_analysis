On January 28, 1987, Warden Dutton (Dutton) did not reappoint the appellees as inmate advisors, when their respective terms expired on February 15, 1987, pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Policies of the Department of Corrections,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> which states in pertinent part that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p>Inmate advisors will be appointed for a six month period the first two months being probationary.  The inmate advisors may be reappointed at the discretion of the Warden or Associate Warden of Treatment upon recommendation of the classification committee and with the consent and continued interest of the inmate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Policy 502.01, Section B-2 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1987, the appellees commenced the instant action in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, wherein they charged First Amendment free speech infringements alleging that appellants had conspired to and had deprived them of their constitutional rights to continue to serve as inmate advisors in violation of 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981, 1983, 1985(3), and 1986, in retaliation for complaints which they had filed with the Warden criticizing the performance of David Hindman (Hindman) who was the Chairman of the Disciplinary Board.  The appellees argued that historically wardens had routinely reappointed any inmate advisor who expressed a desire to continue service in the position and that, as a consequence of existing custom and practice, the warden had vested an implied property right in the appellees to continue indefinitely in the position of inmate advisors if they so elected.  Appellees requested declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary and punitive damages, from the appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1987, the trial court referred the controversy to a Magistrate for initial consideration and for submission of Recommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  On March 26, 1987, the Magistrate conducted a hearing and thereafter, on May 28, 1987, issued his Report and Recommendation in which he concluded that the appellees had been denied reappointment in retaliation for written and oral complaints which had criticized Hindman's performance as Chairman of the Disciplinary Board.  Having decided that the appellees had satisfied the requirements necessary to support a preliminary injunction, the Magistrate recommended that the appellants be ordered to reinstate the four named appellees to their positions as inmate advisors pending the resolution of the action on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellees' complaint had not requested class certification, nor alleged training inadequacies of the Disciplinary Board members or inmate advisors, the Magistrate sua sponte addressed these issues which had not been joined by the pleadings and the evidence and on his own initiative recommended that \"the District Court require the appellants to file a plan with the Court for a training program to be conducted by lawyers for members of the prison disciplinary board and inmate advisors at the Tennessee State Penitentiary as soon as practicable and to allow only such trained persons to serve in these administrative proceeding [sic].\"  Magistrate's Report and Recommendation, at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants timely filed objections to the magistrate's proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations to the district court.  On December 7, 1987, however, the district court adopted in toto the magistrate's report and recommendations, after a de novo review of the appellees' request for preliminary injunctive relief.  The appellants thereupon filed a timely appeal from the district court's order granting preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When examining the appellees' motion for preliminary injunctive relief, the district court was required to balance the following four factors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) Whether the plaintiff has shown a strong or substantial likelihood or probability of success on the merits;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2) Whether the plaintiff has shown irreparable injury;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3) Whether the issuance of a preliminary injunction would cause substantial harm to others;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4) Whether the public interest would be served by issuing a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Friendship Materials, Inc. v. Michigan Brick, Inc., 679 F.2d 100, 102 (6th Cir.1982).  In reviewing the District Court's decision addressing appellees' request for injunctive relief, this court must determine if the district abused its discretion in acting as it did.

In the instant appeal, the appellants have contended that the district court erred in its factual conclusion that the appellees were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim, and in concluding that appellees would suffer irreparable harm should the injunctive relief be denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants have urged that the appellees had no constitutionally protected property interest in continued employment as inmate advisors.  The appellants are correct.  Existing precedent confirms that \"[t]he Constitution does not create a property or liberty interest in prison employment ... [and that] any such interest must be created by state law by 'language of an unmistakably mandatory character.' \"    Ingram v. Papalia, 804 F.2d 595, 596-97 (10th Cir.1986) (quoting Hewitt v. Helms, 459 U.S. 460, 471, 103 S.Ct. 864, 871, 74 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983));  see also Adams v. James, 784 F.2d 1077 (11th Cir.1986);  Gibson v. McEvers, 631 F.2d 95 (7th Cir.1980);  Altizer v.

Thompson, 490 U.S. ----, ----, 109 S.Ct. 1904, 1908, 104 L.Ed.2d 506 (1989);  Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at bar, the appellees have failed to demonstrate that they had any cognizable property interest created under Tennessee law in continuing to serve as inmate advisors.  The appellees have argued that longstanding custom and practice which provided that any prisoner who elected to continue serving as an inmate advisor would be reappointed to the position and that the expectation of reappointment constituted a property interest cognizable under the Constitution.  The argument is less than persuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove an \"expectation\" interest under state law, the appellees must demonstrate that there was a \"mutually explicit understanding\" between themselves and the appellants.  Existing precedent has recognized that \"prison officials' policy statements and other promulgations\" can create constitutionally protected interests in favor of the prisoners.  See, e.g., Kentucky Dep't of Corrections, 490 U.S. at ----, 109 S.Ct. at 1908-09;  Beard v. Livesay, 798 F.2d 874, 876 (6th Cir.1986);  Franklin v. Aycock, 795 F.2d 1253, 1260 (6th Cir.1986);  Bills v. Henderson, 631 F.2d 1287, 1291 (6th Cir.1980).  The official policy pronouncements enacted by the State of Tennessee at issue in the instant appeal clearly indicate that \"inmate advisors may be reappointed at the discretion of the Warden.\"    Policy 502.01, Section B-2 (emphasis added).  Because these policy guidelines vested complete discretionary authority in the warden to appoint or reappoint inmate advisors, they did not serve to provide the appellees with a constitutionally protected interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations at issue here, however, lack the requisite relevant mandatory language.  They stop short of requiring that a particular result is to be reached upon a finding that the substantive predicates are met....  [T]he regulations are not worded in such a way that an inmate could reasonably expect to enforce them against the prison officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kentucky Dep't of Corrections, 490 U.S. at ----, 109 S.Ct. at 1910-11 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the appellees failed to demonstrate that the appellants had agreed to waive the expressed policy guideline which vested unlimited discretion in the warden to appoint and/or reappointment inmate advisors for any or no reason.  Consequently, any practice or policy relied upon by the appellees did not rise to the level of a \"mutual\" and \"explicit\" understanding, and was merely a \"unilateral expectation\" on the part of the appellees insufficient to create a recognized property interest.  To constitute a constitutionally protected property right, \"the interest must rise to more than 'an abstract need or desire,' ... and must be based on more than 'a unilateral hope'....\"    Kentucky Dep't of Corrections, 490 U.S. at ----, 109 S.Ct. at 1908 (citations omitted);  see also Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 345, 96 S.Ct. 2074, 2077, 48 L.Ed.2d 684 (1976);  Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 602 n. 7, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2700 n. 7, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972);  Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972).  Accordingly, the appellants are correct in asserting that the appellees failed to prove the existence of a property interest in remaining as inmate advisors which was cognizable under state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellees did not demonstrate a cognizable property interest in their position as inmate advisors, they did however have a cognizable liberty interest in remaining in their respective positions free from impermissible interference.  It is well recognized that it is constitutionally impermissible to terminate even a unilateral expectation of a property interest in a manner which violates rights of expression protected by the First Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>Even though [plaintiff] was merely a probationary employee, and even if she could have been discharged for any reason or for no reason at all, she may nonetheless be entitled to reinstatement if she was discharged for exercising her constitutional right to freedom of expression.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rankin v.

Existing case precedent indicates that a failure to reappoint an individual to a position is equally impermissible, even where there was no cognizable expectation of continued service, if reappointment was denied because of the individual's exercise of First Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the respondent's lack of a contractual or tenure \"right\" to re-employment for the 1969-70 academic year is immaterial to his free speech claim.  Indeed, twice before, this Court has specifically held that the nonrenewal of a non-tenured public school teacher's one-year contract may not be predicated on his exercise of First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.

I write to set forth my understanding of the First Amendment issue argued and ruled upon by the district court and briefed and presented to this court.  I dissent from the majority decision to address appellees' claim as a free speech issue.  The magistrate and the district court based their opinions on a probable violation of the First Amendment right of access to the courts.  Appellees' brief filed with this court does not set forth a free speech issue.  Finding that the right of access to the courts is not implicated in this case, I would also vacate the district court's grant of injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Right of Access to the Courts</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The First Amendment guarantees that all persons shall have access to the courts.  In a prison context, the right of access to the courts is the right to prepare and file pleadings with a court which fairly represents the inmate's claim.  Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 828, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 1498, 52 L.Ed.2d 72, 83 (1977).  In the absence of any meaningful alternative, inmates must be permitted to receive from other inmates assistance in preparing their court documents.  Johnson v. Avery, 393 U.S. 483, 89 S.Ct. 747, 21 L.Ed.2d 718 (1969).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the district court found appellees had a constitutional right to provide legal advice.  This concept has been soundly rejected by other jurisdictions.  In Adams v. James, 784 F.2d 1077 (11th Cir.1986), the Eleventh Circuit held that although a prisoner has a right to receive from other inmates assistance and advice on legal matters, trained inmate \"law clerks\" have no constitutional right to provide legal assistance to prisoners.  Similarly in Smith v. Halford, 570 F.Supp. 1187, 1194 (D.Kan.1983), the court noted that no authority existed for the creation of \"a [constitutional] right, vested in jailhouse lawyers, to provide legal assistance to others.\"    But see Gometz v. Henman, 807 F.2d 113, 115 (7th Cir.1986) (leaving unanswered the question of whether a jailhouse lawyer has standing to assert the constitutional rights of the prisoner he desires to assist).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find appellees have no constitutional right to provide legal assistance to other prisoners.  A litigant may present only his own rights as the bases of relief.  In order for a third party to assert another's constitutional rights, there must be some impediment to first party litigation.  See Singleton v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 114-116, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2874-2875, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (Stevens, J., plurality opinion).  No impediment to first party litigation is alleged by appellees;  the inmates to whom appellees provided assistance are capable of pursuing their own claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo appellees had standing to assert the claims of their inmate clients, the right of access to the courts is not implicated in this case.  No inmate has ever been denied access to an inmate advisor as a result of the decision not to reappoint the appellees to their positions.  New inmate advisors were appointed to serve in the positions previously held by the appellees.  Just as an indigent defendant to a criminal trial does not have a constitutional right to a lawyer of his choice, the prison inmates whom appellees represented are not entitled to the assistance of a particular legal advisor.  Cf., Morris v. Slappy, 461 U.S. 1, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983) (finding indigent criminal defendant merely entitled to adequate representation).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the right of access to the courts guarantees an inmate access to a court of law for the primary purpose of filing habeas corpus petitions and civil rights complaints.  Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977).  By allowing inmates access to the courts to pursue these types of legal proceedings, inmates are provided an avenue for the protection of their constitutional rights.  Id.  The right of access to the courts does not guarantee an inmate a right to counsel in internal prison administrative proceedings.  The assistance provided inmates by appellees was limited to matters involving internal prison disciplinary action before the prison disciplinary board.  Appellees did not assist in the preparation of legal memoranda for filing with the courts.  Therefore, appellees' assistance is not guaranteed by the First Amendment right of access to the courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Right to Free Speech</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The majority state:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p>the appellees commenced the instant action ... [asserting] First Amendment free speech infringements alleging that appellants had conspired to and had deprived them of their constitutional rights to continue to serve as inmate advisors ... in retaliation for complaints filed with the Warden concerning the performance of David Hindman as Chairman of the Disciplinary Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of appellees' complaint reveals no express claim of an abridgement of free speech by appellants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a>   Reviewing the appellees' pro se complaint with a measure of leniency, appellees' complaint may, arguably, be broad enough to encompass a free speech claim.  The district court, however, did not grant injunctive relief on such a theory.  I believe it is inappropriate to rule on such a theory without the matter being presented to the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar issue was encountered by the Eleventh Circuit in Adams v. James, 784 F.2d 1077 (11th Cir.1986).  In Adams, inmates who were terminated from law clerk positions instituted a lawsuit to be reinstated.  The inmate-law clerks alleged their termination violated their inmate-clients' First Amendment right of access to the courts.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the prison administration.  On appeal, the inmate-law clerks argued that they raised before the district court claims implicating their own First Amendment rights rather than the rights of their inmate-clients.  The inmate-law clerks argued that the district court misunderstood their position and, as a consequence, they were denied relief.  The Eleventh Circuit only addressed the claim ruled upon by the district court, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>[i]t is important that we review the case presented to the district court rather than a better case fashioned after the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">784 F.2d at 1080.    Likewise, in the instant case, I would review only those matters ruled upon by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the majority discuss the free speech issue, I must express my view that injunctive relief is nonetheless inappropriate because there is no showing of irreparable harm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The majority relies upon Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 2690, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), to support the proposition that any First Amendment infringement, no matter how minimal, constitutes irreparable injury sufficient to justify injunctive relief.  In Elrod, Justice Brennan, who authored the plurality opinion, stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p>It is clear therefore that First Amendment interests were either threatened or in fact being impaired at the time relief was sought.    The loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury....  Since such injury was both threatened and occurring at the time of respondents' motion and since respondents sufficiently demonstrated a probability of success on the merits, the Court of Appeals might properly have held that the District Court abused its discretion in denying preliminary injunctive relief.  (Citations omitted) (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly, the Elrod Court contemplated that the First Amendment infringement would either be threatened or occurring at the time relief is sought before the injury could be considered irreparable.  Savage v. Gorski, 850 F.2d 64, 68 (2d Cir.1988) (finding chilling of speech stems not from discharge but from threat of discharge);  American Postal Workers Union v. United States Postal Service, 766 F.2d 715, 722 (2d Cir.1985) (holding employee's right to free speech not threatened subsequent to discharge), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1046, 106 S.Ct. 1262, 89 L.Ed.2d 572 (1986);  Kendzierski v. Corey, 615 F.Supp. 550, 552 (N.D.Ind.1985);  Savage v. Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 475 F.Supp. 524, 532 (E.D.Pa.1979), aff'd. 620 F.2d 289 (3rd Cir.1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the First Amendment violation is a past act which is no longer a threat to appellees' right to free speech.  Appellees may now lodge as many complaints as they wish against disciplinary board members.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since reinstatement and money damages would make appellees whole subsequent to a trial on the merits, I would find appellees failed to demonstrate irreparable harm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>   Accordingly, to the extent that this case is addressed as a free speech claim, I would nonetheless deny injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

See, e.g., Adams v. James, 784 F.2d 1077, 1080 (11th Cir.1986) (\"It is important that we review the case presented to the district court rather than a better case fashioned after the district court's order.\").  An examination of the record, however, demonstrates that this concern is misplaced</p>\n        <p>In his Report and Recommendation, the Magistrate expressly made the following factual observations and legal conclusions:</p>\n        <p>Plaintiffs allege, in essence, that they were terminated as inmate advisors in retaliation for their objections to the conduct of disciplinary and administrative segregation proceedings at TSP by the Chairman of the Disciplinary Board.</p>\n        <p>The Magistrate finds that there is a substantial likelihood that the plaintiffs' complaints about Hindman were the primary reason for their terminations by Dutton....</p>\n        <p>....  [R]atification of Hindman's conduct and Dutton's failure to follow departmental policies gives rise to the Magistrate's finding that the plaintiff's non-reappointment was not ordinary prison adminstrative matters, but rather Dutton's decision to terminate plaintiffs was based upon their legitimate complaints about Hindman's conduct....  Such actions by Dutton are consistent with Hindman's statements that if the plaintiffs objected to his handling of disciplinary proceedings, they would lose their jobs.</p>\n        <p>In the Magistrate's view, the evidence in this case to date, [sic] is substantial that the plaintiffs were terminated because of their complaints about Hindman's conduct of administrative and disciplinary proceedings at the Tennessee State Prison.  Dutton stated that at the time of their terminations, he did not question the performance of any plaintiff and that he had no complaints from inmates or institutional staff, other than Hindman, about the plaintiff's [sic] performance of their inmate advisor duties.  Therefore, it appears to the Magistrate that but for the plaintiffs' complaints and confrontations with Hindman, they would have remained in their positions.</p>\n        <p>Magistrate's Report and Recommendation of May 29, 1987, at 1, 6 &amp; 10 (emphasis added).  The district court expressly adopted the Magistrate's Report and Recommendation, specifically commenting that \"[w]ith respect to the likelihood of success on the merits, the Court agrees with the Magistrate's conclusion that the proof introduced at the hearing held on April 10, 1987, indicates that there is a substantial likelihood that the plaintiffs' complaints about the actions of David Hindman, Chairman of the TSP Disciplinary Board, were the primary reasons for their terminations by Dutton.\"    District Court's Memorandum of December 9, 1987, at 1-2 (emphasis added).</p>\n        <p>The above quoted factual and legal conclusions constituted a quintessential formulation of a finding by the magistrate and the district court that the plaintiffs' constitutionally protected rights to freedom of expression had been violated by the defendants in the case at bar.  The fact that the court below did not specifically cite to relevant case law relating to the impermissible infringement of such First Amendment rights of expression is irrelevant, since the court made specific findings sufficient to support an abridgement of the prison inmate advisors' constitutional rights under the facts of this case.  See, e.g., Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 113 n. 9, 102 S.Ct. 869, 876 n. 9, 71 L.Ed.2d 1 (1982) (\"Our jurisdiction does not depend upon citation to book and verse.\")  (citing New York ex rel.

Compare, for example, Lusted v. San Antonio Indep. School Dist., 741 F.2d 817, 821 (5th Cir.1984) (\"Nor is there any indication in the record that this case was tried implicitly as a class action, and 'that all parties to the action knew of its class nature and acquiesced in it.' \")  (quoting Bing v. Roadway Express, Inc., 485 F.2d 441, 446 (5th Cir.1973)) (footnote omitted), in which the court of appeals affirmed the denial of class certification, with such cases as Alexander v.

Incarcerated persons retain minimal liberty interests.  Prison authorities may threaten the loss of those liberty interests retained by inmates to ensure conformity with prison rules, regulations and policies.  The threat of additional deprivations of liberty, however, often has little deterrent effect since many inmates perceive they have nothing left to lose.  This situation creates security risks in prisons which are unparalleled when compared to any other facet of society.  Because of the nature of prisons and recognizing the grave risks associated with the day-to-day operation of prisons, the Supreme Court has granted prison administrators great deference in the execution of their duties.  See e.g., Kentucky Dept. of Corrections v.

Secs. 1981, 1983, 1985(3), and 1986, in retaliation for complaints which they had filed with the Warden criticizing the performance of David Hindman (Hindman) who was the Chairman of the Disciplinary Board.  The appellees argued that historically wardens had routinely reappointed any inmate advisor who expressed a desire to continue service in the position and that, as a consequence of existing custom and practice, the warden had vested an implied property right in the appellees to continue indefinitely in the position of inmate advisors if they so elected.  Appellees requested declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary and punitive damages, from the appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 9, 1987, the trial court referred the controversy to a Magistrate for initial consideration and for submission of Recommended Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law.  On March 26, 1987, the Magistrate conducted a hearing and thereafter, on May 28, 1987, issued his Report and Recommendation in which he concluded that the appellees had been denied reappointment in retaliation for written and oral complaints which had criticized Hindman's performance as Chairman of the Disciplinary Board.  Having decided that the appellees had satisfied the requirements necessary to support a preliminary injunction, the Magistrate recommended that the appellants be ordered to reinstate the four named appellees to their positions as inmate advisors pending the resolution of the action on its merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the appellees' complaint had not requested class certification, nor alleged training inadequacies of the Disciplinary Board members or inmate advisors, the Magistrate sua sponte addressed these issues which had not been joined by the pleadings and the evidence and on his own initiative recommended that \"the District Court require the appellants to file a plan with the Court for a training program to be conducted by lawyers for members of the prison disciplinary board and inmate advisors at the Tennessee State Penitentiary as soon as practicable and to allow only such trained persons to serve in these administrative proceeding [sic].\"  Magistrate's Report and Recommendation, at 15.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants timely filed objections to the magistrate's proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law and recommendations to the district court.  On December 7, 1987, however, the district court adopted in toto the magistrate's report and recommendations, after a de novo review of the appellees' request for preliminary injunctive relief.  The appellants thereupon filed a timely appeal from the district court's order granting preliminary injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When examining the appellees' motion for preliminary injunctive relief, the district court was required to balance the following four factors:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1) Whether the plaintiff has shown a strong or substantial likelihood or probability of success on the merits;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2) Whether the plaintiff has shown irreparable injury;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3) Whether the issuance of a preliminary injunction would cause substantial harm to others;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4) Whether the public interest would be served by issuing a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Friendship Materials, Inc. v.

By allowing inmates access to the courts to pursue these types of legal proceedings, inmates are provided an avenue for the protection of their constitutional rights.  Id.  The right of access to the courts does not guarantee an inmate a right to counsel in internal prison administrative proceedings.  The assistance provided inmates by appellees was limited to matters involving internal prison disciplinary action before the prison disciplinary board.  Appellees did not assist in the preparation of legal memoranda for filing with the courts.  Therefore, appellees' assistance is not guaranteed by the First Amendment right of access to the courts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.

In Adams, inmates who were terminated from law clerk positions instituted a lawsuit to be reinstated.  The inmate-law clerks alleged their termination violated their inmate-clients' First Amendment right of access to the courts.  The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the prison administration.  On appeal, the inmate-law clerks argued that they raised before the district court claims implicating their own First Amendment rights rather than the rights of their inmate-clients.  The inmate-law clerks argued that the district court misunderstood their position and, as a consequence, they were denied relief.  The Eleventh Circuit only addressed the claim ruled upon by the district court, stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p>[i]t is important that we review the case presented to the district court rather than a better case fashioned after the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">784 F.2d at 1080.

An examination of the record, however, demonstrates that this concern is misplaced</p>\n        <p>In his Report and Recommendation, the Magistrate expressly made the following factual observations and legal conclusions:</p>\n        <p>Plaintiffs allege, in essence, that they were terminated as inmate advisors in retaliation for their objections to the conduct of disciplinary and administrative segregation proceedings at TSP by the Chairman of the Disciplinary Board.</p>\n        <p>The Magistrate finds that there is a substantial likelihood that the plaintiffs' complaints about Hindman were the primary reason for their terminations by Dutton....</p>\n        <p>....  [R]atification of Hindman's conduct and Dutton's failure to follow departmental policies gives rise to the Magistrate's finding that the plaintiff's non-reappointment was not ordinary prison adminstrative matters, but rather Dutton's decision to terminate plaintiffs was based upon their legitimate complaints about Hindman's conduct....  Such actions by Dutton are consistent with Hindman's statements that if the plaintiffs objected to his handling of disciplinary proceedings, they would lose their jobs.</p>\n        <p>In the Magistrate's view, the evidence in this case to date, [sic] is substantial that the plaintiffs were terminated because of their complaints about Hindman's conduct of administrative and disciplinary proceedings at the Tennessee State Prison.  Dutton stated that at the time of their terminations, he did not question the performance of any plaintiff and that he had no complaints from inmates or institutional staff, other than Hindman, about the plaintiff's [sic] performance of their inmate advisor duties.  Therefore, it appears to the Magistrate that but for the plaintiffs' complaints and confrontations with Hindman, they would have remained in their positions.</p>\n        <p>Magistrate's Report and Recommendation of May 29, 1987, at 1, 6 &amp; 10 (emphasis added).

Incarcerated persons retain minimal liberty interests.  Prison authorities may threaten the loss of those liberty interests retained by inmates to ensure conformity with prison rules, regulations and policies.  The threat of additional deprivations of liberty, however, often has little deterrent effect since many inmates perceive they have nothing left to lose.  This situation creates security risks in prisons which are unparalleled when compared to any other facet of society.
