FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Introduction\n       In May 1993, defendant induced a group of teenagers to form a gang.\nBetween May 14 and May 20, 1993, gang members committed a series of\nrobberies, attempted robberies and kidnappings, carjackings and murder.\nDefendant was convicted of these offenses either as a direct perpetrator, a\nconspirator, an aider and abettor or an accessory.\n\n       B. Prosecution’s Guilt Phase Evidence\n\n           1. The Crimes and Related Events\n\n               a. Events of May 14, 1993\n       In the early morning of May 14, 1993, while defendant drove around\nMoreno Valley with Mondre Weatherspoon and Alonso Dearaujo, the three\ndecided to commit a robbery. Defendant had a .380-caliber handgun that was to\nfeature prominently in the ensuing crimes. He directed Weatherspoon to the\nparking lot of a Circle K convenience store and gave Dearaujo the gun. He and\n\n\n7      Section 12022.5, subdivision (a).\n8      Section 190.4, subdivision (e).\n9      Section 1239, subdivision (b).\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fWeatherspoon told Dearaujo to go into the store, pull out the gun and demand\nmoney.\n       James Garcia was working at the Circle K when Dearaujo entered, pointed\na gun and told him to ―give him all the money or he‘d blow my . . . head off.‖\nGarcia emptied the cash register into a bag, then turned around and started to\ncount to 100 as directed. When the doorbell chimed, Garcia looked and Dearaujo\nhad gone. He locked the door and called the police\n       Dearaujo ran back to the car and Weatherspoon drove away. Defendant\ntook his gun back and the three split the stolen money.\n\n           2. Formation of the Gang\n       The same night, a group of young people ranging in age from 13 to 19\ngathered at the home of 17-year-old Natalie Dannov, defendant‘s girlfriend.\nDefendant had called the meeting and invited the participants. According to\nDannov and others, defendant talked about forming a gang to commit crimes and\n―have fun.‖ Stolen money would be used to buy a house and invest in stocks.\nThose over 18 would be given bank accounts. Defendant said the gang would be\ncalled the Pimp-Style Hustlers. Gang members would earn ―stripes‖ or ―G\nstripes‖ by committing crimes, carjackings and robberies. At one point, defendant\ndemonstrated how to commit a carjacking, using Dearaujo as his mock victim.\nThe victim was to be put in the car trunk. If a target resisted, defendant directed\nhis members to ―cap ‘em or shoot ‘em.‖ Although others also spoke, defendant\nwas the leader. After his presentation, several people, including defendant, got\ninto a van driven by John Howell and went out looking for someone to carjack.\n\n           3. Attempted Kidnappings for Robbery of Debby Phillips and Deena\n               Nolin (Counts 4 and 5)\n       Defendant directed Howell to the parking lot of Dilly‘s night club.\nDefendant gave George Holland the .380-caliber handgun and told him to commit\n\n\n                                          3\n\fthe carjacking because he was the oldest. He also told 14-year-old Andrew\nCannioto to accompany Holland. Cannioto had a pocket knife.\n         Seeing Deena Nolin and Debby Phillips getting into a car outside the club,\nHolland approached the driver‘s window. When Nolin rolled it down, Holland\npointed a gun through it, and told Nolin to get into the back seat. Cannioto\napproached the passenger side where Phillips sat. The women got out of the car,\nbut Nolin stopped Phillips from getting into the back seat. She said Holland could\ntake the car and their purses, but they would not stay in the car. Phillips ran\ntoward the night club. Holland and Cannioto ran back toward the van. The\npassengers told them not to get in and they kept running. Around 30 minutes later,\ndefendant and Weatherspoon picked them up. They drove to a hotel where\nHolland‘s sister had rented a room to celebrate.\n\n             4. Robbery of Dale Nonies (Count 6)\n         Later that night, defendant, Weatherspoon, Holland and Steven McNair\nwent to find another carjack victim. Holland drove. Around midnight, they saw\nDale Nonies and his girlfriend, Genalyn Doronio, saying goodnight in front of\nDoronio‘s house. Nonies‘s white Ford Escort was parked at the curb. Defendant\nand Weatherspoon got out of the car. Defendant pointed his gun at the couple and\ndemanded Nonies‘s car key and wallet. Nonies asked to keep his wallet and other\nkeys. The robbers agreed taking only his money and car key.\n         Defendant and Weatherspoon drove off with Nonies‘s car, followed by\nHolland and McNair. In a secluded area, they stripped the car and rolled it into a\nditch.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                 b. Events of May 15, 1993\n\n                     1. Attempted Carjacking of Barbara DeGeorge (Count 7)\n       On May 15, defendant told gang member Anthony Post to carjack a vehicle\nso defendant could drive it to the prom. After two aborted attempts, defendant and\nPost went to the parking lot of a theater complex. They saw a woman getting out\nof a car. Defendant said, ―she‘ll be easy because she hasn‘t put her keys away\nyet.‖ Post was reluctant, but defendant gave him the gun and ―pumped [him] up.‖\nPost approached the woman, lifted his shirt to display the gun in his waistband,\nand demanded her car keys.\n       The victims, Barbara DeGeorge and her 10-year-old daughter Lisa, were on\ntheir way to the movies. When Post displayed the weapon, DeGeorge and her\ndaughter ran. Post ran toward defendant, who waved him away. Post hid the gun\nin a field and retrieved it later.\n\n                     2. Robbery of Patricia Smith Estep and Charles Estey (Counts\n                         8 and 9)\n       Later that night, defendant sent Dearaujo and 13-year-old gang member\nChristopher Lyons to rob a liquor store. Dearaujo had defendant‘s gun; Lyons\ncarried two knives. When they got to the liquor store, it was closing. They left.\n       They passed a building with the lights on and people inside. Lyons said,\n―let‘s rob them.‖ Lyons took the gun and they entered. The building housed a Los\nAngeles Times distribution center owned by Charles Estey who was there with his\nmother, Patricia Smith Estep. Lyons and Dearaujo ran into the office with Lyons\nwearing a stocking mask. Initially, Estey thought his friends were playing a joke\non him, even as the gunman pointed the gun at his face. Dearaujo held a knife to\nPatricia Smith Estep‘s back and told her not to look at him. Ordered to get on the\nfloor, Estey said, ―Knock it off, Manny . . . . This has gone far enough.‖ Seeing\nthe knife pointed at his mother, Estey realized the robbery was not a joke. The\n\n\n                                         5\n\frobbers took Estey‘s wallet and his mother‘s purse. Dearaujo told Lyons, ―Let‘s\ncap them and get out of here.‖ Estey offered them his car keys, saying, ―We never\nsaw you once, just go.‖ They left.\n       Dearaujo and Lyons met defendant. They gave him the purse and wallet\nthat together contained about $100. Defendant kept the money and commended\nthem for a ―good job.‖\n\n               c. Events of May 19-20, 1993\n\n                         1. Murder of Yvonne Los (Counts 1 and 2)\n       On the evening of May 19, 1993, defendant was part of a group planning to\ndrive to a party in Anaheim. As he and others were getting into a car, Dearaujo\nand Lyons came over. Defendant asked if Dearaujo could come with them, but the\ngroup was too large to fit in the vehicle. Defendant told Dearaujo and Lyons to go\nto the Family Fitness Center and ―get a car.‖ Defendant told Dearaujo to carjack a\nlight-colored sedan and put the victim in the trunk. He gave Dearaujo his gun\nalong with a jacket and a bandana to cover his face. He described where to meet\nhim afterwards.\n       Dearaujo and Lyons walked to the parking lot of the fitness center and\nwaited for an ―appropriate‖ victim. Yvonne Los, an Air Force nurse and mother\nof two, pulled into the lot. When her car passed them, Dearaujo said, ―This is it,\nlet‘s do it.‖ As Los sat in the driver‘s seat, Dearaujo tapped the car window with\nthe gun barrel and said, ―Shh.‖ Los looked frightened and locked the doors.\nLyons tried to open the passenger door. A witness heard him yelling, ―get out of\nthe car, get out of the fucking car.‖ When Los started the car, Dearaujo shot her.\nThe car rolled backwards, striking another vehicle. Los tapped her car horn and\nthen slumped over. Dearaujo and Lyons fled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f         An off-duty police officer heard the crash and responded to find Los shot in\nthe neck and unresponsive. A bullet had severed Los‘s carotid artery causing\ndeath by exsanguination.\n         Later, Dearaujo and Lyons met defendant and reported what happened.\nDefendant told them to find someplace to stay that night and to come to Dannov‘s\nhouse the next day.\n\n               2. Post Murder Celebration\n         The following afternoon, the mood at Dannov‘s house was festive.\nDefendant referred to Dearaujo as ―Charles Manson.‖ He awarded Dearaujo two\nstripes, and Lyons one, for a ―good job.‖ When a television newscast aired a\nphotograph of Los, Dearaujo said, ―I smoked that bitch.‖ When Los‘s fiancé\nappeared on screen and said they were planning to marry, Lyons said, ―Not no\nmore.‖\n\n             3. Robbery and Attempted Kidnapping for Robbery of Glynn Brodbeck\n                 (Counts 10 and 11)\n         That night, defendant, Weatherspoon and James Handy tried to commit\nanother carjacking. Defendant took the gun. Defendant and Weatherspoon\napproached Glynn Brodbeck, who was parked in a Taco Bell lot waiting for his\nfiancée to finish her shift. Defendant tapped on the driver‘s window and told\nBrodbeck to get out of the car. Brodbeck saw defendant with a gun and two other\nmen standing nearby.\n         Defendant demanded his wallet, but Brodbeck had left it at home. Handy\n―frisked‖ him and took his cigarettes. Weatherspoon took Brodbeck‘s keys and\nopened the trunk, where he and defendant planned to put their victim. When the\nrobbers looked into the trunk, Brodbeck ran toward the Taco Bell. Defendant shot\nat him, but Brodbeck slipped. As he fell, he heard the bullet pass by. He\nrecovered and kept running until he entered the restaurant where he called police.\n\n\n                                           7\n\fDefendant, Weatherspoon and Handy left the scene, dropping Brodbeck‘s keys in\nthe parking lot.\n         4. Defendant’s Arrest and Statement to Police\n         The murder investigation led police to George Holland who revealed\ndefendant‘s name. Police arrested him on May 22, 1993. En route to the county\njail, defendant asked how much time he could get for carjacking. Defendant also\ncommented that a detective had called him ―David Koresh,‖ adding he did not\nthink he was Koresh, but guessed he was a sort of leader.\n         Police interrogated defendant on May 22 and 23. He admitted calling the\nmeeting at Natalie Dannov‘s house where he and others discussed committing\ncarjackings. He also admitted proposing to put the money into a common\ninvestment pool and to coining the name Pimp-Style Hustlers. He denied being\nthe ―ringleader,‖ claiming he was the ―second hand man‖ to Mondre\nWeatherspoon.\n         Defendant admitted either planning or committing the Circle K robbery, the\nNonies robbery and the attempted carjacking of Brodbeck at Taco Bell. He was\npresent at the attempted carjacking of Phillips and Nolin and the attempted\ncarjacking of DeGeorge. Defendant conceded he divided the money Dearaujo and\nLyons took from Charles Estey and his mother. As to the murder, defendant\nadmitted knowing that Dearaujo was ―gonna jack a car,‖ giving him a gun and\nplanning to meet him afterwards. He denied ordering Dearaujo to commit the\ncrime.\n\n         C. Defendant’s Guilt Phase Evidence\n         Defendant called Jason Domke, a friend of Christopher Lyon‘s. Domke\ntestified that Lyons showed him a knife and asked him if he wanted to go\n―jacking‖ with him. Domke testified he saw Lyons retrieve a gun and a bag of\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\fshells from Natalie Dannov‘s house. Lyons showed him a woman‘s stolen\ndriver‘s license.\n\n       D. Codefendant Dearaujo’s Guilt Phase Evidence10\n       Dearaujo called Keisha Lawrence, who had been married to John Howell;\nshe had pled guilty to two counts of being an accessory to attempted kidnapping\nfor robbery and served eight months of her one-year sentence. Lawrence believed\nDearaujo was slow-witted and wanted to fit in. He was ―picked on,‖ ―punched‖\nand manipulated by defendant and others in the group. Defendant was the leader\nthe others looked up to. She corroborated defendant‘s involvement in the\nattempted carjacking of Debbie Phillips and Deena Nolin and the robbery and\ncarjacking of Dale Nonies. Following the murder, Lawrence called defendant and\nasked what he was going to do about the homicide for which she blamed him. He\nsaid, ―It‘s already done. The bitch is dead.‖ When she asked about Dearaujo,\ndefendant said Dearaujo was fine; he had the situation under control and she\nshould not worry.\n\n       E. Prosecution’s Penalty Phase Evidence\n       1. Victim Impact Evidence\n       Yvonne Los‘s family and friends described the impact of her death. Her\nfiancé, ex-husband, parents, two siblings and two children represented the family.\nThey were joined by two Air Force coworkers .\n       Los was the oldest child in a close-knit family and had grown up taking\ncare of her younger siblings. Her desire to help people led her to choose nursing\nas her profession. She joined the Air Force to further her education and was proud\n\n10     Defendant was tried along with Dearaujo before separate juries. Dearaujo‘s\nconvictions are not involved in this appeal. The evidence summarized here was\nheard by defendant‘s jury.\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fof her military service. She rose to the rank of staff sergeant, a difficult\nachievement for medical personnel. She did volunteer work and cared for a\ndisabled boy. Committed to her Catholic faith, she loved her two children and\ninstilled high moral values in them. She was a person who loved unconditionally.\n       Each relative described learning of Los‘s death, their feelings of loss and\ngrief and the impact of her death on the extended family. Her father testified\nabout the pain of losing a child. Siblings recounted the family‘s sadness and the\npall cast over family gatherings. Her son, age 10, was five when she died and\nremembered her as a ―nice mom.‖ Her daughter, 15, testified Los was a kind\nperson and a role model. She thought of her mother every day. She remained\nupset that she and her mother had argued on the night of the murder and that she\nhad gone to bed without telling her mother good-night. Los‘s ex-husband\ndescribed how difficult it had been for him and their children after her death. He\nreturned from Germany, where he was stationed, to be with the children and take\nthem back to Germany. Witnesses described her funeral and burial in Iowa and a\nposthumous ceremony where an Air Force dormitory for nurses was named in her\nhonor. A videotape of the ceremony, an unusual honor, was shown to the jury\nalong with a montage of still photographs.\n       2. Violent Criminal Activity\n       The prosecutor presented evidence in aggravation documenting defendant‘s\ncriminal activity involving the ―use or attempted use of force or violence or the\nexpress or implied threat to use force.‖11\n\n\n\n\n11     Section 190.3, factor (a).\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f      Mario Loa testified that in September 1991 he was attacked by defendant\nand the ex-boyfriend of a woman Loa was dating. Trina P. testified that in\nJanuary 1992, defendant hit her in the mouth following a disagreement.\n      A number of witnesses testified to defendant‘s violent crimes while in\ncustody. Inmate Donald Deloney testified how, in March 1994, he and defendant\njoined together to intimidate and assault other inmates. Defendant beat up an\ninmate to secure a lower bunk for Deloney and forced another inmate to orally\ncopulate defendant. Deloney and defendant robbed at least 13 inmates. They took\ncommissary cards and physically threatened Timothy Goodfield. After the\nincident with Goodfield, defendant and Deloney were reassigned to high security\nsegregated housing.\n      In May 1994, defendant fought with inmate Mark Sanchez. That same\nmonth, he ordered a Latino inmate to attack a White prisoner who had a swastika\ntattoo. In July 1994, defendant fought with inmate Mark Heinzen, believing he\nwas gay. In August 1994, defendant assaulted Dale Foster because he wanted\nFoster‘s bunk. In December 1995, defendant fought Arturo Alatorre, who had\ncomplained that defendant exceeded his phone time.\n\n      F. Defendant’s Penalty Phase Evidence\n      Defendant‘s father testified he was a ―normal kid,‖ who had experienced\nproblems in middle school that were resolved. He dropped out of high school and\nan alternative school. At 17, defendant went to work in his father‘s landscaping\nbusiness. At 18, he began living away from home intermittently. Defendant‘s\nfather was acquainted with most of his friends. He had been unaware defendant\nhad any problems with substance abuse or violence. Defendant‘s arrest devastated\nhis father who could not imagine life without his son.\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f       Defendant‘s mother abused drugs when defendant was growing up and\nwould visit out-of-town relatives for months at a time. Occasionally, she took her\nchildren.\n       Defendant‘s sister described him as helpful, respectful and well-liked.\n       Rahin Brown was defendant‘s neighbor and friend in 1987. They played\nbasketball and football together. Brown left home, joined the Navy, and went to\ncollege. He remained in touch with defendant who was like a member of Brown‘s\nfamily. Brown was unaware of any bad behavior on defendant‘s part. In spite of\ndefendant‘s convictions, Brown remained his friend and believed he had good\nqualities.\n       Velma McDowell lived next door to defendant‘s grandmother. He ran\nerrands for her and mowed her lawn. He was respectful and ―a good kid.‖\n       Defendant‘s sixth and seventh grade teachers also testified about his good\ncharacter.\n       Anthony Casas, a private investigator and litigation consultant, worked for\nthe Department of Corrections for 23 years. He described the prison classification\nsystem. Based on his case review and interviews with defendant, he opined that if\nsentenced to life without parole, defendant would be sent to a level 4 facility, the\nmost restrictive in the system. Casas described level 4 facilities, routines and\ndisciplinary actions. Casas believed defendant would adapt and do well in that\nsetting. Notwithstanding his ―infractions‖ while in custody, Casas believed he\nwould not be a management problem in prison.\n       Defendant also presented evidence that Mario Loa failed to initially name\nhim as one of his assailants. A district attorney investigator testified that the\nattack on the inmate with the swastika tattoo was not committed by a Latino\ninmate acting on defendant‘s orders, but by someone else.\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f       G. Prosecution Rebuttal Evidence\n       Correctional Officer Martin Trochtrop found homemade weapons\nconcealed in the ceiling of defendant‘s cell. Samuel Francis, a correctional officer\nfor over 17 years, was called to counter Casa‘s opinion that defendant would pose\nno threat at a level 4 facility. Francis testified that an inmate with a record of\nweapons possession and assaults on other inmates might be an administrative\nproblem. In his opinion, such an inmate would continue to demonstrate a\npropensity for violence.\n                              II. GUILT PHASE ISSUES\n\n       A. Use of Restraints\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered the\nuse of a leg restraint without a finding of manifest necessity. (People v. Duran\n(1976) 16 Cal.3d 282, 290-291.)12 He argues further that the court‘s decision\nviolated his rights under various constitutional provisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th\n& 8th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 1, 7, 15, 16 & 17.) Defendant has forfeited\nthe claim and, in any event, fails to show prejudice.\n       Following preliminary instructions to the jury, and outside the jury‘s\npresence, the trial court remarked, ―I was approached by the security people that\n\n\n12      ―As to this and virtually all other appellate claims, defendant contends that\nan issue raised and decided in the trial court resulted in constitutional violations,\nbut he did not present those constitutional theories below. In such instances, it\nappears that (1) the appellate claim is the kind that required no [specific argument]\nto preserve it, or (2) the new arguments do not invoke facts or legal standards\ndifferent from those the trial court was asked to apply . . . . To that extent,\ndefendant‘s new constitutional arguments are not forfeited on appeal. [Citations.]\nIn the latter case, no separate constitutional discussion is required or provided\nwhere rejection of a claim that the trial court erred on the issue presented to that\ncourt necessarily leads to rejection of any constitutional theory or ‗gloss‘ raised for\nthe first time here.‖ (People v. Contreras (2013) 58 Cal.4th 123, 139, fn. 17.)\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\ftheir intention is to request at some point [defendant] wear, at least initially, the\nleg restraint locking-type of device to prevent his escape or any type of other\nsecurity issue. As I understand it, although I have never seen it, it is an\nunobtrusive device which is not visible to any member of the jury. As long as\nthere‘s no attempt to rapidly run, it remains flexible. . . . [I]f he tries to run, it‘s\nsupposed to lock . . . . I‘ve been told that there are a number of incidents [since\ndefendant] has been in custody that have occurred in jail that apparently support\nthe sheriff‘s concern that some, at least minimal, restraints ought to be employed\nin this case.‖ Defense counsel responded, ―I told [defendant] to expect this. So I\ndon‘t think at this point I‘m in a position to comment further, but other than to say\n[defendant] has never been a problem for transportation, to my knowledge. I think\nthe incidents that may have occurred in the jail are pretty old at this point. Other\nthan that, I told [defendant] already to expect to have the leg restraint. He‘s seen it\nalready and knows what it is.‖ Addressing the bailiff, the court said, ―[I]f there are\nany concerns [about] that regular restraint, I assume that you will or someone from\nyour office will make the presentation or ask us to revisit the issue.‖ The bailiff\nsaid, ―yes.‖\n       Later, during a recess, defendant complained the restraint was ―very, very\nuncomfortable‖ because ―[i]t‘s cutting me.‖ The prosecutor suggested leg\nshackles. Defense counsel replied, ―I don‘t think it would be to[o] oppressive to\nsit. We can find out tomorrow, and maybe leg shackles would be the alternative.\nSince he doesn‘t have to stand up, the jury wouldn‘t see it, but I‘ll alert the court.‖\n       The last reference to defendant‘s restraint was made in the context of a\ndiscussion about the use of restraints on prosecution witnesses. During that\ndiscussion, the prosecutor noted that defendant and Dearaujo were ―not restrained.\nThey don‘t have handcuffs on. As far as the jury knows, they‘re greatly\nunrestrained.‖\n\n                                            14\n\f       ―Under Duran, supra, 16 Cal.3d 282, a criminal defendant may be\nsubjected to physical restraints in the jury‘s presence upon ‗a showing of a\nmanifest need for such restraints.‘ [Citations.] This requirement is satisfied by\nevidence that the defendant has threatened jail deputies, possessed weapons in\ncustody, threatened or assaulted other inmates, and/or engaged in violent outbursts\nin court. [Citations.] [¶] The trial court‘s decision to physically restrain a\ndefendant cannot be based on rumor or innuendo. [Citation.] However, a formal\nevidentiary hearing is not required. [Citation.]‖ (People v. Lewis and Oliver\n(2006) 39 Cal.4th 970, 1031-1032.) The trial court‘s determination is reviewed\nfor abuse of discretion. (People v. Combs (2004) 34 Cal.4th 821, 837.)\n       Defendant failed to object to restraints and has therefore forfeited his claim\non appeal. (People v. Foster (2010) 50 Cal.4th 1301, 1321.) At no time did the\ndefense request a formal hearing on the question. In any event, we need not\nconsider any abuse of discretion because no evidence suggests that any juror saw\nthe restraints. (Id. at p. 1322; see People v. Manibusan (2013) 58 Cal.4th 40, 85.)\n―[W]e have consistently held that courtroom shackling, even if error, [is] harmless\nif there is no evidence that the jury saw the restraints, or that the shackles impaired\nor prejudiced the defendant‘s right to testify or participate in his defense.‖ (People\nv. Anderson (2001) 25 Cal.4th 543, 596.)\n       The only record regarding the restraint was the court‘s initial comment that\nit would not be visible to the jury and the prosecutor‘s later observation that\ndefendants did not appear to be restrained. Defendant cites nothing in the record\nto contradict these references. He did not testify at either phase of the trial and\nmade a single passing reference to discomfort. No evidence suggests the restraint\ninfluenced him not to testify, affected his demeanor or impaired his ability to\ncommunicate with defense counsel. (People v. Combs, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pp.\n837-839; see People v. Manibusan, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 87.)\n\n                                          15\n\f       Defendant claims Deck v. Missouri (2005) 544 U.S. 622, stands for the\nproposition that when restraints are used prejudice is presumed.    We have\npreviously rejected this construction of Deck. (People v. Letner and Tobin (2010)\n50 Cal.4th 99.) We noted ―[i]n Deck, there was no dispute that the restraints were\nvisible to the jury — a circumstance that courts consistently have viewed as\ninherently prejudicial.‖ (Id. at p. 155.) We declined to presume the jurors viewed\nthe restraint, and nothing in the record showed that they did so. (Ibid.) The same\nanalysis applies here.\n\n       B. Excusal of Juror No. 12 During Trial\n       During the prosecution‘s case, the court dismissed a juror who improperly\nexpressed an opinion about witness credibility then lied to the court about having\nmade the statement. Defendant contends the excusal of the juror was an abuse of\ndiscretion and also violated his rights under various constitutional provisions.\n(U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.)\n\n           1. Background\n       Juror No. 6 initially reported that Juror No. 12 said she was upset because\nJames Handy, an in-custody prosecution witness, had been brought to court in\nhandcuffs. Later, Juror No. 7 told Juror No. 6 that Juror No. 12 said the only\nreason Handy had been handcuffed was because he was African-American. Juror\nNo. 12 herself was African-American.\n       Upon inquiry, Juror No. 12 admitted making the comment. The court\nexplained a decision to restrain an inmate witness was based on whether the\nwitness posed a security threat and was ―not a racial decision.‖ Juror No. 12 said\nthe episode would not prejudice her against either side. She acknowledged that\nher ―mistake‖ was, ―I‘m not supposed to give my opinions to others.‖ At the\nprosecutor‘s request, the trial court also questioned Juror No. 7 about Juror No.\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f12‘s comment. She confirmed that Juror No. 12 had asserted ―the black [prisoner-\nwitnesses] are in shackles.‖\n       The prosecutor sought to excuse Juror No. 12 because she could not be fair\nand impartial. The trial court denied the request because the juror had said she\ncould be fair to both sides and her comment concerned an ancillary matter.\n       The trial court told the jury that restraints were placed on a witness for\nsecurity and should have no bearing on its evaluation of the witness‘s credibility.\nThe trial court also reminded jurors they were not to discuss the merits of the case\nbefore it was submitted to them.\n       Nine days later, another juror reported comments by Juror No. 12. Juror\nNo. 2 told the court that after Glynn Brodbeck testified, Juror No. 12 said, ―the\nonly truth lied [sic] in the parking lot and that everyone else was just lying.‖ Juror\nNo. 2 reported the comment had been made after the court‘s earlier admonition not\nto discuss the merits of the case. Juror No. 2 also said Juror No. 12‘s latest remark\nhad been made in the presence of other jurors.\n       The matter was put over for several days before Juror No. 12 was\nquestioned. She said she heard someone make a similar statement but denied it\nwas she. She heard someone say ―everybody in the courtroom was lying except\nthe judge,‖ but did not remember who made the comment. She volunteered she\nwas ―a strong-opinionated person,‖ and suggested that ―maybe somebody would\nnot like for me to be on the jury, to go into deliberations or whatever.‖ She\nwondered if she was being ―pinpointed with things that are said or done as far as\nthis particular trial is concerned.‖ The court pointed out that the juror who had\nreported this comment was not the same juror who had reported the handcuffing\ncomment. Juror No. 12 said she could be fair but felt like ―I‘m being attacked.‖\n       The remaining jurors and alternates were questioned. No one remembered\nhearing the statement Juror No. 2 reported. Alternate Juror No. 3 said he\n\n                                          17\n\foverheard a juror say she was upset by a comment Juror No. 12 made. That\nremark could have been made on the day Brodbeck testified.\n       The prosecutor renewed her motion to dismiss Juror No. 12, saying the\nissue was whether Juror No. 2 was credible. She argued that Alternate Juror No.\n3‘s recollection corroborated Juror No. 2‘s claim that Juror No. 12 had made the\nstatement about witnesses lying. The prosecutor asserted that the new statement\nviolated the court‘s admonition not to discuss the case and that Juror No. 12‘s\ndenial ―was not credible.‖\n       Over defendant‘s objection, the court removed Juror No. 12. Referring to\nthe handcuff statement, the court noted that Juror No. 12 had said one of the things\nshe learned from the incident was not to share her opinion with others.\nNonetheless, the second statement attributed to her went ―directly [to] the merits\nof the case‖ and showed Juror No. 12 had formed an opinion about the witness‘s\ncredibility. This behavior violated the court‘s admonition not to do so until the\ncase was finally submitted. The court held the juror had lied when denying she\nmade the statement and that Juror No. 2 was credible.\n       The court found that Juror No. 12‘s misconduct was thrice improper.\n―First, she, in violation of the Court‘s order, formed an opinion about the merits of\nthe case, and two, she expressed that opinion to other jurors, and three, when\nconfronted with that, in my opinion she lied to the Court as to whether she made\nthe statement in the first place.‖ The juror was dismissed and an alternate seated.\n\n           2. Discussion\n       ―The court may discharge a juror for good cause (see § 1089), which\nincludes a failure to follow the court‘s instructions.‖ (People v. Allen and Johnson\n(2011) 53 Cal.4th 60, 69.) ―A juror who violates his or her oath and the trial\ncourt‘s instructions is guilty of misconduct.‖ (People v. Linton (2013) 56 Cal.4th\n\n\n\n                                         18\n\f1146, 1194.) ―We review a trial court‘s decision to discharge a juror under an\nabuse of discretion standard, and will uphold such decision if the record supports\nthe juror‘s disqualification as a demonstrable reality. [Citations.] The\ndemonstrable reality test ‗requires a showing that the court as trier of fact did rely\non evidence that, in light of the entire record, supports its conclusion that\n[disqualification] was established.‘ [Citation.] To determine whether the trial\ncourt‘s conclusion is ‗manifestly supported by evidence on which the court\nactually relied,‘ we consider not just the evidence itself, but also the record of\nreasons the court provided. [Citation.] In doing so, we will not reweigh the\nevidence. [Citation.]‖ (People v. Wilson (2008) 43 Cal.4th 1, 26.) We defer to\nthe trial court‘s credibility assessments ―based, as they are, on firsthand\nobservations unavailable to us on appeal.‖ (People v. Barnwell (2007) 41 Cal.4th\n1038, 1053.)\n       Section 1122 requires that after the jury is sworn and before opening\narguments it be instructed about ―its basic functions, duties and conduct,‖\nincluding that the jurors ―shall not converse among themselves, or with anyone\nelse, . . . on any subject connected with the trial.‖ (§ 1122, subd. (a).) This jury\nwas so instructed. Section 1122 also requires that ―[t]he jury shall also, at each\nadjournment of the court before the submission of the cause to the jury, . . . be\nadmonished by the court that it is their duty not to . . . converse among themselves,\nor with anyone else, on any subject connected with the trial, or to form or express\nany opinion about the case until the cause is finally submitted to them.‖ (§ 1122,\nsubd. (b).) Those admonitions were given as required. A juror‘s violation of these\ndirections constitutes serious misconduct. (People v. Majors (1998) 18 Cal.4th\n385, 423.)\n       Moreover, after the initial inquiry as to the handcuffing, the court again\ndrew the jury‘s attention to the prohibition against discussing the case until it was\n\n                                          19\n\fsubmitted to them. Indeed, Juror No. 12 herself recognized she should keep her\nopinion to herself.\n       On this record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Juror\nNo. 12. The crux of the court‘s ruling was its credibility determination that Juror\nNo. 2 was truthful and Juror No. 12 was not. There is no basis to disturb that\nfinding on appeal. Juror No. 12 was well aware that she was not to form an\nopinion on any matter touching upon the case or to express an opinion to others.\nNevertheless, her second remark shows she had formed an opinion about witness\ncredibility. She then shared it with at least one other juror. She compounded her\nmisconduct by lying to the court. The record supports her disqualification as a\ndemonstrable reality.\n\n       C. Instructional Claims\n\n           1. Lesser Included Offense Instruction\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to provide, sua sponte,\nlesser include offense instructions on second degree felony murder, second degree\nmurder and voluntary manslaughter. He maintains the error violated his rights\nunder various constitutional provisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th\nAmends.) Because no substantial evidence implicated issues addressed in these\ninstructions the trial court was not required to give them.\n       ―The trial court must instruct on general legal principles closely related to\nthe case. This duty extends to necessarily included offenses when the evidence\nraises a question as to whether all the elements of the charged offense are\npresent. . . . [¶] Nevertheless, ‗the existence of ―any evidence, no matter how\nweak‖ will not justify instructions on a lesser included offense . . . .‘ [Citation.]\nSuch instructions are required only where there is ‗substantial evidence‘ from\nwhich a rational jury could conclude that the defendant committed the lesser\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\foffense, and that he is not guilty of the greater offense.‖ (People v. DePriest\n(2007) 42 Cal.4th 1, 50.) ―Substantial evidence,‖ in this context, ―is evidence\nsufficient to ‗deserve consideration by the jury,‘ that is, evidence that a reasonable\njury could find persuasive.‖ (People v. Barton (1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 201, fn. 8.)\n       Defendant was charged with the felony murder of Yvonne Los. Because he\nwas not the perpetrator, the prosecution proceeded on theories of aiding and\nabetting and conspiracy. Defendant asserts that the evidence supported\ninstructions for the lesser included offense of second degree felony murder based\non a target offense of discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent manner.\n(§ 246.3.) He also contends the jury could have determined that Los was killed\nduring an intentional but unpremeditated shooting, thus constituting second degree\nmurder. Finally, he argues he merely furnished a weapon knowing it might be\nused in a crime. Accordingly, his act ―amounts to nothing more than criminal\nnegligence supporting a voluntary manslaughter conviction.‖13\n       The evidence showed that carjacking was one of the crimes defendant\nformed his gang to commit. He trained them how to do a carjacking and said any\nresisting victim was to be shot. Before the Los killing, defendant had already\n\n13     We question whether a second degree felony-murder instruction would\nhave been appropriate here. ―[The] use of the second degree felony-murder rule\n[is] appropriate when the purpose of the predicate felony was independent of or\ncollateral to an intent to cause injury that would result in death.‖ (People v.\nRobertson (2004) 34 Cal.4th 156, 171.) In Robertson, we held that the trial court\ndid not err in instructing about second degree felony murder based on a violation\nof section 246.3 where the defendant claimed he had fired his gun to frighten the\nmen who were stealing his hubcaps. (Robertson, at p. 173.) Here, however, there\nwas no evidence that Dearaujo used his gun for any other purpose than to commit\na carjacking. We similarly doubt that either second degree murder or voluntary\nmanslaughter were available as lesser included offenses here. We will assume,\nmerely for purpose of argument, that they were.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fdirected two other carjackings by gang members whom he had armed. He had\npersonally carjacked Dale Nonies. On the night of the murder, he told Dearaujo to\nsecure a car and gave him the gun. Defendant specifically said to place the victim\nin the trunk. He clearly contemplated a robbery, not the mere theft of an\nunattended vehicle. Defendant intended that the gun be used to commit a\ncarjacking and, if necessary, to shoot the victim. Dearaujo acted on defendant‘s\ndirection when he approached the car and pointed the gun at Los. Her killing was\nmanifestly a natural and probable consequence of defendant‘s instructions.\n       No substantial evidence supports defendant‘s assertions that he was\nunaware Dearaujo would use the gun or that he did not share Dearaujo‘s purpose.\nNo evidence points to a different intent than Dearaujo‘s use of defendant‘s gun to\ncommit a carjacking and, if necessary, to shoot a resisting victim. Defendant\nasserts the jury might have concluded he only intended that Dearaujo obtain a car,\nnot necessarily commit a carjacking. He argues further the jury could have\ninferred he armed Dearaujo merely for self-defense. There is simply no basis in\nthe evidence for these speculative assertions. As we noted in People v. Mendoza\n(2000) 24 Cal.4th 130, 174, ―[s]peculation is insufficient to require the giving of\nan instruction on a lesser included offense.‖ The fragments of Lyons‘s testimony\non which defendant relies in no way support the instructions he claims were\nlacking. For example, to bolster his argument that the shooting was a reflexive\nand impulsive act rather than a calculated plan to kill, defendant asserts that Lyons\ntestified Dearaujo shot the victim in a panic. In the transcript passages he cites,\nhowever, Lyons testified not to Dearaujo‘s panic, but to his own. Again,\ndefendant fails to direct us to any substantial evidence supporting a lesser included\ninstruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f           2. Consciousness of Guilt Instructions (CALJIC Nos. 2.03 & 2.06)\n       Defendant challenges the consciousness of guilt instructions regarding false\nstatements and suppression of evidence (CALJIC Nos. 2.03, 2.06 ) as ―infirm‖\nunder various constitutional provisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th\nAmends.) He urges that they permitted the jury to convict him based on improper\ninferences and were impermissibly argumentative. He alternatively contends that\nthe instructions were unwarranted by the evidence.\n       We have consistently rejected the challenges defendant advances here.\nPeople v. Lopez (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1028, held that neither CALJIC No. 2.03 nor\nNo. 2.06 is argumentative, nor does either generate an impermissible inference of\nguilt. (Lopez, at p. 1075.) People v. Watkins (2012) 55 Cal.4th 999, concluded\nCALJIC No. 2.03 does not direct or compel the drawing of an impermissible\ninference of guilt. (Watkins, at p. 1028; accord, People v. Stitely (2005) 35 Cal.4th\n514, 555; People v. Holloway (2004) 33 Cal.4th 96, 142.) ―Each challenged\ninstruction made clear that the jury ‗may‘ consider certain described conduct as a\ncircumstance tending to prove consciousness of guilt, but each also cautioned that\nsuch conduct is not sufficient by itself to prove guilt, and that the weight or\nsignificance of the conduct, if any, constituted matters for the jury‘s\nconsideration.‖ (Watkins, at p. 1027.) ―These conclusions apply with equal force\nto the case before us and defendant provides no persuasive reason for\nreconsidering the issue.‖ (Lopez, at p. 1075.)\n       Moreover, there was ample evidentiary support for the instructions. There\nwas evidence defendant made false and misleading statements to police about his\ninvolvement in the murder. ―[T]he instruction applied based on defendant‘s\ninconsistent and contradicted statements to police attempting to minimize\ninvolvement in the capital crime.‖ (People v. Stitely, supra, 35 Cal.4th at p. 555;\nPeople v. Kelly (1992) 1 Cal.4th 495, 531.) Similarly, there was evidence\n\n\n                                          23\n\fdefendant subsequently gave the murder weapon to Anthony Post, who then\ndisassembled it. (See People v. Hart (1999) 20 Cal.4th 546, 620-621 [citing cases\ninvolving disposal or attempted disposal of weapons].)\n\n           3. Jury Query Regarding Liability of Principals for Aiding and\n               Abetting Purposes\n       Defendant contends the trial court responded inadequately to a jury inquiry.\nHe asserts the trial court‘s response violated his rights under various constitutional\nprovisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., §§ 1, 7, 15,\n16 & 17.) The claim is meritless.\n       During their deliberations, the jurors sent out two notes regarding aiding\nand abetting liability. The first note asked: ―Need clarification of the law — [¶]\nIf A-B-C-D were involved in planning and talking about a robbery at one place\nand B + C started out to the do the crime [but] [t]hey did not do the planned crime\nbut did another crime in the same area, what would A‘s status be under the law.‖\nThese facts apparently referred to the robbery of the Los Angeles Times\ndistribution center that Dearaujo and Lyons committed after they failed to rob the\nliquor store as defendant had originally directed. The trial court responded: ―In\nresponse to your Question #9, the legal answer is provided in the instructions\nalready provided. The court would refer you to the series on Aiding and Abetting,\nstarting with 3.00. [¶] Note that in your question, whether ―A‖ would be legally\nresponsible for the actual crime ultimately committed would require that the jury\nunanimously find that the committed crime was ‗reasonably foreseeable.‘ That is,\nan aider and abettor (‗A‘ in your hypothetical) is guilty not only of the offense he\nintended to facilitate or encourage, but also of any reasonable foreseeable offense\ncommitted by the person(s) (‗B-C-D‘ in your hypothetical) he aids and abets.‖\n       Later the same day, the court received a second note: ―I want to know if a\nperson is a principal if the non principal commits a crime is the principal just as\n\n\n                                         24\n\fguilty of the crime also.‖ In discussing the note, the court agreed with the\nprosecutor that the answer to the question was covered by CALJIC No. 3.00.\nDefense counsel said: ―But there are —,‖ at which the prosecutor broke in and\nsaid, ―That one instruction answers that question.‖ Defense counsel stated, ―Yes,\nwell —,‖ and the prosecutor continued, ― — which is to what level are principals\nresponsible. Each principal, regardless of the extent or manner of participation, is\nequally guilty, principals included, and its [sic] defined.‖ Defense counsel\nreiterated an earlier objection he had made to all aiding and abetting instructions,\nincluding CALJIC No. 3.00 but acknowledged, ―that language is in 3.00.‖ The\ntrial court said, ―Okay. You objection is noted and the answer is to refer to\ninstruction 3.00.‖ The judge then responded to the jury‘s question as follows:\n―You are referred to Instruction 3.00.‖\n       Defendant contends that the trial court‘s response, referring the jury to\nCALJIC No. 3.00, was inadequate because it did not also refer to CALJIC No.\n8.27. Additionally, he asserts the response showed partiality by the court toward\nthe prosecution.\n       The Attorney General argues the claim is forfeited. The record reveals that\nduring the discussion of the jury‘s note defendant renewed his objection to all\naiding and abetting instructions, including the one to which the court referred the\njury, and the court noted the objection. This is sufficient for us to proceed to the\nmerits of the claim that we reject.\n       Section 1138 requires the court to answer jury requests for clarification on\npoints of law.14 ―If, however ‗ ―the original instructions are themselves full and\n\n14      Section 1138 provides in relevant part: ―After the jury have retired for\ndeliberation, . . . if they desire to be informed on any point of law arising in the\ncase, they must require the officer to conduct them into court. Upon being brought\n                                                           (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                          25\n\fcomplete, the court has discretion under . . . section 1138 to determine what\nadditional explanations are sufficient to satisfy the jury‘s request for\ninformation.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Smithey (1999) 20 Cal.4th 936, 985.) Defendant does\nnot contend that CALJIC No. 3.00 was an incorrect statement of the law but only\nthat, in addition to that instruction, the trial court should also have referred the jury\nto CALJIC No. 8.27.\n        The second note reflects confusion over who qualifies as a principal. A\n―non principal‖ cannot commit a crime because, by definition, one who commits a\ncrime is a principal. CALJIC No. 3.00 explains that concept and clarifies that\naiders and abettors may be liable as principals, even if they do not directly commit\nthe offense. The instruction was sufficient to clarify the jury‘s inquiry. 15\n        CALJIC No. 8.27 simply restates those concepts in the context of the\nparticular offense of felony murder.16 CALJIC No. 8.27 was both read to the jury\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\ninto court, the information required must be given in the presence of, or after\nnotice to, the prosecuting attorney, and the defendant or his counsel . . . .‖\n15      As given here, CALJIC No. 3.00 stated: ―Persons who are involved in\ncommitting or attempting to commit a crime are referred to as principals in that\ncrime. Each principal, regardless of the extent or manner of participation is\nequally guilty. [¶] Principals include, one, those who directly and actively\ncommit or attempt to commit the crime, or, two, those who aid and abet the\ncommission or attempted commission of the crime.‖\n16      As given here, CALJIC No. 8.27 stated: ―If a human being is killed by any\none of several persons engaged in the commission or attempted commission of the\ncrime of robbery, all persons who either directly or actively commit the act\nconstituting the crime, or who with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the\nperpetrator of the crime and with the intent or purpose of committing,\nencouraging, or facilitating the commission of the offense, aid, promote,\nencourage or instigate by acts or advice its commission, are guilty of murder of the\nfirst degree whether the killing is intentional, unintentional or accidental.‖\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\fand given to it in writing. The jury received additional instructions in aiding and\nabetting as well as the elements of robbery and other substantive offenses.\nDefendant fails to demonstrate error.\n       Defendant also argues that in exercising its discretion the court\ndemonstrated partiality to the prosecution. He fails to explain how giving a\ncorrect statement of the law, particularly in the absence of a request for\naugmentation, reflects partiality.\n\n            4. Instruction on Natural and Probable Consequences (CALJIC No.\n                3.02)\n       There are two distinct forms of aider and abettor liability. ―First, an aider\nand abettor with the necessary mental state is guilty of the intended crime.\nSecond, under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, an aider and\nabettor is guilty not only of the intended crime, but also ‗for any other offense that\nwas a ―natural and probable consequence‖ of the crime aided and abetted.‘\n[Citation.]‖ (People v. McCoy (2001) 25 Cal.4th 1111, 1117.) This latter form of\nliability was the basis of the prosecutor‘s theory that defendant aided and abetted\nthe Los murder: he aided and abetted Dearaujo‘s carjacking, the natural and\nprobable consequence of which was that Dearaujo shot and killed Los.\n       The prosecution‘s theory was explained in CALJIC No. 3.02, given here:\n―One who aids and abets another in the commission of a crime is not only guilty of\nthose crimes, but is also guilty of any other crimes committed by a principal which\nis a natural and probable consequence of the crime originally aided and abetted.‖\nThe jury was told that before it could convict defendant it had to find ―beyond a\nreasonable doubt that: [¶] 1. The crime . . . of . . . murder [was] committed; [¶]\n2. That the defendant aided and abetted [that] crime[]; [¶] 3. That a co-principal\nin that crime committed the crime[] of . . . murder[;] and [¶] 4. The crime[]\n\n\n\n\n                                          27\n\fof . . . murder [was] a natural and probable consequence of the commission of the\ncrime[] of robbery.‖\n       Defendant contends the natural and probable consequences doctrine as set\nforth in CALJIC No. 3.02 unconstitutionally imposes criminal liability for mere\nnegligence. ( U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 11th Amends.) We have previously\nrejected similar challenges. (People v. Richardson (2008) 43 Cal.4th 959, 1021;\nPeople v. Coffman and Marlow (2004) 34 Cal.4th 1, 108), and do so again.\n       Alternatively, defendant faults the trial court for omitting the following\nlanguage from the version it gave of CALJIC No. 3.02: ―In determining whether a\nconsequence is ‗natural and probable,‘ you must apply an objective test, based not\non what the defendant actually intended, but on what a person of reasonable and\nordinary prudence would have expected likely to occur. The issue is to be decided\nin light of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident. A ‗natural‘\nconsequence is one which is within the normal range of outcomes that may be\nreasonably expected to occur if nothing unusual has intervened. ‗Probable‘ means\nlikely to happen.‖\n       Defendant was tried in 1998. The ―objective test‖ language was added to\nthe instruction by a 2000 revision. (CALJIC No. 3.02 (2000 rev.) (6th ed. 1997).)\nThe trial court‘s instruction was a complete and accurate statement of the law.\nThere was no error. Defendant fails to demonstrate that the failure to include a\nclarification later included by the CALJIC committee rendered the instruction\ninadequate as given.17 To the extent defendant could have sought a modification\nof the instruction to add the ―objective test‖ language, his failure to have done so\n\n17     The instruction given at defendant‘s trial was prepared by the Committee\non Standard Jury Instructions, Criminal, composed of lawyers and judges under\nthe auspices of the Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\fforfeits any claim of error. (People v. Lang (1989) 49 Cal.3d 991, 1024 [―A party\nmay not complain on appeal that an instruction correct in law and responsive to\nthe evidence was too general or incomplete unless the party requested appropriate\nclarifying or amplifying language‖].)\n\n       D. Trial Court Responses to Jury’s Requests for Clarification\n          Regarding Law of Conspiracy\n       Conspiracy, like aiding and abetting, was presented as a theory of\ndefendant‘s liability, but was not charged as a substantive offense. ―It is long and\nfirmly established that an uncharged conspiracy may properly be used to prove\ncriminal liability for acts of a coconspirator.‖ (People v. Belmontes (1988) 45\nCal.3d 744, 788.)\n       Over defendant‘s objection, the jury was given standard conspiracy\ninstructions, including CALJIC No. 6.10.5, which defined the conspiracy as ―an\nagreement between two or more persons with the specific intent to agree to\ncommit the crime of robbery, and with the further specific intent to commit that\ncrime, followed by an overt act committed in this state by one or more of the\nparties for the purpose of accomplishing the object of the agreement.‖ The jury\nwas also instructed it ―must determine whether the defendant is guilty as a\nmember of the conspiracy to commit the originally agreed upon crime or crimes,\nand, if so, whether the crime alleged in Counts I through XI was perpetrated by a\nco-conspirator in furtherance of that conspiracy and was a natural and probable\nconsequence of the agreed upon criminal objective of that conspiracy.‖\nAdditionally, the jury was instructed that ―[e]ach defendant is individually entitled\nto, and must receive, your determination whether he was a member of the alleged\nconspiracy.‖\n       During deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial court: ―When you deal\nwith conspiracies, is every individual crime the start of a new conspiracy or does\n\n\n                                         29\n\fthe conspiracy start at the first crime and every crime after that is just a\ncontinuance of the original conspiracy.‖ The jury‘s note did not refer to a\nparticular instruction or count as the impetus for the question.\n       The trial court, over defendant‘s objection, responded: ―You, the jury, are\nto determine from the evidence whether a conspiracy was formed. If you find that\na conspiracy was formed, then any crimes committed which you find to be in\nfurtherance of that conspiracy comes within the original conspiracy. All of these\nlegal concepts are included in the instructions previously given starting with\n6.10.5.‖\n       Defendant contends the trial court‘s response was error because, he asserts,\nwhether there was a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies was a factual\nquestion for the jury to decide and the trial court‘s response ―implied (if not\ndirected)‖ there was a single conspiracy. According to defendant, ―[i]f the jury\nhad been permitted to decide for itself whether there was but one conspiracy or a\nnumber of conspiracies, the jury may well have decided the individual\nconspiracies were narrow in scope – a result likely in [defendant‘s] favor.‖\n       The Attorney General argues defendant has forfeited his claim on appeal\nbecause defense counsel failed to specifically object to the trial court‘s response.\nDuring the discussion of the note, defense counsel reiterated his objection to any\nconspiracy instructions because the substantive offense of conspiracy had not been\ncharged. Moreover, defense counsel specifically objected when the court\nproposed telling the jury ―if you find that a conspiracy was established, then any\ncrime committed that is in the furtherance of that conspiracy comes within the\nperimeters of that conspiracy.‖ Although defense counsel grudgingly conceded\nthe ultimate response given by the court did not contain ―any blatant problems,‖ he\nagain noted his objection to any conspiracy instructions. We assume these\n\n\n\n                                           30\n\fobjections were sufficient to preserve the issue on appeal. The claim fails on its\nmerits.\n          Defendant cites decisions of the Court of Appeal for the proposition that the\nnumber of conspiracies is a factual question for the jury. As he concedes,\nhowever, the lower court is split on this question. (Compare People v. Jasso\n(2006) 142 Cal.App.4th 1213 with People v. Liu (1996) 46 Cal.App.4th 1119,\n1133.) Moreover, these decisions involved conspiracy as a charged offense.\nWhere the crime of conspiracy is charged, the factual question of whether there\nwas a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies raises questions of jury unanimity\nand whether the evidence will sustain single or multiple convictions. (See, e.g.,\nJasso, at pp. 1220-1223.) Where, however, conspiracy is a theory of liability and\nnot a charged offense, these considerations do not arise. We need not resolve that\nconflict in the different context of this case.\n          We disagree with defendant‘s assertion that the trial court‘s response to the\nquestion directed the jury to find that only one conspiracy existed. To the\ncontrary, the reference to ―a conspiracy‖ in the first two sentences of the response\nwould not have foreclosed the jury from determining there were multiple\nconspiracies. Also significant was the trial court‘s reference in the third sentence\nto the conspiracy instructions previously given. As noted, those instructions\ninformed the jury it must determine whether defendant was a member of a\nconspiracy for purposes of counts 1 through 11. These instructions allowed the\njury to consider whether there was a single conspiracy encompassing all counts or\nwhether each count was the fruit of its own conspiracy. In short, the trial court‘s\nresponse did not remove from the jury its ability to determine for itself whether\nthere was one conspiracy or multiple conspiracies.\n          Further, it would have made no difference even if some jurors understood\nthe court‘s response in the manner claimed by defendant. Even were we to\n\n                                            31\n\fassume the jury understood the note in the manner defendant urges, any error\nwould have been harmless.18 There was overwhelming evidence that defendant\neither actively participated in or instigated every crime committed by the Pimp-\nStyle Hustlers. Whether the jurors concluded there was single conspiracy\nencompassing multiple counts or that each count constituted a separate conspiracy,\nthe result would have been the same. There is no reasonable probability of a more\nfavorable verdict had the jury been explicitly instructed that it was to determine\nthe number of conspiracies. (People v. Watson (1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836.) 19\n\n\n18      Although defendant appears to argue there is a federal constitutional\ndimension to his claim of error, he neglects to identify the precise constitutional\nright involved or the manner in which it may have been violated. He simply\nasserts he would have benefited had the jury determined there were multiple\nconspiracies, without showing how. Accordingly, the error appears to be one of\nstate law only. Even if we were to subject the claimed error to review under the\nstandard for federal constitutional error, we would find it harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. (See Chapman v. California (1967) 386 U.S. 18; People v.\nHarris (1994) 9 Cal.4th 407, 424-431.)\n19      Defendant raises a somewhat related claim. He asserts that, assuming the\njury concluded there was a single conspiracy, the Circle K robbery could not have\nbeen part of it because it occurred before the formation of his gang. He shows no\nprejudice. The jury was instructed it had to decide whether the various counts\nwere in furtherance of the conspiracy. Assuming the jury found the conspiracy\nbegan when defendant formed the gang, an offense committed beforehand could\nnot have been in furtherance of the conspiracy. More fundamentally, there was\nample evidence defendant aided and abetted the Circle K robbery.\n        Defendant also argues that, because the purpose of the Pimp-Style Hustlers\nconspiracy was to obtain money, the murder of Los, to obtain a car, was not in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy. It is unclear how this relates to his overall\nargument. In any event it is without merit. The evidence amply showed\ndefendant, Dearaujo and Lyons conspired to commit a carjacking and that the\nmurder was a natural and probable consequence of the target offense. Their\nultimate goal, whether to obtain money or transportation or both, is irrelevant.\nThey intended to commit a carjacking. That offense was identified by defendant\nas one of the gang‘s chosen crimes. Whether they ultimately intended to establish\na fleet of stolen cars for the gang‘s use or to liquidate the stolen cars for ready\n                                                          (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                         32\n\f        Finally, defendant contends ―[t]he jury should have been instructed to agree\nunanimously whether there was a single or multiple conspiracies.‖ We have\npreviously rejected that argument when a count of conspiracy has not been\ncharged but the doctrine is merely relied upon as a theory of culpability for the\ncrimes for which the defendant is on trial. (People v. Valdez (2012) 55 Cal.4th 82,\n153-154; People v. Prieto (2003) 30 Cal.4th 226, 251.)\n\n        E. Excusal of Juror No. 10 During Deliberations\n        Defendant asserts Juror No. 10 was improperly dismissed during\ndeliberations, violating his rights under various federal constitutional provisions.\n(U.S. Const., 5th, 6th & 14th Amends.) The claim fails.\n\n             1. Background\n        During deliberations the court and counsel met with Juror No. 10, at her\nrequest. The juror's driver's license was suspended. She wanted to know if jury\nduty counted as community service because she otherwise feared she would be\nunable to drive to court. The court advised her to take it up with the traffic court.\nOn her way out, the juror asked, ―What is not deliberating? If you don‘t have\ncomments, is that considered not deliberating?‖ The court replied: ―Not\ndeliberating is just what it sounds like. A person just sits there with their,\nfiguratively with their arms closed, and they just don‘t discuss the case or the law\nwith other jurors. It‘s like they have pulled away and they won‘t talk about it\nperiod.‖ After the juror left, the prosecutor expressed some concern with the trial\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\ncapital does not negate their intent to commit a carjacking, or remove that crime\nfrom the scope of their conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\fcourt‘s answer. The court recalled the juror to correct any misimpression. The\ncourt said, ―[T]he appropriate response should have been that if the jury has a\nquestion regarding the subject, the foreperson should direct a note to the Court in\nthis regard and then the Court would address to the jury as a whole the subject . . .\nrather than an individual going back and saying, well, the Court told me such and\nsuch, which would be improper.‖\n       Three days later, on the tenth day of deliberation, Juror No. 10 called in\nsick. When contacted by the court clerk about whether she would appear the next\nday, Juror No. 10 said she would call in that afternoon. Later, she telephoned to\nsay she would probably not be in the next day. The bailiff, meanwhile, reported\nthat the other jurors wanted to talk to the court about Juror No. 10‘s absence. The\njurors appeared to be quite agitated. After some discussion with counsel, the trial\ncourt directed the foreman to send a note about the jury‘s concerns.\n       In response, the foreman wrote: ―Regarding juror number 10[.] She does\nnot pay attention to discussion, she appears to be asleep most of the time, doesn‘t\nparticipate [,] constantly has an attitude towards others. [¶] Furthermore, we‘ve\ncompleted the written voting on counts 1-11. She has been seen writting [sic]\ninformation on paper [and] taking it out with her to lunch. When she returns from\nlunch she changes her opinion on how she voted and has questions on the legal\nterminology. This has happened more than once. Upon her return from lunch she\nmentioned at the table that ‗my lawyer can put holes on this interview.‘ [¶] She\nhas also stated that she wants to prolong this due to the fact that she doesn‘t want\nto return to work. This unnecessary delay has caused financial hardship on juror\nnumber 11. [¶] There is a number of issues that other jurors would like to discuss\nwith you. Sorry for the inconvenience. [¶] Juror #3 4/1/98.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\f       The prosecutor argued that the note showed misconduct and suggested that\nthe court talk to the foreman and then to Juror No. 10 the following day. Defense\ncounsel agreed.\n       The foreman, Juror No. 3, told the court the jury‘s procedure was to go\naround the table so each juror could speak. He reported that, while other people\nspoke, Juror No. 10 had her eyes closed. When it came her turn to speak, she\nwould announce she had nothing to say. When asked by the court if Juror No. 10\nwas asleep, Juror No. 3 responded that she would ask questions about subjects\nthey had just finished discussing. Juror No. 3 said, while he had never seen it,\nother jurors reported that Juror No. 10 made notes to herself and, when she\nreturned from lunch, would want to revisit counts she had already voted on and\nwould bring up technical questions. When Juror No. 3 would ask her to write\ndown her thoughts so other jurors could discuss them, she would ―clam[] up.‖ He\nreported that ―[w]hen she disagrees, we try to find out why she disagrees and she\nwon‘t tell us . . . . She just says my opinion is this and that‘s it.‖ He also reported\nthat Juror No. 10 said she wanted the trial to go on as long as possible. Other\njurors believed it was because she did not want to go back to work and perhaps\nintended to file a ―stress case‖ with her employer.\n       Under questioning by the prosecutor, Juror No. 3 reiterated that attempts by\nother jurors to solicit Juror No. 10‘s reasons for her positions were met with\nstatements like, ― ‗Because I believe, because this is the way I believe,‘ but she\ndoesn‘t give a reason why she believes that.‖ Juror No. 3 said in his opinion, Juror\nNo. 10 was not deliberating because ―she does not accept our views at all. She‘s\nclosed her mind. If we break it down step by step, she does not open her mind to\nanything we say.‖ Juror No. 3 also clarified that Juror No. 10‘s statement that her\n―lawyer can put holes in this interview‖ referred to the police interrogation of\ndefendant. He ended by telling the court, ―we‘re all just so frustrated [with Juror\n\n                                          35\n\fNo. 10] we don‘t know where to go,‖ and described their stress — ―A lot of us\naren‘t getting any sleep . . . stomachs are inside out, upside down. I‘m shaking\nright now.‖\n       Defense counsel asked whether the other jurors‘ frustration was only with\nJuror No. 10. Juror No. 3 responded that while everyone had feelings about the\ncase, they were trying to follow the law. He said the ―race issue‖ had been\nbrought up and, as the foreman, ―I tried to put a halt to that right then and there,\nand I think I did, but that came up and we sort of talked about it. [¶] We don‘t\nlook at it that way. I mean, we are looking at the law.‖ Nonetheless he believed\nthat Juror No. 10 may have taken that discussion personally. Juror No. 3 said\nthere had also been a ―blowup‖ in the room but that he had apologized for it.20\n       The court and counsel then questioned six other jurors (Juror Nos. 1, 2, 4,\n5, 6 and 11) on four specific points: (1) whether Juror No. 10 was sleeping during\ndeliberations; (2) Juror No. 10‘s statements about prolonging deliberations to\navoid going back to work; (3) whether Juror No. 10 consulted outside sources on\nthe law; and (4) whether Juror No. 10 refused to deliberate.\n       On the first point, Juror No. 2 stated he had seen Juror No. 10 sleeping\nduring deliberations. The remaining jurors could not say she was sleeping but all\nof them had seen her with her eyes closed for several minutes during which she\ndid not appear to be paying attention to the discussion. One juror mentioned Juror\nNo. 10 had fallen asleep during the trial court‘s instructions.\n       On the second point, Juror Nos. 2 and 6 reported that Juror No. 10 had said\nshe wanted to prolong the deliberations and that she did not want to return to\n\n20     Neither the court nor counsel questioned the foreperson further about the\nnature of the ―blowup‖ or whether it related to the ―race issue.‖ No additional\ninformation on this topic appears in the record. (But see fn. 21, p. 38, post.)\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fwork. The other jurors had not heard her make this statement although Juror No.\n11 had heard from other jurors that Juror No. 10 had made the statement.\n       On the third point, all the jurors told the court they saw Juror No. 10\nmaking notes on scraps of paper she would take with her during lunch breaks. She\nwould return from lunch and change her position on issues the jury had voted on\nearlier. She would present new arguments, sometimes introducing new legal\nterms. Several of the jurors remembered her statement that her lawyer could poke\nholes through defendant‘s statement to police. Juror No. 2 noted that Juror No. 10\nhad an appointment with a lawyer involving custody issues.\n       On the final point, the jurors said Juror No. 10 regularly refused requests to\nexplain her position and to relate it to the law and evidence. For example, Juror\nNo. 1 said Juror No. 10 would say whether she liked or disliked something but\nwould not go into detail and would not discuss the factual or legal basis of her\nopinion. Juror No. 2 said her response when asked to explain her position was,\n―When I‘m ready to tell you, you‘ll find out. When I‘m ready to say something,\nyou‘ll hear from me.‖ Juror No. 2 said Juror No. 10 had been offered the option of\nwriting down her disagreements for discussion and had refused. Juror No. 2 also\nspoke of an incident where Juror No. 10 said, ―I‘m the only African/American in\nthis room and I want to make sure, I have to double check everything.‖ He said,\n―she felt that she was being picked on because of that, and I said, no, you know,\nthat‘s not the issue, and so everybody, everybody has been very, very patient with\nher since she made that statement.‖21\n\n21      It is not clear whether this is the same episode the foreman was referring to\nwhen he mentioned the ―race issue.‖ Defendant suggests that the juror‘s removal\nwas race related because both Juror Nos. 12 and 10 were African-American and\ntheir removal left no African-Americans on his jury. Defendant is African-\nAmerican. He suggests that the other jurors may have wanted to remove these\n                                                           (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                         37\n\f        Juror No. 4 said that during discussions Juror No. 10 would flip through the\npages of the instructions, and ―not [be] with us.‖ She disagreed without stating\nwhy, and said the other jurors had not proven their positions. When they offered\nspecifics, Juror No. 10 would say, ― ‗No, I don‘t believe it.‘ ‖ Juror No. 4 said the\nother jurors had ―bent over backward‖ to allow her to say everything she wanted\nto say and had provided her with her own set of instructions while they shared\nanother among themselves. Juror No. 5 said if there was a disagreement between\nJuror No. 10 and other jurors, she would not explain the basis of her disagreement\n―so we could help understand where she was coming from.‖ Juror No. 6 told the\ncourt that Juror No. 10 would ―refuse to speak with us. She will just say, ‗I‘m not\ntalking to you, if I have something to say, I‘ll say it.‘ ‖ Juror No. 6 added that, on\nissues on which she agreed with other jurors, she was more open but where she\ndisagreed she would not discuss the basis of her disagreement. Juror No. 11 said\nJuror No. 10 would participate in discussions during the morning sessions but then\n―clam[] up‖ in the afternoon. When the jurors went around the table to speak and\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\njurors because of their race. The record lends no support to this claim. The\ndismissals of the two jurors came at different points in the trial and for different\nreasons, neither related to race. The only mention of race in the jury room, of\nwhich there is any evidence, is the episode described above in which Juror No. 10\nasserted that because she was African-American she had to ―double check\neverything.‖ The juror‘s life experience as an African-American was certainly a\nlegitimate prism through which she viewed the case but, as her fellow jurors\ncorrectly pointed out, race was not an issue here. Moreover, defendant assumes\nthe remaining jurors were White. Other than Juror No. 10‘s assertion, the record\ndoes not reflect the racial composition of the jury. We do know, from statements\nby the jurors to the court, that they tried to include Juror No. 10 in the\ndeliberations and to draw her out. We reject as unsupported defendant‘s\ninsinuation that racial bias played a role in Juror No. 10‘s dismissal or in the jury‘s\nultimate resolution of the case.\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fit was Juror No. 10‘s turn to speak, she would say, ― ‗I ain‘t got nothing to say,‘\nand that would be it.‖\n       After hearing from seven out of the 12 jurors, the trial court stated, ―it\nseems like we are hearing the same things over and over again.‖ The clerk\nreported that Juror No. 10 had indicated she would probably not be back the\nfollowing day. The court concluded there was credible evidence from the\nstatements of her fellow jurors that Juror No. 10 was sleeping during deliberations.\nThe court noted that ―on many occasions‖ during the trial it had to send the bailiff\nover to ―wake her up, give her cups of water.‖ The court pointed to one example\nwhen the tape of defendant‘s interrogation was being played and the jury followed\nalong with transcripts. ―[S]he would go as long as five pages without turning the\ntranscript and then all of a sudden would kind of start, come awake, and turn\nseveral pages at once and then repeat the process.‖ Based on these observations\nand the statements of her fellow jurors, the court said, ―it is probable . . . that she\ndoes have a problem staying awake.‖\n       The court did not find there was sufficient evidence to conclude either that\nJuror No. 10 wished to prolong the proceedings or was receiving information from\noutside sources.\n       The court concluded it was ―very clear‖ that Juror No. 10 had ―violate[d]\nher jury oath by not deliberating.‖ The court stated, ―You can‘t take a position\nand refuse to discuss the basis for it,‖ and found ―a consistent pattern where . . . if\nit‘s a situation where she is in disagreement with other jurors, simply takes the\nposition and then stonewalls.‖\n       Finally, the court cited ―her inability to participate because of [her] illness.‖\nThe court alluded to the fact that the jury had been given ―a certain time line‖ for\nthe trial that Juror No. 10‘s illness was disrupting. He noted that, given the flu-\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\flike symptoms she had described, she might be contagious. Accordingly, the trial\ncourt excused her.\n       Defense counsel objected to the dismissal. He argued it was unclear\nwhether Juror No. 10‘s unwillingness to express her opinion was on minor or\nimportant issues. He argued further if she had already made her point and did not\nwish to restate it declining to do so did not constitute a refusal to deliberate. The\ncourt clarified that it found the areas of disagreement to be on important issues and\nthat, while there were instances when Juror No. 10 did discuss evidence, ―it‘s\npretty clear that the norm is that she has a predisposition not to deliberate.‖\n       The court excused Juror No. 10 and the clerk so informed her.\nNonetheless, Juror No. 10 appeared the next day and accused her fellow jurors of\nnot beginning deliberations anew when previous jurors had been excused. She\nreported she was taking antibiotic and pain medicine for an ear infection and was\n―like drugged, dragging.‖ Her statements regarding renewed deliberations are\ndiscussed below.\n\n           2. Discussion\n       The trial court may discharge a juror for good cause at any time, including\nduring deliberations, if the court finds that the juror is ―unable to perform his or\nher duty.‖ (§ 1089.) As noted, ―[w]e review a trial court‘s decision to discharge a\njuror under an abuse of discretion standard, and will uphold the decision if the\nrecord supports the juror‘s disqualification as a demonstrable reality.‖ (People v.\nWilson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 26.) The trial court gave three reasons for excusing\nJuror No. 10: (1) she was sleeping during deliberations; (2) she violated her oath\nby refusing to deliberate; and (3) her illness would delay the proceedings\nindefinitely. Because the first reason is sufficient to uphold the court‘s ruling, it is\n\n\n\n\n                                          40\n\funnecessary for us to address the court‘s remaining grounds. (People v. Johnson\n(1993) 6 Cal.4th 1, 21-22.)\n       Sleeping during trial constitutes good cause for the dismissal of a juror.\n(People v. Bonilla (2007) 41 Cal.4th 313, 350.) ―When the trial court receives\nnotices that such cause may exist it has an affirmative obligation to investigate.\n[Citations.] Both the scope of any investigation and the ultimate decision whether\nto discharge a given juror are committed to the sound discretion of the trial\ncourt.‖ (Ibid.)\n       In People v. Johnson, supra, 6 Cal.4th 1, the trial court excused a juror after\nfinding the juror had fallen asleep at trial. ―The court, its two deputies, and the\nprosecutor each stated on the record that they had observed [the juror] exhibiting\nvarious physical indicia of sleep, including eye closures, head nodding, and\nslumping in his chair.‖ (Id. at p. 21.) We concluded the trial court had properly\ndischarged the juror, notwithstanding the defendant‘s claim that the court had not\ninquired of the juror whether he had been asleep. (Id. at pp. 21-22.)\n       In People v. Ramirez (2006) 39 Cal.4th 398, the court excused a juror over\nthe defendant‘s objection after receiving a note from the foreperson ―that the juror\nhad fallen asleep on two occasions.‖ (Id. at p. 456.) The court questioned the\nforeperson who confirmed that he had seen the juror sleeping. The court added\nthat it had noticed the juror ― ‗behaving as if he were dozing off from time to\ntime.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 457.) Based on the foreperson‘s statements and the court‘s own\nobservations, the court excused the juror for sleeping. We affirmed: ―The judge‘s\nobservations were consistent with the testimony of the jury foreperson that the\njuror had fallen asleep twice during deliberations. The trial court, therefore, did\nnot abuse its discretion in discharging the juror.‖ (Id. at p. 458.)\n       Here, the record is more extensive than in Johnson and Ramirez. Juror No.\n2 affirmatively stated that he had seen Juror No. 10 sleeping during deliberations,\n\n                                          41\n\fadding that he sat ―two seats away from her, so I can see her very clearly.‖ Five\nother jurors described behavior consistent with sleeping. The juror closed her eyes\nand leaned back in her chair, once for at least 15 minutes. She would later appear\nto have no idea what the other jurors had been discussing while she was in this\nposture. One of the jurors reported Juror No. 10 slept during instructions. To this\ntestimony, the court added its own observations that ―on many occasions‖ it had to\nhave the bailiff wake her and bring her water. The court referred to a specific\ninstance while the jury listened to the recording of defendant‘s statement to the\npolice. This record reveals no abuse of discretion in excusing the juror for\nsleeping.\n\n       F. Alleged Coercion of Verdict\n       Defendant contends that the verdict reached following the dismissal of\nJuror No. 10 was the product of coercion, violating his rights under various\nconstitutional provisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.) His claim\ncan also be understood to assert that the jury failed to deliberate anew as\ninstructed. In either case, he cites allegations of juror misconduct made by Juror\nNo. 10 regarding deliberations after previous jurors had been dismissed and the\nspeed with which the jury reached its verdict after Juror No. 10 was excused. We\nconsider and reject both aspects of his challenge.\n\n            1. Background\n       Juror No. 10 was excused from the jury on Wednesday, April 1, and\nnotified of her excusal that afternoon. The next morning, Thursday, April 2, Juror\nNo. 10 appeared in court and accused her fellow jurors of not beginning\ndeliberations anew when two alternates had been seated. According to Juror No.\n10, the remaining jurors asked the newcomers what they thought and told them\nwhat the previous group had decided. She elaborated: ―[W]e spent a week and a\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\fhalf in there before we could even vote on issues, and then you come in and you\njust say how you felt about certain charges, and then we listened and we said that‘s\nhow we felt, and then we voted.‖ She also said the jury had voted on 11 charges\nbefore the alternates were seated.22 After Juror No. 10 left the courtroom, defense\ncounsel indicated he would seek a mistrial because the jury failed to deliberate\nanew. The court said it would consider the motion when it was filed, but pointed\nout ―starting anew does not necessarily mean that the jury is required to repeat\nevery step and every word and every nuance of [its] deliberations, including\nasking for the same testimony to be reread or the same words to be spoken or\nthings of that nature.‖\n       Following that discussion, the court convened the jury and Juror No. 10‘s\nreplacement, Alternate Juror No. 4. The court read CALJIC No. 17.51, which\nadmonished the jury not to consider for any purpose the replacement of Juror No.\n10 and to ―set aside and disregard all past deliberations and begin deliberating\nanew. This means that each remaining original juror must set aside and disregard\nthe earlier deliberations as if they had not taken place.‖\n       The reconstituted jury began deliberations at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday, April\n2 and adjourned at 4:10 p.m. During that time, it requested that portions of\nMondre Weatherspoon‘s testimony be read back. They agreed on verdicts for nine\nof the 11 counts. The jury did not deliberate on Friday, April 3. The following\nMonday, April 6, deliberations resumed at 9:30 a.m. That afternoon, the jury sent\na note requesting clarification of the phrase ―to wit‖ in an instruction concerning\n\n\n\n22      Those votes were not formally returned as verdicts. Final verdicts on all\ncounts were returned only after Juror No. 10 was excused and a third alternate\nseated.\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\fsentence enhancements. At 2:15 p.m., the jury reached verdicts on the remaining\ntwo counts.\n       Defendant‘s mistrial motion was heard after the verdicts were recorded but\nbefore the penalty phase began. The trial court rejected the idea that CALJIC No.\n17.51 required the jury to backtrack and duplicate every discussion it had had\nbefore the new jurors were seated. ―It means in good faith they start from the\nbeginning discussing issues and show a willingness to include the newly seated\njuror or jurors so that all decisions are made with all 12 jurors participating in that\nfunction.‖ The court noted that, between the time the two alternates were seated\nand Juror No. 10 made her allegations, the jury had requested readbacks and\nsubmitted a question. ―[S]o I am satisfied that they were deliberating within the\nlegal meaning of Section 17.51; therefore, the motion for mistrial is denied.‖\n\n           2. Discussion\n       There is no merit to defendant‘s claim that the reconstituted jury was\ncoerced into reaching a verdict or that it failed to deliberate anew. ―We presume\n[it] followed the trial court‘s instructions to begin the deliberation anew [citation],\nand defendant‘s speculation to the contrary does not persuade us to conclude\notherwise.‖ (People v. Fuiva (2012) 53 Cal.4th 622, 716.) Here, that presumption\nis supported by the actual, deliberative conduct of the reconstituted jury. It\nrequested a readback and asked the court for clarification of instructions.\nDefendant asserts the length of deliberations is evidence the jury did not follow\nthe instruction to begin deliberations anew. ―But the brevity of the deliberations\nproves nothing. [Citations.] The newly constituted jury was not required to\ndeliberate for the same length of time as the original jury, nor was it required to\nreview the same evidence. When, as here, there are no indications to the contrary,\nwe assume that the jurors followed the trial court‘s instructions and started afresh.\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\f[Citation.]‖ (People v. Leonard (2007) 40 Cal.4th 1370, 1413.) Defendant‘s\nfurther claim that the trial court‘s excusal of Juror Nos. 10 and 12 communicated\nto the jury the court‘s view that defendant was guilty is meritless. The two jurors\nwere excused at different points in the trial and for different reasons. Nothing said\nby the court on either occasion communicated any court opinion as to defendant‘s\nguilt or innocence.\n       Defendant asserts that Juror No. 10‘s accusations of misconduct are\nevidence that the jury refused to deliberate anew. We assume, without deciding,\nher statements were admissible under Evidence Code section 1150, subdivision\n(a).23 Plainly, the trial court rejected the former juror‘s implicit belief that\nredeliberation required repetition of every step taken to the point when the new\njurors were seated. Thus, contrary to defendant‘s claim, the trial court was not\nobliged to instruct the jury to discontinue engaging in the \"improper practices\"\nasserted by Juror No. 10. Moreover, Juror No. 10 obviously was not present\nduring the deliberations of the jury that actually rendered the verdicts. Finally, to\nthe extent defendant faults the court for failing to conduct a more thorough\ninvestigation, the contention is forfeited by his failure to raise it below. In any\nevent, the trial court acted within its discretion as to the scope of any such\ninvestigation. (People v. Alexander (2010) 49 Cal.4th 846, 927.)\n\n\n\n23      That statute provides: ―Upon an inquiry as to the validity of a verdict, any\notherwise admissible evidence may be received as to statements made, or conduct,\nconditions, or events occurring, either within or without the jury room, of such\ncharacter as is likely to have influenced the verdict improperly. No evidence is\nadmissible to show the effect of such statement, conduct, condition, or event upon\na juror either in influencing him to assent or to dissent from the verdict or\nconcerning the mental processes by which it was determined.‖ (Evid. Code,\n§ 1150, subd. (a).)\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\f       G. Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Robbery-Murder Special\n          Circumstance\n       Defendant contends insufficient evidence supported the robbery-murder\nspecial circumstance based on an aiding and abetting theory. According to\ndefendant, the evidence failed to establish he was a major participant in the target\noffense or exhibited reckless indifference to human life as required by section\n190.2, subdivision (d).\n       In considering such a challenge ― ‗we review the entire record in the light\nmost favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial\nevidence — that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value —\nfrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt.‘ [Citation.] We determine ‗whether, after viewing the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.‘ [Citation.]\nIn so doing, a reviewing court ‗presumes in support of the judgment the existence\nof every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.‘ [Citation.]‖\n(People v. Maciel (2013) 57 Cal.4th 482, 514-515.) ―The same standard applies to\nspecial circumstance allegations.‖ (People v. Tully (2012) 54 Cal.4th 952, 1007.)\n       At the time of defendant‘s trial, section 190.2, subdivision (d) stated in\nrelevant part: ―[E]very person, not the actual killer, who, with reckless\nindifference to human life and as a major participant, aids [and] abets . . . in the\ncommission of a felony enumerated in paragraph (17) of subdivision (a) which\nfelony results in the death of some person or persons, who is found guilty of\nmurder in the first degree therefor, shall suffer death or confinement in state prison\nfor life without the possibility of parole, in any case in which a special\ncircumstance enumerated in paragraph (17) of subdivision (a) . . . has been found\nto be true . . . .‖ Robbery is one of the enumerated felonies. (§ 190.1,\n\n\n\n                                          46\n\fsubd. (a)(17)(A).) A major participant need not be the ringleader (People v. Proby\n(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 922, 931), but a ringleader is a major participant (see\nPeople v. Marshall (1990) 50 Cal.3d 907, 938). ― ‗[R]eckless indifference to\nhuman life‘ is commonly understood to mean that the defendant was subjectively\naware that his or her participation in the felony involved a grave risk of death.‖\n(People v. Estrada (1995) 11 Cal.4th 568, 577; see, for further discussion, People\nv. Banks (2015) 61 Cal.4th 788.)\n       As he does in other contexts, defendant continues to insist that his only\nparticipation in the murder was supplying the gun and that he had no idea\nDearaujo and Lyons would commit a carjacking or kill a resisting victim. His\ninterpretation of evidence is contrary to the governing standard of review and the\nproven facts.\n       Defendant was the founder, ringerleader and mastermind behind the Pimp-\nStyle Hustlers. He formed the gang the day after he, Dearaujo and Weatherspoon\ncommitted a robbery during which Dearaujo used defendant‘s gun. The gang‘s\npurpose was to commit robbery and carjacking in order to buy a home and build a\nstock portfolio. Defendant gave the gang members a carjacking tutorial and\ninstructed them that a resisting victim was to be shot.\n       Defendant directed the attempted carjacking of Phillips and Nolin and that\nof DeGeorge. He personally robbed Nonies and tried to carjack Brodbeck.\nDefendant also ordered Dearaujo and Lyons to rob a liquor store, which led to the\nrobbery at the Los Angeles Times distribution center. In each case, defendant\nchose and armed the gang member he commissioned to commit the crime or was\nhimself armed with the gun.\n       The circumstances of the murder followed the pattern of the crimes that\npreceded and followed it. Defendant directed Dearaujo to go to the Family Fitness\nCenter and to carjack a specific type of car, which he described in detail. He gave\n\n                                         47\n\fDearaujo the gun along with a bandana to cover his face. He described where they\nshould meet after the crime. He reminded Dearaujo to put the victim in the trunk.\nDefendant himself told police he understood that Dearaujo was ―gonna jack a car‖\nand that he had repeatedly instructed gang members to shoot a victim who\nresisted. Defendant later commended Dearaujo and Lyons and awarded them\nstripes for the murder. His claim of tangential involvement and ignorance are\nmanifestly at odds with the evidence arrayed against him. The facts adduced are\nmore than sufficient to uphold the special circumstance finding that defendant was\na major participant and acted with reckless indifference to human life.\n                           III. PENALTY PHASE ISSUES\n\n       A. Defense Counsel’s Asserted Conflict of Interest\n       Defendant contends his public defender had a conflict of interest because\nhis office had previously represented prosecution witnesses who appeared at the\npenalty phase. He asserts the conflict violated his rights under various\nconstitutional provisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art.\nI, § 15.) We reject the claim.\n\n           1. Background\n       After Donald Deloney testified about violent activities he and defendant\nhad engaged in while in jail, a representative from the public defender‘s office,\nFloyd Zagorsky, requested an in camera hearing to discuss a possible conflict of\ninterest.24 Zagorsky related that the office had previously represented Deloney.\nThat prior representation created a conflict of interest because Zargorsky believed\n\n\n24     Zagorsky is identified in the record only as a member of the public\ndefender‘s office making a special appearance on defendant‘s behalf. No further\nexplanation is given about why he, rather than defendant‘s trial counsel, also a\npublic defender, brought this conflict to the court‘s attention.\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\fthere was material in Deloney‘s files potentially useful for his cross-examination.\nLater, Zagorsky reported his office had represented three other prosecution\nwitnesses — David Ramirez, Christopher Willis and Timothy Goodfield.\nZagorsky eventually said he believed there was also a conflict as to four additional\nprosecution witnesses; Arturo Alatorre, Dale Foster, Michael Hanna and Martin\nSanchez, all of whom had been represented by the public defender‘s office.\nDefendant‘s counsel, Deputy Public Defender Wright, informed the court he had\nnot represented any of these witnesses and did not have any confidential\ninformation about them. Specifically addressing Deloney, Wright argued he did\nnot have an actual conflict of interest just because another public defender had\nrepresented Deloney. Zargorsky took the position that an actual conflict existed\nwhen anyone in the public defender‘s office reviewed the files of former clients\nand declared a conflict. The trial court did not find a conflict of interest. 25\n\n           2. Discussion\n       To successfully establish a conflict of interest, ―defendant must show the\nexistence of an actual or potential conflict ‗that adversely affected counsel‘s\nperformance.‘ [Citations.] A conflict of interest may arise if counsel‘s former\nclient is a prosecution witness in the case against the defendant. [Citations.] This\nis because counsel‘s duty not to reveal confidential information acquired during\nthe attorney-client relationship creates conflicting obligations to multiple clients\nthat ‗effectively seal[s] his lips on crucial matters.‘ [Citation.] As we recognized\nin People v. Cox (2003) 30 Cal.4th 916, 949, however, courts have held that no\n\n\n\n25    The court ordered Wright not to examine his office‘s files on the\nprosecution witnesses for impeachment material but did not preclude him from\ndeveloping such material from his own independent investigation.\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\factual or potential conflict of interest arises when the attorney does not possess\nsuch confidential information.‖ (People v. Clark (2011) 52 Cal.4th 856, 983-984.)\n        Here, Deputy Public Defender Wright told the court he had not represented,\nnor did he possess, any confidential information about the prosecution witnesses in\nquestion. ―[Wright], as an officer of the court, was in the best position to assess\nwhether a conflict of interest existed or was likely to arise.‖ (People v. Clark\n(1993) 5 Cal.4th 950, 1001.) ―[T]he court may rely on the representations of\ndefense counsel that no conflict exists.‖ (People v. Lawley (2002) 27 Cal.4th 102,\n146.)\n        Notwithstanding Wright‘s representations, defendant insists an actual\nconflict existed because Zagorsky had declared one based on information in client\nfiles. An analogous argument was made in People v. Clark, supra, 52 Cal.4th 856.\nThere, Deputy Public Defender Martinez conceded she had not personally\nrepresented a prosecution witness previously represented by her office, nor had\nshe obtained information developed by another public defender during the\nattorney-client relationship. Nonetheless, she declared a conflict. The defendant\nin Clark argued that her declaration distinguished the case from earlier cases like\nLawley in which no conflict had been declared. We rejected the claim. ―That\nMartinez declared a conflict is not dispositive of its existence, however.‖ (Clark,\nat p. 984.) Given Martinez‘s concessions, we concluded, based on the totality of\nthe circumstances, that there was ―no showing of an actual or potential conflict of\ninterest [here].‖ (Ibid.) Similarly, there is no showing of an actual or potential\nconflict of interest in this case, Zagorsky‘s statement notwithstanding.\n        In a related claim, defendant suggests that the prosecution withheld\nimpeachment evidence about Deloney and other penalty phase prosecution\nwitnesses. (Brady v. Maryland (1963) 373 U.S. 83.) Not only is the claim\nforfeited because it was not made below, nothing in the record supports the\n\n                                         50\n\fexistence of any undisclosed impeachment evidence known to the prosecution.\nThe claim fails as it is based on pure speculation.\n\n       B. Victim Impact Evidence Claims\n       Defendant challenges the victim impact evidence as irrelevant and\nprejudicial and asserts its admission violated his rights under various constitutional\nprovisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.) He contends further that\nthe trial court erred by failing to give sua sponte a limiting instruction on the use\nof the victim impact evidence. Many of defendant‘s specific claims, including his\nclaim of instructional error, are forfeited. All are without merit.\n       ― ‗The Eighth Amendment does not prohibit the admission of evidence\nshowing how a defendant‘s crimes directly impacted the victim‘s family, friends,\nand the community as a whole, unless such evidence is ―so unduly prejudicial‖\nthat it results in a trial that is ―fundamentally unfair.‖ [Citations.] Likewise, under\nstate law, victim impact evidence is admissible as a circumstance of the crime\nunder section 190.3, factor (a), so long as it ―is not so inflammatory as to elicit\nfrom the jury an irrational or emotional response untethered to the facts of the\ncase.‖ [Citations.]‘ ‖ (People v. Pearson (2013) 56 Cal.4th 393, 466-467.)\n― ‗[T]he state has a legitimate interest in ― ‗counteracting the mitigating evidence\nwhich the defendant is entitled to put in, by reminding the sentencer that just as the\nmurderer should be considered as an individual, so too the victim is an individual\nwhose death represents a unique loss to society and in particular to [her]\nfamily.‘ ‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Linton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1203.)\n       Defendant objects to the quantity, scope and nature of the victim impact\ntestimony, asserting that the 10 victim impact witnesses consumed a fifth of the\nprosecution‘s penalty phase case. He objected, however, only to the testimony of\nthree of those witnesses, Los‘s fiancé, Paul Petrosky and her coworkers\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\fChristopher Reusch and Captain Margaret Foltz. He also objected to admission of\na video of the dormitory dedication in the victim‘s honor, and another depicting a\nseries of still photographs of the victim set to music. The trial court admitted both\ntapes but directed that the music accompanying the second be muted to avoid\nevocation of an emotional response. The court also properly allowed the\nprosecution to call the three nonfamily member witnesses to whom defendant\nobjected. Victim impact testimony is not limited to testimony of family members.\n(People v. Pollock (2004) 32 Cal.4th 1153, 1183.) Defendant did not object to the\ntestimony of the victim‘s family members or her former husband. His claims\nregarding their testimony are forfeited. (Evid. Code, §353; Pollock, at p. 1183.)\nDefendant asserts any objection would have been futile in view of the trial court‘s\nadmission of other testimony and videos. The argument fails. The trial court\ncarefully listened to defendant‘s objections, modifying one exhibit by excluding\nthe music. We will not assume the trial court would have been any less\nconscientious had defendant timely objected to the evidence he challenges here.\n       In any event, defendant‘s claims are meritless. First, as to number. The 10\nvictim impact witnesses constituted 20 percent of the prosecution‘s case. In other\nwords, 80 percent of the prosecution‘s phase was directed at other matters,\nprimarily defendant‘s propensity for violence. Further, any argument attempting\nto put a numerical limit on evidence of this nature is of minimal persuasiveness.\nThe question is the qualitative fairness of the evidence, not an arbitrary\nquantification. The testimony of each victim impact witness was relatively brief.\nThe testimony of Los‘s father, for example, consists of 12 pages; her mother‘s,\neight; her son‘s, two. The most extensive testimony, that of her fiancé, consumes\n22 pages. The evidence, representing three generations of the victim‘s family, her\nformer husband, coworkers and current fiancé, was neither unduly inflammatory\nnor unfairly prejudicial. (See People v. Taylor (2010) 48 Cal.4th 574, 646 [proper\n\n                                         52\n\fto admit victim impact testimony of six family members representing four\ngenerations of the victim‘s close family].) The evidence was ― ‗very typical of the\nvictim impact evidence we routinely permit.‘ ‖ (People v. Pearson, supra, 56\nCal.4th at p. 467.)\n       Defendant‘s contends that victim impact evidence should be limited to\ntestimony that describes the impact on family members present at the scene or\nimmediately thereafter, and to those effects known or reasonably knowable to\ndefendant at the time of the murder. We have previously rejected these\narguments. (People v. Pollock, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 1183.) So too have we\nrejected the argument advanced here that victim impact evidence should provide\nno more than a quick glimpse into the victim‘s life. ―The People are entitled to\npresent a ‗ ―complete life histor[y] [of the murder victim] from early childhood to\ndeath.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Garcia (2011) 52 Cal.4th 706, 751.) Nor did the trial court\nerr in admitting the videotape of the dedication ceremony. In People v. Huggins\n(2006) 38 Cal.4th 175, we held that the testimony that the victim‘s ―community. . .\nmourned her death by placing a bronze statue of her at the . . . public library‖ was\npermissible. (Id. at p. 239.) Admission of the videotape of still photographs of the\nliving victim was likewise within the court‘s discretion. (People v. Linton, supra,\n56 Cal.4th at pp. 1202-1204.)\n       Defendant contends further that the contrast between the victim‘s life and\nhis own invited the jury to draw invidious comparisons. In support, he asserts that\nthe prosecutor explicitly urged the jury to make these comparisons in her closing\nargument and, further, improperly raised the issue of race. Defendant failed to\nobject to any of the identified statements, forfeiting the claim. (People v. Lopez,\nsupra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1073.) The claim is also without merit. The contrast the\nprosecutor drew between the victim‘s positive effect on the lives she touched and\ndefendant‘s violent crimes was reasonable commentary on the weighing of\n\n                                         53\n\faggravating and mitigating circumstances and fell within the wide range of\npermissible argument. (See People v. Dykes (2009) 46 Cal.4th 731, 789-791.)\nThe prosecutor‘s fleeting reference to the ―Crips‖ when explaining the nature of\ndefendant‘s gang was not an appeal to race, directly or implicitly. Her\ncharacterization of defendant as ―sociopathic‖ was consistent with the evidence\nand fell within the permissible range of argument. (People v. Zambrano (2007) 41\nCal.4th 1082, 1172-1173.)\n       Defendant also challenges the court‘s instructions regarding consideration\nof this evidence. The trial court read CALJIC No. 8.84.1, which stated in part:\n―You must neither be influenced by bias nor prejudice against the defendant, nor\nswayed by public opinion or public feelings. In your consideration of whether the\nsentence of death is appropriate, you should not consider the race, color, religious\nbeliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or the victim.‖ Defendant asserts\nthis instruction was insufficient to guide the jury in the consideration of victim\nimpact evidence and that the court, sua sponte, should have provided an\ninstruction to that end. Defendant‘s claim is forfeited by his failure to request\nclarification or modification of the instruction. (People v. Guerra (2006) 37\nCal.4th 1067, 1134.) Defendant asserts such a request would have been futile.\nWe reject it for the same reason we rejected his previous claim of futility.\nMoreover, we have consistently ―rejected the argument that a trial court must\ninstruct the jury not to be influenced by emotion resulting from victim impact\nevidence.‖ (People v. Carey (2007) 41 Cal.4th 109, 134.) We do so again.\n\n       C. Instructional Claims\n               1. Lingering Doubt\n       Defendant assigns error for refusal to give a lingering doubt instruction.\n―There is no federal or state right to such an instruction. [Citations.] Rather, we\n\n\n\n                                          54\n\fhave held that ‗the standard instructions on capital sentencing factors, together\nwith counsel‘s closing argument, are sufficient to convey the lingering doubt\nconcept to the jury.‘ [Citations.] Defendant cites no persuasive reason to revisit\nthis conclusion.‖ (People v. Edwards (2013) 57 Cal.4th 658, 765; accord, People\nv. Rogers (2013) 57 Cal.4th 296, 348-349; People v. Streeter (2012) 54 Cal.4th\n205, 265-266.)\n                 2. CALJIC No. 8.85\n       Defendant contends that CALJIC No. 8.85, the standard instruction\nidentifying the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, is ―constitutionally\nflawed.‖ The defect, according to defendant, is that the instruction failed to advise\nthe jury which factors were aggravating, which were mitigating, and which could\nbe considered as either mitigating or aggravating depending of the jury‘s view of\nthe evidence. ―As defendant acknowledges, we have in the past repeatedly\nrejected [this] contention[]. Thus, we have held that the trial court is not obligated\nto identify which factors are mitigating and which are aggravating . . . .‖ (People\nv. Lewis (2008) 43 Cal.4th 415, 532; People v. Farnam (2002) 28 Cal.4th 107,\n191.) We decline to reconsider this precedent.\n\n           3. CALJIC No. 8.88\n       Defendant raises familiar challenges to CALJIC No. 8.88, the standard jury\ninstruction on how to weigh the aggravating and mitigating evidence. As\ndefendant acknowledges, we have in the past rejected each of these contentions:\n―The court was not required to instruct the jury that (1) it could return a verdict of\nlife imprisonment without possibility of parole even if the circumstances in\naggravation outweighed those in mitigation; (2) it was required to return a verdict\nof life without possibility of parole if it found that the aggravating factors did not\noutweigh the mitigating factors or that death was not the appropriate punishment;\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\for (3) it could return a verdict of life without possibility of parole even in the\ncomplete absence of mitigating evidence. [Citations.] The term ‗so substantial‘ as\nused in CALJIC No. 8.88 is not unconstitutionally vague [citation] and does not\nimproperly direct a verdict in favor of death if the jury finds aggravation\noutweighs mitigation [citation].‖ (People v. Whalen (2013) 56 Cal.4th 1, 89.)\n―Finally, the trial court need not instruct the jury that life imprisonment without\npossibility of parole is presumed to be the appropriate penalty unless the\nprosecution proves to the contrary. [Citation.] We decline defendant‘s invitation\nto revisit these holdings.‖ (People v. Lewis, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 534.)\n\n       D. Trial Court Response to Jury Request for Clarification Regarding\n          Life Without Possibility of Parole\n       Defendant requested an instruction that, if sentenced to death, the jury\n―must assume . . . the defendant . . . will be executed in the gas chamber or by\nlethal injection,‖ and that, if sentenced to life without parole, the jury must\n―assume that he will not be paroled.‖ The court declined to give the instruction.\nInstead, it gave the jury CALJIC No. 8.84: ―It is the law of this state that the\npenalty for a defendant found guilty of murder of the first degree shall be death or\nconfinement in the state prison for life without possibility of parole in any case in\nwhich the special circumstances alleged in this case has been specially found to be\ntrue. [¶] Under the law of this state, you must now determine which of these\npenalties shall be imposed on the defendant.‖\n       During deliberations, the jury sent the court the following note: ―If we vote\nfor life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Does that mean no good\ntime off at all. Or he may be able to get out in 40 or 50 yrs or what ever. Will he\nspend his natural life in prison and never get out. [¶] If we vote for death\npenalty can the judge overturn our decision?‖\n\n\n\n\n                                           56\n\f        After discussing the issue, and with the reluctant agreement of defense\ncounsel, the court responded to the first question: ―[Y]ou are not to speculate on\nsuch issues but are to follow the court‘s instruction previously given.‖ Similarly,\nthe court replied to the second question: ―[Y]ou[] are instructed that you are not to\nspeculate as to such issues but instead are instructed to concentrate on your\nresponsibilities and functions as you have previously been instructed.‖ The trial\ncourt‘s response was consistent with our recommended instruction on this point in\nPeople v. Letner and Tobin, supra, 50 Cal.4th at page 206.\n        Defendant now contends that both the court‘s response and CALJIC No.\n8.84 were inadequate to properly convey the jury‘s sentencing responsibilities.\nHis arguments rest on Simmons v. South Carolina (1994) 512 U.S. 154 and Shafer\nv. South Carolina (2001) 532 U.S. 36, a pair of United States Supreme Court\ndecisions we have previously distinguished in decisions that rejected the same\narguments defendant advances here. (People v. Ervine (2009) 47 Cal.4th 745,\n810-812; People v. Wallace (2008) 44 Cal.4th 1032, 1089-1091; People v. Abilez\n(2007) 41 Cal.4th 472, 527-528; People v. Prieto, supra, 30 Cal.4th at pp. 269-\n271.)\n\n        E. Asserted Disproportionality of Death Sentence\n        Defendant advances two proportionality claims. First, he argues that the\ndeath penalty is disproportionate when applied to a defendant convicted of felony\nmurder as an aider and abettor because the statute does not require proof that he\nacted with a culpable state of mind, permitting him to be executed for an\nunintentional or accidental killing. Second, he asserts his punishment is\ndisproportionate to his culpability under a Dillon analysis. (People v. Dillon\n(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441.) His arguments fail.\n\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f       As noted above, section 190.2, subdivision (d) permits the imposition of a\ndeath sentence for a defendant who aids and abets the commission of a robbery\nthat results in death when it is proven the defendant acted with reckless\nindifference to human life and was a major participant in the commission of the\nfelony. ―Th[is] portion of the statutory language . . . derives verbatim from the\nUnited States Supreme Court‘s decision in Tison v. Arizona (1987) 481 U.S.\n137 . . . . In Tison, the court held that the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit as\ndisproportionate the imposition of the death penalty on a defendant convicted of\nfirst degree felony murder who was a ‗major participant‘ in the underlying felony,\nand whose mental state is one of ‗reckless indifference to human life.‘ [Citation.]\nThe incorporation of Tison‘s rule into section 190.2(d) — in express terms —\nbrought state capital sentencing law into conformity with prevailing Eighth\nAmendment doctrine.‖ (People v. Estrada, supra, 11 Cal.4th at p. 575.)\nAccordingly, we reject defendant‘s claim that his conviction under this section\nviolates the Eighth Amendment. The assertion in his reply brief that Tison is no\nlonger good law must be addressed to the United States Supreme Court.\n       Regarding his second claim, as defendant concedes, we have repeatedly\nheld that intercase proportionality review is not required. (People v. Carpenter\n(1997) 15 Cal.4th 312, 421; People v. Fierro (1991) 1 Cal.4th 173, 253.)\nDefendant nonetheless persists, relying on People v. Dillon, supra, 34 Cal.3d 441,\nto argue that the death penalty is disproportionate to his culpability. Except in age,\ndefendant bears no semblance to the immature 17-year-old defendant in Dillon\nwho shot and killed his victim in a panic and was sentenced to life in prison\ndespite the views of the judge and jury that his sentence was disproportionate to\nhis moral culpability. (Id. at p. 487.) We need not repeat the facts of this case nor\ndefendant‘s role as kingpin in a brief but violent and lethal crime wave. The\npenalty is not disproportionate to his culpability.\n\n                                          58\n\f       F. International Law\n       ―Defendant contends he was denied the right to a fair and impartial trial by\nan independent tribunal in violation of customary international law as well as\ninternational treaties to which the United States is a party. He also claims he\nsuffered racial discrimination in violation of international law at both the guilt and\npenalty phases of his trial. Because defendant has failed to establish his premise\nthat he suffered violations of state or federal constitutional law, or that his rights to\ndue process of law and to be free from racial discrimination were violated, we\nneed not consider the applicability of those international treaties and laws to his\nappeal. [Citation.] In any event, ‗ ―[i]nternational law does not prohibit a\nsentence of death rendered in accordance with state and federal constitutional and\nstatutory requirements. ‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Tafoya (2007) 42 Cal.4th 147, 199; see\nPeople v. Lewis, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 539 [The defendant‘s death sentence did\nnot violate the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights where, when it\nratified the treaty, the United States ― ‗ ― specially reserved the right to impose the\ndeath penalty on any person, except a pregnant woman, duly convicted under laws\npermitting the imposition of capital punishment‖ ‘ ‖]; People v. Jenkins (2000) 22\nCal.4th 900, 1055.)\n\n       G. Constitutional Challenges to the Death Penalty Statute\n       Defendant contends that California‘s death penalty statute is\nconstitutionally invalid in numerous respects. We have repeatedly rejected\nidentical challenges to the statute and we do so again here.\n       ― ‗[T]he California death penalty statute is not impermissibly broad,\nwhether considered on its face or as interpreted by this court.‘ [Citation.] We\nfurther ‗reject the claim that section 190.3, factor (a), on its face or as interpreted\nand applied, permits arbitrary and capricious imposition of a sentence of death.‘\n[Citations.]\n\n\n                                           59\n\f       ―Contrary to defendant‘s assertion, the death penalty statute does not lack\nsafeguards to avoid arbitrary and capricious sentencing, deprive a defendant of the\nright to a jury trial, or constitute cruel and unusual punishment because it does not\nrequire unanimity as to the truth of aggravating circumstances, or findings beyond\na reasonable doubt that an aggravating circumstance (other than § 190.3, factor (b)\nor (c) evidence) has been proved, that the aggravating factors outweighed the\nmitigating factors, or that death is the appropriate sentence.

Watkins, supra, 55\nCal.4th at pp. 1034-1036; People v. Elliott (2012) 53 Cal.4th 535, 593-595.)\n\n\n\n\n                                          60\n\f       H. Cumulative Effect of Error\n       Defendant asserts that numerous alleged errors, committed during both\nphases of his trial, cumulatively prejudiced him and require reversal of his\nconviction and of the judgment of death. We have either found no error or, in\nthose instances where error has been found or assumed, no prejudice. Thus, there\nis no prejudice to accumulate.\n                               IV. RESTITUTION FINE\n       Defendant contends the trial court improperly imposed a $10,000 restitution\nfine without considering his ability to pay. As the Attorney General points out,\nwhen defendant committed his 1993 crimes and when he was sentenced in 1998,\nthe relevant statutes authorized the trial court to consider a defendant‘s ability to\npay in imposing the restitution fine. (Former § 1202.4, subd. (a); former Gov.\nCode, § 13967, subd. (a).) Defendant failed to raise this issue at his sentencing.\nAccordingly, his claim is forfeited. (People v. Avila (2009) 46 Cal.4th 680, 728-\n729.) Further, we assume the court was aware of and exercised its authority.\nDefendant cites no facts supporting a contrary conclusion.\n                                   V. DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n                                                          CORRIGAN, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\nCANTIL-SAKAUYE, C.

Ct. No. CR49662\n____________________________________)\n\n\n        A jury convicted defendant Jack Emmit Williams of the 1993 attempted\nrobbery and first degree murder of Yvonne Los.1 It found true a robbery special-\ncircumstance allegation and enhancement allegations that a principal was armed\nwith a firearm.2\n        Defendant was also convicted of the robbery3 of James Garcia; attempted\nkidnapping with intent to rob4 of Debby Phillips and of Deena Nolin; robbery of\nDale Nonies; attempted robbery5 of Barbara DeGeorge; accessory to the robbery6\nof Patricia Smith Estep and of Charles Estey; robbery of Glynn Brodbeck; and\n\n\n1      Penal Code sections 664, 211, 187, subdivision (a).

As to each count the\njury found a principal was armed with a firearm. For the counts involving Dale\nNonies and Glynn Brodbeck, it found that defendant personally used a firearm.7\n       The jury returned a verdict of death for the murder. The trial court denied a\nmotion to modify the verdict and sentenced defendant to death.8 It also sentenced\ndefendant to a total of 24 years six months, the sentences to run consecutively.\nThis appeal is automatic.9 We affirm the judgment in its entirety.\n                            I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       A. Introduction\n       In May 1993, defendant induced a group of teenagers to form a gang.\nBetween May 14 and May 20, 1993, gang members committed a series of\nrobberies, attempted robberies and kidnappings, carjackings and murder.\nDefendant was convicted of these offenses either as a direct perpetrator, a\nconspirator, an aider and abettor or an accessory.\n\n       B. Prosecution’s Guilt Phase Evidence\n\n           1. The Crimes and Related Events\n\n               a. Events of May 14, 1993\n       In the early morning of May 14, 1993, while defendant drove around\nMoreno Valley with Mondre Weatherspoon and Alonso Dearaujo, the three\ndecided to commit a robbery. Defendant had a .380-caliber handgun that was to\nfeature prominently in the ensuing crimes. He directed Weatherspoon to the\nparking lot of a Circle K convenience store and gave Dearaujo the gun. He and\n\n\n7      Section 12022.5, subdivision (a).\n8      Section 190.4, subdivision (e).\n9      Section 1239, subdivision (b).\n\n\n\n                                           2\n\fWeatherspoon told Dearaujo to go into the store, pull out the gun and demand\nmoney.\n       James Garcia was working at the Circle K when Dearaujo entered, pointed\na gun and told him to ―give him all the money or he‘d blow my . . . head off.‖\nGarcia emptied the cash register into a bag, then turned around and started to\ncount to 100 as directed. When the doorbell chimed, Garcia looked and Dearaujo\nhad gone. He locked the door and called the police\n       Dearaujo ran back to the car and Weatherspoon drove away. Defendant\ntook his gun back and the three split the stolen money.\n\n           2. Formation of the Gang\n       The same night, a group of young people ranging in age from 13 to 19\ngathered at the home of 17-year-old Natalie Dannov, defendant‘s girlfriend.\nDefendant had called the meeting and invited the participants. According to\nDannov and others, defendant talked about forming a gang to commit crimes and\n―have fun.‖ Stolen money would be used to buy a house and invest in stocks.\nThose over 18 would be given bank accounts. Defendant said the gang would be\ncalled the Pimp-Style Hustlers. Gang members would earn ―stripes‖ or ―G\nstripes‖ by committing crimes, carjackings and robberies. At one point, defendant\ndemonstrated how to commit a carjacking, using Dearaujo as his mock victim.\nThe victim was to be put in the car trunk. If a target resisted, defendant directed\nhis members to ―cap ‘em or shoot ‘em.‖ Although others also spoke, defendant\nwas the leader. After his presentation, several people, including defendant, got\ninto a van driven by John Howell and went out looking for someone to carjack.\n\n           3. Attempted Kidnappings for Robbery of Debby Phillips and Deena\n               Nolin (Counts 4 and 5)\n       Defendant directed Howell to the parking lot of Dilly‘s night club.\nDefendant gave George Holland the .380-caliber handgun and told him to commit\n\n\n                                          3\n\fthe carjacking because he was the oldest. He also told 14-year-old Andrew\nCannioto to accompany Holland. Cannioto had a pocket knife.\n         Seeing Deena Nolin and Debby Phillips getting into a car outside the club,\nHolland approached the driver‘s window. When Nolin rolled it down, Holland\npointed a gun through it, and told Nolin to get into the back seat. Cannioto\napproached the passenger side where Phillips sat. The women got out of the car,\nbut Nolin stopped Phillips from getting into the back seat. She said Holland could\ntake the car and their purses, but they would not stay in the car. Phillips ran\ntoward the night club. Holland and Cannioto ran back toward the van. The\npassengers told them not to get in and they kept running. Around 30 minutes later,\ndefendant and Weatherspoon picked them up. They drove to a hotel where\nHolland‘s sister had rented a room to celebrate.\n\n             4. Robbery of Dale Nonies (Count 6)\n         Later that night, defendant, Weatherspoon, Holland and Steven McNair\nwent to find another carjack victim. Holland drove. Around midnight, they saw\nDale Nonies and his girlfriend, Genalyn Doronio, saying goodnight in front of\nDoronio‘s house. Nonies‘s white Ford Escort was parked at the curb. Defendant\nand Weatherspoon got out of the car. Defendant pointed his gun at the couple and\ndemanded Nonies‘s car key and wallet. Nonies asked to keep his wallet and other\nkeys. The robbers agreed taking only his money and car key.\n         Defendant and Weatherspoon drove off with Nonies‘s car, followed by\nHolland and McNair. In a secluded area, they stripped the car and rolled it into a\nditch.\n\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\f                 b. Events of May 15, 1993\n\n                     1. Attempted Carjacking of Barbara DeGeorge (Count 7)\n       On May 15, defendant told gang member Anthony Post to carjack a vehicle\nso defendant could drive it to the prom. After two aborted attempts, defendant and\nPost went to the parking lot of a theater complex. They saw a woman getting out\nof a car. Defendant said, ―she‘ll be easy because she hasn‘t put her keys away\nyet.‖ Post was reluctant, but defendant gave him the gun and ―pumped [him] up.‖\nPost approached the woman, lifted his shirt to display the gun in his waistband,\nand demanded her car keys.\n       The victims, Barbara DeGeorge and her 10-year-old daughter Lisa, were on\ntheir way to the movies. When Post displayed the weapon, DeGeorge and her\ndaughter ran. Post ran toward defendant, who waved him away. Post hid the gun\nin a field and retrieved it later.\n\n                     2. Robbery of Patricia Smith Estep and Charles Estey (Counts\n                         8 and 9)\n       Later that night, defendant sent Dearaujo and 13-year-old gang member\nChristopher Lyons to rob a liquor store. Dearaujo had defendant‘s gun; Lyons\ncarried two knives. When they got to the liquor store, it was closing. They left.\n       They passed a building with the lights on and people inside. Lyons said,\n―let‘s rob them.‖ Lyons took the gun and they entered. The building housed a Los\nAngeles Times distribution center owned by Charles Estey who was there with his\nmother, Patricia Smith Estep. Lyons and Dearaujo ran into the office with Lyons\nwearing a stocking mask. Initially, Estey thought his friends were playing a joke\non him, even as the gunman pointed the gun at his face. Dearaujo held a knife to\nPatricia Smith Estep‘s back and told her not to look at him. Ordered to get on the\nfloor, Estey said, ―Knock it off, Manny . . . . This has gone far enough.‖ Seeing\nthe knife pointed at his mother, Estey realized the robbery was not a joke. The\n\n\n                                         5\n\frobbers took Estey‘s wallet and his mother‘s purse. Dearaujo told Lyons, ―Let‘s\ncap them and get out of here.‖ Estey offered them his car keys, saying, ―We never\nsaw you once, just go.‖ They left.\n       Dearaujo and Lyons met defendant. They gave him the purse and wallet\nthat together contained about $100. Defendant kept the money and commended\nthem for a ―good job.‖\n\n               c. Events of May 19-20, 1993\n\n                         1. Murder of Yvonne Los (Counts 1 and 2)\n       On the evening of May 19, 1993, defendant was part of a group planning to\ndrive to a party in Anaheim. As he and others were getting into a car, Dearaujo\nand Lyons came over. Defendant asked if Dearaujo could come with them, but the\ngroup was too large to fit in the vehicle. Defendant told Dearaujo and Lyons to go\nto the Family Fitness Center and ―get a car.‖ Defendant told Dearaujo to carjack a\nlight-colored sedan and put the victim in the trunk. He gave Dearaujo his gun\nalong with a jacket and a bandana to cover his face. He described where to meet\nhim afterwards.\n       Dearaujo and Lyons walked to the parking lot of the fitness center and\nwaited for an ―appropriate‖ victim. Yvonne Los, an Air Force nurse and mother\nof two, pulled into the lot. When her car passed them, Dearaujo said, ―This is it,\nlet‘s do it.‖ As Los sat in the driver‘s seat, Dearaujo tapped the car window with\nthe gun barrel and said, ―Shh.‖ Los looked frightened and locked the doors.\nLyons tried to open the passenger door. A witness heard him yelling, ―get out of\nthe car, get out of the fucking car.‖ When Los started the car, Dearaujo shot her.\nThe car rolled backwards, striking another vehicle. Los tapped her car horn and\nthen slumped over. Dearaujo and Lyons fled.\n\n\n\n\n                                         6\n\f         An off-duty police officer heard the crash and responded to find Los shot in\nthe neck and unresponsive. A bullet had severed Los‘s carotid artery causing\ndeath by exsanguination.\n         Later, Dearaujo and Lyons met defendant and reported what happened.\nDefendant told them to find someplace to stay that night and to come to Dannov‘s\nhouse the next day.\n\n               2. Post Murder Celebration\n         The following afternoon, the mood at Dannov‘s house was festive.\nDefendant referred to Dearaujo as ―Charles Manson.‖ He awarded Dearaujo two\nstripes, and Lyons one, for a ―good job.‖ When a television newscast aired a\nphotograph of Los, Dearaujo said, ―I smoked that bitch.‖ When Los‘s fiancé\nappeared on screen and said they were planning to marry, Lyons said, ―Not no\nmore.‖\n\n             3. Robbery and Attempted Kidnapping for Robbery of Glynn Brodbeck\n                 (Counts 10 and 11)\n         That night, defendant, Weatherspoon and James Handy tried to commit\nanother carjacking. Defendant took the gun. Defendant and Weatherspoon\napproached Glynn Brodbeck, who was parked in a Taco Bell lot waiting for his\nfiancée to finish her shift. Defendant tapped on the driver‘s window and told\nBrodbeck to get out of the car. Brodbeck saw defendant with a gun and two other\nmen standing nearby.\n         Defendant demanded his wallet, but Brodbeck had left it at home. Handy\n―frisked‖ him and took his cigarettes. Weatherspoon took Brodbeck‘s keys and\nopened the trunk, where he and defendant planned to put their victim. When the\nrobbers looked into the trunk, Brodbeck ran toward the Taco Bell. Defendant shot\nat him, but Brodbeck slipped. As he fell, he heard the bullet pass by. He\nrecovered and kept running until he entered the restaurant where he called police.\n\n\n                                           7\n\fDefendant, Weatherspoon and Handy left the scene, dropping Brodbeck‘s keys in\nthe parking lot.\n         4. Defendant’s Arrest and Statement to Police\n         The murder investigation led police to George Holland who revealed\ndefendant‘s name. Police arrested him on May 22, 1993. En route to the county\njail, defendant asked how much time he could get for carjacking. Defendant also\ncommented that a detective had called him ―David Koresh,‖ adding he did not\nthink he was Koresh, but guessed he was a sort of leader.\n         Police interrogated defendant on May 22 and 23. He admitted calling the\nmeeting at Natalie Dannov‘s house where he and others discussed committing\ncarjackings. He also admitted proposing to put the money into a common\ninvestment pool and to coining the name Pimp-Style Hustlers. He denied being\nthe ―ringleader,‖ claiming he was the ―second hand man‖ to Mondre\nWeatherspoon.\n         Defendant admitted either planning or committing the Circle K robbery, the\nNonies robbery and the attempted carjacking of Brodbeck at Taco Bell. He was\npresent at the attempted carjacking of Phillips and Nolin and the attempted\ncarjacking of DeGeorge. Defendant conceded he divided the money Dearaujo and\nLyons took from Charles Estey and his mother. As to the murder, defendant\nadmitted knowing that Dearaujo was ―gonna jack a car,‖ giving him a gun and\nplanning to meet him afterwards. He denied ordering Dearaujo to commit the\ncrime.\n\n         C. Defendant’s Guilt Phase Evidence\n         Defendant called Jason Domke, a friend of Christopher Lyon‘s. Domke\ntestified that Lyons showed him a knife and asked him if he wanted to go\n―jacking‖ with him. Domke testified he saw Lyons retrieve a gun and a bag of\n\n\n\n                                          8\n\fshells from Natalie Dannov‘s house. Lyons showed him a woman‘s stolen\ndriver‘s license.\n\n       D. Codefendant Dearaujo’s Guilt Phase Evidence10\n       Dearaujo called Keisha Lawrence, who had been married to John Howell;\nshe had pled guilty to two counts of being an accessory to attempted kidnapping\nfor robbery and served eight months of her one-year sentence. Lawrence believed\nDearaujo was slow-witted and wanted to fit in. He was ―picked on,‖ ―punched‖\nand manipulated by defendant and others in the group. Defendant was the leader\nthe others looked up to. She corroborated defendant‘s involvement in the\nattempted carjacking of Debbie Phillips and Deena Nolin and the robbery and\ncarjacking of Dale Nonies. Following the murder, Lawrence called defendant and\nasked what he was going to do about the homicide for which she blamed him. He\nsaid, ―It‘s already done. The bitch is dead.‖ When she asked about Dearaujo,\ndefendant said Dearaujo was fine; he had the situation under control and she\nshould not worry.\n\n       E. Prosecution’s Penalty Phase Evidence\n       1. Victim Impact Evidence\n       Yvonne Los‘s family and friends described the impact of her death. Her\nfiancé, ex-husband, parents, two siblings and two children represented the family.\nThey were joined by two Air Force coworkers .\n       Los was the oldest child in a close-knit family and had grown up taking\ncare of her younger siblings. Her desire to help people led her to choose nursing\nas her profession. She joined the Air Force to further her education and was proud\n\n10     Defendant was tried along with Dearaujo before separate juries. Dearaujo‘s\nconvictions are not involved in this appeal. The evidence summarized here was\nheard by defendant‘s jury.\n\n\n\n                                         9\n\fof her military service. She rose to the rank of staff sergeant, a difficult\nachievement for medical personnel. She did volunteer work and cared for a\ndisabled boy. Committed to her Catholic faith, she loved her two children and\ninstilled high moral values in them. She was a person who loved unconditionally.\n       Each relative described learning of Los‘s death, their feelings of loss and\ngrief and the impact of her death on the extended family. Her father testified\nabout the pain of losing a child. Siblings recounted the family‘s sadness and the\npall cast over family gatherings. Her son, age 10, was five when she died and\nremembered her as a ―nice mom.‖ Her daughter, 15, testified Los was a kind\nperson and a role model. She thought of her mother every day. She remained\nupset that she and her mother had argued on the night of the murder and that she\nhad gone to bed without telling her mother good-night. Los‘s ex-husband\ndescribed how difficult it had been for him and their children after her death. He\nreturned from Germany, where he was stationed, to be with the children and take\nthem back to Germany. Witnesses described her funeral and burial in Iowa and a\nposthumous ceremony where an Air Force dormitory for nurses was named in her\nhonor. A videotape of the ceremony, an unusual honor, was shown to the jury\nalong with a montage of still photographs.\n       2. Violent Criminal Activity\n       The prosecutor presented evidence in aggravation documenting defendant‘s\ncriminal activity involving the ―use or attempted use of force or violence or the\nexpress or implied threat to use force.‖11\n\n\n\n\n11     Section 190.3, factor (a).\n\n\n\n                                          10\n\f      Mario Loa testified that in September 1991 he was attacked by defendant\nand the ex-boyfriend of a woman Loa was dating. Trina P. testified that in\nJanuary 1992, defendant hit her in the mouth following a disagreement.\n      A number of witnesses testified to defendant‘s violent crimes while in\ncustody. Inmate Donald Deloney testified how, in March 1994, he and defendant\njoined together to intimidate and assault other inmates. Defendant beat up an\ninmate to secure a lower bunk for Deloney and forced another inmate to orally\ncopulate defendant. Deloney and defendant robbed at least 13 inmates. They took\ncommissary cards and physically threatened Timothy Goodfield. After the\nincident with Goodfield, defendant and Deloney were reassigned to high security\nsegregated housing.\n      In May 1994, defendant fought with inmate Mark Sanchez. That same\nmonth, he ordered a Latino inmate to attack a White prisoner who had a swastika\ntattoo. In July 1994, defendant fought with inmate Mark Heinzen, believing he\nwas gay. In August 1994, defendant assaulted Dale Foster because he wanted\nFoster‘s bunk. In December 1995, defendant fought Arturo Alatorre, who had\ncomplained that defendant exceeded his phone time.\n\n      F. Defendant’s Penalty Phase Evidence\n      Defendant‘s father testified he was a ―normal kid,‖ who had experienced\nproblems in middle school that were resolved. He dropped out of high school and\nan alternative school. At 17, defendant went to work in his father‘s landscaping\nbusiness. At 18, he began living away from home intermittently. Defendant‘s\nfather was acquainted with most of his friends. He had been unaware defendant\nhad any problems with substance abuse or violence. Defendant‘s arrest devastated\nhis father who could not imagine life without his son.\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f       Defendant‘s mother abused drugs when defendant was growing up and\nwould visit out-of-town relatives for months at a time. Occasionally, she took her\nchildren.\n       Defendant‘s sister described him as helpful, respectful and well-liked.\n       Rahin Brown was defendant‘s neighbor and friend in 1987. They played\nbasketball and football together. Brown left home, joined the Navy, and went to\ncollege. He remained in touch with defendant who was like a member of Brown‘s\nfamily. Brown was unaware of any bad behavior on defendant‘s part. In spite of\ndefendant‘s convictions, Brown remained his friend and believed he had good\nqualities.\n       Velma McDowell lived next door to defendant‘s grandmother. He ran\nerrands for her and mowed her lawn. He was respectful and ―a good kid.‖\n       Defendant‘s sixth and seventh grade teachers also testified about his good\ncharacter.\n       Anthony Casas, a private investigator and litigation consultant, worked for\nthe Department of Corrections for 23 years. He described the prison classification\nsystem. Based on his case review and interviews with defendant, he opined that if\nsentenced to life without parole, defendant would be sent to a level 4 facility, the\nmost restrictive in the system. Casas described level 4 facilities, routines and\ndisciplinary actions. Casas believed defendant would adapt and do well in that\nsetting. Notwithstanding his ―infractions‖ while in custody, Casas believed he\nwould not be a management problem in prison.\n       Defendant also presented evidence that Mario Loa failed to initially name\nhim as one of his assailants. A district attorney investigator testified that the\nattack on the inmate with the swastika tattoo was not committed by a Latino\ninmate acting on defendant‘s orders, but by someone else.\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f       G. Prosecution Rebuttal Evidence\n       Correctional Officer Martin Trochtrop found homemade weapons\nconcealed in the ceiling of defendant‘s cell. Samuel Francis, a correctional officer\nfor over 17 years, was called to counter Casa‘s opinion that defendant would pose\nno threat at a level 4 facility. Francis testified that an inmate with a record of\nweapons possession and assaults on other inmates might be an administrative\nproblem. In his opinion, such an inmate would continue to demonstrate a\npropensity for violence.\n                              II. GUILT PHASE ISSUES\n\n       A. Use of Restraints\n       Defendant contends the trial court abused its discretion when it ordered the\nuse of a leg restraint without a finding of manifest necessity. (People v. Duran\n(1976) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1185764\"><a href=\"/opinion/1185764/people-v-duran/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 290-291.)12 He argues further that the court‘s decision\nviolated his rights under various constitutional provisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th\n& 8th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, §§ 1, 7, 15, 16 & 17.) Defendant has forfeited\nthe claim and, in any event, fails to show prejudice.\n       Following preliminary instructions to the jury, and outside the jury‘s\npresence, the trial court remarked, ―I was approached by the security people that\n\n\n12      ―As to this and virtually all other appellate claims, defendant contends that\nan issue raised and decided in the trial court resulted in constitutional violations,\nbut he did not present those constitutional theories below. In such instances, it\nappears that (1) the appellate claim is the kind that required no [specific argument]\nto preserve it, or (2) the new arguments do not invoke facts or legal standards\ndifferent from those the trial court was asked to apply . . . . To that extent,\ndefendant‘s new constitutional arguments are not forfeited on appeal. [Citations.]\nIn the latter case, no separate constitutional discussion is required or provided\nwhere rejection of a claim that the trial court erred on the issue presented to that\ncourt necessarily leads to rejection of any constitutional theory or ‗gloss‘ raised for\nthe first time here.‖ (People v. Contreras (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 139, fn. 17.)\n\n\n\n                                          13\n\ftheir intention is to request at some point [defendant] wear, at least initially, the\nleg restraint locking-type of device to prevent his escape or any type of other\nsecurity issue. As I understand it, although I have never seen it, it is an\nunobtrusive device which is not visible to any member of the jury. As long as\nthere‘s no attempt to rapidly run, it remains flexible. . . . [I]f he tries to run, it‘s\nsupposed to lock . . . . I‘ve been told that there are a number of incidents [since\ndefendant] has been in custody that have occurred in jail that apparently support\nthe sheriff‘s concern that some, at least minimal, restraints ought to be employed\nin this case.‖ Defense counsel responded, ―I told [defendant] to expect this. So I\ndon‘t think at this point I‘m in a position to comment further, but other than to say\n[defendant] has never been a problem for transportation, to my knowledge. I think\nthe incidents that may have occurred in the jail are pretty old at this point. Other\nthan that, I told [defendant] already to expect to have the leg restraint. He‘s seen it\nalready and knows what it is.‖ Addressing the bailiff, the court said, ―[I]f there are\nany concerns [about] that regular restraint, I assume that you will or someone from\nyour office will make the presentation or ask us to revisit the issue.‖ The bailiff\nsaid, ―yes.‖\n       Later, during a recess, defendant complained the restraint was ―very, very\nuncomfortable‖ because ―[i]t‘s cutting me.‖ The prosecutor suggested leg\nshackles. Defense counsel replied, ―I don‘t think it would be to[o] oppressive to\nsit. We can find out tomorrow, and maybe leg shackles would be the alternative.\nSince he doesn‘t have to stand up, the jury wouldn‘t see it, but I‘ll alert the court.‖\n       The last reference to defendant‘s restraint was made in the context of a\ndiscussion about the use of restraints on prosecution witnesses. During that\ndiscussion, the prosecutor noted that defendant and Dearaujo were ―not restrained.\nThey don‘t have handcuffs on. As far as the jury knows, they‘re greatly\nunrestrained.‖\n\n                                            14\n\f       ―Under Duran, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1185764\"><a href=\"/opinion/1185764/people-v-duran/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, a criminal defendant may be\nsubjected to physical restraints in the jury‘s presence upon ‗a showing of a\nmanifest need for such restraints.‘ [Citations.] This requirement is satisfied by\nevidence that the defendant has threatened jail deputies, possessed weapons in\ncustody, threatened or assaulted other inmates, and/or engaged in violent outbursts\nin court. [Citations.] [¶] The trial court‘s decision to physically restrain a\ndefendant cannot be based on rumor or innuendo. [Citation.] However, a formal\nevidentiary hearing is not required. [Citation.]‖ (People v. Lewis and Oliver\n(2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">970</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1031-1032.) The trial court‘s determination is reviewed\nfor abuse of discretion. (People v. Combs (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">821</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837.)\n       Defendant failed to object to restraints and has therefore forfeited his claim\non appeal. (People v. Foster (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2357821\"><a href=\"/opinion/2357821/people-v-foster/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1321.) At no time did the\ndefense request a formal hearing on the question. In any event, we need not\nconsider any abuse of discretion because no evidence suggests that any juror saw\nthe restraints. (Id. at p. 1322; see People v. Manibusan (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 85.)\n―[W]e have consistently held that courtroom shackling, even if error, [is] harmless\nif there is no evidence that the jury saw the restraints, or that the shackles impaired\nor prejudiced the defendant‘s right to testify or participate in his defense.‖ (People\nv. Anderson (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2623304\"><a href=\"/opinion/2623304/people-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 596.)\n       The only record regarding the restraint was the court‘s initial comment that\nit would not be visible to the jury and the prosecutor‘s later observation that\ndefendants did not appear to be restrained. Defendant cites nothing in the record\nto contradict these references. He did not testify at either phase of the trial and\nmade a single passing reference to discomfort. No evidence suggests the restraint\ninfluenced him not to testify, affected his demeanor or impaired his ability to\ncommunicate with defense counsel. (People v. Combs, supra, 34 Cal.4th at pp.\n837-839; see People v. Manibusan, supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 87.)\n\n                                          15\n\f       Defendant claims Deck v. Missouri (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142897\"><a href=\"/opinion/142897/deck-v-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, stands for the\nproposition that when restraints are used prejudice is presumed.    We have\npreviously rejected this construction of Deck. (People v. Letner and Tobin (2010)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2630926\"><a href=\"/opinion/2630926/people-v-letner-and-tobin/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) We noted ―[i]n Deck, there was no dispute that the restraints were\nvisible to the jury — a circumstance that courts consistently have viewed as\ninherently prejudicial.‖ (Id. at p. 155.) We declined to presume the jurors viewed\nthe restraint, and nothing in the record showed that they did so. (Ibid.) The same\nanalysis applies here.\n\n       B. Excusal of Juror No. 12 During Trial\n       During the prosecution‘s case, the court dismissed a juror who improperly\nexpressed an opinion about witness credibility then lied to the court about having\nmade the statement. Defendant contends the excusal of the juror was an abuse of\ndiscretion and also violated his rights under various constitutional provisions.\n(U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.)\n\n           1. Background\n       Juror No. 6 initially reported that Juror No. 12 said she was upset because\nJames Handy, an in-custody prosecution witness, had been brought to court in\nhandcuffs. Later, Juror No. 7 told Juror No. 6 that Juror No. 12 said the only\nreason Handy had been handcuffed was because he was African-American. Juror\nNo. 12 herself was African-American.\n       Upon inquiry, Juror No. 12 admitted making the comment. The court\nexplained a decision to restrain an inmate witness was based on whether the\nwitness posed a security threat and was ―not a racial decision.‖ Juror No. 12 said\nthe episode would not prejudice her against either side. She acknowledged that\nher ―mistake‖ was, ―I‘m not supposed to give my opinions to others.‖ At the\nprosecutor‘s request, the trial court also questioned Juror No. 7 about Juror No.\n\n\n\n                                         16\n\f12‘s comment. She confirmed that Juror No. 12 had asserted ―the black [prisoner-\nwitnesses] are in shackles.‖\n       The prosecutor sought to excuse Juror No. 12 because she could not be fair\nand impartial. The trial court denied the request because the juror had said she\ncould be fair to both sides and her comment concerned an ancillary matter.\n       The trial court told the jury that restraints were placed on a witness for\nsecurity and should have no bearing on its evaluation of the witness‘s credibility.\nThe trial court also reminded jurors they were not to discuss the merits of the case\nbefore it was submitted to them.\n       Nine days later, another juror reported comments by Juror No. 12. Juror\nNo. 2 told the court that after Glynn Brodbeck testified, Juror No. 12 said, ―the\nonly truth lied [sic] in the parking lot and that everyone else was just lying.‖ Juror\nNo. 2 reported the comment had been made after the court‘s earlier admonition not\nto discuss the merits of the case. Juror No. 2 also said Juror No. 12‘s latest remark\nhad been made in the presence of other jurors.\n       The matter was put over for several days before Juror No. 12 was\nquestioned. She said she heard someone make a similar statement but denied it\nwas she. She heard someone say ―everybody in the courtroom was lying except\nthe judge,‖ but did not remember who made the comment. She volunteered she\nwas ―a strong-opinionated person,‖ and suggested that ―maybe somebody would\nnot like for me to be on the jury, to go into deliberations or whatever.‖ She\nwondered if she was being ―pinpointed with things that are said or done as far as\nthis particular trial is concerned.‖ The court pointed out that the juror who had\nreported this comment was not the same juror who had reported the handcuffing\ncomment. Juror No. 12 said she could be fair but felt like ―I‘m being attacked.‖\n       The remaining jurors and alternates were questioned. No one remembered\nhearing the statement Juror No. 2 reported. Alternate Juror No. 3 said he\n\n                                          17\n\foverheard a juror say she was upset by a comment Juror No. 12 made. That\nremark could have been made on the day Brodbeck testified.\n       The prosecutor renewed her motion to dismiss Juror No. 12, saying the\nissue was whether Juror No. 2 was credible. She argued that Alternate Juror No.\n3‘s recollection corroborated Juror No. 2‘s claim that Juror No. 12 had made the\nstatement about witnesses lying. The prosecutor asserted that the new statement\nviolated the court‘s admonition not to discuss the case and that Juror No. 12‘s\ndenial ―was not credible.‖\n       Over defendant‘s objection, the court removed Juror No. 12. Referring to\nthe handcuff statement, the court noted that Juror No. 12 had said one of the things\nshe learned from the incident was not to share her opinion with others.\nNonetheless, the second statement attributed to her went ―directly [to] the merits\nof the case‖ and showed Juror No. 12 had formed an opinion about the witness‘s\ncredibility. This behavior violated the court‘s admonition not to do so until the\ncase was finally submitted. The court held the juror had lied when denying she\nmade the statement and that Juror No. 2 was credible.\n       The court found that Juror No. 12‘s misconduct was thrice improper.\n―First, she, in violation of the Court‘s order, formed an opinion about the merits of\nthe case, and two, she expressed that opinion to other jurors, and three, when\nconfronted with that, in my opinion she lied to the Court as to whether she made\nthe statement in the first place.‖ The juror was dismissed and an alternate seated.\n\n           2.

(a).) This jury\nwas so instructed. Section 1122 also requires that ―[t]he jury shall also, at each\nadjournment of the court before the submission of the cause to the jury, . . . be\nadmonished by the court that it is their duty not to . . . converse among themselves,\nor with anyone else, on any subject connected with the trial, or to form or express\nany opinion about the case until the cause is finally submitted to them.‖ (§ 1122,\nsubd. (b).) Those admonitions were given as required. A juror‘s violation of these\ndirections constitutes serious misconduct. (People v.

Indeed, Juror No. 12 herself recognized she should keep her\nopinion to herself.\n       On this record, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Juror\nNo. 12. The crux of the court‘s ruling was its credibility determination that Juror\nNo. 2 was truthful and Juror No. 12 was not. There is no basis to disturb that\nfinding on appeal. Juror No. 12 was well aware that she was not to form an\nopinion on any matter touching upon the case or to express an opinion to others.\nNevertheless, her second remark shows she had formed an opinion about witness\ncredibility. She then shared it with at least one other juror. She compounded her\nmisconduct by lying to the court. The record supports her disqualification as a\ndemonstrable reality.\n\n       C. Instructional Claims\n\n           1. Lesser Included Offense Instruction\n       Defendant contends the trial court erred by failing to provide, sua sponte,\nlesser include offense instructions on second degree felony murder, second degree\nmurder and voluntary manslaughter. He maintains the error violated his rights\nunder various constitutional provisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th\nAmends.) Because no substantial evidence implicated issues addressed in these\ninstructions the trial court was not required to give them.\n       ―The trial court must instruct on general legal principles closely related to\nthe case. This duty extends to necessarily included offenses when the evidence\nraises a question as to whether all the elements of the charged offense are\npresent. . . . [¶] Nevertheless, ‗the existence of ―any evidence, no matter how\nweak‖ will not justify instructions on a lesser included offense . . . .‘ [Citation.]\nSuch instructions are required only where there is ‗substantial evidence‘ from\nwhich a rational jury could conclude that the defendant committed the lesser\n\n\n\n                                          20\n\foffense, and that he is not guilty of the greater offense.‖ (People v. DePriest\n(2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2517841\"><a href=\"/opinion/2517841/people-v-depriest/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 50.) ―Substantial evidence,‖ in this context, ―is evidence\nsufficient to ‗deserve consideration by the jury,‘ that is, evidence that a reasonable\njury could find persuasive.‖ (People v. Barton (1995) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1127701\"><a href=\"/opinion/1127701/people-v-barton/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 201, fn. 8.)\n       Defendant was charged with the felony murder of Yvonne Los. Because he\nwas not the perpetrator, the prosecution proceeded on theories of aiding and\nabetting and conspiracy. Defendant asserts that the evidence supported\ninstructions for the lesser included offense of second degree felony murder based\non a target offense of discharging a firearm in a grossly negligent manner.\n(§ 246.3.) He also contends the jury could have determined that Los was killed\nduring an intentional but unpremeditated shooting, thus constituting second degree\nmurder. Finally, he argues he merely furnished a weapon knowing it might be\nused in a crime. Accordingly, his act ―amounts to nothing more than criminal\nnegligence supporting a voluntary manslaughter conviction.‖13\n       The evidence showed that carjacking was one of the crimes defendant\nformed his gang to commit. He trained them how to do a carjacking and said any\nresisting victim was to be shot. Before the Los killing, defendant had already\n\n13     We question whether a second degree felony-murder instruction would\nhave been appropriate here. ―[The] use of the second degree felony-murder rule\n[is] appropriate when the purpose of the predicate felony was independent of or\ncollateral to an intent to cause injury that would result in death.‖ (People v.\nRobertson (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2597430\"><a href=\"/opinion/2597430/people-v-robertson/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 171.) In Robertson, we held that the trial court\ndid not err in instructing about second degree felony murder based on a violation\nof section 246.3 where the defendant claimed he had fired his gun to frighten the\nmen who were stealing his hubcaps. (Robertson, at p. 173.) Here, however, there\nwas no evidence that Dearaujo used his gun for any other purpose than to commit\na carjacking. We similarly doubt that either second degree murder or voluntary\nmanslaughter were available as lesser included offenses here. We will assume,\nmerely for purpose of argument, that they were.\n\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fdirected two other carjackings by gang members whom he had armed. He had\npersonally carjacked Dale Nonies. On the night of the murder, he told Dearaujo to\nsecure a car and gave him the gun. Defendant specifically said to place the victim\nin the trunk. He clearly contemplated a robbery, not the mere theft of an\nunattended vehicle. Defendant intended that the gun be used to commit a\ncarjacking and, if necessary, to shoot the victim. Dearaujo acted on defendant‘s\ndirection when he approached the car and pointed the gun at Los. Her killing was\nmanifestly a natural and probable consequence of defendant‘s instructions.\n       No substantial evidence supports defendant‘s assertions that he was\nunaware Dearaujo would use the gun or that he did not share Dearaujo‘s purpose.\nNo evidence points to a different intent than Dearaujo‘s use of defendant‘s gun to\ncommit a carjacking and, if necessary, to shoot a resisting victim. Defendant\nasserts the jury might have concluded he only intended that Dearaujo obtain a car,\nnot necessarily commit a carjacking. He argues further the jury could have\ninferred he armed Dearaujo merely for self-defense. There is simply no basis in\nthe evidence for these speculative assertions. As we noted in People v. Mendoza\n(2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2594735\"><a href=\"/opinion/2594735/people-v-mendoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 174, ―[s]peculation is insufficient to require the giving of\nan instruction on a lesser included offense.‖ The fragments of Lyons‘s testimony\non which defendant relies in no way support the instructions he claims were\nlacking. For example, to bolster his argument that the shooting was a reflexive\nand impulsive act rather than a calculated plan to kill, defendant asserts that Lyons\ntestified Dearaujo shot the victim in a panic. In the transcript passages he cites,\nhowever, Lyons testified not to Dearaujo‘s panic, but to his own. Again,\ndefendant fails to direct us to any substantial evidence supporting a lesser included\ninstruction.\n\n\n\n\n                                          22\n\f           2. Consciousness of Guilt Instructions (CALJIC Nos. 2.03 & 2.06)\n       Defendant challenges the consciousness of guilt instructions regarding false\nstatements and suppression of evidence (CALJIC Nos. 2.03, 2.06 ) as ―infirm‖\nunder various constitutional provisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th\nAmends.) He urges that they permitted the jury to convict him based on improper\ninferences and were impermissibly argumentative. He alternatively contends that\nthe instructions were unwarranted by the evidence.\n       We have consistently rejected the challenges defendant advances here.\nPeople v. Lopez (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1028</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, held that neither CALJIC No. 2.03 nor\nNo. 2.06 is argumentative, nor does either generate an impermissible inference of\nguilt.

There\nwas evidence defendant made false and misleading statements to police about his\ninvolvement in the murder. ―[T]he instruction applied based on defendant‘s\ninconsistent and contradicted statements to police attempting to minimize\ninvolvement in the capital crime.‖ (People v.

Jury Query Regarding Liability of Principals for Aiding and\n               Abetting Purposes\n       Defendant contends the trial court responded inadequately to a jury inquiry.\nHe asserts the trial court‘s response violated his rights under various constitutional\nprovisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., §§ 1, 7, 15,\n16 & 17.) The claim is meritless.\n       During their deliberations, the jurors sent out two notes regarding aiding\nand abetting liability. The first note asked: ―Need clarification of the law — [¶]\nIf A-B-C-D were involved in planning and talking about a robbery at one place\nand B + C started out to the do the crime [but] [t]hey did not do the planned crime\nbut did another crime in the same area, what would A‘s status be under the law.‖\nThese facts apparently referred to the robbery of the Los Angeles Times\ndistribution center that Dearaujo and Lyons committed after they failed to rob the\nliquor store as defendant had originally directed. The trial court responded: ―In\nresponse to your Question #9, the legal answer is provided in the instructions\nalready provided. The court would refer you to the series on Aiding and Abetting,\nstarting with 3.00. [¶] Note that in your question, whether ―A‖ would be legally\nresponsible for the actual crime ultimately committed would require that the jury\nunanimously find that the committed crime was ‗reasonably foreseeable.‘ That is,\nan aider and abettor (‗A‘ in your hypothetical) is guilty not only of the offense he\nintended to facilitate or encourage, but also of any reasonable foreseeable offense\ncommitted by the person(s) (‗B-C-D‘ in your hypothetical) he aids and abets.‖\n       Later the same day, the court received a second note: ―I want to know if a\nperson is a principal if the non principal commits a crime is the principal just as\n\n\n                                         24\n\fguilty of the crime also.‖ In discussing the note, the court agreed with the\nprosecutor that the answer to the question was covered by CALJIC No. 3.00.\nDefense counsel said: ―But there are —,‖ at which the prosecutor broke in and\nsaid, ―That one instruction answers that question.‖ Defense counsel stated, ―Yes,\nwell —,‖ and the prosecutor continued, ― — which is to what level are principals\nresponsible. Each principal, regardless of the extent or manner of participation, is\nequally guilty, principals included, and its [sic] defined.‖ Defense counsel\nreiterated an earlier objection he had made to all aiding and abetting instructions,\nincluding CALJIC No. 3.00 but acknowledged, ―that language is in 3.00.‖ The\ntrial court said, ―Okay. You objection is noted and the answer is to refer to\ninstruction 3.00.‖ The judge then responded to the jury‘s question as follows:\n―You are referred to Instruction 3.00.‖\n       Defendant contends that the trial court‘s response, referring the jury to\nCALJIC No. 3.00, was inadequate because it did not also refer to CALJIC No.\n8.27. Additionally, he asserts the response showed partiality by the court toward\nthe prosecution.\n       The Attorney General argues the claim is forfeited. The record reveals that\nduring the discussion of the jury‘s note defendant renewed his objection to all\naiding and abetting instructions, including the one to which the court referred the\njury, and the court noted the objection. This is sufficient for us to proceed to the\nmerits of the claim that we reject.\n       Section 1138 requires the court to answer jury requests for clarification on\npoints of law.14 ―If, however ‗ ―the original instructions are themselves full and\n\n14      Section 1138 provides in relevant part: ―After the jury have retired for\ndeliberation, . . . if they desire to be informed on any point of law arising in the\ncase, they must require the officer to conduct them into court.

Defendant does\nnot contend that CALJIC No. 3.00 was an incorrect statement of the law but only\nthat, in addition to that instruction, the trial court should also have referred the jury\nto CALJIC No. 8.27.\n        The second note reflects confusion over who qualifies as a principal. A\n―non principal‖ cannot commit a crime because, by definition, one who commits a\ncrime is a principal. CALJIC No. 3.00 explains that concept and clarifies that\naiders and abettors may be liable as principals, even if they do not directly commit\nthe offense. The instruction was sufficient to clarify the jury‘s inquiry. 15\n        CALJIC No. 8.27 simply restates those concepts in the context of the\nparticular offense of felony murder.16 CALJIC No. 8.27 was both read to the jury\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\ninto court, the information required must be given in the presence of, or after\nnotice to, the prosecuting attorney, and the defendant or his counsel . . . .‖\n15      As given here, CALJIC No. 3.00 stated: ―Persons who are involved in\ncommitting or attempting to commit a crime are referred to as principals in that\ncrime.

[¶] Principals include, one, those who directly and actively\ncommit or attempt to commit the crime, or, two, those who aid and abet the\ncommission or attempted commission of the crime.‖\n16      As given here, CALJIC No. 8.27 stated: ―If a human being is killed by any\none of several persons engaged in the commission or attempted commission of the\ncrime of robbery, all persons who either directly or actively commit the act\nconstituting the crime, or who with knowledge of the unlawful purpose of the\nperpetrator of the crime and with the intent or purpose of committing,\nencouraging, or facilitating the commission of the offense, aid, promote,\nencourage or instigate by acts or advice its commission, are guilty of murder of the\nfirst degree whether the killing is intentional, unintentional or accidental.‖\n\n\n\n                                           26\n\fand given to it in writing. The jury received additional instructions in aiding and\nabetting as well as the elements of robbery and other substantive offenses.\nDefendant fails to demonstrate error.\n       Defendant also argues that in exercising its discretion the court\ndemonstrated partiality to the prosecution.

Instruction on Natural and Probable Consequences (CALJIC No.\n                3.02)\n       There are two distinct forms of aider and abettor liability. ―First, an aider\nand abettor with the necessary mental state is guilty of the intended crime.\nSecond, under the natural and probable consequences doctrine, an aider and\nabettor is guilty not only of the intended crime, but also ‗for any other offense that\nwas a ―natural and probable consequence‖ of the crime aided and abetted.‘\n[Citation.]‖ (People v.

This latter form of\nliability was the basis of the prosecutor‘s theory that defendant aided and abetted\nthe Los murder: he aided and abetted Dearaujo‘s carjacking, the natural and\nprobable consequence of which was that Dearaujo shot and killed Los.\n       The prosecution‘s theory was explained in CALJIC No. 3.02, given here:\n―One who aids and abets another in the commission of a crime is not only guilty of\nthose crimes, but is also guilty of any other crimes committed by a principal which\nis a natural and probable consequence of the crime originally aided and abetted.‖\nThe jury was told that before it could convict defendant it had to find ―beyond a\nreasonable doubt that: [¶] 1. The crime . . . of . . . murder [was] committed; [¶]\n2. That the defendant aided and abetted [that] crime[]; [¶] 3.

The issue is to be decided\nin light of all of the circumstances surrounding the incident.

Trial Court Responses to Jury’s Requests for Clarification\n          Regarding Law of Conspiracy\n       Conspiracy, like aiding and abetting, was presented as a theory of\ndefendant‘s liability, but was not charged as a substantive offense. ―It is long and\nfirmly established that an uncharged conspiracy may properly be used to prove\ncriminal liability for acts of a coconspirator.‖ (People v. Belmontes (1988) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1181055\"><a href=\"/opinion/1181055/people-v-belmontes/\"><span class=\"volume\">45</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 788.)\n       Over defendant‘s objection, the jury was given standard conspiracy\ninstructions, including CALJIC No. 6.10.5, which defined the conspiracy as ―an\nagreement between two or more persons with the specific intent to agree to\ncommit the crime of robbery, and with the further specific intent to commit that\ncrime, followed by an overt act committed in this state by one or more of the\nparties for the purpose of accomplishing the object of the agreement.‖ The jury\nwas also instructed it ―must determine whether the defendant is guilty as a\nmember of the conspiracy to commit the originally agreed upon crime or crimes,\nand, if so, whether the crime alleged in Counts I through XI was perpetrated by a\nco-conspirator in furtherance of that conspiracy and was a natural and probable\nconsequence of the agreed upon criminal objective of that conspiracy.‖\nAdditionally, the jury was instructed that ―[e]ach defendant is individually entitled\nto, and must receive, your determination whether he was a member of the alleged\nconspiracy.‖\n       During deliberations, the jury sent a note to the trial court: ―When you deal\nwith conspiracies, is every individual crime the start of a new conspiracy or does\n\n\n                                         29\n\fthe conspiracy start at the first crime and every crime after that is just a\ncontinuance of the original conspiracy.‖ The jury‘s note did not refer to a\nparticular instruction or count as the impetus for the question.\n       The trial court, over defendant‘s objection, responded: ―You, the jury, are\nto determine from the evidence whether a conspiracy was formed. If you find that\na conspiracy was formed, then any crimes committed which you find to be in\nfurtherance of that conspiracy comes within the original conspiracy. All of these\nlegal concepts are included in the instructions previously given starting with\n6.10.5.‖\n       Defendant contends the trial court‘s response was error because, he asserts,\nwhether there was a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies was a factual\nquestion for the jury to decide and the trial court‘s response ―implied (if not\ndirected)‖ there was a single conspiracy. According to defendant, ―[i]f the jury\nhad been permitted to decide for itself whether there was but one conspiracy or a\nnumber of conspiracies, the jury may well have decided the individual\nconspiracies were narrow in scope – a result likely in [defendant‘s] favor.‖\n       The Attorney General argues defendant has forfeited his claim on appeal\nbecause defense counsel failed to specifically object to the trial court‘s response.\nDuring the discussion of the note, defense counsel reiterated his objection to any\nconspiracy instructions because the substantive offense of conspiracy had not been\ncharged. Moreover, defense counsel specifically objected when the court\nproposed telling the jury ―if you find that a conspiracy was established, then any\ncrime committed that is in the furtherance of that conspiracy comes within the\nperimeters of that conspiracy.‖ Although defense counsel grudgingly conceded\nthe ultimate response given by the court did not contain ―any blatant problems,‖ he\nagain noted his objection to any conspiracy instructions. We assume these\n\n\n\n                                           30\n\fobjections were sufficient to preserve the issue on appeal. The claim fails on its\nmerits.\n          Defendant cites decisions of the Court of Appeal for the proposition that the\nnumber of conspiracies is a factual question for the jury. As he concedes,\nhowever, the lower court is split on this question. (Compare People v. Jasso\n(2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1213</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> with People v.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1133.) Moreover, these decisions involved conspiracy as a charged offense.\nWhere the crime of conspiracy is charged, the factual question of whether there\nwas a single conspiracy or multiple conspiracies raises questions of jury unanimity\nand whether the evidence will sustain single or multiple convictions. (See, e.g.,\nJasso, at pp. 1220-1223.) Where, however, conspiracy is a theory of liability and\nnot a charged offense, these considerations do not arise. We need not resolve that\nconflict in the different context of this case.\n          We disagree with defendant‘s assertion that the trial court‘s response to the\nquestion directed the jury to find that only one conspiracy existed. To the\ncontrary, the reference to ―a conspiracy‖ in the first two sentences of the response\nwould not have foreclosed the jury from determining there were multiple\nconspiracies. Also significant was the trial court‘s reference in the third sentence\nto the conspiracy instructions previously given. As noted, those instructions\ninformed the jury it must determine whether defendant was a member of a\nconspiracy for purposes of counts 1 through 11. These instructions allowed the\njury to consider whether there was a single conspiracy encompassing all counts or\nwhether each count was the fruit of its own conspiracy. In short, the trial court‘s\nresponse did not remove from the jury its ability to determine for itself whether\nthere was one conspiracy or multiple conspiracies.\n          Further, it would have made no difference even if some jurors understood\nthe court‘s response in the manner claimed by defendant. Even were we to\n\n                                            31\n\fassume the jury understood the note in the manner defendant urges, any error\nwould have been harmless.18 There was overwhelming evidence that defendant\neither actively participated in or instigated every crime committed by the Pimp-\nStyle Hustlers. Whether the jurors concluded there was single conspiracy\nencompassing multiple counts or that each count constituted a separate conspiracy,\nthe result would have been the same. There is no reasonable probability of a more\nfavorable verdict had the jury been explicitly instructed that it was to determine\nthe number of conspiracies. (People v. Watson (1956) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1444734\"><a href=\"/opinion/1444734/people-v-watson/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">818</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836.) 19\n\n\n18      Although defendant appears to argue there is a federal constitutional\ndimension to his claim of error, he neglects to identify the precise constitutional\nright involved or the manner in which it may have been violated. He simply\nasserts he would have benefited had the jury determined there were multiple\nconspiracies, without showing how. Accordingly, the error appears to be one of\nstate law only. Even if we were to subject the claimed error to review under the\nstandard for federal constitutional error, we would find it harmless beyond a\nreasonable doubt. (See Chapman v. California (1967) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">; People v.\nHarris (1994) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1393358\"><a href=\"/opinion/1393358/people-v-harris/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 424-431.)\n19      Defendant raises a somewhat related claim. He asserts that, assuming the\njury concluded there was a single conspiracy, the Circle K robbery could not have\nbeen part of it because it occurred before the formation of his gang. He shows no\nprejudice. The jury was instructed it had to decide whether the various counts\nwere in furtherance of the conspiracy. Assuming the jury found the conspiracy\nbegan when defendant formed the gang, an offense committed beforehand could\nnot have been in furtherance of the conspiracy. More fundamentally, there was\nample evidence defendant aided and abetted the Circle K robbery.\n        Defendant also argues that, because the purpose of the Pimp-Style Hustlers\nconspiracy was to obtain money, the murder of Los, to obtain a car, was not in\nfurtherance of the conspiracy. It is unclear how this relates to his overall\nargument. In any event it is without merit. The evidence amply showed\ndefendant, Dearaujo and Lyons conspired to commit a carjacking and that the\nmurder was a natural and probable consequence of the target offense. Their\nultimate goal, whether to obtain money or transportation or both, is irrelevant.\nThey intended to commit a carjacking. That offense was identified by defendant\nas one of the gang‘s chosen crimes. Whether they ultimately intended to establish\na fleet of stolen cars for the gang‘s use or to liquidate the stolen cars for ready\n                                                          (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                         32\n\f        Finally, defendant contends ―[t]he jury should have been instructed to agree\nunanimously whether there was a single or multiple conspiracies.‖ We have\npreviously rejected that argument when a count of conspiracy has not been\ncharged but the doctrine is merely relied upon as a theory of culpability for the\ncrimes for which the defendant is on trial.

Excusal of Juror No. 10 During Deliberations\n        Defendant asserts Juror No. 10 was improperly dismissed during\ndeliberations, violating his rights under various federal constitutional provisions.\n(U.S. Const., 5th, 6th & 14th Amends.) The claim fails.\n\n             1. Background\n        During deliberations the court and counsel met with Juror No. 10, at her\nrequest. The juror's driver's license was suspended. She wanted to know if jury\nduty counted as community service because she otherwise feared she would be\nunable to drive to court. The court advised her to take it up with the traffic court.\nOn her way out, the juror asked, ―What is not deliberating? If you don‘t have\ncomments, is that considered not deliberating?‖ The court replied: ―Not\ndeliberating is just what it sounds like. A person just sits there with their,\nfiguratively with their arms closed, and they just don‘t discuss the case or the law\nwith other jurors. It‘s like they have pulled away and they won‘t talk about it\nperiod.‖ After the juror left, the prosecutor expressed some concern with the trial\n\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\ncapital does not negate their intent to commit a carjacking, or remove that crime\nfrom the scope of their conspiracy.\n\n\n\n\n                                          33\n\fcourt‘s answer. The court recalled the juror to correct any misimpression. The\ncourt said, ―[T]he appropriate response should have been that if the jury has a\nquestion regarding the subject, the foreperson should direct a note to the Court in\nthis regard and then the Court would address to the jury as a whole the subject . . .\nrather than an individual going back and saying, well, the Court told me such and\nsuch, which would be improper.‖\n       Three days later, on the tenth day of deliberation, Juror No. 10 called in\nsick. When contacted by the court clerk about whether she would appear the next\nday, Juror No. 10 said she would call in that afternoon. Later, she telephoned to\nsay she would probably not be in the next day. The bailiff, meanwhile, reported\nthat the other jurors wanted to talk to the court about Juror No. 10‘s absence. The\njurors appeared to be quite agitated. After some discussion with counsel, the trial\ncourt directed the foreman to send a note about the jury‘s concerns.\n       In response, the foreman wrote: ―Regarding juror number 10[.] She does\nnot pay attention to discussion, she appears to be asleep most of the time, doesn‘t\nparticipate [,] constantly has an attitude towards others. [¶] Furthermore, we‘ve\ncompleted the written voting on counts 1-11. She has been seen writting [sic]\ninformation on paper [and] taking it out with her to lunch. When she returns from\nlunch she changes her opinion on how she voted and has questions on the legal\nterminology. This has happened more than once. Upon her return from lunch she\nmentioned at the table that ‗my lawyer can put holes on this interview.‘ [¶] She\nhas also stated that she wants to prolong this due to the fact that she doesn‘t want\nto return to work. This unnecessary delay has caused financial hardship on juror\nnumber 11. [¶] There is a number of issues that other jurors would like to discuss\nwith you. Sorry for the inconvenience. [¶] Juror #3 4/1/98.‖\n\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\f       The prosecutor argued that the note showed misconduct and suggested that\nthe court talk to the foreman and then to Juror No. 10 the following day. Defense\ncounsel agreed.\n       The foreman, Juror No. 3, told the court the jury‘s procedure was to go\naround the table so each juror could speak. He reported that, while other people\nspoke, Juror No. 10 had her eyes closed. When it came her turn to speak, she\nwould announce she had nothing to say. When asked by the court if Juror No. 10\nwas asleep, Juror No. 3 responded that she would ask questions about subjects\nthey had just finished discussing. Juror No. 3 said, while he had never seen it,\nother jurors reported that Juror No. 10 made notes to herself and, when she\nreturned from lunch, would want to revisit counts she had already voted on and\nwould bring up technical questions. When Juror No. 3 would ask her to write\ndown her thoughts so other jurors could discuss them, she would ―clam[] up.‖ He\nreported that ―[w]hen she disagrees, we try to find out why she disagrees and she\nwon‘t tell us . . . . She just says my opinion is this and that‘s it.‖ He also reported\nthat Juror No. 10 said she wanted the trial to go on as long as possible. Other\njurors believed it was because she did not want to go back to work and perhaps\nintended to file a ―stress case‖ with her employer.\n       Under questioning by the prosecutor, Juror No. 3 reiterated that attempts by\nother jurors to solicit Juror No. 10‘s reasons for her positions were met with\nstatements like, ― ‗Because I believe, because this is the way I believe,‘ but she\ndoesn‘t give a reason why she believes that.‖ Juror No. 3 said in his opinion, Juror\nNo. 10 was not deliberating because ―she does not accept our views at all. She‘s\nclosed her mind. If we break it down step by step, she does not open her mind to\nanything we say.‖ Juror No. 3 also clarified that Juror No. 10‘s statement that her\n―lawyer can put holes in this interview‖ referred to the police interrogation of\ndefendant. He ended by telling the court, ―we‘re all just so frustrated [with Juror\n\n                                          35\n\fNo. 10] we don‘t know where to go,‖ and described their stress — ―A lot of us\naren‘t getting any sleep . . . stomachs are inside out, upside down. I‘m shaking\nright now.‖\n       Defense counsel asked whether the other jurors‘ frustration was only with\nJuror No. 10. Juror No. 3 responded that while everyone had feelings about the\ncase, they were trying to follow the law. He said the ―race issue‖ had been\nbrought up and, as the foreman, ―I tried to put a halt to that right then and there,\nand I think I did, but that came up and we sort of talked about it. [¶] We don‘t\nlook at it that way. I mean, we are looking at the law.‖ Nonetheless he believed\nthat Juror No. 10 may have taken that discussion personally. Juror No. 3 said\nthere had also been a ―blowup‖ in the room but that he had apologized for it.20\n       The court and counsel then questioned six other jurors (Juror Nos. 1, 2, 4,\n5, 6 and 11) on four specific points: (1) whether Juror No. 10 was sleeping during\ndeliberations; (2) Juror No. 10‘s statements about prolonging deliberations to\navoid going back to work; (3) whether Juror No. 10 consulted outside sources on\nthe law; and (4) whether Juror No. 10 refused to deliberate.\n       On the first point, Juror No. 2 stated he had seen Juror No. 10 sleeping\nduring deliberations. The remaining jurors could not say she was sleeping but all\nof them had seen her with her eyes closed for several minutes during which she\ndid not appear to be paying attention to the discussion. One juror mentioned Juror\nNo. 10 had fallen asleep during the trial court‘s instructions.\n       On the second point, Juror Nos. 2 and 6 reported that Juror No. 10 had said\nshe wanted to prolong the deliberations and that she did not want to return to\n\n20     Neither the court nor counsel questioned the foreperson further about the\nnature of the ―blowup‖ or whether it related to the ―race issue.‖ No additional\ninformation on this topic appears in the record. (But see fn. 21, p. 38, post.)\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fwork. The other jurors had not heard her make this statement although Juror No.\n11 had heard from other jurors that Juror No. 10 had made the statement.\n       On the third point, all the jurors told the court they saw Juror No. 10\nmaking notes on scraps of paper she would take with her during lunch breaks. She\nwould return from lunch and change her position on issues the jury had voted on\nearlier. She would present new arguments, sometimes introducing new legal\nterms. Several of the jurors remembered her statement that her lawyer could poke\nholes through defendant‘s statement to police. Juror No. 2 noted that Juror No. 10\nhad an appointment with a lawyer involving custody issues.\n       On the final point, the jurors said Juror No. 10 regularly refused requests to\nexplain her position and to relate it to the law and evidence. For example, Juror\nNo. 1 said Juror No. 10 would say whether she liked or disliked something but\nwould not go into detail and would not discuss the factual or legal basis of her\nopinion. Juror No. 2 said her response when asked to explain her position was,\n―When I‘m ready to tell you, you‘ll find out. When I‘m ready to say something,\nyou‘ll hear from me.‖ Juror No. 2 said Juror No. 10 had been offered the option of\nwriting down her disagreements for discussion and had refused. Juror No. 2 also\nspoke of an incident where Juror No. 10 said, ―I‘m the only African/American in\nthis room and I want to make sure, I have to double check everything.‖ He said,\n―she felt that she was being picked on because of that, and I said, no, you know,\nthat‘s not the issue, and so everybody, everybody has been very, very patient with\nher since she made that statement.‖21\n\n21      It is not clear whether this is the same episode the foreman was referring to\nwhen he mentioned the ―race issue.‖ Defendant suggests that the juror‘s removal\nwas race related because both Juror Nos. 12 and 10 were African-American and\ntheir removal left no African-Americans on his jury. Defendant is African-\nAmerican. He suggests that the other jurors may have wanted to remove these\n                                                           (footnote continued on next page)\n\n\n                                         37\n\f        Juror No. 4 said that during discussions Juror No. 10 would flip through the\npages of the instructions, and ―not [be] with us.‖ She disagreed without stating\nwhy, and said the other jurors had not proven their positions. When they offered\nspecifics, Juror No. 10 would say, ― ‗No, I don‘t believe it.‘ ‖ Juror No. 4 said the\nother jurors had ―bent over backward‖ to allow her to say everything she wanted\nto say and had provided her with her own set of instructions while they shared\nanother among themselves. Juror No. 5 said if there was a disagreement between\nJuror No. 10 and other jurors, she would not explain the basis of her disagreement\n―so we could help understand where she was coming from.‖ Juror No. 6 told the\ncourt that Juror No. 10 would ―refuse to speak with us. She will just say, ‗I‘m not\ntalking to you, if I have something to say, I‘ll say it.‘ ‖ Juror No. 6 added that, on\nissues on which she agreed with other jurors, she was more open but where she\ndisagreed she would not discuss the basis of her disagreement. Juror No. 11 said\nJuror No. 10 would participate in discussions during the morning sessions but then\n―clam[] up‖ in the afternoon. When the jurors went around the table to speak and\n\n\n(footnote continued from previous page)\n\njurors because of their race. The record lends no support to this claim. The\ndismissals of the two jurors came at different points in the trial and for different\nreasons, neither related to race. The only mention of race in the jury room, of\nwhich there is any evidence, is the episode described above in which Juror No. 10\nasserted that because she was African-American she had to ―double check\neverything.‖ The juror‘s life experience as an African-American was certainly a\nlegitimate prism through which she viewed the case but, as her fellow jurors\ncorrectly pointed out, race was not an issue here. Moreover, defendant assumes\nthe remaining jurors were White. Other than Juror No. 10‘s assertion, the record\ndoes not reflect the racial composition of the jury. We do know, from statements\nby the jurors to the court, that they tried to include Juror No. 10 in the\ndeliberations and to draw her out. We reject as unsupported defendant‘s\ninsinuation that racial bias played a role in Juror No. 10‘s dismissal or in the jury‘s\nultimate resolution of the case.\n\n\n\n                                          38\n\fit was Juror No. 10‘s turn to speak, she would say, ― ‗I ain‘t got nothing to say,‘\nand that would be it.‖\n       After hearing from seven out of the 12 jurors, the trial court stated, ―it\nseems like we are hearing the same things over and over again.‖ The clerk\nreported that Juror No. 10 had indicated she would probably not be back the\nfollowing day. The court concluded there was credible evidence from the\nstatements of her fellow jurors that Juror No. 10 was sleeping during deliberations.\nThe court noted that ―on many occasions‖ during the trial it had to send the bailiff\nover to ―wake her up, give her cups of water.‖ The court pointed to one example\nwhen the tape of defendant‘s interrogation was being played and the jury followed\nalong with transcripts. ―[S]he would go as long as five pages without turning the\ntranscript and then all of a sudden would kind of start, come awake, and turn\nseveral pages at once and then repeat the process.‖ Based on these observations\nand the statements of her fellow jurors, the court said, ―it is probable . . . that she\ndoes have a problem staying awake.‖\n       The court did not find there was sufficient evidence to conclude either that\nJuror No. 10 wished to prolong the proceedings or was receiving information from\noutside sources.\n       The court concluded it was ―very clear‖ that Juror No. 10 had ―violate[d]\nher jury oath by not deliberating.‖ The court stated, ―You can‘t take a position\nand refuse to discuss the basis for it,‖ and found ―a consistent pattern where . . . if\nit‘s a situation where she is in disagreement with other jurors, simply takes the\nposition and then stonewalls.‖\n       Finally, the court cited ―her inability to participate because of [her] illness.‖\nThe court alluded to the fact that the jury had been given ―a certain time line‖ for\nthe trial that Juror No. 10‘s illness was disrupting. He noted that, given the flu-\n\n\n\n                                           39\n\flike symptoms she had described, she might be contagious. Accordingly, the trial\ncourt excused her.\n       Defense counsel objected to the dismissal. He argued it was unclear\nwhether Juror No. 10‘s unwillingness to express her opinion was on minor or\nimportant issues. He argued further if she had already made her point and did not\nwish to restate it declining to do so did not constitute a refusal to deliberate. The\ncourt clarified that it found the areas of disagreement to be on important issues and\nthat, while there were instances when Juror No. 10 did discuss evidence, ―it‘s\npretty clear that the norm is that she has a predisposition not to deliberate.‖\n       The court excused Juror No. 10 and the clerk so informed her.\nNonetheless, Juror No. 10 appeared the next day and accused her fellow jurors of\nnot beginning deliberations anew when previous jurors had been excused. She\nreported she was taking antibiotic and pain medicine for an ear infection and was\n―like drugged, dragging.‖ Her statements regarding renewed deliberations are\ndiscussed below.\n\n           2. Discussion\n       The trial court may discharge a juror for good cause at any time, including\nduring deliberations, if the court finds that the juror is ―unable to perform his or\nher duty.‖ (§ 1089.) As noted, ―[w]e review a trial court‘s decision to discharge a\njuror under an abuse of discretion standard, and will uphold the decision if the\nrecord supports the juror‘s disqualification as a demonstrable reality.‖ (People v.\nWilson, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 26.) The trial court gave three reasons for excusing\nJuror No. 10: (1) she was sleeping during deliberations; (2) she violated her oath\nby refusing to deliberate; and (3) her illness would delay the proceedings\nindefinitely. Because the first reason is sufficient to uphold the court‘s ruling, it is\n\n\n\n\n                                          40\n\funnecessary for us to address the court‘s remaining grounds.

Johnson, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the trial court excused a juror after\nfinding the juror had fallen asleep at trial. ―The court, its two deputies, and the\nprosecutor each stated on the record that they had observed [the juror] exhibiting\nvarious physical indicia of sleep, including eye closures, head nodding, and\nslumping in his chair.‖ (Id. at p. 21.) We concluded the trial court had properly\ndischarged the juror, notwithstanding the defendant‘s claim that the court had not\ninquired of the juror whether he had been asleep. (Id. at pp. 21-22.)\n       In People v. Ramirez (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600470\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600470/people-v-ramirez/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the court excused a juror over\nthe defendant‘s objection after receiving a note from the foreperson ―that the juror\nhad fallen asleep on two occasions.‖ (Id. at p. 456.) The court questioned the\nforeperson who confirmed that he had seen the juror sleeping. The court added\nthat it had noticed the juror ― ‗behaving as if he were dozing off from time to\ntime.‘ ‖ (Id. at p. 457.) Based on the foreperson‘s statements and the court‘s own\nobservations, the court excused the juror for sleeping. We affirmed: ―The judge‘s\nobservations were consistent with the testimony of the jury foreperson that the\njuror had fallen asleep twice during deliberations. The trial court, therefore, did\nnot abuse its discretion in discharging the juror.‖ (Id. at p. 458.)\n       Here, the record is more extensive than in Johnson and Ramirez. Juror No.\n2 affirmatively stated that he had seen Juror No. 10 sleeping during deliberations,\n\n                                          41\n\fadding that he sat ―two seats away from her, so I can see her very clearly.‖ Five\nother jurors described behavior consistent with sleeping. The juror closed her eyes\nand leaned back in her chair, once for at least 15 minutes. She would later appear\nto have no idea what the other jurors had been discussing while she was in this\nposture. One of the jurors reported Juror No. 10 slept during instructions. To this\ntestimony, the court added its own observations that ―on many occasions‖ it had to\nhave the bailiff wake her and bring her water. The court referred to a specific\ninstance while the jury listened to the recording of defendant‘s statement to the\npolice. This record reveals no abuse of discretion in excusing the juror for\nsleeping.\n\n       F. Alleged Coercion of Verdict\n       Defendant contends that the verdict reached following the dismissal of\nJuror No. 10 was the product of coercion, violating his rights under various\nconstitutional provisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.) His claim\ncan also be understood to assert that the jury failed to deliberate anew as\ninstructed. In either case, he cites allegations of juror misconduct made by Juror\nNo. 10 regarding deliberations after previous jurors had been dismissed and the\nspeed with which the jury reached its verdict after Juror No. 10 was excused. We\nconsider and reject both aspects of his challenge.\n\n            1. Background\n       Juror No. 10 was excused from the jury on Wednesday, April 1, and\nnotified of her excusal that afternoon. The next morning, Thursday, April 2, Juror\nNo. 10 appeared in court and accused her fellow jurors of not beginning\ndeliberations anew when two alternates had been seated. According to Juror No.\n10, the remaining jurors asked the newcomers what they thought and told them\nwhat the previous group had decided. She elaborated: ―[W]e spent a week and a\n\n\n\n                                         42\n\fhalf in there before we could even vote on issues, and then you come in and you\njust say how you felt about certain charges, and then we listened and we said that‘s\nhow we felt, and then we voted.‖ She also said the jury had voted on 11 charges\nbefore the alternates were seated.22 After Juror No. 10 left the courtroom, defense\ncounsel indicated he would seek a mistrial because the jury failed to deliberate\nanew. The court said it would consider the motion when it was filed, but pointed\nout ―starting anew does not necessarily mean that the jury is required to repeat\nevery step and every word and every nuance of [its] deliberations, including\nasking for the same testimony to be reread or the same words to be spoken or\nthings of that nature.‖\n       Following that discussion, the court convened the jury and Juror No. 10‘s\nreplacement, Alternate Juror No. 4. The court read CALJIC No. 17.51, which\nadmonished the jury not to consider for any purpose the replacement of Juror No.\n10 and to ―set aside and disregard all past deliberations and begin deliberating\nanew. This means that each remaining original juror must set aside and disregard\nthe earlier deliberations as if they had not taken place.‖\n       The reconstituted jury began deliberations at 10:30 a.m. on Thursday, April\n2 and adjourned at 4:10 p.m. During that time, it requested that portions of\nMondre Weatherspoon‘s testimony be read back. They agreed on verdicts for nine\nof the 11 counts. The jury did not deliberate on Friday, April 3. The following\nMonday, April 6, deliberations resumed at 9:30 a.m. That afternoon, the jury sent\na note requesting clarification of the phrase ―to wit‖ in an instruction concerning\n\n\n\n22      Those votes were not formally returned as verdicts. Final verdicts on all\ncounts were returned only after Juror No. 10 was excused and a third alternate\nseated.\n\n\n\n                                          43\n\fsentence enhancements. At 2:15 p.m., the jury reached verdicts on the remaining\ntwo counts.\n       Defendant‘s mistrial motion was heard after the verdicts were recorded but\nbefore the penalty phase began. The trial court rejected the idea that CALJIC No.\n17.51 required the jury to backtrack and duplicate every discussion it had had\nbefore the new jurors were seated. ―It means in good faith they start from the\nbeginning discussing issues and show a willingness to include the newly seated\njuror or jurors so that all decisions are made with all 12 jurors participating in that\nfunction.‖ The court noted that, between the time the two alternates were seated\nand Juror No. 10 made her allegations, the jury had requested readbacks and\nsubmitted a question. ―[S]o I am satisfied that they were deliberating within the\nlegal meaning of Section 17.51; therefore, the motion for mistrial is denied.‖\n\n           2. Discussion\n       There is no merit to defendant‘s claim that the reconstituted jury was\ncoerced into reaching a verdict or that it failed to deliberate anew. ―We presume\n[it] followed the trial court‘s instructions to begin the deliberation anew [citation],\nand defendant‘s speculation to the contrary does not persuade us to conclude\notherwise.‖ (People v. Fuiva (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844218\"><a href=\"/opinion/844218/people-v-fuiava/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 716.) Here, that presumption\nis supported by the actual, deliberative conduct of the reconstituted jury. It\nrequested a readback and asked the court for clarification of instructions.\nDefendant asserts the length of deliberations is evidence the jury did not follow\nthe instruction to begin deliberations anew. ―But the brevity of the deliberations\nproves nothing. [Citations.] The newly constituted jury was not required to\ndeliberate for the same length of time as the original jury, nor was it required to\nreview the same evidence. When, as here, there are no indications to the contrary,\nwe assume that the jurors followed the trial court‘s instructions and started afresh.\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\f[Citation.]‖ (People v. Leonard (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2632907\"><a href=\"/opinion/2632907/people-v-leonard/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1413.) Defendant‘s\nfurther claim that the trial court‘s excusal of Juror Nos. 10 and 12 communicated\nto the jury the court‘s view that defendant was guilty is meritless. The two jurors\nwere excused at different points in the trial and for different reasons. Nothing said\nby the court on either occasion communicated any court opinion as to defendant‘s\nguilt or innocence.\n       Defendant asserts that Juror No. 10‘s accusations of misconduct are\nevidence that the jury refused to deliberate anew. We assume, without deciding,\nher statements were admissible under Evidence Code section 1150, subdivision\n(a).23 Plainly, the trial court rejected the former juror‘s implicit belief that\nredeliberation required repetition of every step taken to the point when the new\njurors were seated. Thus, contrary to defendant‘s claim, the trial court was not\nobliged to instruct the jury to discontinue engaging in the \"improper practices\"\nasserted by Juror No. 10. Moreover, Juror No. 10 obviously was not present\nduring the deliberations of the jury that actually rendered the verdicts. Finally, to\nthe extent defendant faults the court for failing to conduct a more thorough\ninvestigation, the contention is forfeited by his failure to raise it below. In any\nevent, the trial court acted within its discretion as to the scope of any such\ninvestigation. (People v. Alexander (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2386649\"><a href=\"/opinion/2386649/people-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">49</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 927.)\n\n\n\n23      That statute provides: ―Upon an inquiry as to the validity of a verdict, any\notherwise admissible evidence may be received as to statements made, or conduct,\nconditions, or events occurring, either within or without the jury room, of such\ncharacter as is likely to have influenced the verdict improperly. No evidence is\nadmissible to show the effect of such statement, conduct, condition, or event upon\na juror either in influencing him to assent or to dissent from the verdict or\nconcerning the mental processes by which it was determined.‖ (Evid. Code,\n§ 1150, subd. (a).)\n\n\n\n                                           45\n\f       G. Sufficiency of Evidence to Support Robbery-Murder Special\n          Circumstance\n       Defendant contends insufficient evidence supported the robbery-murder\nspecial circumstance based on an aiding and abetting theory. According to\ndefendant, the evidence failed to establish he was a major participant in the target\noffense or exhibited reckless indifference to human life as required by section\n190.2, subdivision (d).\n       In considering such a challenge ― ‗we review the entire record in the light\nmost favorable to the judgment to determine whether it contains substantial\nevidence — that is, evidence that is reasonable, credible, and of solid value —\nfrom which a reasonable trier of fact could find the defendant guilty beyond a\nreasonable doubt.‘ [Citation.] We determine ‗whether, after viewing the evidence\nin the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have\nfound the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.‘ [Citation.]\nIn so doing, a reviewing court ‗presumes in support of the judgment the existence\nof every fact the trier could reasonably deduce from the evidence.‘ [Citation.]‖\n(People v.

His\ninterpretation of evidence is contrary to the governing standard of review and the\nproven facts.\n       Defendant was the founder, ringerleader and mastermind behind the Pimp-\nStyle Hustlers. He formed the gang the day after he, Dearaujo and Weatherspoon\ncommitted a robbery during which Dearaujo used defendant‘s gun. The gang‘s\npurpose was to commit robbery and carjacking in order to buy a home and build a\nstock portfolio. Defendant gave the gang members a carjacking tutorial and\ninstructed them that a resisting victim was to be shot.\n       Defendant directed the attempted carjacking of Phillips and Nolin and that\nof DeGeorge. He personally robbed Nonies and tried to carjack Brodbeck.\nDefendant also ordered Dearaujo and Lyons to rob a liquor store, which led to the\nrobbery at the Los Angeles Times distribution center. In each case, defendant\nchose and armed the gang member he commissioned to commit the crime or was\nhimself armed with the gun.\n       The circumstances of the murder followed the pattern of the crimes that\npreceded and followed it. Defendant directed Dearaujo to go to the Family Fitness\nCenter and to carjack a specific type of car, which he described in detail. He gave\n\n                                         47\n\fDearaujo the gun along with a bandana to cover his face. He described where they\nshould meet after the crime. He reminded Dearaujo to put the victim in the trunk.\nDefendant himself told police he understood that Dearaujo was ―gonna jack a car‖\nand that he had repeatedly instructed gang members to shoot a victim who\nresisted. Defendant later commended Dearaujo and Lyons and awarded them\nstripes for the murder. His claim of tangential involvement and ignorance are\nmanifestly at odds with the evidence arrayed against him. The facts adduced are\nmore than sufficient to uphold the special circumstance finding that defendant was\na major participant and acted with reckless indifference to human life.\n                           III. PENALTY PHASE ISSUES\n\n       A. Defense Counsel’s Asserted Conflict of Interest\n       Defendant contends his public defender had a conflict of interest because\nhis office had previously represented prosecution witnesses who appeared at the\npenalty phase. He asserts the conflict violated his rights under various\nconstitutional provisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th & 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art.\nI, § 15.) We reject the claim.\n\n           1. Background\n       After Donald Deloney testified about violent activities he and defendant\nhad engaged in while in jail, a representative from the public defender‘s office,\nFloyd Zagorsky, requested an in camera hearing to discuss a possible conflict of\ninterest.24 Zagorsky related that the office had previously represented Deloney.\nThat prior representation created a conflict of interest because Zargorsky believed\n\n\n24     Zagorsky is identified in the record only as a member of the public\ndefender‘s office making a special appearance on defendant‘s behalf. No further\nexplanation is given about why he, rather than defendant‘s trial counsel, also a\npublic defender, brought this conflict to the court‘s attention.\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\fthere was material in Deloney‘s files potentially useful for his cross-examination.\nLater, Zagorsky reported his office had represented three other prosecution\nwitnesses — David Ramirez, Christopher Willis and Timothy Goodfield.\nZagorsky eventually said he believed there was also a conflict as to four additional\nprosecution witnesses; Arturo Alatorre, Dale Foster, Michael Hanna and Martin\nSanchez, all of whom had been represented by the public defender‘s office.\nDefendant‘s counsel, Deputy Public Defender Wright, informed the court he had\nnot represented any of these witnesses and did not have any confidential\ninformation about them. Specifically addressing Deloney, Wright argued he did\nnot have an actual conflict of interest just because another public defender had\nrepresented Deloney. Zargorsky took the position that an actual conflict existed\nwhen anyone in the public defender‘s office reviewed the files of former clients\nand declared a conflict. The trial court did not find a conflict of interest. 25\n\n           2. Discussion\n       To successfully establish a conflict of interest, ―defendant must show the\nexistence of an actual or potential conflict ‗that adversely affected counsel‘s\nperformance.‘ [Citations.] A conflict of interest may arise if counsel‘s former\nclient is a prosecution witness in the case against the defendant. [Citations.] This\nis because counsel‘s duty not to reveal confidential information acquired during\nthe attorney-client relationship creates conflicting obligations to multiple clients\nthat ‗effectively seal[s] his lips on crucial matters.‘ [Citation.] As we recognized\nin People v. Cox (2003) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639471\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639471/people-v-cox/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 949, however, courts have held that no\n\n\n\n25    The court ordered Wright not to examine his office‘s files on the\nprosecution witnesses for impeachment material but did not preclude him from\ndeveloping such material from his own independent investigation.\n\n\n\n                                          49\n\factual or potential conflict of interest arises when the attorney does not possess\nsuch confidential information.‖ (People v. Clark (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 983-984.)\n        Here, Deputy Public Defender Wright told the court he had not represented,\nnor did he possess, any confidential information about the prosecution witnesses in\nquestion. ―[Wright], as an officer of the court, was in the best position to assess\nwhether a conflict of interest existed or was likely to arise.‖ (People v. Clark\n(1993) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">5</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">950</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1001.) ―[T]he court may rely on the representations of\ndefense counsel that no conflict exists.‖ (People v. Lawley (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585200\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585200/people-v-lawley/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">102</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n146.)\n        Notwithstanding Wright‘s representations, defendant insists an actual\nconflict existed because Zagorsky had declared one based on information in client\nfiles. An analogous argument was made in People v. Clark, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">856</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\nThere, Deputy Public Defender Martinez conceded she had not personally\nrepresented a prosecution witness previously represented by her office, nor had\nshe obtained information developed by another public defender during the\nattorney-client relationship. Nonetheless, she declared a conflict. The defendant\nin Clark argued that her declaration distinguished the case from earlier cases like\nLawley in which no conflict had been declared. We rejected the claim. ―That\nMartinez declared a conflict is not dispositive of its existence, however.‖ (Clark,\nat p. 984.) Given Martinez‘s concessions, we concluded, based on the totality of\nthe circumstances, that there was ―no showing of an actual or potential conflict of\ninterest [here].‖ (Ibid.) Similarly, there is no showing of an actual or potential\nconflict of interest in this case, Zagorsky‘s statement notwithstanding.\n        In a related claim, defendant suggests that the prosecution withheld\nimpeachment evidence about Deloney and other penalty phase prosecution\nwitnesses. (Brady v. Maryland (1963) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106598\"><a href=\"/opinion/106598/brady-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) Not only is the claim\nforfeited because it was not made below, nothing in the record supports the\n\n                                         50\n\fexistence of any undisclosed impeachment evidence known to the prosecution.\nThe claim fails as it is based on pure speculation.\n\n       B. Victim Impact Evidence Claims\n       Defendant challenges the victim impact evidence as irrelevant and\nprejudicial and asserts its admission violated his rights under various constitutional\nprovisions. (U.S. Const., 5th, 6th, 8th & 14th Amends.) He contends further that\nthe trial court erred by failing to give sua sponte a limiting instruction on the use\nof the victim impact evidence. Many of defendant‘s specific claims, including his\nclaim of instructional error, are forfeited. All are without merit.\n       ― ‗The Eighth Amendment does not prohibit the admission of evidence\nshowing how a defendant‘s crimes directly impacted the victim‘s family, friends,\nand the community as a whole, unless such evidence is ―so unduly prejudicial‖\nthat it results in a trial that is ―fundamentally unfair.‖ [Citations.] Likewise, under\nstate law, victim impact evidence is admissible as a circumstance of the crime\nunder section 190.3, factor (a), so long as it ―is not so inflammatory as to elicit\nfrom the jury an irrational or emotional response untethered to the facts of the\ncase.‖ [Citations.]‘ ‖ (People v. Pearson (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 466-467.)\n― ‗[T]he state has a legitimate interest in ― ‗counteracting the mitigating evidence\nwhich the defendant is entitled to put in, by reminding the sentencer that just as the\nmurderer should be considered as an individual, so too the victim is an individual\nwhose death represents a unique loss to society and in particular to [her]\nfamily.‘ ‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Linton, supra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1203.)\n       Defendant objects to the quantity, scope and nature of the victim impact\ntestimony, asserting that the 10 victim impact witnesses consumed a fifth of the\nprosecution‘s penalty phase case. He objected, however, only to the testimony of\nthree of those witnesses, Los‘s fiancé, Paul Petrosky and her coworkers\n\n\n\n                                          51\n\fChristopher Reusch and Captain Margaret Foltz. He also objected to admission of\na video of the dormitory dedication in the victim‘s honor, and another depicting a\nseries of still photographs of the victim set to music. The trial court admitted both\ntapes but directed that the music accompanying the second be muted to avoid\nevocation of an emotional response. The court also properly allowed the\nprosecution to call the three nonfamily member witnesses to whom defendant\nobjected. Victim impact testimony is not limited to testimony of family members.\n(People v. Pollock (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621639\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621639/people-v-pollock/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1153</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1183.) Defendant did not object to the\ntestimony of the victim‘s family members or her former husband. His claims\nregarding their testimony are forfeited. (Evid. Code, §353; Pollock, at p. 1183.)\nDefendant asserts any objection would have been futile in view of the trial court‘s\nadmission of other testimony and videos. The argument fails. The trial court\ncarefully listened to defendant‘s objections, modifying one exhibit by excluding\nthe music. We will not assume the trial court would have been any less\nconscientious had defendant timely objected to the evidence he challenges here.\n       In any event, defendant‘s claims are meritless. First, as to number. The 10\nvictim impact witnesses constituted 20 percent of the prosecution‘s case. In other\nwords, 80 percent of the prosecution‘s phase was directed at other matters,\nprimarily defendant‘s propensity for violence. Further, any argument attempting\nto put a numerical limit on evidence of this nature is of minimal persuasiveness.\nThe question is the qualitative fairness of the evidence, not an arbitrary\nquantification. The testimony of each victim impact witness was relatively brief.\nThe testimony of Los‘s father, for example, consists of 12 pages; her mother‘s,\neight; her son‘s, two. The most extensive testimony, that of her fiancé, consumes\n22 pages. The evidence, representing three generations of the victim‘s family, her\nformer husband, coworkers and current fiancé, was neither unduly inflammatory\nnor unfairly prejudicial. (See People v. Taylor (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2600070\"><a href=\"/opinion/2600070/people-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">48</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 646 [proper\n\n                                         52\n\fto admit victim impact testimony of six family members representing four\ngenerations of the victim‘s close family].) The evidence was ― ‗very typical of the\nvictim impact evidence we routinely permit.‘ ‖ (People v. Pearson, supra, 56\nCal.4th at p. 467.)\n       Defendant‘s contends that victim impact evidence should be limited to\ntestimony that describes the impact on family members present at the scene or\nimmediately thereafter, and to those effects known or reasonably knowable to\ndefendant at the time of the murder. We have previously rejected these\narguments. (People v. Pollock, supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 1183.) So too have we\nrejected the argument advanced here that victim impact evidence should provide\nno more than a quick glimpse into the victim‘s life. ―The People are entitled to\npresent a ‗ ―complete life histor[y] [of the murder victim] from early childhood to\ndeath.‖ ‘ ‖ (People v. Garcia (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"844248\"><a href=\"/opinion/844248/people-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 751.) Nor did the trial court\nerr in admitting the videotape of the dedication ceremony. In People v. Huggins\n(2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2575903\"><a href=\"/opinion/2575903/people-v-huggins/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, we held that the testimony that the victim‘s ―community. . .\nmourned her death by placing a bronze statue of her at the . . . public library‖ was\npermissible. (Id. at p. 239.) Admission of the videotape of still photographs of the\nliving victim was likewise within the court‘s discretion. (People v. Linton, supra,\n56 Cal.4th at pp. 1202-1204.)\n       Defendant contends further that the contrast between the victim‘s life and\nhis own invited the jury to draw invidious comparisons. In support, he asserts that\nthe prosecutor explicitly urged the jury to make these comparisons in her closing\nargument and, further, improperly raised the issue of race. Defendant failed to\nobject to any of the identified statements, forfeiting the claim. (People v. Lopez,\nsupra, 56 Cal.4th at p. 1073.) The claim is also without merit. The contrast the\nprosecutor drew between the victim‘s positive effect on the lives she touched and\ndefendant‘s violent crimes was reasonable commentary on the weighing of\n\n                                         53\n\faggravating and mitigating circumstances and fell within the wide range of\npermissible argument. (See People v. Dykes (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2625630\"><a href=\"/opinion/2625630/people-v-dykes/\"><span class=\"volume\">46</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 789-791.)\nThe prosecutor‘s fleeting reference to the ―Crips‖ when explaining the nature of\ndefendant‘s gang was not an appeal to race, directly or implicitly. Her\ncharacterization of defendant as ―sociopathic‖ was consistent with the evidence\nand fell within the permissible range of argument. (People v. Zambrano (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2517801\"><a href=\"/opinion/2517801/people-v-zambrano/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1082</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1172-1173.)\n       Defendant also challenges the court‘s instructions regarding consideration\nof this evidence. The trial court read CALJIC No. 8.84.1, which stated in part:\n―You must neither be influenced by bias nor prejudice against the defendant, nor\nswayed by public opinion or public feelings. In your consideration of whether the\nsentence of death is appropriate, you should not consider the race, color, religious\nbeliefs, national origin, or sex of the defendant or the victim.‖ Defendant asserts\nthis instruction was insufficient to guide the jury in the consideration of victim\nimpact evidence and that the court, sua sponte, should have provided an\ninstruction to that end. Defendant‘s claim is forfeited by his failure to request\nclarification or modification of the instruction. (People v. Guerra (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2633286\"><a href=\"/opinion/2633286/people-v-guerra/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1067</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1134.) Defendant asserts such a request would have been futile.\nWe reject it for the same reason we rejected his previous claim of futility.\nMoreover, we have consistently ―rejected the argument that a trial court must\ninstruct the jury not to be influenced by emotion resulting from victim impact\nevidence.‖ (People v. Carey (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2543856\"><a href=\"/opinion/2543856/people-v-carey/\"><span class=\"volume\">41</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">109</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134.) We do so again.\n\n       C. Instructional Claims\n               1. Lingering Doubt\n       Defendant assigns error for refusal to give a lingering doubt instruction.\n―There is no federal or state right to such an instruction. [Citations.] Rather, we\n\n\n\n                                          54\n\fhave held that ‗the standard instructions on capital sentencing factors, together\nwith counsel‘s closing argument, are sufficient to convey the lingering doubt\nconcept to the jury.‘ [Citations.] Defendant cites no persuasive reason to revisit\nthis conclusion.‖ (People v. Edwards (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 765; accord, People\nv.

CALJIC No. 8.85\n       Defendant contends that CALJIC No. 8.85, the standard instruction\nidentifying the aggravating and mitigating circumstances, is ―constitutionally\nflawed.‖ The defect, according to defendant, is that the instruction failed to advise\nthe jury which factors were aggravating, which were mitigating, and which could\nbe considered as either mitigating or aggravating depending of the jury‘s view of\nthe evidence. ―As defendant acknowledges, we have in the past repeatedly\nrejected [this] contention[]. Thus, we have held that the trial court is not obligated\nto identify which factors are mitigating and which are aggravating . . . .‖ (People\nv. Lewis (2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 532; People v.

We decline to reconsider this precedent.\n\n           3. CALJIC No. 8.88\n       Defendant raises familiar challenges to CALJIC No. 8.88, the standard jury\ninstruction on how to weigh the aggravating and mitigating evidence. As\ndefendant acknowledges, we have in the past rejected each of these contentions:\n―The court was not required to instruct the jury that (1) it could return a verdict of\nlife imprisonment without possibility of parole even if the circumstances in\naggravation outweighed those in mitigation; (2) it was required to return a verdict\nof life without possibility of parole if it found that the aggravating factors did not\noutweigh the mitigating factors or that death was not the appropriate punishment;\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\for (3) it could return a verdict of life without possibility of parole even in the\ncomplete absence of mitigating evidence. [Citations.] The term ‗so substantial‘ as\nused in CALJIC No. 8.88 is not unconstitutionally vague [citation] and does not\nimproperly direct a verdict in favor of death if the jury finds aggravation\noutweighs mitigation [citation].‖ (People v. Whalen (2013) 5</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">6</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 89.)\n―Finally, the trial court need not instruct the jury that life imprisonment without\npossibility of parole is presumed to be the appropriate penalty unless the\nprosecution proves to the contrary. [Citation.] We decline defendant‘s invitation\nto revisit these holdings.‖ (People v. Lewis, supra, 43 Cal.4th at p. 534.)\n\n       D. Trial Court Response to Jury Request for Clarification Regarding\n          Life Without Possibility of Parole\n       Defendant requested an instruction that, if sentenced to death, the jury\n―must assume . . . the defendant . . . will be executed in the gas chamber or by\nlethal injection,‖ and that, if sentenced to life without parole, the jury must\n―assume that he will not be paroled.‖ The court declined to give the instruction.\nInstead, it gave the jury CALJIC No. 8.84: ―It is the law of this state that the\npenalty for a defendant found guilty of murder of the first degree shall be death or\nconfinement in the state prison for life without possibility of parole in any case in\nwhich the special circumstances alleged in this case has been specially found to be\ntrue. [¶] Under the law of this state, you must now determine which of these\npenalties shall be imposed on the defendant.‖\n       During deliberations, the jury sent the court the following note: ―If we vote\nfor life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. Does that mean no good\ntime off at all. Or he may be able to get out in 40 or 50 yrs or what ever. Will he\nspend his natural life in prison and never get out. [¶] If we vote for death\npenalty can the judge overturn our decision?‖\n\n\n\n\n                                           56\n\f        After discussing the issue, and with the reluctant agreement of defense\ncounsel, the court responded to the first question: ―[Y]ou are not to speculate on\nsuch issues but are to follow the court‘s instruction previously given.‖ Similarly,\nthe court replied to the second question: ―[Y]ou[] are instructed that you are not to\nspeculate as to such issues but instead are instructed to concentrate on your\nresponsibilities and functions as you have previously been instructed.‖ The trial\ncourt‘s response was consistent with our recommended instruction on this point in\nPeople v. Letner and Tobin, supra, 50 Cal.4th at page 206.\n        Defendant now contends that both the court‘s response and CALJIC No.\n8.84 were inadequate to properly convey the jury‘s sentencing responsibilities.\nHis arguments rest on Simmons v.

First, he argues that the\ndeath penalty is disproportionate when applied to a defendant convicted of felony\nmurder as an aider and abettor because the statute does not require proof that he\nacted with a culpable state of mind, permitting him to be executed for an\nunintentional or accidental killing. Second, he asserts his punishment is\ndisproportionate to his culpability under a Dillon analysis. (People v. Dillon\n(1983) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2615135\"><a href=\"/opinion/2615135/people-v-dillon/\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">441</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) His arguments fail.\n\n\n\n\n                                         57\n\f       As noted above, section 190.2, subdivision (d) permits the imposition of a\ndeath sentence for a defendant who aids and abets the commission of a robbery\nthat results in death when it is proven the defendant acted with reckless\nindifference to human life and was a major participant in the commission of the\nfelony. ―Th[is] portion of the statutory language . . . derives verbatim from the\nUnited States Supreme Court‘s decision in Tison v. Arizona (1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111863\"><a href=\"/opinion/111863/tison-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> . . . . In Tison, the court held that the Eighth Amendment does not prohibit as\ndisproportionate the imposition of the death penalty on a defendant convicted of\nfirst degree felony murder who was a ‗major participant‘ in the underlying felony,\nand whose mental state is one of ‗reckless indifference to human life.‘ [Citation.]\nThe incorporation of Tison‘s rule into section 190.2(d) — in express terms —\nbrought state capital sentencing law into conformity with prevailing Eighth\nAmendment doctrine.‖ (People v. Estrada, supra, 11 Cal.4th at p. 575.)\nAccordingly, we reject defendant‘s claim that his conviction under this section\nviolates the Eighth Amendment. The assertion in his reply brief that Tison is no\nlonger good law must be addressed to the United States Supreme Court.\n       Regarding his second claim, as defendant concedes, we have repeatedly\nheld that intercase proportionality review is not required. (People v. Carpenter\n(1997) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 421; People v.

Except in age,\ndefendant bears no semblance to the immature 17-year-old defendant in Dillon\nwho shot and killed his victim in a panic and was sentenced to life in prison\ndespite the views of the judge and jury that his sentence was disproportionate to\nhis moral culpability. (Id. at p. 487.) We need not repeat the facts of this case nor\ndefendant‘s role as kingpin in a brief but violent and lethal crime wave. The\npenalty is not disproportionate to his culpability.\n\n                                          58\n\f       F.

[Citation.] ‗Use\nof the adjectives ―extreme‖ and ―substantial‖ in section 190.3, factors (d) and (g)\nis constitutional.‘ [Citation.] [¶] ‗The failure to require intercase proportionality\ndoes not guarantee ―arbitrary, discriminatory, or disproportionate impositions of\nthe death penalty.‖ ‘ [Citations.] Moreover ‗capital and noncapital defendants are\nnot similarly situated and therefore may be treated differently without violating\nconstitutional guarantees of equal protection of the laws . . . ,‘ due process of law,\nor the cruel and unusual punishment clause.‖ (People v.

Cumulative Effect of Error\n       Defendant asserts that numerous alleged errors, committed during both\nphases of his trial, cumulatively prejudiced him and require reversal of his\nconviction and of the judgment of death. We have either found no error or, in\nthose instances where error has been found or assumed, no prejudice. Thus, there\nis no prejudice to accumulate.\n                               IV. RESTITUTION FINE\n       Defendant contends the trial court improperly imposed a $10,000 restitution\nfine without considering his ability to pay. As the Attorney General points out,\nwhen defendant committed his 1993 crimes and when he was sentenced in 1998,\nthe relevant statutes authorized the trial court to consider a defendant‘s ability to\npay in imposing the restitution fine. (Former § 1202.4, subd. (a); former Gov.\nCode, § 13967, subd. (a).) Defendant failed to raise this issue at his sentencing.\nAccordingly, his claim is forfeited. (People v.
