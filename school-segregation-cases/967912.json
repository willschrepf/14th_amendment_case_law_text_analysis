Ray and Jessen contracted to sell the\n\nBattle Ground Plaza                     Center ( BG Plaza   Property)   to BG Plaza LLC.           The contract\n                         Shopping\n\nincluded a right of first refusal provision for an adjacent 0. 5 acre undeveloped parcel (undeveloped\n\nparcel).\n\n\n\n\n           First, BG Plaza LLC argues the superior court erred by granting summary judgment for\n\nRay and Jessen because they failed to comply with the right of first refusal provision. BG Plaza\n\nLLC argues Ray and Jessen contracted to sell the undeveloped parcel to Maldonado without\n\n                                 the \" Reciprocal Easement Agreement\" for parking it      entered     into   with\nadvising BG Plaza LLC       of\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\nMaldonado as part of the undeveloped parcel sale. But the bankruptcy court previously approved\n\nthe sale of the   undeveloped parcel   to Maldonado       and   issued    a   final   order on   the sale.   Thus, BG\n\n\nPlaza LLC' s claim is precluded under the doctrine of collateral estoppel and is an improper\n\ncollateral attack. We affirm the superior court' s grant of summary judgment in favor of Ray and\n\nJessen.\n\n\n          Second, BG Plaza LLC argues the superior court erred by denying its motion for summary\n\njudgment on its seniority claim because its rights to the BG Plaza Property are senior to any right\n\nMaldonado      received   in the Reciprocal Easement Agreement.               Because the sale of the BG Plaza\n\n\nProperty has not closed, BG Plaza LLC does not have an ownership interest in the BG Plaza\n\nProperty. Thus, BG Plaza LLC' s seniority claim is merely hypothetical and speculative and does\n\nnot present an actual, present, and existing dispute that is ripe for review. 1 We affirm the superior\n\ncourt' s denial of BG Plaza LLC' s summary judgment motion.\n\n          Last, BG Plaza LLC argues the superior court abused its discretion when awarding Ray\n\n      Jessen attorney fees                                its             for   an offset of      attorney fees.   We\nand                           and costs   and   denying         request\n\n\n\n\ndisagree and affirm the superior court' s award of attorney fees.\n\n          We affirm the trial court' s grant of summary judgment in favor of Ray and Jessen, its denial\n\nof BG Plaza LLC' s summary judgment motion, and its award of attorney fees.\n\n\n\n\n 1 This argument is more appropriately discussed in terms of the respective parties' rights in the BG\nPlaza Property pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements and the Reciprocal Easement\nAgreement. But because this issue is not ripe for review and we do not reach a decision on it, we\naddress it in terms of the parties argued seniority claim.\n\n                                                      2\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n                                                        FACTS\n\n\nI.         BACKGROUND\n\n\n           As of 2000, Ray and Jessen owned the BG Plaza Property and an adjacent undeveloped\n\nparcel in the City of Battle Ground. On August 10, 2000, Ray filed for relief under Chapter 11 of\n\nthe United States Bankruptcy Code.\n\n           In December 2000, Ray and Jessen entered a purchase and sale agreement to sell the BG\n\nPlaza    Property ( BG    Plaza Agreement) to Bruce Feldman, Inc., who later assigned its interest as\n\n\npurchaser      to BG Plaza LLC.      The BG Plaza Agreement granted BG Plaza LLC a right of first\n\nrefusal to purchase the adjacent undeveloped parcel.2\n\n           On June 8, 2001, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the BG Plaza Property to BG\n\nPlaza LLC.       In March 2002, the bankruptcy court approved Ray' s third amended plan. This plan\n\nincluded the sale of both the jointly owned BG Plaza property to BG Plaza LLC and the\n\n\n2\n     Specifically, the right of first refusal states:\n\n           Seller grants to Purchaser a \" Right of First Refusal\" with respect to the land owned\n           by Seller ( consisting of approximately a half acre) that is immediately adjacent to\n           the Property Purchaser is buying from Seller pursuant to this contract. This Right\n           of.First Refusal means that Seller may not sell or become contractually obligated\n           to sell the adjacent parcel without giving written notice to Purchaser of all of the\n           terms and conditions upon which Seller is willing to sell the adjacent property and\n           giving Purchaser the opportunity to buy the adjacent land on those terms. Purchaser\n           shall have seventy -two ( 72) hours from receipt of any such written notice within\n           which to accept Seller' s offer by serving a written and signed acceptance upon\n           Seller. If Purchaser fails to communicate acceptance of the offer within 72 hours\n           of receipt, then Purchaser' s Right of First Refusal shall lapse as to that particular\n           offer and Seller may sell it upon the stated terms to someone else. In the event that\n           Seller ... becomes willing to sell upon terms that are different than those contained\n           in the original notice, then Purchaser' s Right of First Refusal shall again apply and\n           must be satisfied ( including a new notice) before sale or voluntary transfer of the\n            adjacent property to any other party.\n\n Clerk' s Papers ( CP) at 119.\n\n\n                                                          3\n\f43874 -7 -II\n\n\n\nundeveloped parcel. Under the plan, the undeveloped parcel was to be sold either under the terms\n\nof the right of first refusal or to another third party should BG Plaza LLC not elect to exercise its\n\nright of first refusal.\n\n\n          On May 18, 2005, Ray and Jessen entered a purchase and sale agreement to sell the\n\nundeveloped         parcel (   Parcel Agreement) to Maldonado.                        The Parcel. Agreement included a\n\n\nprovision      that Maldonado'        s \" obligation     to   purchase   the   Property [ was]   conditioned on ...   Review\n\n\n                                                               3\nand acceptance          of the      cross parking agreements. \"                Clerk' s Papers ( CP) at 69 ( emphasis in\n\n\noriginal).     The Parcel Agreement also required Ray and Jessen to deliver to Maldonado within ten\n\ndays   after     the execution      date   a   copy   of a \"[   dross easement for access and parking\" document.\n\nCP   at   70 (   emphasis      in   original).    On May 31, Maldonado signed an addendum to the Parcel\n\nAgreement that referenced the BG Plaza Agreement and BG Plaza LLC' s right of first refusal for\n\nthe undeveloped parcel.\n\n\n          On            27, BG Plaza LLC              received notice      of   the   Parcel Agreement.     BG Plaza LLC\n                  May\n\nneither exercised nor declined to exercise its .right of first refusal, claiming that its right of first\n\nrefusal was not ripe until its purchase of the BG Plaza Property closed. On July 5, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt approved        the   sale of   the   undeveloped parcel          to Maldonado.      BG Plaza LLC never appealed\n\n\nthis order.\n\n\n\n           On October 8, Maldonado, Ray, and Jessen amended the Parcel Agreement, reducing the\n\npurchase price and          extending the closing date.            On October 18, BG Plaza LLC received notice of\n\n\nthe amended Parcel Agreement and, on October 21, gave Ray and Jessen notice of its intent to\n\n exercise its right of first refusal. At the same time it provided a $ 5, 000 promissory note and stated\n\n\n\n\n 3 The cross parking agreement would allow patrons of BG Plaza Property and any establishment\n built on the undeveloped parcel to utilize parking available on both lots.\n                                                                    4\n\f43874 -7 -II\n\n\n\nthat   principal and   interest   would   be   payable   by   December 19.   Shortly thereafter, Ray moved the\n\nbankruptcy court to approve the modified sale of the undeveloped parcel to Maldonado. BG Plaza\n\nLLC objected to the proposed sale and asserted the sale violated the conditions of its right of first\n\nrefusal.    It also requested all cross parking agreements and other documents pertaining to both\n\nproperties from Ray and Jessen. Jessen' s counsel did not respond to BG Plaza LLC' s request.\n\n           On November 1, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the undeveloped parcel to\n\nMaldonado      with    the   revised sale price.     The bankruptcy court ruled that the sale was \" free and\n\nclear of   liens   and encumbrances pursuant          to 11 USC Â§    363, including but not .imited to the right\n                                                                                            l\n\nof first refusal granted to Battle Ground Plaza, LLC, and the deed of trust granted to Battle Ground\n\nPlaza, LLC,    by Irwin P.     Jessen in favor   of   Battle Ground Plaza, LLC.\"    CP at 178. The bankruptcy\n\ncourt found that BG Plaza LLC' s attempted exercise of its right of first refusal failed to mirror the\n\nParcel Agreement.            Subsequently, the bankruptcy court denied BG Plaza LLC' s motion for\n\nreconsideration. BG Plaza LLC did not appeal the bankruptcy court' s approval of the undeveloped\n\nparcel sale to Maldonado or the order denying its motion for reconsideration.\n\n           In November 2005, the undeveloped parcel sale closed; shortly thereafter Ray, Jessen, and\n\nMaldonado          executed    and   recorded    a    Reciprocal   Easement Agreement.        The   sale   of the\n\n\nundeveloped parcel enabled Ray to pay the remaining creditors' claims under the terms of his\n\nchapter 11 plan and, on December 29, the bankruptcy court entered a final decree closing Ray' s\n\nbankruptcy case.\n\nII.        PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n           In June 2006, BG Plaza LLC first learned of Ray, Jessen, and Maldonado' s Reciprocal\n\nEasement Agreement. On July 5, BG Plaza LLC commenced a lawsuit in Clark County Superior\n\n Court     against    Ray,    Jessen,   Maldonado,       and Maldonado' s successor entities for specific\n\n\n\n                                                               5\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n\nperformance,4 damages, and declaratory relief, arguing that Ray and Jessen had failed to comply\n\nwith the terms of BG Plaza LLC' s right of first refusal because they did not advise BG Plaza LLC\n\nof their intent to execute the Reciprocal Easement Agreement.\n\n\n          Maldonado, joined by Ray and Jessen, moved to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis that the\n\nsuperior court        lacked    subject matter      jurisdiction.      The superior court remanded the case to the\n\n\nUnited States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Washington for a determination of\n\nwhether      it had   retained   jurisdiction.      In January 2007, on Ray and Jessen' s motion and over BG\n\nPlaza LLC'      s objection,     the   bankruptcy      court reopened            Ray' s bankruptcy          case.      On August 29,\n\n\n2007, the bankruptcy court entered an order retaining jurisdiction over BG Plaza LLC' s claim for\n\nspecific performance and concerning the respective parties' rights under the Reciprocal Easement\n\nAgreement.5\n\n           The Estate of Jessen6 filed a motion for summary judgment in the bankruptcy court and\n\nargued that there were no material issues of fact about whether Ray and Jessen had failed to provide\n\nBG Plaza LLC with sufficient notice of all conditions on which they would have sold the\n\nundeveloped parcel         to Maldonado.            The bankruptcy court granted Jessen' s motion for summary\n\njudgment; ruled that its previous orders approving the sale were final and not subject to collateral\n\n\n\n4 At oral argument, BG Plaza LLC abandoned its specific performance claim and stated it is now\nseeking ,only damages. Wash. Court of Appeals oral argument, Battle Ground Plaza, LLC v.\nMaldonado, No. 43874 -7 -II (Apr. 1, 2014),                at   6   min.,   20   sec. -   7   min.,   15   sec. (   on file with court).\n\n5\n    The   bankruptcy     court' s order stated: \"[     T] his Court shall retain jurisdiction to hear and decide the\nclaim for      specific performance made              by [ BG       Plaza LLC],       and the US Bankruptcy Court shall\nreserve    jurisdiction    at   this time    over   the claim   made    by [ BG Plaza LLC], concerning the rights of\nthe   respective parties under         the   reciprocal easement        agreement.\"  CP at 405.\n\n\n6\n    Jessen   passed     away in September 2006.             Eugene Anderson and William Macrae -Smith were\nappointed as co- personal representatives of his estate and were substituted for Jessen on November\n9, 2006.\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n\nattack by BG Plaza LLC in state court; and, ruled that, in any event, Ray and Jessen had complied\n\nwith   the terms   of   the   right of   first   refusal.   BG Plaza LLC appealed to the Bankruptcy Appellate\n\nPanel of the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the bankruptcy court' s decision. BG Plaza LLC then\n\nappealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit held the\n\nbankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the state breach of contract claims, reversed the\n\nbankruptcy appellate panel, and remanded with instructions to vacate the bankruptcy court' s\n\njudgment for lack of jurisdiction.?\n\n\n          Before the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion, BG Plaza LLC filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment in Clark        County     Superior Court          on   its seniority   claim.   Ray, Jessen, and Maldonado\n\nasserted that the bankruptcy court still retained jurisdiction over this claim. The bankruptcy court,\n\nhowever, stated that it would not decide the jurisdictional issue on the seniority claim because it\n\nwas not ripe.\n\n\n\n\n          Following remand to the state superior court, BG Plaza LLC moved for summary judgment\nand argued that the Reciprocal Easement Agreement was junior to BG Plaza LLC' s interest in the\n\nBG Plaza Property. Ray and Jessen also moved for summary judgment and argued that BG Plaza\n\nLLC'   s claims were      barred    by    the    bankruptcy      court' s sale order.     The superior court denied BG\n\n\nPlaza LLC' s motion, ruling that BG Plaza LLC' s seniority claim was not ripe because the sale of\n\nthe BG Plaza       Property     to BG Plaza LLC had              not closed.     The superior court granted Ray and\n\nJessen'   s   motion     for    summary judgment,             concluding that BG Plaza LLC' s claims were\n\nextinguished by the bankruptcy court' s November 1, 2005 sale order.\n\n\n\n\n7 The Ninth Circuit stated that the \" Clark County Court was perfectly capable of taking jurisdiction\nand assessing whether BG Plaza [ LLC' s] claim is precluded given that the sale had already been\nfinalized     and approved      in the   previous     bankruptcy      proceeding.\"      CP at 263.\n\n                                                                  7\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\nIII.        ATTORNEY FEES\n\n\n            After the superior court' s summary judgment rulings, Ray and Jessen filed a motion for\n\nattorney fees and costs in the amount of $229, 648. 67 pursuant to two prevailing party attorney fee\n\nprovisions in the BG Plaza Agreement. 8 The superior court denied this motion and stated ( 1) it\n\nwould not award         fees   under   CR 11   and   RCW 4.84. 185; (      2) it would consider only those fees from\n\nthe bankruptcy court proceedings \" that can be allocated to the support of the Court' s order for\n\nsummary judgment\"              and that \" there is going to have to be a tie -in of how those bankruptcy\n\nproceeding         matters related   to the Court'   s ultimate   entry ...    of the order for summary judgment \";\n\n 3) it would not award any attorney fees related to BG Plaza LLC' s seniority claim; and ( 4) the\n\nfees requested must be reasonable considering the multiple attorneys and paralegals that\n\nparticipated. Report of Proceedings ( RP) at 5.\n\n\n            In response to the superior court' s oral ruling, Ray and Jessen submitted an amended\n\nmotion       for attorney fees       and costs   in the   amount    of $ 100,    114. 77.    This fee request included\n\n\n  12, 463. 00 for the      services of   Michael Higgins,         who   had   initially   represented   Ray; $ 990. 00 for\n\nthe services of Timothy Dack, who had initially represented Jessen; and $ 86, 661. 77 for the services\n\nof Bullivant Houser Bailey, who represented both Ray and Jessen.\n\n\n\n\n8 BG Plaza Agreement provision 10 states:\n\n            In the event suit or action is instituted by Seller, Purchaser, Purchaser' s Agent or\n            Seller' s Agent to enforce or declare the meaning of any of the terms of this contract,\n            the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover such sum as the court may adjudge\n            reasonable as attorney fees at trial and on any appeal of any such suit or action, in\n            addition to all other sums provided by law.\n\nCP     at   107.

It   awarded $   3, 170. 00 for Michael Higgins'   s   services, $ 137. 50 for\n\n\nTimothy       Dack'   s services, and $   90, 250. 00 ($ 3, 588. 23 more than requested) for Bullivant Houser\n\n\nBailey' s     services.   BG Plaza LLC appeals the superior court' s dismissal of its lawsuit and award\n\n\nof attorney fees to Ray and Jessen.9\n\n             During the pendency ofthis appeal, and because the superior court had not entered findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law on its attorney fee award, we remanded the case for entry of findings\n\nof    fact   and conclusions of     law. On remand, the superior court entered findings and conclusions\n\n\nand also corrected an error in its initial fee award and instead awarded a, total of $82, 803. 67 in\n\nattorney fees and costs to Ray and Jessen. BG Plaza LLC timely appeals.\n\n                                                      ANALYSIS\n\n\nI.           RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL CLAIM\n\n\n             The superior court concluded BG Plaza LLC' s claim seeking to enforce its right of first\n\nrefusal by specific performance or for an award of damages was \" extinguished\" by the bankruptcy\ncourt' s     November 1, 2005        sale order pursuant    to 11 U. S. C. Â§   363.   On appeal, BG Plaza LLC\n\n\nargues that the bankruptcy court' s November 1, 2005 sale order cannot be given such \" preclusive\n\n\n\n\n9\n     Ray and Jessen initially appealed the superior court' s first denial of their request for attorney fees\nand costs.     But following the superior court' s subsequent award of attorney fees, they did not\npursue their appeal and, instead, requested that we affirm the superior court' s award of attorney\nfees and costs.\n\n\n\n                                                            9\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n         10\neffect. \"      Appellant'    s   Br.   at   16.   Because the bankruptcy court' s November 1, 2005 sale order\n\nconcluded that the sale was free and clear of liens and encumbrances, which included BG Plaza\n\nLLC' s right of first refusal, BG Plaza LLC is collaterally estopped from seeking to enforce its right\n\nof first refusal and may not now collaterally attack the sale order in state court.\n\n               C] ollateral estoppel is intended to prevent retrial of one or more of the crucial issues or\n\ndeterminative facts determined in                 previous    litigation.'

Once a party has had a full and fair\n\nopportunity to litigate an issue, the party is precluded from litigating that same issue in subsequent\n                                                                                      1993).

Collateral estoppel requires that the\n\n\n\nparty seeking application of the doctrine establish that:\n\n            1) the issue decided in the earlier proceeding was identical to the issue presented\n           in the later proceeding; (2) the earlier proceeding ended in a judgment on the merits;\n           3) the party against whom collateral estoppel is asserted was a party to, or in privity\n           with a party to, the earlier proceeding; and ( 4) application of collateral estoppel\n           does not work an injustice on the party against whom it is applied.\n\nChristensen, 152 Wn.2d               at   307.    We review de novo whether collateral estoppel bars an action.\n\n\nCity   of Walla Walla        v. $   401, 333. 44, 150 Wn. App. 360, 365, 208 P. 3d 574 ( 2009).\n\n\n\n\n1Â° BG Plaza LLC also argues that its state superior court suit \" is an altogether proper independent\naction that can set aside an order allowing the sale of property as allowed by [ Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure] FRCP 60( d)( 1)\"                 or Appellant' s Reply Br. at 3 -5. BG Plaza LLC,\n                                                       FRCP 60( d)( 3).\nhowever, did not file an FRCP 60( d) motion and, instead, collaterally attacked the sale order in its\nstate superior court action. Thus, this argument fails.\n\n                                                                   10\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n             Here, collateral estoppel bars BG Plaza LLC' s right of first refusal claim because all four\n\nparts of the test have been met. First, the instant case and the bankruptcy case involve the same\n\nissue: BG Plaza LLC'                s    ability to   enforce   its   right   of   first   refusal.     The bankruptcy court' s\n\nNovember 1, 2005 sale order approved the sale of the undeveloped parcel to Maldonado \" free and\n\nclear of     liens    and encumbrances pursuant             to 11 USC Â§        363, including but not limited to the right\n\nof   first   refusal    granted     to Battle Ground Plaza, LLC.\"                  CP   at   178.     The bankruptcy court also\n\ndetermined that BG Plaza LLC' s attempt to exercise its right of first refusal was insufficient\n\n\nbecause the terms of its offer were different from those in the Parcel Agreement. Accordingly, an\n\nissue decided in the earlier bankruptcy proceeding was identical to the issue presented to the\n\nsuperior court.\n\n\n\n             Second, the       bankruptcy        court sale order was a         final judgment         on   the   merits.   See Third\n\n\nNat' l Bank      v.   Fischer (In       re   Fischer), 184 B. R. 293, 301 ( Bankr. M.D. Tenn. 1995) (                 quoting Cedar\n\nIsland Builders, Inc.          v.   S.   County   Sand & Gravel, Inc., 151 B. R. 298, 300 ( D. R.I. 1993));                  see also\n\n\n\n\nIn   re   Sax, 796 F. 2d 994, 996 ( 7th Cir. 1986) (                       holding that bankruptcy sale orders are final\n\ndecisions).\n\n\n             Third, BG Plaza LLC participated in the earlier bankruptcy proceeding regarding the sale\n\norder. BG Plaza LLC received notice of the hearing and the bankruptcy court fully considered BG\n\nPlaza LLC' s attempted exercise of its right of first refusal before approving the sale of the\n\nundeveloped parcel to Maldonado free and clear of BG Plaza LLC' s right of first refusal. See Am.\n\nLinen     Supply Co.      v.   Nursing        Home    Bldg. Corp., 15 Wn. App. 757, 766 -67, 551 P. 2d 1038 ( 1976)\n\n holding that collateral estoppel is proper if \"the party against whom the estoppel is claimed has\n\nhad the opportunity to fairly and fully present that party' s case \").\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      11\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n\n             Finally, application of collateral estoppel here does not work an injustice on BG Plaza LLC\n\nbecause it had         a   full   and    fair   hearing     on   the   right of   first   refusal   issue. \" The determination of\n\n\nwhether application of collateral estoppel will work an injustice on the party against whom the\n\ndoctrine is        asserted â€”the        fourth   elementâ€”        depends primarily on `whether the parties to the earlier\n\nproceeding         received a     full   and    fair   hearing on the     issue in   question. \"'     Clark v. Baines, 150 Wn.2d\n\n\n905, 913, 84 P. 3d 245 ( 2004) (                 quoting Thompson v. Dep' t of Licensing, 138 Wn.2d 783, 795 -96,\n\n982 P. 2d 601 ( 1999)).            BG Plaza LLC received notice of the hearing and filed an objection to the\n\napproval of the sale of the undeveloped parcel to Maldonado. Despite BG Plaza LLC' s objection\n\nand attempted exercise of its right of first refusal, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the\n\nundeveloped parcel to Maldonado free and clear of BG Plaza LLC' s right of first refusal after a\n\n\nhearing       on    the issue.     The bankruptcy court also determined that BG Plaza LLC' s attempted\n\nexercise of its right of first refusal failed to mirror the Parcel Agreement and was improperly\n\nexercised. Thus, applying collateral estoppel does not work an injustice on BG Plaza LLC.\n\n             Further,   a   bankruptcy          sale order under        11 U. S. C. Â§     363 for property sold free and clear of\n\nall liens \" is shielded from collateral attack not by res judicata, but by virtue of the nature of rights\n\ntransferred        under    11 U. S. C. Â§ 363.\"           Regions Bank v. J. Oil Co., LLC, 387 F. 3d 721, 732 ( 8th\n                                                                           R.\n\nCir. 2004).          Once the bankruptcy court has approved the sale, the sale order is not subject to\n\ncollateral attack          because the      approval of a sale under Â§            363 is an in rem proceeding that is good as\n\nagainst      the   world, not     just those       who were actual parties            to the   proceedings.

Pipin, 861 F. 2d 1012, 1017 ( 7th Cir. 1988)). \" A collateral attack is\n\n\nan   attempt       to impeach      a   judgment in        an action other      than that     in   which   it   was rendered.\"   Cassell\n\n\nv.   Portelance, 172 Wn.               App.     156, 165, 294 P. 3d 1 ( 2012) (            citing Batey v. Batey, 35 Wn.2d 791,\n\n798, 215 P. 2d 694 ( 1950)).                The    relief   BG Plaza LLC is seeking â€”now                  only damages because, at\n\n\n                                                                         12\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\noral argument        before   our court,    it   abandoned    its   claim   for    specific performance â€”would      have the\n\n\neffect of impeaching the bankruptcy court' s November 1, 2005 sale order.\n\n           Other than appealing the sale order, the appropriate method to attack a court- approved sale\n\nis   by   a motion   to   vacate   the   sale under     FRCP 60( b).

The finality of bankruptcy court\n\norders following the conclusion of direct review would ordinarily prevent a party from challenging\n\nthe orders' enforceability; however, FRCP 60( b) provides an exception to finality and allows a\n\nparty to seek relief from a final judgment under a limited set of circumstances, including newly\ndiscovered     evidence or         fraud.   FRCP 60( b)( 2) -( 3);       United Student Aid Funds, 559 U. S. 269 -70;\n\n\nsee also     Valley   Nat' l Bank of Ariz.        v.   Needler, 922 F. 2d 1438, 1442 ( 9th Cir. 1991) ( affirming an\n\n\norder imposing FRCP 11 sanctions against a debtor' s counsel because debtor' s counsel collaterally\n\nattacked a sale order and did not seek \" any review, reconsideration, or stay of the bankruptcy\n\ncourt' s order \").\n\n\n\n            We hold that BG Plaza LLC is collaterally estopped from seeking to enforce its right of\n\nfirst refusal and may not now collaterally attack the sale order in state court. We affirm the superior\n\ncourt' s grant of summary judgment on the right of first refusal issue.\n\nII.         SENIORITY CLAIM\n\n\n            BG Plaza LLC requested a finding from the superior court that its rights to the BG Plaza\n\n                            the Reciprocal Easement Agreement                      are senior   to Maldonado'   s rights.   The\nProperty      and under\n\n\n\n\nsuperior court concluded this claim was not ripe for review and denied summary judgment for BG\n\nPlaza LLC. On appeal, BG Plaza LLC argues its seniority claim is ripe and that the superior court\n\nshould      have found its     rights    to be    senior   to Maldonado'      s.    We disagree. Because the sale of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    13\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n\nBG Plaza Property has not yet closed, any dispute regarding who has seniority rights has not yet\n\ncome to fruition. BG Plaza LLC' s seniority claim is not a justiciable controversy.\n\n         Before a court may rule by declaratory judgment, a justiciable controversy must exist.\n\nWalker     v.   Munro, 124 Wn.2d 402, 411, 879 P. 2d 920 ( 1994).                    For declaratory judgment purposes,\n\na justiciable controversy is:\n\n            1) ...       an actual, present and existing dispute, or the mature seeds of one, as\n         distinguished          from      a    possible,    dormant,       hypothetical,    speculative,        or    moot\n\n         disagreement, (2) between               parties   having   genuine and     opposing interests, ( 3) which\n         involves         interests that        must    be direct      and   substantial,   rather than potential,\n         theoretical, abstract or academic, and ( 4) a judicial determination of which will be\n         final and conclusive.\n\n\nWalker, 124 Wn.2d at 411 ( quoting Nollette v. Christianson, 115 Wn.2d 594, 599, 800 P.2d 359\n\n 1990)).        In other words, a claim is ripe for judicial determination if the issues raised are primarily\n\nlegal   and      do   not require     further factual development,            and   the   challenged action          is final.   First\n\n\nCovenant Church of Seattle              v.\n                                              City ofSeattle,   114 Wn.2d 392, 400, 787 P. 2d 1352 ( 1990),                 adhered\n\n\n\n\nto   on remand,        120 Wn.2d 203, 840 P. 2d 174 ( 1992). \" Absent these elements, the court `steps into\n\n\nthe   prohibited area of            advisory    opinions. \"'    Walker, 124 Wn.2d at 411 -12 ( quoting Diversified\n\nIndus. Dev. Corp. v. Ripley, 82 Wn.2d 811, 815, 514 P. 2d 137 ( 1973)).\n\n           In this      case   there is   no    actual, present,    or    existing dispute.     The sale of the BG Plaza\n\n\nProperty has          not yet closed and       may     never close.\"      If the sale does not close, then BG Plaza LLC\n\nwould have no ownership rights in the BG Plaza Property or the Reciprocal Easement Agreement,\n\nand thus would have no rights that could be senior to Maldonado' s rights. Where the transaction\n\n\n\n\n11 Throughout the trial proceedings between Ray, Jessen, and BG Plaza LLC regarding the sale of\nthe BG Plaza Property, BG Plaza LLC maintained that it had no obligation to close and that it may\nnever    close.         Instead, BG Plaza LLC stated it would wait until after the property had been\nremediated           to decide. â€¢   Additionally, BG Plaza LLC may be unable to close due to its insolvency\nand   because it \" owns         no   tangible property and       its     obligations exceed    its   assets.\"   CP at 1751 -52.\n\n                                                                    14\n\f43874 -7 -II\n\n\n\n\nat issue has not yet occurred or remains a matter of speculation, no justiciable controversy exists.\n\nDiversified Indus. Dev.              Corp.,   82 Wn.2d at 815.\n\n\n           Because BG Plaza LLC does not have an ownership interest in the BG Plaza Property and\n\nwill not until the closing of the sale, its claim of seniority is merely possible, hypothetical, or\n\nspeculative. Accordingly, BG Plaza LLC' s seniority claim is not ripe because it does not present\n\nan     actual,   present,     and     existing dispute.             We affirm the superior court' s denial of summary\n\njudgment for BG Plaza LLC on its seniority claim.\n\nIII.       ATTORNEY FEES CLAIM\n\n\n           BG Plaza LLC argues the superior court erred by awarding Ray and Jessen attorney fees\n\nand    failing    to   award    it   an offset.   We hold the superior court' s award of attorney fees and costs\n\nwas not an abuse of discretion. We also hold the superior court did not abuse its discretion by not\n\nawarding BG Plaza LLC an offset of attorney fees for prevailing on the jurisdiction issue in the\nNinth Circuit.\n\n\n           We apply       a   two -\n                                  part    standard of review            to   a superior court' s award of   attorney fees: \"(   1)\n\n\n W] e    review    de   novo whether          there   is   a   legal basis for awarding attorney fees ...    and ( 2) we review\n\n\na    discretionary      decision to       award . .            attorney fees and the reasonableness of any attorney fee\n\naward     for    abuse of     discretion.\"      Gander v. Yeager, 167 Wn. App. 638, 647, 282 P. 3d 1100 ( 2012).\n\nThe superior court has broad discretion when determining the reasonableness of an attorney fee\n\naward. Hall v. Feigenbaum, 178 Wn.

We will overturn the superior court' s award only if the superior court' s decision is\n\nmanifestly unreasonable or based on untenable grounds. Hall, 178 Wn. App. at 827.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        15\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n          A.      ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS\n\n\n          A superior court may award attorney fees if authorized by a contract, statute, or rule.\n\nGander, 167 Wn.         App.   at   645.    Here, the BG Plaza Agreement authorizes attorney fees and costs\n\nfor the prevailing party for any litigation arising out of the BG Plaza Agreement. Ray and Jessen\n\nwere the prevailing parties on the right of first refusal claim, which arose from the BG Plaza\n\nAgreement.      Thus, Ray and Jessen, as the prevailing parties, are entitled to attorney fees on the\n\nright of first refusal claim and for attorney fees and costs in presenting their claim for attorney\n\nfees.\n\n\n          Next, we review whether the superior court' s fee award is manifestly unreasonable or based\n\non untenable     grounds.      As a general rule, Washington courts calculate reasonable attorney fees\n\nbased   on   the lodestar   method.         Clausen    v.   Icicle Seafoods, Inc., 174 Wn.2d 70, 81, 272 P. 3d 827\n\n\n 2012).      Under this method, the court evaluates whether counsel spent a reasonable number of\n\n\nhours â€”excluding         any wasteful or duplicative hours and any hours pertaining to unsuccessful\n\nclaims â€”and whether counsel                billed   at a reasonable rate.       Smith   v.   Behr Process   Corp.,   113 Wn.\n\n\nApp.    306, 341, 54 P. 3d 665 ( 2002) ( citing Bowers                v.   Transamerica Title Ins. Co., 100 Wn.2d 581,\n\n\n597, 675 P. 2d 193 ( 1983)).               Where an attorney fee award \" is authorized for only some of the\n\nclaims, the attorney fees award must properly reflect a segregation of the time spent on issues for\nwhich     attorney fees    are authorized       from time      spent on other     issues.\"     Hume v. Am. Disposal Co.,\n\n\n124 Wn. 2d 656, 672, 880 P. 2d 988 ( 1994).

App. 180, 187, 773 P. 2d 114 ( 1989)).\n\n         BG Plaza LLC makes several arguments regarding the superior court' s attorney fee award.\n\nBG Plaza LLC claims the superior court erred by ( 1) awarding more fees than were claimed, 12 ( 2)\n\nawarding fees for time         spent on   the seniority   claim and    companion    case, (   3) awarding fees for time\n\nspent   in   bankruptcy proceedings, ( 4)         awarding fees   on   duplicative time, ( 5)   awarding fees for time\n\nspent after it decided the summary judgment motions, and ( 6) awarding costs that are considered\n\nnormal office overhead.\n\n\n\n\n          Ray and Jessen submitted detailed time sheets of their attorney fees and costs, which\n\nsegregated out any charges not related to the right of first refusal claim or its claim for attorney\n\nfees.    Upon review of these times sheets and the parties arguments regarding attorney fees, the\n\nsuperior court disallowed fees for services unrelated to the right of first refusal claim or attorney\n\nfee   request.       See CP   at   1844 ( \" The   Court will not and did not award fees and costs relating to\n\nunsuccessful claims, and it has for that reason required that Sellers segregate time attributable to\n\nPlaintiffs seniority      claim. \").     With the exception of disallowing one attorney' s time spent on the\n\nsummary judgment motion, the superior court found that the time Ray' s and Jessen' s attorneys\n\nclaimed they spent was not duplicative and that \"it is reasonable that attorneys of different abilities,\n\noften with one attorney supervising another, will act on behalf of the client and each will bill the\nclient   accordingly.\"        CP at 1837.\n\n\n\n\n 12 On remand for entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law for the attorney fees award, .the\n superior court corrected this error and thus, we do not address this argument.\n\n                                                             17\n\f43874- 741\n\n\n\n\n           Also, except as specifically disallowed, the superior court determined that the amount of\n\ntime Ray' s and Jessen' s attorneys spent to accomplish their tasks was reasonable \" in light of the\n\namount at stake, the somewhat complex issues presented, and the need to address ( often in depth)\n\neach of    the      issues   raised   by   Plaintiff' s   attorneys.\"   CP    at   1838.   The superior court reasonably\n\nallowed fees for time spent in bankruptcy court on the right of first refusal issues because the\n\n amount requested include[ d] time spent on activities that would be recoverable if those activities\n\nwere conducted in\" the superior court. CP at 1839. Finally, the superior court found that \" it is an\n\nacceptable and common practice                 to   charge costs   separately from fees â€” i.e., not to include all costs .\n\n\nas overhead ... [        and] that it was a common practice of the Bullivant Houser Bailey law firm .. .\n\nto bills   costs     separately from fees.\"         CP at 1837. We hold the superior court' s findings and award\n\n\nof attorney fees and costs in the amount of $82, 803. 67 were not manifestly unreasonable or based\n\non untenable grounds.            We affirm the superior court' s attorney fee award.\n\n           B.          OFFSET\n\n\n           BG Plaza LLC argues it was entitled to an offset of attorney fees for prevailing on the\n\njurisdiction issue in the Ninth Circuit. We disagree.\n\n           In   a    contract   dispute      where \" several       distinct   and   severable   claims\"   are at issue, the\n\n\nproportionality appropriate is more appropriate. Marassi v. Lau, 71 Wn. App. 912, 917, 859 P. 2d\n605 ( 1993),        abrogated on other grounds by Wachovia SBA Lending, Inc. v. Kraft, 165 Wn.2d 481,\n\n200 P. 3d 683 ( 2009).          In the proportionality approach, the plaintiff is awarded attorney fees for the\n\nclaims it prevails upon and likewise the defendant for the claims it prevails upon and then the\n\nawards are offset. Marassi, 71 Wn. App. at 918.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                   18\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n\n          A prevailing party is one who receives an affirmative judgment in its favor.

O' Neel, 168 Wn.2d 515, 522, 229 P. 3d 723 ( 2010) ( \"` a                    plaintiff prevails when actual relief on\n\n\n\nthe merits of his claim materially alters the legal relationship between the parties by modifying the\n\ndefendant'     s   behavior in      a   way that   directly benefits    the plaintiff \") (       quoting Farrar v. Hobby, 506\n\nU. S. 103, 111 - 12, 113 S. Ct. 566, 121 L. Ed. 2d 494 ( 1992)).                   A \"victory in a preliminary injunction\n\nis not sufficient to make a plaintiff a prevailing party where that plaintiff eventually loses on the\n\nmerits, as the victory is ` ephemeral' and the plaintiff has merely won the battle but lost the war.\"\n\nParmelee, 168 Wn.2d at 523 ( quoting Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, 86, 127 S. Ct. 2188, 167 L. Ed.\n\n2d 1069 ( 2007)).          A defendant who successfully defends may also be a prevailing party. Cornish,\n\n158 Wn.     App.      at   231. \"   If neither wholly prevails, then the determination of who is a prevailing\n\nparty depends upon who is the ,substantially prevailing party, and this question depends upon the\nextent of   the relief       afforded     the   parties.\"   Riss v. Angel, 13.1 Wn.2d 612, 633, 934 P. 2d 669 ( 1997)\n\n\n citing Marassi, 71 Wn. App. at 916).\n\n          Neither party wholly or substantially prevailed in the Ninth Circuit. BG Plaza LLC initially\nfiled its   right of       first refusal   and    seniority   claims    in   state court.    Ray and Jessen had the claims\n\ntransferred to the bankruptcy court. BG Plaza LLC contested the bankruptcy court' s jurisdiction,\n\nbut the bankruptcy court asserted jurisdiction over the right of first refusal claim and declined to\nassert   jurisdiction       over    the seniority     claim   because it     concluded      it   was not ripe.   The bankruptcy\n\ncourt granted summary judgment in Ray' s and Jessen' s favor on the right of first refusal claim,\n\nwhich the bankruptcy appellate panel affirmed. The Ninth Circuit held the bankruptcy court and\n\nbankruptcy appellate panel lacked jurisdiction to decide the claims and vacated the judgments.\n\nAlthough BG Plaza LLC successfully argued the jurisdiction issue to the Ninth Circuit, it is not a\n\n\n                                                                   19\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n\nprevailing party because it did not receive an affirmative judgment or relief. BG Plaza LLC did\nnot prevail on the merits of its substantive right of first refusal and seniority claims in the\n\nbankruptcy      court.    It had to relitigate the same claims in state court where it ultimately lost.\n\nAccordingly, we hold that the superior court did not abuse its discretion by not awarding an offset.\n\nIV.     ATTORNEY FEES ON APPEAL\n\n\n        Pursuant to the BG Plaza Agreement attorney fees provisions and RAP 18. 1, Ray, Jessen,\n\nand   BG Plaza LLC        request   attorney fees   on appeal.         We may award attorney fees on appeal if\n\n                                                    the               is                   to RAP 18. 1(   a).\"   Malted\n allowed   by   statute, rule, or contract and            request          made pursuant\n\n\n\n\nMousse, Inc.     v.   Steinmetz, 150 Wn.2d 518, 535, 79 P. 3d 1154 ( 2003).                The BG Plaza Agreement\n\n\nprovisions authorize an award of attorney fees and costs to the prevailing party in the event of any\n\nlitigation arising out of the BG Plaza Agreement.\n\n        BG Plaza LLC' s right of first refusal claim arose out of the BG Plaza Agreement.\n\nTherefore, because Ray and Jessen prevail on the right of first refusal claim, we award them\n\nattorney fees on appeal as to that claim. BG Plaza LLC' s seniority claim did not arise out of the\n\nBG Plaza Agreement; thus, no parties are entitled to attorney fees on appeal for the seniority claim.\n\nRay and Jessen also prevailed on their attorney fee claim and are entitled to attorney fees as to\n\ntheir attorney fee arguments on appeal.\n\n         We affirm the superior court' s grant of summary judgment on the right of first refusal claim\n\nbecause the bankruptcy court' s sale order was final, and thus BG Plaza LLC' s claim is precluded\nunder   the doctrine of collateral     estoppel and       as   an   improper   collateral challenge.   We also affirm\n\n\nthe superior court' s denial of summary judgment on the seniority issue because BG Plaza LLC\n\ndoes not have an ownership interest in the BG Plaza Property because the sale of the BG Plaza\n\nProperty has      not    closed.    Thus, BG Plaza LLC' s seniority claim is merely hypothetical and\n\n\n                                                               20\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\nspeculative and does not present an actual, present, and existing dispute that is ripe for review. We\n\nalso affirm the superior court' s award of attorney fees and costs for Ray and Jessen.\n\n        A majority of the panel having determined that this opinion will not be printed in the\n\nWashington Appellate Reports, but will be filed for public record in accordance with RCW 2. 06. 040,\n\nit is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n\n\n\n        a,\n         47\n\n        Hunt, J.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  21\n\f",

Ray and Jessen contracted to sell the\n\nBattle Ground Plaza                     Center ( BG Plaza   Property)   to BG Plaza LLC.           The contract\n                         Shopping\n\nincluded a right of first refusal provision for an adjacent 0. 5 acre undeveloped parcel (undeveloped\n\nparcel).\n\n\n\n\n           First, BG Plaza LLC argues the superior court erred by granting summary judgment for\n\nRay and Jessen because they failed to comply with the right of first refusal provision. BG Plaza\n\nLLC argues Ray and Jessen contracted to sell the undeveloped parcel to Maldonado without\n\n                                 the \" Reciprocal Easement Agreement\" for parking it      entered     into   with\nadvising BG Plaza LLC       of\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\nMaldonado as part of the undeveloped parcel sale. But the bankruptcy court previously approved\n\nthe sale of the   undeveloped parcel   to Maldonado       and   issued    a   final   order on   the sale.   Thus, BG\n\n\nPlaza LLC' s claim is precluded under the doctrine of collateral estoppel and is an improper\n\ncollateral attack. We affirm the superior court' s grant of summary judgment in favor of Ray and\n\nJessen.\n\n\n          Second, BG Plaza LLC argues the superior court erred by denying its motion for summary\n\njudgment on its seniority claim because its rights to the BG Plaza Property are senior to any right\n\nMaldonado      received   in the Reciprocal Easement Agreement.               Because the sale of the BG Plaza\n\n\nProperty has not closed, BG Plaza LLC does not have an ownership interest in the BG Plaza\n\nProperty. Thus, BG Plaza LLC' s seniority claim is merely hypothetical and speculative and does\n\nnot present an actual, present, and existing dispute that is ripe for review. 1 We affirm the superior\n\ncourt' s denial of BG Plaza LLC' s summary judgment motion.\n\n          Last, BG Plaza LLC argues the superior court abused its discretion when awarding Ray\n\n      Jessen attorney fees                                its             for   an offset of      attorney fees.   We\nand                           and costs   and   denying         request\n\n\n\n\ndisagree and affirm the superior court' s award of attorney fees.\n\n          We affirm the trial court' s grant of summary judgment in favor of Ray and Jessen, its denial\n\nof BG Plaza LLC' s summary judgment motion, and its award of attorney fees.\n\n\n\n\n 1 This argument is more appropriately discussed in terms of the respective parties' rights in the BG\nPlaza Property pursuant to the purchase and sale agreements and the Reciprocal Easement\nAgreement. But because this issue is not ripe for review and we do not reach a decision on it, we\naddress it in terms of the parties argued seniority claim.\n\n                                                      2\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n                                                        FACTS\n\n\nI.         BACKGROUND\n\n\n           As of 2000, Ray and Jessen owned the BG Plaza Property and an adjacent undeveloped\n\nparcel in the City of Battle Ground. On August 10, 2000, Ray filed for relief under Chapter 11 of\n\nthe United States Bankruptcy Code.\n\n           In December 2000, Ray and Jessen entered a purchase and sale agreement to sell the BG\n\nPlaza    Property ( BG    Plaza Agreement) to Bruce Feldman, Inc., who later assigned its interest as\n\n\npurchaser      to BG Plaza LLC.      The BG Plaza Agreement granted BG Plaza LLC a right of first\n\nrefusal to purchase the adjacent undeveloped parcel.2\n\n           On June 8, 2001, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the BG Plaza Property to BG\n\nPlaza LLC.       In March 2002, the bankruptcy court approved Ray' s third amended plan. This plan\n\nincluded the sale of both the jointly owned BG Plaza property to BG Plaza LLC and the\n\n\n2\n     Specifically, the right of first refusal states:\n\n           Seller grants to Purchaser a \" Right of First Refusal\" with respect to the land owned\n           by Seller ( consisting of approximately a half acre) that is immediately adjacent to\n           the Property Purchaser is buying from Seller pursuant to this contract. This Right\n           of.First Refusal means that Seller may not sell or become contractually obligated\n           to sell the adjacent parcel without giving written notice to Purchaser of all of the\n           terms and conditions upon which Seller is willing to sell the adjacent property and\n           giving Purchaser the opportunity to buy the adjacent land on those terms.

Under the plan, the undeveloped parcel was to be sold either under the terms\n\nof the right of first refusal or to another third party should BG Plaza LLC not elect to exercise its\n\nright of first refusal.\n\n\n          On May 18, 2005, Ray and Jessen entered a purchase and sale agreement to sell the\n\nundeveloped         parcel (   Parcel Agreement) to Maldonado.                        The Parcel. Agreement included a\n\n\nprovision      that Maldonado'        s \" obligation     to   purchase   the   Property [ was]   conditioned on ...   Review\n\n\n                                                               3\nand acceptance          of the      cross parking agreements. \"                Clerk' s Papers ( CP) at 69 ( emphasis in\n\n\noriginal).     The Parcel Agreement also required Ray and Jessen to deliver to Maldonado within ten\n\ndays   after     the execution      date   a   copy   of a \"[   dross easement for access and parking\" document.\n\nCP   at   70 (   emphasis      in   original).    On May 31, Maldonado signed an addendum to the Parcel\n\nAgreement that referenced the BG Plaza Agreement and BG Plaza LLC' s right of first refusal for\n\nthe undeveloped parcel.\n\n\n          On            27, BG Plaza LLC              received notice      of   the   Parcel Agreement.     BG Plaza LLC\n                  May\n\nneither exercised nor declined to exercise its .right of first refusal, claiming that its right of first\n\nrefusal was not ripe until its purchase of the BG Plaza Property closed. On July 5, the bankruptcy\n\ncourt approved        the   sale of   the   undeveloped parcel          to Maldonado.      BG Plaza LLC never appealed\n\n\nthis order.\n\n\n\n           On October 8, Maldonado, Ray, and Jessen amended the Parcel Agreement, reducing the\n\npurchase price and          extending the closing date.            On October 18, BG Plaza LLC received notice of\n\n\nthe amended Parcel Agreement and, on October 21, gave Ray and Jessen notice of its intent to\n\n exercise its right of first refusal. At the same time it provided a $ 5, 000 promissory note and stated\n\n\n\n\n 3 The cross parking agreement would allow patrons of BG Plaza Property and any establishment\n built on the undeveloped parcel to utilize parking available on both lots.\n                                                                    4\n\f43874 -7 -II\n\n\n\nthat   principal and   interest   would   be   payable   by   December 19.   Shortly thereafter, Ray moved the\n\nbankruptcy court to approve the modified sale of the undeveloped parcel to Maldonado. BG Plaza\n\nLLC objected to the proposed sale and asserted the sale violated the conditions of its right of first\n\nrefusal.    It also requested all cross parking agreements and other documents pertaining to both\n\nproperties from Ray and Jessen. Jessen' s counsel did not respond to BG Plaza LLC' s request.\n\n           On November 1, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of the undeveloped parcel to\n\nMaldonado      with    the   revised sale price.     The bankruptcy court ruled that the sale was \" free and\n\nclear of   liens   and encumbrances pursuant          to 11 USC Â§    363, including but not .imited to the right\n                                                                                            l\n\nof first refusal granted to Battle Ground Plaza, LLC, and the deed of trust granted to Battle Ground\n\nPlaza, LLC,    by Irwin P.     Jessen in favor   of   Battle Ground Plaza, LLC.\"    CP at 178. The bankruptcy\n\ncourt found that BG Plaza LLC' s attempted exercise of its right of first refusal failed to mirror the\n\nParcel Agreement.            Subsequently, the bankruptcy court denied BG Plaza LLC' s motion for\n\nreconsideration. BG Plaza LLC did not appeal the bankruptcy court' s approval of the undeveloped\n\nparcel sale to Maldonado or the order denying its motion for reconsideration.\n\n           In November 2005, the undeveloped parcel sale closed; shortly thereafter Ray, Jessen, and\n\nMaldonado          executed    and   recorded    a    Reciprocal   Easement Agreement.        The   sale   of the\n\n\nundeveloped parcel enabled Ray to pay the remaining creditors' claims under the terms of his\n\nchapter 11 plan and, on December 29, the bankruptcy court entered a final decree closing Ray' s\n\nbankruptcy case.\n\nII.        PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n\n           In June 2006, BG Plaza LLC first learned of Ray, Jessen, and Maldonado' s Reciprocal\n\nEasement Agreement. On July 5, BG Plaza LLC commenced a lawsuit in Clark County Superior\n\n Court     against    Ray,    Jessen,   Maldonado,       and Maldonado' s successor entities for specific\n\n\n\n                                                               5\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n\nperformance,4 damages, and declaratory relief, arguing that Ray and Jessen had failed to comply\n\nwith the terms of BG Plaza LLC' s right of first refusal because they did not advise BG Plaza LLC\n\nof their intent to execute the Reciprocal Easement Agreement.\n\n\n          Maldonado, joined by Ray and Jessen, moved to dismiss the lawsuit on the basis that the\n\nsuperior court        lacked    subject matter      jurisdiction.      The superior court remanded the case to the\n\n\nUnited States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Washington for a determination of\n\nwhether      it had   retained   jurisdiction.      In January 2007, on Ray and Jessen' s motion and over BG\n\nPlaza LLC'      s objection,     the   bankruptcy      court reopened            Ray' s bankruptcy          case.      On August 29,\n\n\n2007, the bankruptcy court entered an order retaining jurisdiction over BG Plaza LLC' s claim for\n\nspecific performance and concerning the respective parties' rights under the Reciprocal Easement\n\nAgreement.5\n\n           The Estate of Jessen6 filed a motion for summary judgment in the bankruptcy court and\n\nargued that there were no material issues of fact about whether Ray and Jessen had failed to provide\n\nBG Plaza LLC with sufficient notice of all conditions on which they would have sold the\n\nundeveloped parcel         to Maldonado.            The bankruptcy court granted Jessen' s motion for summary\n\njudgment; ruled that its previous orders approving the sale were final and not subject to collateral\n\n\n\n4 At oral argument, BG Plaza LLC abandoned its specific performance claim and stated it is now\nseeking ,only damages. Wash. Court of Appeals oral argument, Battle Ground Plaza, LLC v.\nMaldonado, No. 43874 -7 -II (Apr. 1, 2014),                at   6   min.,   20   sec. -   7   min.,   15   sec. (   on file with court).\n\n5\n    The   bankruptcy     court' s order stated: \"[     T] his Court shall retain jurisdiction to hear and decide the\nclaim for      specific performance made              by [ BG       Plaza LLC],       and the US Bankruptcy Court shall\nreserve    jurisdiction    at   this time    over   the claim   made    by [ BG Plaza LLC], concerning the rights of\nthe   respective parties under         the   reciprocal easement        agreement.\"  CP at 405.\n\n\n6\n    Jessen   passed     away in September 2006.             Eugene Anderson and William Macrae -Smith were\nappointed as co- personal representatives of his estate and were substituted for Jessen on November\n9, 2006.\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n\nattack by BG Plaza LLC in state court; and, ruled that, in any event, Ray and Jessen had complied\n\nwith   the terms   of   the   right of   first   refusal.   BG Plaza LLC appealed to the Bankruptcy Appellate\n\nPanel of the Ninth Circuit, which affirmed the bankruptcy court' s decision. BG Plaza LLC then\n\nappealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit held the\n\nbankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction over the state breach of contract claims, reversed the\n\nbankruptcy appellate panel, and remanded with instructions to vacate the bankruptcy court' s\n\njudgment for lack of jurisdiction.?\n\n\n          Before the Ninth Circuit issued its opinion, BG Plaza LLC filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment in Clark        County     Superior Court          on   its seniority   claim.   Ray, Jessen, and Maldonado\n\nasserted that the bankruptcy court still retained jurisdiction over this claim. The bankruptcy court,\n\nhowever, stated that it would not decide the jurisdictional issue on the seniority claim because it\n\nwas not ripe.\n\n\n\n\n          Following remand to the state superior court, BG Plaza LLC moved for summary judgment\nand argued that the Reciprocal Easement Agreement was junior to BG Plaza LLC' s interest in the\n\nBG Plaza Property. Ray and Jessen also moved for summary judgment and argued that BG Plaza\n\nLLC'   s claims were      barred    by    the    bankruptcy      court' s sale order.     The superior court denied BG\n\n\nPlaza LLC' s motion, ruling that BG Plaza LLC' s seniority claim was not ripe because the sale of\n\nthe BG Plaza       Property     to BG Plaza LLC had              not closed.     The superior court granted Ray and\n\nJessen'   s   motion     for    summary judgment,             concluding that BG Plaza LLC' s claims were\n\nextinguished by the bankruptcy court' s November 1, 2005 sale order.\n\n\n\n\n7 The Ninth Circuit stated that the \" Clark County Court was perfectly capable of taking jurisdiction\nand assessing whether BG Plaza [ LLC' s] claim is precluded given that the sale had already been\nfinalized     and approved      in the   previous     bankruptcy      proceeding.\"      CP at 263.\n\n                                                                  7\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\nIII.        ATTORNEY FEES\n\n\n            After the superior court' s summary judgment rulings, Ray and Jessen filed a motion for\n\nattorney fees and costs in the amount of $229, 648. 67 pursuant to two prevailing party attorney fee\n\nprovisions in the BG Plaza Agreement. 8 The superior court denied this motion and stated ( 1) it\n\nwould not award         fees   under   CR 11   and   RCW 4.84. 185; (      2) it would consider only those fees from\n\nthe bankruptcy court proceedings \" that can be allocated to the support of the Court' s order for\n\nsummary judgment\"              and that \" there is going to have to be a tie -in of how those bankruptcy\n\nproceeding         matters related   to the Court'   s ultimate   entry ...    of the order for summary judgment \";\n\n 3) it would not award any attorney fees related to BG Plaza LLC' s seniority claim; and ( 4) the\n\nfees requested must be reasonable considering the multiple attorneys and paralegals that\n\nparticipated. Report of Proceedings ( RP) at 5.\n\n\n            In response to the superior court' s oral ruling, Ray and Jessen submitted an amended\n\nmotion       for attorney fees       and costs   in the   amount    of $ 100,    114. 77.    This fee request included\n\n\n  12, 463. 00 for the      services of   Michael Higgins,         who   had   initially   represented   Ray; $ 990. 00 for\n\nthe services of Timothy Dack, who had initially represented Jessen; and $ 86, 661. 77 for the services\n\nof Bullivant Houser Bailey, who represented both Ray and Jessen.\n\n\n\n\n8 BG Plaza Agreement provision 10 states:\n\n            In the event suit or action is instituted by Seller, Purchaser, Purchaser' s Agent or\n            Seller' s Agent to enforce or declare the meaning of any of the terms of this contract,\n            the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover such sum as the court may adjudge\n            reasonable as attorney fees at trial and on any appeal of any such suit or action, in\n            addition to all other sums provided by law.\n\nCP     at   107.    And BG Plaza Agreement           provision      Anything to the contrary herein\n                                                                  29( C)   states: \"\n\n\nnotwithstanding, in the event of any litigation arising out of this contract, the court may award to\nthe prevailing party all reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees.\" CP at 116.\n\n\n                                                              8\n\f43874 - -II\n       7\n\n\n\n\n             The superior court granted Ray and Jessen' s amended motion for attorney fees in a letter\n\nruling without providing any findings of fact or conclusions of law and without providing any\n\nexplanation       for its ruling.    It   awarded $   3, 170. 00 for Michael Higgins'   s   services, $ 137. 50 for\n\n\nTimothy       Dack'   s services, and $   90, 250. 00 ($ 3, 588. 23 more than requested) for Bullivant Houser\n\n\nBailey' s     services.   BG Plaza LLC appeals the superior court' s dismissal of its lawsuit and award\n\n\nof attorney fees to Ray and Jessen.9\n\n             During the pendency ofthis appeal, and because the superior court had not entered findings\n\nof fact and conclusions of law on its attorney fee award, we remanded the case for entry of findings\n\nof    fact   and conclusions of     law. On remand, the superior court entered findings and conclusions\n\n\nand also corrected an error in its initial fee award and instead awarded a, total of $82, 803. 67 in\n\nattorney fees and costs to Ray and Jessen. BG Plaza LLC timely appeals.\n\n                                                      ANALYSIS\n\n\nI.           RIGHT OF FIRST REFUSAL CLAIM\n\n\n             The superior court concluded BG Plaza LLC' s claim seeking to enforce its right of first\n\nrefusal by specific performance or for an award of damages was \" extinguished\" by the bankruptcy\ncourt' s     November 1, 2005        sale order pursuant    to </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.

Upon review of these times sheets and the parties arguments regarding attorney fees, the\n\nsuperior court disallowed fees for services unrelated to the right of first refusal claim or attorney\n\nfee   request.       See CP   at   1844 ( \" The   Court will not and did not award fees and costs relating to\n\nunsuccessful claims, and it has for that reason required that Sellers segregate time attributable to\n\nPlaintiffs seniority      claim. \").     With the exception of disallowing one attorney' s time spent on the\n\nsummary judgment motion, the superior court found that the time Ray' s and Jessen' s attorneys\n\nclaimed they spent was not duplicative and that \"it is reasonable that attorneys of different abilities,\n\noften with one attorney supervising another, will act on behalf of the client and each will bill the\nclient   accordingly.\"        CP at 1837.\n\n\n\n\n 12 On remand for entry of findings of fact and conclusions of law for the attorney fees award, .the\n superior court corrected this error and thus, we do not address this argument.\n\n                                                             17\n\f43874- 741\n\n\n\n\n           Also, except as specifically disallowed, the superior court determined that the amount of\n\ntime Ray' s and Jessen' s attorneys spent to accomplish their tasks was reasonable \" in light of the\n\namount at stake, the somewhat complex issues presented, and the need to address ( often in depth)\n\neach of    the      issues   raised   by   Plaintiff' s   attorneys.\"   CP    at   1838.   The superior court reasonably\n\nallowed fees for time spent in bankruptcy court on the right of first refusal issues because the\n\n amount requested include[ d] time spent on activities that would be recoverable if those activities\n\nwere conducted in\" the superior court. CP at 1839. Finally, the superior court found that \" it is an\n\nacceptable and common practice                 to   charge costs   separately from fees â€” i.e., not to include all costs .\n\n\nas overhead ... [        and] that it was a common practice of the Bullivant Houser Bailey law firm .. .\n\nto bills   costs     separately from fees.\"         CP at 1837. We hold the superior court' s findings and award\n\n\nof attorney fees and costs in the amount of $82, 803. 67 were not manifestly unreasonable or based\n\non untenable grounds.            We affirm the superior court' s attorney fee award.\n\n           B.

We disagree.\n\n           In   a    contract   dispute      where \" several       distinct   and   severable   claims\"   are at issue, the\n\n\nproportionality appropriate is more appropriate.

BG Plaza LLC initially\nfiled its   right of       first refusal   and    seniority   claims    in   state court.    Ray and Jessen had the claims\n\ntransferred to the bankruptcy court. BG Plaza LLC contested the bankruptcy court' s jurisdiction,\n\nbut the bankruptcy court asserted jurisdiction over the right of first refusal claim and declined to\nassert   jurisdiction       over    the seniority     claim   because it     concluded      it   was not ripe.   The bankruptcy\n\ncourt granted summary judgment in Ray' s and Jessen' s favor on the right of first refusal claim,\n\nwhich the bankruptcy appellate panel affirmed. The Ninth Circuit held the bankruptcy court and\n\nbankruptcy appellate panel lacked jurisdiction to decide the claims and vacated the judgments.\n\nAlthough BG Plaza LLC successfully argued the jurisdiction issue to the Ninth Circuit, it is not a\n\n\n                                                                   19\n\f43874- 7- 11\n\n\n\n\nprevailing party because it did not receive an affirmative judgment or relief.
