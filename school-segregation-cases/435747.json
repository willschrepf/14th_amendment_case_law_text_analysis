(“AMAA”),\nand implemented by the Marketing Order Regulating the Han-\n\f9458                        HORNE v. USDA\ndling of Raisins Produced from Grapes Grown in California,\n7 C.F.R. Part 989 (“Raisin Marketing Order” or “the Order”),\nfirst adopted in 1949. Farmers Marvin and Laura Horne (“the\nHornes”1) protest the USDA Judicial Officer’s (“JO”) imposi-\ntion of civil penalties and assessments for their failure to com-\nply with the reserve requirements, among other regulatory\ninfractions, contending: (1) they are producers not subject to\nthe Raisin Marketing Order’s provisions; (2) even if subject\nto those provisions, the requirement that they contribute a\nspecified percentage of their annual raisin crop to the\ngovernment-controlled reserve pool constitutes an uncompen-\nsated per se taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment; and\n(3) the penalties imposed for their “self-help” noncompliance\nwith the Raisin Marketing Order violate the Eighth Amend-\nment Excessive Fines Clause. We affirm.\n\n                          BACKGROUND\n\n      I.   Regulatory Framework\n\n   Raisins and other agricultural commodities are heavily reg-\nulated under federal marketing orders adopted pursuant to the\nAMAA, a Depression-era statute enacted in response to plum-\nmeting commodity prices, market disequilibrium, and the\naccompanying threat to the nation’s credit system. 7 U.S.C.\n§ 601 et seq.; see Zuber v. Allen, 396 U.S. 168, 174-76\n(1969); see generally Daniel Bensing, “The Promulgation and\nImplementation of Federal Marketing Orders Regulating Fruit\nand Vegetable Crops Under the Agricultural Marketing\nAgreement Act of 1937,” 5 San Joaquin Agric. L. Rev. 3\n(1995). The declared purposes of the AMAA are, inter alia,\n  1\n    Collectively referred to as “the Hornes,” the Plaintiffs-Appellants are\nMarvin and Laura Horne, d/b/a Raisin Valley Farms (a California general\npartnership), and d/b/a Raisin Valley Farms Marketing Association (a Cal-\nifornia unincorporated association), together with their business partners\nDon Durbahn and the Estate of Rena Durbahn, collectively d/b/a Lassen\nVineyards (a California general partnership).\n\f                            HORNE v. USDA                              9459\nto help farmers achieve and maintain price parity for their\nagricultural goods and to protect producers and consumers\nalike from “unreasonable fluctuations in supplies and prices”\nby establishing orderly marketing conditions. 7 U.S.C. § 602;\nsee Fla. Lime & Avocado Growers, Inc. v. Paul, 373 U.S.\n132, 138 (1963); Pescosolido v. Block, 765 F.2d 827, 830 (9th\nCir. 1985).\n\n   [1] To achieve these goals, the AMAA delegates authority\nto the Secretary of Agriculture (“Secretary”) to issue market-\ning orders2 regulating the sale and delivery of agricultural\ngoods, 7 U.S.C. § 608c, principally by imposing production\nquotas or by restricting the supply of a commodity for sale on\nthe open market, either through marketing allotments or\nreserve pools, see id. § 608c(6).3 The Secretary, in turn, is\nauthorized to delegate to industry committees the power to\nadminister marketing orders. 7 U.S.C. § 608c(7)(C); see 7\nC.F.R. § 989.35 (2006). Marketing orders under the AMAA\n   2\n     According to the specific promulgation procedures mandated by the\nAMAA, the Secretary may only issue a marketing order if, after providing\nnotice and opportunity for hearing, he finds that “the issuance of such\norder . . . will tend to effectuate the declared policy” of the Act. 7 U.S.C.\n§ 608c(3)-(4). Such order will not become effective until approved by both\n(1) the handlers of at least 50 percent of the volume of the commodity\ncovered by the proposed order and (2) either (a) two-thirds of producers\nof that commodity during a representative period or (b) producers of two-\nthirds of the volume of that commodity during said period. Id. § 608c(8);\nsee id. § 608b. The Secretary may terminate or suspend any marketing\norder upon finding it “obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared\npolicy” of the Act, or upon request of a majority of active producers dur-\ning a representative time period. Id. § 608c(16).\n   3\n     Section 8c of the AMAA, 7 U.S.C. § 608c, the key statutory provision\ndealing with the marketing orders, originated in a 1935 amendment to the\nAgricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, Pub. L. No. 73-10, 48 Stat. 31\n(“AAA”). The Supreme Court invalidated parts of the AAA in 1936, see\nUnited States v. Butler, 297 U.S. 1, 77 (1936), but Congress quickly reen-\nacted most of the AAA’s production-control measures in the AMAA,\nwhich the Supreme Court subsequently upheld against various constitu-\ntional challenges, see United States v. Rock Royal Co-op, Inc., 307 U.S.\n533 (1939).\n\f9460                           HORNE v. USDA\napply only to “handlers,” i.e., those who process and pack\nagricultural goods for distribution,4 and do not apply to any\nproducer “in his capacity as a producer.”5 7 U.S.C.\n§§ 608c(1), 608c(13)(B).6 Any handler who fails to comply\nwith the terms of a marketing order is subject to civil forfei-\nture, as well as possible civil and criminal penalties. 7 U.S.C.\n§§ 608a(5), 608a(6), 608c(14) (authorizing civil penalties up\nto $1,000 for each violation, with each day constituting a sep-\narate violation).\n  4\n   A “handler” under the Raisin Marketing Order is\n      (a) [a]ny processor or packer; (b) any person who places, ships,\n      or continues natural raisins in the current of commerce from\n      within [California] to any point outside thereof; (c) any person\n      who delivers off-grade raisins, other failing raisins or raisin resid-\n      ual material to other than a packer or other than into any eligible\n      non-normal outlet; or (d) any person who blends raisins [subject\n      to certain exceptions].\n7 C.F.R. § 989.15. A “packer,” in turn, is “any person who, within [Cali-\nfornia], stems, sorts, cleans, or seeds raisins, grades stemmed raisins, or\npackages raisins for market as raisins,” but does not include a producer\nwho sorts and cleans his own raisins in their unstemmed form. Id.\n§ 989.14.\n   5\n     A “producer” under the Raisin Marketing Order is “any person\nengaged in a proprietary capacity in the production of grapes which are\nsun-dried or dehydrated by artificial means until they become raisins.” 7\nC.F.R. § 989.11.\n   6\n     The regulation of handlers, as opposed to growers, appears to be a ves-\ntige of the historical context in which the AMAA was enacted, “an era\nwhen small, independent growers were frequently left to the mercy of\nlarge handlers who could benefit from their market power and position.”\nBensing, supra, at 8. In the raisin industry, producers generally own the\nland on which the grapevines are located, and they typically pick the\ngrapes and dry them on trays before selling the unstemmed raisins to pack-\ners, or “handlers.” Packers then prepare the raisins for commercial sale\nand distribution by cleaning, stemming, seeding, grading, sorting, and\npackaging the raisins into containers. Packers then typically sell the\npacked raisins to wholesalers, distributors, and other dealers for resale and\ndistribution to the public. Brown v. Parker, 39 F. Supp. 895, 896-97 (S.D.\nCal. 1941), rev’d on other grounds by Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341\n(1943).\n\f                             HORNE v. USDA                              9461\n   The Raisin Marketing Order was originally enacted in\n1949, see 14 Fed. Reg. 5136 (Aug. 18, 1949) (codified, as\namended, at 7 C.F.R. Part 989), in an effort to stabilize raisin\nprices by controlling production surpluses, which since 1920\nhad consistently been thirty to fifty percent of each year’s\ncrop. See Parker, 317 U.S. at 363-64.7 Like many other fruit\nand vegetable orders issued under the AMAA,8 the Order pro-\nvides for the establishment of annual reserve pools, as deter-\nmined by each year’s crop yield, thereby removing surplus\nraisins from sale on the open domestic market and indirectly\ncontrolling prices. See 7 U.S.C. § 608c(6)(E); 7 C.F.R.\n§§ 989.54(d), 989.65. By February 15 of each year, the Raisin\nAdministrative Committee (“RAC”)—an industry committee\ncharged with administration of the Raisin Marketing Order,9\n  7\n     The raisin industry has long been an important one in California, where\n99.5 percent of the U.S. crop and 40 percent of the world’s crop are pro-\nduced. See The California Raisin Industry, http://www.calraisins.org/\nabout/the-raisin-industry/ (last visited July 6, 2011). Raisin prices rose\nrapidly between 1914 and 1920, peaking in 1921 at $235 per ton. This\nprice increase spurred increased production, which in turn caused prices\nto plummet back down to between $40 and $60 per ton, even while pro-\nduction continued to expand. As a result of this growing disparity between\nincreasing production and decreasing prices, the industry became “com-\npelled to sell at less than parity prices and in some years at prices regarded\nby students of the industry as less than the cost of production,” finally\nprompting federal government intervention with the Raisin Marketing\nOrder in 1949. See Parker, 317 U.S. at 363-64 & nn.9-10.\n   8\n     For a comparison of the Raisin Marketing Order and marketing orders\nfor other agricultural products, such as walnuts, almonds, prunes, tart cher-\nries, and spearmint, see Evans v. United States, 74 Fed. Cl. 554, 558\n(2006), aff’d, 250 Fed. Appx. 321 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\n   9\n     The RAC is currently comprised of forty-seven industry-nominated\nrepresentatives appointed by the Secretary, of whom thirty-five represent\nproducers, ten represent handlers, one represents the cooperative bargain-\ning association, and one represents the public. See 7 C.F.R. §§ 989.26,\n989.29, 989.30. The RAC is an agent of the federal government but\nreceives no federal appropriations. Instead, it is funded by assessments\nlevied on handlers per ton of raisins sold on the open market and by pro-\nceeds from the sale of reserve-tonnage raisins. See 7 C.F.R. §§ 989.53,\n989.79, 989.80(a), 989.82.\n\f9462                    HORNE v. USDA\nsee 7 C.F.R. §§ 989.35, 989.36—recommends the “reserve-\ntonnage” and “free-tonnage” percentages for that year, which\nthe Secretary then promulgates. See id. §§ 989.54(d), 989.55.\nThe reserve-tonnage requirement varies from year to year; for\nexample, in the 2002-03 and 2003-04 crop years at issue here,\nthe reserve percentages were set at forty-seven percent and\nthirty percent of a producer’s crop, respectively.\n\n   As a result of the Order’s reserve program requirements, a\nproducer receives payment (at a pre-negotiated field market\nprice) upon delivery of raisins to a handler only for the free-\ntonnage raisins, which the handler is then free to sell on the\ndomestic market without restrictions. See id. § 989.65. The\nreserve-tonnage raisins, on the other hand, must be held by\nthe handler in segregated bins “for the account” of the RAC\nuntil the RAC sells them to handlers for resale in export mar-\nkets or directs that they be sold or disposed of in secondary,\nnon-competitive markets, such as school lunch programs,\neither by direct sale or gift to U.S. agencies or foreign govern-\nments. Id. §§ 989.54, 989.56, 989.65, 989.67, 989.166,\n989.167. The reserve pool sales are used to finance the RAC’s\nadministration, and any remaining net proceeds must then be\nequitably distributed to the producers on a pro rata basis. See\n7 U.S.C. § 608c(6)(E) (providing for “the equitable distribu-\ntion of the net return derived from the sale [of reserve-pool\nraisins] among the persons beneficially interested therein”); 7\nC.F.R. § 989.66(h). Thus, although producers do not receive\npayment for reserve-tonnage raisins at the time of delivery to\na handler, they retain a limited equity interest in the net pro-\nceeds of the RAC’s disposition of the reserve, to be paid at\na later time.\n\n  The RAC is tasked with selling the reserve raisins in a\nmanner “intended to maxim[ize] producer returns and achieve\nmaximum disposition of such raisins by the time reserve ton-\nnage raisins from the subsequent crop year are available,” 7\nC.F.R. § 989.67(d)(1), but the Hornes complain that they have\nnot received any reserve sale proceeds since the mid-1990s.\n\f                          HORNE v. USDA                           9463\nFor example the RAC designated forty-seven percent of the\n2002-03 crop as reserve tonnage, which it then sold for $970\nper ton, but none of the money the RAC received was paid\nback to the raisin producers.\n\n   In addition to the reserve pool requirement, the Raisin Mar-\nketing Order obliges handlers to, inter alia: file reports with\nthe RAC, pay assessments to the RAC, and grant the RAC\naccess to records for auditing purposes. See id. §§ 989.58,\n989.59, 989.73, 989.77, 989.80.\n\n  II.   The Hornes’ Raisin Enterprises\n\n   Marvin and Laura Horne have been producing raisins in\nFresno and Madera Counties in California since 1969 and in\n1999 registered as a California general partnership under the\nname Raisin Valley Farms. They also own and operate Lassen\nVineyards, another registered California general partnership,\nin partnership with Laura’s parents, Don and Rena Durbahn.\nDisillusioned with a regulatory scheme they deemed “outdat-\ned” and exploitive of farmers, the Hornes looked for ways to\navoid the Raisin Marketing Order’s requirements, particularly\nits mandatory raisin reserve program. Because those require-\nments apply only to handlers, the Hornes implemented a plan\nto bring their raisins to market without going through a tradi-\ntional middle-man packer. As part of their plan, the Hornes\npurchased their own equipment and facilities to clean, stem,\nsort, and package raisins, which they installed on Lassen\nVineyards property in 2001. Not only did this facility handle\nthe raisins from Raisin Valley Farms and Lassen Vineyards,\nit also contracted with more than sixty other raisin growers to\nclean, stem, sort, and in some cases box and stack their raisins\nfor a per-pound fee, typically twelve cents per pound.10 USDA\nrecords reflect that Lassen Vineyards packed out more than\n  10\n    This type of arrangement is known as “toll packing.” Toll packers do\nnot acquire ownership of the commodity but instead provide a packing\nservice for a fee.\n\f9464                       HORNE v. USDA\n1.2 million pounds of raisins during the 2002-03 crop year\nand more than 1.9 million pounds during the 2003-04 crop\nyear.\n\n   Meanwhile, the Hornes also organized these sixty-some\ngrowers into the Raisin Valley Marketing Association, an\nunincorporated association that marketed and sold raisins to\nwholesale customers on its members’ behalf, while the grow-\ners maintained ownership over their own raisins. Raisin Val-\nley Marketing then held the sales funds on the growers’ behalf\nin a trust account, from which it paid Lassen Vineyards its\npacking fees, paid a third-party broker fee, and distributed the\nnet proceeds to the growers.\n\n  III.   Proceedings Below\n\n   The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service\ninitiated an enforcement action against the Hornes, alleging\nviolations of the AMAA and failure to comply with the Raisin\nMarketing Order’s various requirements. On appeal from an\nAdministrative Law Judge’s decision following an on-the-\nrecord hearing, the USDA JO found both Raisin Valley Farms\nand Lassen Vineyards liable for: (1) twenty violations of 7\nC.F.R. § 989.73 (filing of inaccurate reports); (2) fifty-eight\nviolations of 7 C.F.R. § 989.58(d) (failing to obtain incoming\ninspections); (3) 592 violations of 7 C.F.R. § 989.66 and 7\nC.F.R. § 989.166 (failing to hold reserve raisins for the 2002-\n03 and 2003-04 crop years); (4) two violations of 7 C.F.R.\n§ 989.80 (failing to pay assessments to the RAC); and (5) one\nviolation of 7 C.F.R. § 989.77 (failing to allow the Agricul-\ntural Marketing Service access to records). The JO accord-\ningly ordered the Hornes to pay (1) $8,783.39 in unpaid\nassessments for the 2002-03 and 2003-04 crop years, pursuant\nto 7 C.F.R. § 989.80(a); (2) $483,843.53, the alleged dollar\nequivalent of the withheld raisin reserve contributions for the\n2002-03 (632,427 pounds) and 2003-04 (611,159 pounds11)\n  11\n    The Hornes do not challenge the JO’s calculation of these figures.\n\f                            HORNE v. USDA                              9465\ncrop years, pursuant to 7 C.F.R. § 989.166(c); and (3)\n$202,600 in civil penalties, pursuant to 7 U.S.C.\n§ 608c(14)(B).\n\n   The Hornes filed this action in district court seeking judi-\ncial review of a final agency decision pursuant to 7 U.S.C.\n§ 608c(14)(B).12 On cross-motions for summary judgment, the\ndistrict court granted summary judgment for the USDA, and\nthe Hornes timely appealed.\n\n                   STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n   A district court’s grant of summary judgment is reviewed\nde novo. Ariz. Life Coal., Inc. v. Stanton, 515 F.3d 956, 962\n(9th Cir. 2008). Viewing the evidence in the light most favor-\nable to the non-moving party, we must determine whether any\ngenuine issues of material fact remain and whether the district\ncourt correctly applied the relevant substantive law. Lopez v.\nSmith, 203 F.3d 1122, 1131 (9th Cir. 2000) (en banc). We\nreview de novo a constitutional challenge to a federal regula-\ntion. Doe v. Rumsfeld, 435 F.3d 980, 984 (9th Cir. 2006) (cit-\ning Gonzales v. Metro. Transp. Auth., 174 F.3d 1016, 1018\n(9th Cir. 1999)). We also review de novo whether a fine is\nunconstitutionally excessive. United States v. Mackby, 339\nF.3d 1013, 1016 (9th Cir. 2003) (citing United States v.\nBajakajian, 524 U.S. 321, 337 n.10 (1998)).\n  12\n    In a separate action not the subject of this appeal, the Hornes filed an\nadministrative petition before the Secretary of Agriculture in March 2007\npursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 608c(15)(A) challenging the Raisin Marketing\nOrder and its application to them. The JO granted the USDA’s motion to\ndismiss for lack of standing. The Hornes filed a complaint in district court,\nbut the district court dismissed it for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\nbecause it was not timely filed, and we affirmed. See Horne v. U.S. Dep’t\nof Agric., 395 Fed. Appx. 486 (9th Cir. Sep. 27, 2010) (unpublished).\n\f9466                   HORNE v. USDA\n                       DISCUSSION\n\n  I.   Application of the Raisin Marketing Order to the\n       Hornes\n\n   For the reasons discussed in the district court’s opinion\nbelow, we conclude that the Hornes, who admit that their toll-\npacking business “stems, sorts, cleans,” and “packages raisins\nfor market as raisins,” 7 C.F.R. § 989.14, satisfy the regula-\ntory definition of a “packer” and are thus “handlers” subject\nto the Raisin Marketing Order’s provisions, see 7 C.F.R.\n§ 989.15. See Horne v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 2009 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 115464, at *20-49 (E.D. Cal. Dec. 11, 2009). The\nUSDA’s interpretation of its own regulation is not “plainly\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation” and thus must\nbe given “controlling weight.” See Bowles v. Seminole Rock\n& Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945); accord Auer v. Rob-\nbins, 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997); Miller v. Cal. Speedway\nCorp., 536 F.3d 1020, 1028 (9th Cir. 2008). Furthermore, its\nfindings regarding the Hornes’ handler operations are sup-\nported by substantial evidence and are neither arbitrary nor\ncapricious. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (E).\n\n   [2] The Hornes argue they are statutorily exempt from reg-\nulation because they also satisfy the regulatory definition of\na “producer,” and the AMAA provides that “[n]o order issued\nunder this chapter shall be applicable to any producer in his\ncapacity as a producer.” 7 U.S.C. § 608c(13)(B). However, by\nexpressly limiting the exemption from regulation only to a\nproducer “in his capacity as a producer,” the AMAA contem-\nplates that an individual who performs both producer and han-\ndler functions may still be regulated in his capacity as a\nhandler. Even if the AMAA is considered “silent or ambigu-\nous” on the regulation of individuals who perform both pro-\nducer and handler functions, we must give Chevron deference\nto the permissible interpretation of the Secretary of Agricul-\nture, who is charged with administering the statute. Chevron,\nUSA, Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837,\n\f                        HORNE v. USDA                      9467\n842-43 (1984); see 7 U.S.C. § 608c(1); see also Morales-\nIzquierdo v. Dep’t of Homeland Sec., 600 F.3d 1076, 1086-87\n(9th Cir. 2010); Midway Farms v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., 188\nF.3d 1136, 1140 n.5 (9th Cir. 1999). Other courts have simi-\nlarly rejected the Hornes’ argument that a producer who han-\ndles his own product for market is statutorily exempt from\nregulation under the AMAA. See, e.g., Freeman v. Vance, 319\nF.2d 841, 842 (5th Cir. 1963) (per curiam); Ideal Farms, Inc.\nv. Benson, 288 F.2d 608, 614 (3d Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 372\nU.S. 965 (1963); Evans, 74 Fed. Cl. at 557-58. Deferring to\nthe agency’s permissible interpretation of the statute, as we\nmust, we conclude that applying the Raisin Marketing Order\nto the Hornes in their capacity as handlers was not contrary\nto the AMAA.\n\n  II.   Takings Claim\n\n   Does the Raisin Marketing Order’s reserve requirement\nprogram constitute a physical, per se taking of the Hornes’\npersonal property without just compensation, in violation of\nthe Fifth Amendment? See U.S. Const. amend. V (“[N]or\nshall private property be taken for public use, without just\ncompensation.”). We join the Court of Federal Claims, which\nnot long ago decided this exact question, in holding it does\nnot. See Evans, 74 Fed. Cl. at 562-64; cf. Cal-Almond, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 30 Fed. Cl. 244, 246-47 (1994) (rejecting a tak-\nings claim against a similar reserve program under the almond\nmarketing order).\n\n   The Fifth Amendment Takings Clause does not itself\nauthorize the taking of private property, nor does it prohibit\nthe government from doing so. Instead, it imposes conditions\non the government’s authority to act, providing that when\ngovernment takes private property, pursuant to the lawful\nexercise of its constitutional powers, (1) it must take for pub-\nlic rather than private use, and (2) it must provide owners with\njust compensation, as measured by the property owner’s loss.\nSee Brown v. Legal Found. of Wash., 538 U.S. 216, 231-32,\n\f9468                    HORNE v. USDA\n235-36 (2003); First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of\nGlendale v. Cnty. of L.A., 482 U.S. 304, 314 (1987). The for-\nmer condition ensures that government does not abuse its\npowers by taking private property for another’s private gain,\nsee, e.g., Penn. Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S. 393, 413 (1922);\nthe latter ensures that even when government acts in the pub-\nlic interest, it does not “forc[e] some people alone to bear\npublic burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be\nborne by the public as a whole,” Armstrong v. United States,\n364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960).\n\n   [3] In its earliest days, the Takings Clause was thought to\napply only to “direct appropriation of property, or the func-\ntional equivalent of a practical ouster of the owner’s posses-\nsion,” Lingle v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 544 U.S. 528, 537\n(2005) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted), i.e.,\n“physical takings.” See Lucas v. S.C. Coastal Council, 505\nU.S. 1003, 1028 n.15 (1992). Over the years, its reach has\nextended to accommodate the modern reality that “govern-\nment regulation of private property may, in some instances,\nbe so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropri-\nation or ouster.” Lingle, 544 U.S. at 537; see also Loretto v.\nTeleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 427-38\n(1982) (surveying evolution of the takings doctrine). Most\ntakings challenges to governmental regulations must undergo\nan ad hoc, fact-intensive inquiry focusing on (1) the economic\nimpact of the regulation on the claimant; (2) the extent to\nwhich the regulation interferes with reasonable investment-\nbacked expectations; and (3) the character of the governmen-\ntal action. Penn Cent. Transp. Co. v. N.Y.C., 438 U.S. 104,\n124 (1978). Only in two situations does the Supreme Court\nrecognize that regulatory action per se “goes too far” in frus-\ntrating property rights, Mahon, 260 U.S. at 415: first, “where\ngovernment requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical\ninvasion of her property[,] however minor,” Lingle, 544 U.S.\nat 538; see, e.g., Loretto, 458 U.S. at 438 (compensation\nrequired where state law forced landlords to permit cable\ncompanies to install cable facilities occupying one and one-\n\f                       HORNE v. USDA                      9469\nhalf square feet of rooftops); Kaiser Aetna v. United States,\n444 U.S. 164, 179-80 (1979) (same for imposition of naviga-\ntional servitude upon private marina); United States v.\nCausby, 328 U.S. 256, 265 & n.10 (1946) (same for physical\ninvasions of airspace); and second, where government regula-\ntion “denies all economically beneficial or productive use of\nland,” Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1015 (emphasis added) (compensa-\ntion required where state law barring construction of any per-\nmanent habitable structures on beachfront property rendered\nland parcels “valueless”). When government action results in\nsuch a “total regulatory taking[ ],” id. at 1026, as opposed to\na mere “partial regulatory taking[ ],” Tahoe-Sierra Pres.\nCouncil v. Tahoe Reg’l Planning Agency, 535 U.S. 302, 326\n(2002), a property owner is categorically entitled to compen-\nsation, without resort to the usual case-specific inquiry.\n\n   [4] The Hornes, however, do not claim that the Raisin\nMarketing Order effects a regulatory taking, partial or total.\nInstead, they insist we need look no further than the RAC’s\nannual “direct appropriation” of their reserve-tonnage raisins\nto conclude this is a classic physical taking. Though the sim-\nplicity of their logic has some understandable appeal—their\nraisins are personal property, personal property is protected\nby the Fifth Amendment, and each year the RAC “takes”\nsome of their raisins, at least in the colloquial sense—their\nargument rests on a fundamental misunderstanding of the\nnature of property rights and instead clings to a phrase\ndivorced from context.\n\n   It is undisputed that the Fifth Amendment guarantees com-\npensation for the taking not only of real property but also of\npersonal property and even intangible property. See Phillips\nv. Wash. Legal Found., 524 U.S. 156, 172 (1998) (interest\nearned on lawyers’ trust account is a protected private prop-\nerty); Brown, 538 U.S. at 235 (same); Ruckelshaus v. Mon-\nsanto Co., 467 U.S. 986, 1001-04 (1984) (same for trade\nsecrets). No one suggests the government could come onto the\nHornes’ farm uninvited and walk off with forty-seven percent\n\f9470                     HORNE v. USDA\nof their crops without offering just compensation, even if the\nseizure itself were justified (for example, as a wartime mea-\nsure). See Dolan v. City of Tigard, 512 U.S. 374, 384 (1994);\nNollan v. Cal. Coastal Comm’n, 483 U.S. 825, 831 (1987);\nUnited States v. Pewee Coal Co., 341 U.S. 114, 115-17\n(1951) (government’s wartime seizure and operation of a coal\nmine to prevent a national coal miners’ strike constituted a\ncompensable taking). Certainly, that government action is\nauthorized does not immunize it from a takings claim; indeed,\nthe Takings Clause presupposes that the government has\ntaken lawfully. Lingle, 544 U.S. at 543; see Kaiser Aetna, 444\nU.S. at 172 (no “blanket exception” to the Takings Clause\nsimply because Congress has acted under lawful authority). If\nthe Raisin Marketing Order authorized an uninvited, forcible\ntaking of the Hornes’ crops, there is no question that the gov-\nernment would have “a categorical duty to compensate the\n[Hornes], regardless of whether the interest that is taken con-\nstitutes an entire parcel [i.e., all their crops,] or merely a part\nthereof.” Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.S. at 322 (internal citation\nomitted).\n\n   [5] But a forcible taking is not what the Raisin Marketing\nOrder accomplishes. Far from compelling a physical taking of\nthe Hornes’ tangible property, the Raisin Marketing Order\napplies to the Hornes only insofar as they voluntarily choose\nto send their raisins into the stream of interstate commerce.\nSimply put, it is a use restriction, not a direct appropriation.\nThe Secretary of Agriculture did not authorize a forced sei-\nzure of forty-seven percent of the Hornes’ 2002-03 crops and\nthirty percent of their 2003-04 crops, but rather imposed a\ncondition on the Hornes’ use of their crops by regulating their\nsale. As we explained in a similar context over seventy years\nago, the Raisin Marketing Order “contains no absolute\nrequirement of the delivery of [reserve-tonnage raisins] to the\n[RAC]” but rather only “a conditional one.” Wallace v.\nHudson-Duncan & Co., 98 F.2d 985, 989 (9th Cir. 1938)\n(rejecting a takings challenge to a reserve requirement under\nthe walnut marketing order).\n\f                       HORNE v. USDA                       9471\n   In rejecting a claim that a local mobile home rent control\nordinance amounted to a physical taking of park owners’\nproperty interest, the Supreme Court similarly explained that\n“[t]he government effects a physical taking only where it\nrequires the landowner to submit to the physical occupation\nof his land.” Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. 519, 527\n(1992) (emphasis in original). Emphasizing that the “ ‘ele-\nment of required acquiescence is at the heart of the concept\nof occupation,’ ” id. (quoting FCC v. Fla. Power Corp., 480\nU.S. 245, 252 (1987)), the Court explained that the mobile\npark owners had no physical takings claim because they vol-\nuntarily rented their land to mobile home owners and thus\nacquiesced in the regulation not under government compul-\nsion but of their own accord, id. at 527-28. This same logic\nwas used to defeat a takings challenge to a statute authorizing\nthe public disclosure of private data submitted by applicants\nas a condition on registering their pesticides. See Ruckelshaus,\n467 U.S. at 1007. Even though the applicants had a recog-\nnized interest in their intellectual property, the Supreme Court\nreasoned that “a voluntary submission of data by an applicant\nin exchange for the economic advantages of a registration can\nhardly be called a taking,” so long as the disclosure condition\nwas rationally related to a legitimate government interest and\nthe applicant was made aware of the condition in advance. Id.\n\n   [6] There are, of course, limits to what conditions the gov-\nernment can constitutionally impose. The government “may\nnot require a person to give up a constitutional right—[for\nexample,] the right to receive just compensation when prop-\nerty is taken for a public use—in exchange for a discretionary\nbenefit conferred by the government where the benefit has lit-\ntle or no relationship to the property.” Dolan, 512 U.S. at 385.\nThus, where the government conditioned the grant of a coastal\ndevelopment permit on the granting of a public easement\nbearing no nexus to the original purpose of the building\nrestriction, the Supreme Court held that the government could\nnot avoid paying compensation simply by shoehorning a tak-\ning into an unrelated exercise of its police powers. Nollan,\n\f9472                    HORNE v. USDA\n483 U.S. at 837; see also Dolan, 512 U.S. at 395 (holding that\ncity could not require development permit applicant to grant\na public pathway easement where there was no reasonable\nrelationship between the proposed development and the con-\ndition imposed). Here, however, the condition imposed is\nrationally related to the government’s legitimate interest in\ncontrolling the supply of raisins on the domestic market so as\nto prevent price destabilization and corollary effects on the\neconomy, and the Hornes had ample prior notice of the condi-\ntion before they voluntarily decided to enter the raisin market.\n\n   Nevertheless, the Hornes insist their so-called “voluntary”\nsubjection to the Raisin Marketing Order is in fact the product\nof a Hobson’s choice, for they have no economically viable\nalternative to selling their raisins and therefore must suffer the\ncomplete and total taking of a designated percentage of their\nraisins under compulsion. Their argument is founded on an\nerroneous belief that they have a property right to “market\ntheir [raisins] free of regulatory controls,” Cal-Almond, 30\nFed. Cl. at 246, and is unavailing.\n\n   Admittedly, the Raisin Marketing Order’s expansive defini-\ntion of “handler,” which includes anyone who “packs” raisins\nfor sale even if the raisins are sold exclusively within the state\nof California, renders its regulatory reach less escapable than\nthe marketing order at issue in Wallace, which did not apply\nto walnuts sold within the state of production. See Wallace, 98\nF.2d at 989. Nonetheless, we noted in Wallace a “distinction\nbetween the direct appropriation of property and the destruc-\ntion of property values in the exercise of governmental\npower,” id., observing that the regulation would remain valid\n“[e]ven if the [c]ompany were able to show . . . that the only\nalternative to making delivery to the [government] of surplus\nwalnuts or their ‘credit value’ would be to go out of busi-\nness,” id. at 990.\n\n   [7] This seemingly draconian result flows from the long-\nstanding notion that “some [property] values are enjoyed\n\f                       HORNE v. USDA                      9473\nunder an implied limitation and must yield” to the govern-\nment’s regulatory powers. Mahon, 260 U.S. at 413. The\nimplied restrictions on our property rights “are the burdens we\nall must bear in exchange for the advantage of living and\ndoing business in a civilized community,” Ruckelshaus, 467\nU.S. at 1007 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nOur takings jurisprudence is “guided by the understandings of\nour citizens regarding the content of, and the State’s power\nover, the ‘bundle of rights’ that they acquire when they obtain\ntitle to property,” Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1027, and not every\nrestriction on our use of property amounts to a compensable\ntaking.\n\n   Although the Fifth Amendment, as previously discussed,\nprotects real and personal property alike, the personal prop-\nerty “bundle of rights” is not coextensive with the bundle\ncomprising real property, as they are informed by different\nbackground principles. See id. at 1027-30. Consequently, the\nsame government action may effect a taking when applied to\none type of property but not the other. Whereas a regulation\ndepriving a landowner of “all economically beneficial uses”\nof his land effects a categorical taking, see Lucas, 505 U.S.\nat 1019 (emphasis in original), the same may not necessarily\nbe true of a regulation banning the sale of a commercial prod-\nuct, see, e.g., Andrus v. Allard, 444 U.S. 51, 66-67 (1979)\n(holding that prohibition on sale of eagle feathers was not a\ntaking); Ruppert v. Caffey, 251 U.S. 264 (1920) (upholding\nsales ban on nonintoxicating alcoholic beverages against tak-\nings challenge); James Everard’s Breweries v. Day, 265 U.S.\n545 (1924) (upholding ban on sale of all liquor, including\nliquor lawfully manufactured before passage of the statute).\nWhile the total deprivation of beneficial use of land carries a\n“heightened risk that private property is being pressed into\nsome form of public service under the guise of mitigating\nserious public harm,” Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1018, when it comes\nto personal property, “the State’s traditionally high degree of\ncontrol over commercial dealings” ought to put a property\nowner on notice “of the possibility that new regulation might\n\f9474                    HORNE v. USDA\neven render his property economically worthless (at least if\nthe property’s only economically productive use is sale or\nmanufacture for sale),” id. at 1027-28. Thus, although the\nright to sell their raisins is a significant one, it is but one\n“strand” in the Hornes’ bundle, and even the destruction of\nthat single strand would not amount to a taking without under-\ngoing Penn Central ad hoc review. See Andrus, 444 U.S. at\n65-66 (“significant restriction . . . imposed on one means of\ndisposing of the artifacts” does not amount to a taking); see\nalso Rock Royal, 307 U.S. at 572 (“As the Congress would\nhave, clearly, the right to permit only limited amounts of milk\nto move in interstate commerce, . . . it might permit the move-\nment on terms of pool settlement . . . .”).\n\n   [8] In any event, the Raisin Marketing Order does not\ndestroy that strand and does not deny raisin farmers all eco-\nnomically beneficial use of their raisins, for the regulation\ndoes not ban the sale of raisins altogether but only requires\nthe delivery to the RAC of a certain percentage of raisins pre-\npared for market. The Hornes insist the regulation effects a\ntotal taking of those reserve-tonnage raisins, but they ignore\nthe Supreme Court’s repeated admonition that we must con-\nsider the regulation’s impact on “the parcel as a whole” rather\nthan “divide a single parcel into discrete segments and\nattempt to determine whether rights in a particular segment\nhave been entirely abrogated.” Penn Cent., 438 U.S. at 130-\n131 & n.27; accord Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.S. at 327. For exam-\nple, where a statute required coal companies to leave unmined\nfifty percent of their coal beneath certain structures to prevent\nland subsidence, the Supreme Court found no taking, reason-\ning that “[t]he 27 million tons of coal do not constitute a sepa-\nrate segment of property for takings law purposes.” Keystone\nBituminous Coal Ass’n v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 498\n(1987).\n\n   [9] Accordingly, the Hornes’ argument that they have suf-\nfered a complete and total taking of their reserve-tonnage rai-\nsins is squarely foreclosed by case law, for the relevant parcel\n\f                        HORNE v. USDA                        9475\nhere is the entirety of their annual crop, not the individual rai-\nsins destined for the reserve pool. Even if in absolute terms\nthey number in the billions, the reserve-tonnage raisins are but\na designated percentage of a producer’s total annual crop han-\ndled for sale in the domestic market. Furthermore, the Hornes\nhave put forth no evidence that the Raisin Marketing Order\n“makes it impossible for [them] to profitably engage in their\nbusiness.” Id. at 485. We imagine it would be difficult for the\nHornes to gather such evidence, given that the reserve-pool\nrestrictions on the market supply of raisins serve to raise\nprices for the Hornes’ free-tonnage raisins, ostensibly making\ntheir business more profitable than it would be in an unregu-\nlated free market.\n\n   [10] The Hornes have suffered no compensable physical\ntaking of any portion of their crops, and thus the Fifth\nAmendment poses no obstacle to the Secretary’s enforcement\nof the Raisin Marketing Order against them. Because the\nHornes do not advance the alternative theory that the Raisin\nMarketing Order effects a regulatory taking, we leave that\nquestion for another day.\n\n  III.   Excessive Fines Claim\n\n   Finally, in connection with their takings argument, the\nHornes protest the JO’s imposition of nearly $700,000 in\ncombined assessments and fines, which they believe exces-\nsively penalizes them, in violation of the Eighth Amendment,\nfor their justified refusal to deliver their own private property\ninto the hands of the government. See U.S. Const. amend.\nVIII (“Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive\nfines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.”).\n\n   [11] To prevail on an excessive fines claim, a plaintiff\nmust establish (1) the assessment is imposed, at least in part,\nfor punitive and not merely remedial purposes, and (2) the\nfine is excessive, or “grossly disproportional to the gravity of\n[the] offense” for which it is imposed. Bajakajian, 524 U.S.\n\f9476                   HORNE v. USDA\nat 334; see Engquist v. Or. Dep’t of Agric., 478 F.3d 985,\n1006 (9th Cir. 2007); Mackby, 339 F.3d at 1016. Although an\nexcessive punitive civil fine is not beyond the Eighth Amend-\nment’s reach, Hudson v. United States, 522 U.S. 93, 103\n(1997), civil forfeiture that merely “provides a reasonable\nform of liquidated damages” as compensation for government\nlosses resulting from the unlawful activity is remedial, not\npunitive, and accordingly does not implicate the Eighth\nAmendment, One Lot Emerald Cut Stones & One Ring v.\nUnited States, 409 U.S. 232, 237 (1972); see United States v.\n$273,969.04 U.S. Currency, 164 F.3d 462, 466 (9th Cir.\n1999); Austin v. United States, 509 U.S. 602, 622 n.14 (1993)\n(“[A] fine that serves purely remedial purposes cannot be con-\nsidered ‘excessive’ in any event.”).\n\n   [12] Here, the district court correctly determined that the\n$8,783.39 in unpaid assessments imposed pursuant to 7\nC.F.R. § 989.80(a) and the $483,843.53 in compensation for\nthe withheld reserve-tonnage raisins imposed pursuant to 7\nC.F.R. § 989.166(c) amounted to remedial rather than puni-\ntive forfeitures and that the Excessive Fines Clause therefore\nis inapplicable to those penalties. The JO’s order that the\nHornes pay assessments to the RAC was calculated solely to\ncompensate the RAC for the mandatory assessments not paid.\nSee 7 C.F.R. § 989.80(a) (“Each handler shall, with respect to\nfree tonnage acquired by him . . . pay to the committee, upon\ndemand, his pro rata share of the expenses . . . which the Sec-\nretary finds will be incurred, as aforesaid, by the committee\nduring each crop year . . . .”). Similarly, the JO’s order that\nthe Hornes compensate the RAC for the withheld reserve-\ntonnage raisins flowed inexorably from another remedial,\nnon-punitive provision of the regulations. See id. § 989.166(c)\n(“A handler who fails to deliver to the Committee, upon\nrequest, any reserve tonnage raisins in the quantity and quality\nfor which he has become obligated . . . shall compensate the\nCommittee for the amount of the loss resulting from his fail-\nure to so deliver,” as determined by a fixed formula.). Calcu-\nlation of the compensation amount is nondiscretionary and is\n\f                       HORNE v. USDA                       9477\nlimited by the extent of the government’s loss. Cf.\n$273,969.04, 164 F.3d at 466 (inferring punitive nature of a\nsanction where it was not limited by the extent of the govern-\nment’s loss and was tied to commission of a crime). The JO’s\nuse of the “field price” to calculate the compensatory amount\nthe Hornes owed the RAC for their withheld reserve-tonnage\nraisins was consistent with the regulations. See 7 C.F.R.\n§ 989.166(c).\n\n   [13] The only sanction that implicates the Excessive Fines\nClause is the $202,600 fine imposed pursuant to 7 U.S.C.\n§ 608c(14)(B), but we again agree with the district court that\nthis civil penalty, less than one-third the authorized statutory\namount, is not “grossly disproportional to the gravity of [the\nHornes’] offense.” Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 334. Although we\nhave no set formula for determining the proportionality of a\ngiven penalty, relevant factors include the severity of the\noffense, the statutory maximum penalty available, and the\nharm caused by the offense. Mackby, 339 F.3d at 1016; see\nalso United States v. 3814 NW Thurman St., 164 F.3d 1191,\n1197-98 (9th Cir. 1999).\n\n   We have previously recognized that noncompliance with a\nmarketing order’s reporting and reserve requirements are seri-\nous offenses that threaten the Secretary’s ability to regulate a\ngiven market and prevent price destabilization, while also\nunjustly enriching the offenders who profit from selling their\nreserve-tonnage goods on the open market. See Balice v. U.S.\nDep’t of Agric., 203 F.3d 684, 693, 695, 698-99 (9th Cir.\n2000) (upholding a fine of $225,500 imposed on an almond\nhandler subject to up to $528,000 in fines for violations of\nvarious reporting and reserve requirements). Furthermore, that\nCongress authorized a much steeper fine ($1,000 for each of\nthe Hornes’ 673 separate offenses spanning a two-year period,\nfor a total of $673,000) than what the JO actually imposed,\nwhile not dispositive, weighs heavily against finding the fine\ngrossly disproportional to the Hornes’ offense, for “judgments\nabout the appropriate punishment for an offense belong in the\n\f9478                        HORNE v. USDA\nfirst instance to the legislature.” Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 336,\n339 n.14; accord Balice, 203 F.3d at 699.13 In light of these\nfactors, we cannot say the district court erred in finding the\npenalties consistent with the Eighth Amendment.14\n\n                            CONCLUSION\n\n  The Hornes are clearly dissatisfied and frustrated with a\nregulatory scheme they believe no longer serves the interests\nof the farmers it was designed, in large part, to protect. That\nbeing the case, the Hornes may wish to “take their case to the\nSecretary for a reevaluation of the [Raisin Marketing] Order\nand the regulations, for although the [Raisin Marketing] Order\nand the regulations are lawful, plaintiffs and other producers\nmay prevail upon the Secretary to change them in order to\nbetter achieve the purpose behind the [AMAA].” Prune Bar-\ngaining Ass’n v. Butz, 444 F. Supp. 785, 793 (N.D. Cal.\n  13\n      Although in Balice it appears the JO imposed penalties under only 7\nU.S.C. § 608c(14) and not under the regulation’s forfeiture provisions,\nwhereas here the JO imposed both, nothing in the statutory or regulatory\nlanguage seems to preclude simultaneous imposition of remedial and puni-\ntive sanctions under the respective provisions. To the contrary, 7 C.F.R.\n§ 989.166(c) expressly provides that compensation for failure to deliver\nreserve-tonnage raisins “shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any\nor all of the remedies or penalties prescribed in the act” for noncompliance\nwith the act or regulation’s requirements, and the Hornes do not challenge\nthe legitimacy of this provision.\n   14\n      We also reject the Hornes’ contention that 7 U.S.C. § 608c(14)(B)\nexempts them from liability for their Raisin Marketing Order violations\nbecause in 2007 they filed an administrative petition pursuant to 7 U.S.C.\n§ 608c(15)(A). See 7 U.S.C. § 608c(14)(B) (immunizing from civil pen-\nalty any handler who “in good faith and not for delay” files and prosecutes\na qualifying administrative petition). First, this argument was already dis-\nposed of in one of our earlier decisions, see Horne, 397 Fed. Appx. at 486,\nand is not properly before us now. Moreover, even if the matter were\nproperly before us, it is without merit. Section 608c(14)(B) only immu-\nnizes handlers from penalties otherwise incurred during the pendency of\ntheir administrative petition; it does not apply retroactively. Therefore, an\nadministrative petition not filed until 2007 cannot immunize the Hornes\nfrom fines relating to their conduct in 2002-04.\n\f                       HORNE v.

Our role, however, is limited to\nreviewing the constitutionality and not the wisdom of the cur-\nrent regulation.

Part 989 (“Raisin Marketing Order” or “the Order”),\nfirst adopted in 1949. Farmers Marvin and Laura Horne (“the\nHornes”1) protest the USDA Judicial Officer’s (“JO”) imposi-\ntion of civil penalties and assessments for their failure to com-\nply with the reserve requirements, among other regulatory\ninfractions, contending: (1) they are producers not subject to\nthe Raisin Marketing Order’s provisions; (2) even if subject\nto those provisions, the requirement that they contribute a\nspecified percentage of their annual raisin crop to the\ngovernment-controlled reserve pool constitutes an uncompen-\nsated per se taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment; and\n(3) the penalties imposed for their “self-help” noncompliance\nwith the Raisin Marketing Order violate the Eighth Amend-\nment Excessive Fines Clause.

Marketing orders under the AMAA\n   2\n     According to the specific promulgation procedures mandated by the\nAMAA, the Secretary may only issue a marketing order if, after providing\nnotice and opportunity for hearing, he finds that “the issuance of such\norder . . . will tend to effectuate the declared policy” of the Act. 7 U.S.C.\n§ 608c(3)-(4). Such order will not become effective until approved by both\n(1) the handlers of at least 50 percent of the volume of the commodity\ncovered by the proposed order and (2) either (a) two-thirds of producers\nof that commodity during a representative period or (b) producers of two-\nthirds of the volume of that commodity during said period. Id. § 608c(8);\nsee id. § 608b. The Secretary may terminate or suspend any marketing\norder upon finding it “obstructs or does not tend to effectuate the declared\npolicy” of the Act, or upon request of a majority of active producers dur-\ning a representative time period. Id. § 608c(16).\n   3\n     Section 8c of the AMAA, 7 U.S.C. § 608c, the key statutory provision\ndealing with the marketing orders, originated in a 1935 amendment to the\nAgricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, Pub.

A “packer,” in turn, is “any person who, within [Cali-\nfornia], stems, sorts, cleans, or seeds raisins, grades stemmed raisins, or\npackages raisins for market as raisins,” but does not include a producer\nwho sorts and cleans his own raisins in their unstemmed form. Id.\n§ 989.14.\n   5\n     A “producer” under the Raisin Marketing Order is “any person\nengaged in a proprietary capacity in the production of grapes which are\nsun-dried or dehydrated by artificial means until they become raisins.” 7\nC.F.R. § 989.11.\n   6\n     The regulation of handlers, as opposed to growers, appears to be a ves-\ntige of the historical context in which the AMAA was enacted, “an era\nwhen small, independent growers were frequently left to the mercy of\nlarge handlers who could benefit from their market power and position.”\nBensing, supra, at 8. In the raisin industry, producers generally own the\nland on which the grapevines are located, and they typically pick the\ngrapes and dry them on trays before selling the unstemmed raisins to pack-\ners, or “handlers.” Packers then prepare the raisins for commercial sale\nand distribution by cleaning, stemming, seeding, grading, sorting, and\npackaging the raisins into containers. Packers then typically sell the\npacked raisins to wholesalers, distributors, and other dealers for resale and\ndistribution to the public. Brown v.

USDA                              9461\n   The Raisin Marketing Order was originally enacted in\n1949, see 14 Fed. Reg. 5136 (Aug. 18, 1949) (codified, as\namended, at 7 C.F.R. Part 989), in an effort to stabilize raisin\nprices by controlling production surpluses, which since 1920\nhad consistently been thirty to fifty percent of each year’s\ncrop. See Parker, 317 U.S. at 363-64.7 Like many other fruit\nand vegetable orders issued under the AMAA,8 the Order pro-\nvides for the establishment of annual reserve pools, as deter-\nmined by each year’s crop yield, thereby removing surplus\nraisins from sale on the open domestic market and indirectly\ncontrolling prices. See 7 U.S.C. § 608c(6)(E); 7 C.F.R.\n§§ 989.54(d), 989.65. By February 15 of each year, the Raisin\nAdministrative Committee (“RAC”)—an industry committee\ncharged with administration of the Raisin Marketing Order,9\n  7\n     The raisin industry has long been an important one in California, where\n99.5 percent of the U.S. crop and 40 percent of the world’s crop are pro-\nduced. See The California Raisin Industry, http://www.calraisins.org/\nabout/the-raisin-industry/ (last visited July 6, 2011). Raisin prices rose\nrapidly between 1914 and 1920, peaking in 1921 at $235 per ton. This\nprice increase spurred increased production, which in turn caused prices\nto plummet back down to between $40 and $60 per ton, even while pro-\nduction continued to expand. As a result of this growing disparity between\nincreasing production and decreasing prices, the industry became “com-\npelled to sell at less than parity prices and in some years at prices regarded\nby students of the industry as less than the cost of production,” finally\nprompting federal government intervention with the Raisin Marketing\nOrder in 1949. See Parker, 317 U.S. at 363-64 & nn.9-10.\n   8\n     For a comparison of the Raisin Marketing Order and marketing orders\nfor other agricultural products, such as walnuts, almonds, prunes, tart cher-\nries, and spearmint, see Evans v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Fed. Cl.</span> <span class=\"page\">554</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 558\n(2006), aff’d, 250 Fed. Appx. 321 (Fed. Cir. 2007).\n   9\n     The RAC is currently comprised of forty-seven industry-nominated\nrepresentatives appointed by the Secretary, of whom thirty-five represent\nproducers, ten represent handlers, one represents the cooperative bargain-\ning association, and one represents the public. See 7 C.F.R. §§ 989.26,\n989.29, 989.30. The RAC is an agent of the federal government but\nreceives no federal appropriations. Instead, it is funded by assessments\nlevied on handlers per ton of raisins sold on the open market and by pro-\nceeds from the sale of reserve-tonnage raisins. See 7 C.F.R. §§ 989.53,\n989.79, 989.80(a), 989.82.\n\f9462                    HORNE v. USDA\nsee 7 C.F.R. §§ 989.35, 989.36—recommends the “reserve-\ntonnage” and “free-tonnage” percentages for that year, which\nthe Secretary then promulgates. See id. §§ 989.54(d), 989.55.\nThe reserve-tonnage requirement varies from year to year; for\nexample, in the 2002-03 and 2003-04 crop years at issue here,\nthe reserve percentages were set at forty-seven percent and\nthirty percent of a producer’s crop, respectively.\n\n   As a result of the Order’s reserve program requirements, a\nproducer receives payment (at a pre-negotiated field market\nprice) upon delivery of raisins to a handler only for the free-\ntonnage raisins, which the handler is then free to sell on the\ndomestic market without restrictions. See id. § 989.65. The\nreserve-tonnage raisins, on the other hand, must be held by\nthe handler in segregated bins “for the account” of the RAC\nuntil the RAC sells them to handlers for resale in export mar-\nkets or directs that they be sold or disposed of in secondary,\nnon-competitive markets, such as school lunch programs,\neither by direct sale or gift to U.S. agencies or foreign govern-\nments. Id. §§ 989.54, 989.56, 989.65, 989.67, 989.166,\n989.167. The reserve pool sales are used to finance the RAC’s\nadministration, and any remaining net proceeds must then be\nequitably distributed to the producers on a pro rata basis. See\n7 U.S.C. § 608c(6)(E) (providing for “the equitable distribu-\ntion of the net return derived from the sale [of reserve-pool\nraisins] among the persons beneficially interested therein”); 7\nC.F.R. § 989.66(h). Thus, although producers do not receive\npayment for reserve-tonnage raisins at the time of delivery to\na handler, they retain a limited equity interest in the net pro-\nceeds of the RAC’s disposition of the reserve, to be paid at\na later time.\n\n  The RAC is tasked with selling the reserve raisins in a\nmanner “intended to maxim[ize] producer returns and achieve\nmaximum disposition of such raisins by the time reserve ton-\nnage raisins from the subsequent crop year are available,” 7\nC.F.R. § 989.67(d)(1), but the Hornes complain that they have\nnot received any reserve sale proceeds since the mid-1990s.\n\f                          HORNE v. USDA                           9463\nFor example the RAC designated forty-seven percent of the\n2002-03 crop as reserve tonnage, which it then sold for $970\nper ton, but none of the money the RAC received was paid\nback to the raisin producers.\n\n   In addition to the reserve pool requirement, the Raisin Mar-\nketing Order obliges handlers to, inter alia: file reports with\nthe RAC, pay assessments to the RAC, and grant the RAC\naccess to records for auditing purposes. See id. §§ 989.58,\n989.59, 989.73, 989.77, 989.80.\n\n  II.   The Hornes’ Raisin Enterprises\n\n   Marvin and Laura Horne have been producing raisins in\nFresno and Madera Counties in California since 1969 and in\n1999 registered as a California general partnership under the\nname Raisin Valley Farms. They also own and operate Lassen\nVineyards, another registered California general partnership,\nin partnership with Laura’s parents, Don and Rena Durbahn.\nDisillusioned with a regulatory scheme they deemed “outdat-\ned” and exploitive of farmers, the Hornes looked for ways to\navoid the Raisin Marketing Order’s requirements, particularly\nits mandatory raisin reserve program. Because those require-\nments apply only to handlers, the Hornes implemented a plan\nto bring their raisins to market without going through a tradi-\ntional middle-man packer. As part of their plan, the Hornes\npurchased their own equipment and facilities to clean, stem,\nsort, and package raisins, which they installed on Lassen\nVineyards property in 2001. Not only did this facility handle\nthe raisins from Raisin Valley Farms and Lassen Vineyards,\nit also contracted with more than sixty other raisin growers to\nclean, stem, sort, and in some cases box and stack their raisins\nfor a per-pound fee, typically twelve cents per pound.10 USDA\nrecords reflect that Lassen Vineyards packed out more than\n  10\n    This type of arrangement is known as “toll packing.” Toll packers do\nnot acquire ownership of the commodity but instead provide a packing\nservice for a fee.\n\f9464                       HORNE v. USDA\n1.2 million pounds of raisins during the 2002-03 crop year\nand more than 1.9 million pounds during the 2003-04 crop\nyear.\n\n   Meanwhile, the Hornes also organized these sixty-some\ngrowers into the Raisin Valley Marketing Association, an\nunincorporated association that marketed and sold raisins to\nwholesale customers on its members’ behalf, while the grow-\ners maintained ownership over their own raisins. Raisin Val-\nley Marketing then held the sales funds on the growers’ behalf\nin a trust account, from which it paid Lassen Vineyards its\npacking fees, paid a third-party broker fee, and distributed the\nnet proceeds to the growers.\n\n  III.   Proceedings Below\n\n   The Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service\ninitiated an enforcement action against the Hornes, alleging\nviolations of the AMAA and failure to comply with the Raisin\nMarketing Order’s various requirements. On appeal from an\nAdministrative Law Judge’s decision following an on-the-\nrecord hearing, the USDA JO found both Raisin Valley Farms\nand Lassen Vineyards liable for: (1) twenty violations of 7\nC.F.R. § 989.73 (filing of inaccurate reports); (2) fifty-eight\nviolations of 7 C.F.R. § 989.58(d) (failing to obtain incoming\ninspections); (3) 592 violations of 7 C.F.R. § 989.66 and 7\nC.F.R. § 989.166 (failing to hold reserve raisins for the 2002-\n03 and 2003-04 crop years); (4) two violations of 7 C.F.R.\n§ 989.80 (failing to pay assessments to the RAC); and (5) one\nviolation of 7 C.F.R. § 989.77 (failing to allow the Agricul-\ntural Marketing Service access to records). The JO accord-\ningly ordered the Hornes to pay (1) $8,783.39 in unpaid\nassessments for the 2002-03 and 2003-04 crop years, pursuant\nto 7 C.F.R. § 989.80(a); (2) $483,843.53, the alleged dollar\nequivalent of the withheld raisin reserve contributions for the\n2002-03 (632,427 pounds) and 2003-04 (611,159 pounds11)\n  11\n    The Hornes do not challenge the JO’s calculation of these figures.\n\f                            HORNE v.

The JO granted the USDA’s motion to\ndismiss for lack of standing.

Application of the Raisin Marketing Order to the\n       Hornes\n\n   For the reasons discussed in the district court’s opinion\nbelow, we conclude that the Hornes, who admit that their toll-\npacking business “stems, sorts, cleans,” and “packages raisins\nfor market as raisins,” 7 C.F.R. § 989.14, satisfy the regula-\ntory definition of a “packer” and are thus “handlers” subject\nto the Raisin Marketing Order’s provisions, see 7 C.F.R.\n§ 989.15.

Furthermore, its\nfindings regarding the Hornes’ handler operations are sup-\nported by substantial evidence and are neither arbitrary nor\ncapricious. See 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), (E).\n\n   [2] The Hornes argue they are statutorily exempt from reg-\nulation because they also satisfy the regulatory definition of\na “producer,” and the AMAA provides that “[n]o order issued\nunder this chapter shall be applicable to any producer in his\ncapacity as a producer.” 7 U.S.C. § 608c(13)(B). However, by\nexpressly limiting the exemption from regulation only to a\nproducer “in his capacity as a producer,” the AMAA contem-\nplates that an individual who performs both producer and han-\ndler functions may still be regulated in his capacity as a\nhandler. Even if the AMAA is considered “silent or ambigu-\nous” on the regulation of individuals who perform both pro-\nducer and handler functions, we must give Chevron deference\nto the permissible interpretation of the Secretary of Agricul-\nture, who is charged with administering the statute.

Takings Claim\n\n   Does the Raisin Marketing Order’s reserve requirement\nprogram constitute a physical, per se taking of the Hornes’\npersonal property without just compensation, in violation of\nthe Fifth Amendment? See U.S. Const. amend. V (“[N]or\nshall private property be taken for public use, without just\ncompensation.”). We join the Court of Federal Claims, which\nnot long ago decided this exact question, in holding it does\nnot. See Evans, 74 Fed. Cl. at 562-64; cf.

Instead, it imposes conditions\non the government’s authority to act, providing that when\ngovernment takes private property, pursuant to the lawful\nexercise of its constitutional powers, (1) it must take for pub-\nlic rather than private use, and (2) it must provide owners with\njust compensation, as measured by the property owner’s loss.\nSee Brown v.

Far from compelling a physical taking of\nthe Hornes’ tangible property, the Raisin Marketing Order\napplies to the Hornes only insofar as they voluntarily choose\nto send their raisins into the stream of interstate commerce.\nSimply put, it is a use restriction, not a direct appropriation.\nThe Secretary of Agriculture did not authorize a forced sei-\nzure of forty-seven percent of the Hornes’ 2002-03 crops and\nthirty percent of their 2003-04 crops, but rather imposed a\ncondition on the Hornes’ use of their crops by regulating their\nsale.

The government “may\nnot require a person to give up a constitutional right—[for\nexample,] the right to receive just compensation when prop-\nerty is taken for a public use—in exchange for a discretionary\nbenefit conferred by the government where the benefit has lit-\ntle or no relationship to the property.” Dolan, 512 U.S. at 385.\nThus, where the government conditioned the grant of a coastal\ndevelopment permit on the granting of a public easement\nbearing no nexus to the original purpose of the building\nrestriction, the Supreme Court held that the government could\nnot avoid paying compensation simply by shoehorning a tak-\ning into an unrelated exercise of its police powers. Nollan,\n\f9472                    HORNE v. USDA\n483 U.S. at 837; see also Dolan, 512 U.S. at 395 (holding that\ncity could not require development permit applicant to grant\na public pathway easement where there was no reasonable\nrelationship between the proposed development and the con-\ndition imposed). Here, however, the condition imposed is\nrationally related to the government’s legitimate interest in\ncontrolling the supply of raisins on the domestic market so as\nto prevent price destabilization and corollary effects on the\neconomy, and the Hornes had ample prior notice of the condi-\ntion before they voluntarily decided to enter the raisin market.\n\n   Nevertheless, the Hornes insist their so-called “voluntary”\nsubjection to the Raisin Marketing Order is in fact the product\nof a Hobson’s choice, for they have no economically viable\nalternative to selling their raisins and therefore must suffer the\ncomplete and total taking of a designated percentage of their\nraisins under compulsion. Their argument is founded on an\nerroneous belief that they have a property right to “market\ntheir [raisins] free of regulatory controls,” Cal-Almond, 30\nFed. Cl. at 246, and is unavailing.\n\n   Admittedly, the Raisin Marketing Order’s expansive defini-\ntion of “handler,” which includes anyone who “packs” raisins\nfor sale even if the raisins are sold exclusively within the state\nof California, renders its regulatory reach less escapable than\nthe marketing order at issue in Wallace, which did not apply\nto walnuts sold within the state of production. See Wallace, 98\nF.2d at 989. Nonetheless, we noted in Wallace a “distinction\nbetween the direct appropriation of property and the destruc-\ntion of property values in the exercise of governmental\npower,” id., observing that the regulation would remain valid\n“[e]ven if the [c]ompany were able to show . . . that the only\nalternative to making delivery to the [government] of surplus\nwalnuts or their ‘credit value’ would be to go out of busi-\nness,” id. at 990.\n\n   [7] This seemingly draconian result flows from the long-\nstanding notion that “some [property] values are enjoyed\n\f                       HORNE v. USDA                      9473\nunder an implied limitation and must yield” to the govern-\nment’s regulatory powers. Mahon, 260 U.S. at 413. The\nimplied restrictions on our property rights “are the burdens we\nall must bear in exchange for the advantage of living and\ndoing business in a civilized community,” Ruckelshaus, 467\nU.S. at 1007 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nOur takings jurisprudence is “guided by the understandings of\nour citizens regarding the content of, and the State’s power\nover, the ‘bundle of rights’ that they acquire when they obtain\ntitle to property,” Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1027, and not every\nrestriction on our use of property amounts to a compensable\ntaking.\n\n   Although the Fifth Amendment, as previously discussed,\nprotects real and personal property alike, the personal prop-\nerty “bundle of rights” is not coextensive with the bundle\ncomprising real property, as they are informed by different\nbackground principles. See id. at 1027-30. Consequently, the\nsame government action may effect a taking when applied to\none type of property but not the other. Whereas a regulation\ndepriving a landowner of “all economically beneficial uses”\nof his land effects a categorical taking, see Lucas, 505 U.S.\nat 1019 (emphasis in original), the same may not necessarily\nbe true of a regulation banning the sale of a commercial prod-\nuct, see, e.g., Andrus v.

USDA\neven render his property economically worthless (at least if\nthe property’s only economically productive use is sale or\nmanufacture for sale),” id. at 1027-28. Thus, although the\nright to sell their raisins is a significant one, it is but one\n“strand” in the Hornes’ bundle, and even the destruction of\nthat single strand would not amount to a taking without under-\ngoing Penn Central ad hoc review. See Andrus, 444 U.S. at\n65-66 (“significant restriction . . . imposed on one means of\ndisposing of the artifacts” does not amount to a taking); see\nalso Rock Royal, 307 U.S. at 572 (“As the Congress would\nhave, clearly, the right to permit only limited amounts of milk\nto move in interstate commerce, . . . it might permit the move-\nment on terms of pool settlement . . . .”).\n\n   [8] In any event, the Raisin Marketing Order does not\ndestroy that strand and does not deny raisin farmers all eco-\nnomically beneficial use of their raisins, for the regulation\ndoes not ban the sale of raisins altogether but only requires\nthe delivery to the RAC of a certain percentage of raisins pre-\npared for market. The Hornes insist the regulation effects a\ntotal taking of those reserve-tonnage raisins, but they ignore\nthe Supreme Court’s repeated admonition that we must con-\nsider the regulation’s impact on “the parcel as a whole” rather\nthan “divide a single parcel into discrete segments and\nattempt to determine whether rights in a particular segment\nhave been entirely abrogated.” Penn Cent., 438 U.S. at 130-\n131 & n.27; accord Tahoe-Sierra, 535 U.S. at 327. For exam-\nple, where a statute required coal companies to leave unmined\nfifty percent of their coal beneath certain structures to prevent\nland subsidence, the Supreme Court found no taking, reason-\ning that “[t]he 27 million tons of coal do not constitute a sepa-\nrate segment of property for takings law purposes.” Keystone\nBituminous Coal Ass’n v.

USDA                        9475\nhere is the entirety of their annual crop, not the individual rai-\nsins destined for the reserve pool. Even if in absolute terms\nthey number in the billions, the reserve-tonnage raisins are but\na designated percentage of a producer’s total annual crop han-\ndled for sale in the domestic market. Furthermore, the Hornes\nhave put forth no evidence that the Raisin Marketing Order\n“makes it impossible for [them] to profitably engage in their\nbusiness.” Id. at 485. We imagine it would be difficult for the\nHornes to gather such evidence, given that the reserve-pool\nrestrictions on the market supply of raisins serve to raise\nprices for the Hornes’ free-tonnage raisins, ostensibly making\ntheir business more profitable than it would be in an unregu-\nlated free market.\n\n   [10] The Hornes have suffered no compensable physical\ntaking of any portion of their crops, and thus the Fifth\nAmendment poses no obstacle to the Secretary’s enforcement\nof the Raisin Marketing Order against them. Because the\nHornes do not advance the alternative theory that the Raisin\nMarketing Order effects a regulatory taking, we leave that\nquestion for another day.\n\n  III.   Excessive Fines Claim\n\n   Finally, in connection with their takings argument, the\nHornes protest the JO’s imposition of nearly $700,000 in\ncombined assessments and fines, which they believe exces-\nsively penalizes them, in violation of the Eighth Amendment,\nfor their justified refusal to deliver their own private property\ninto the hands of the government. See U.S. Const. amend.\nVIII (“Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive\nfines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.”).\n\n   [11] To prevail on an excessive fines claim, a plaintiff\nmust establish (1) the assessment is imposed, at least in part,\nfor punitive and not merely remedial purposes, and (2) the\nfine is excessive, or “grossly disproportional to the gravity of\n[the] offense” for which it is imposed.

The JO’s order that the\nHornes pay assessments to the RAC was calculated solely to\ncompensate the RAC for the mandatory assessments not paid.\nSee 7 C.F.R. § 989.80(a) (“Each handler shall, with respect to\nfree tonnage acquired by him . . . pay to the committee, upon\ndemand, his pro rata share of the expenses . . . which the Sec-\nretary finds will be incurred, as aforesaid, by the committee\nduring each crop year . . . .”). Similarly, the JO’s order that\nthe Hornes compensate the RAC for the withheld reserve-\ntonnage raisins flowed inexorably from another remedial,\nnon-punitive provision of the regulations. See id. § 989.166(c)\n(“A handler who fails to deliver to the Committee, upon\nrequest, any reserve tonnage raisins in the quantity and quality\nfor which he has become obligated . . . shall compensate the\nCommittee for the amount of the loss resulting from his fail-\nure to so deliver,” as determined by a fixed formula.). Calcu-\nlation of the compensation amount is nondiscretionary and is\n\f                       HORNE v. USDA                       9477\nlimited by the extent of the government’s loss. Cf.\n$273,969.04, 164 F.3d at 466 (inferring punitive nature of a\nsanction where it was not limited by the extent of the govern-\nment’s loss and was tied to commission of a crime). The JO’s\nuse of the “field price” to calculate the compensatory amount\nthe Hornes owed the RAC for their withheld reserve-tonnage\nraisins was consistent with the regulations. See 7 C.F.R.\n§ 989.166(c).\n\n   [13] The only sanction that implicates the Excessive Fines\nClause is the $202,600 fine imposed pursuant to 7 U.S.C.\n§ 608c(14)(B), but we again agree with the district court that\nthis civil penalty, less than one-third the authorized statutory\namount, is not “grossly disproportional to the gravity of [the\nHornes’] offense.” Bajakajian, 524 U.S. at 334. Although we\nhave no set formula for determining the proportionality of a\ngiven penalty, relevant factors include the severity of the\noffense, the statutory maximum penalty available, and the\nharm caused by the offense.

Cal.\n  13\n      Although in Balice it appears the JO imposed penalties under only 7\nU.S.C. § 608c(14) and not under the regulation’s forfeiture provisions,\nwhereas here the JO imposed both, nothing in the statutory or regulatory\nlanguage seems to preclude simultaneous imposition of remedial and puni-\ntive sanctions under the respective provisions. To the contrary, 7 C.F.R.\n§ 989.166(c) expressly provides that compensation for failure to deliver\nreserve-tonnage raisins “shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any\nor all of the remedies or penalties prescribed in the act” for noncompliance\nwith the act or regulation’s requirements, and the Hornes do not challenge\nthe legitimacy of this provision.\n   14\n      We also reject the Hornes’ contention that 7 U.S.C. § 608c(14)(B)\nexempts them from liability for their Raisin Marketing Order violations\nbecause in 2007 they filed an administrative petition pursuant to 7 U.S.C.\n§ 608c(15)(A). See 7 U.S.C. § 608c(14)(B) (immunizing from civil pen-\nalty any handler who “in good faith and not for delay” files and prosecutes\na qualifying administrative petition). First, this argument was already dis-\nposed of in one of our earlier decisions, see Horne, 397 Fed. Appx. at 486,\nand is not properly before us now. Moreover, even if the matter were\nproperly before us, it is without merit. Section 608c(14)(B) only immu-\nnizes handlers from penalties otherwise incurred during the pendency of\ntheir administrative petition; it does not apply retroactively.
