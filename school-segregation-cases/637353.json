GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit. See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n\n                             OPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n   Victor and Kimberly Morgan, on behalf of their minor child Brad-\nley, who is dyslexic, commenced this action to review the decision of\na West Virginia hearing officer rejecting in part their complaint about\nthe Greenbrier County (West Virginia) Board of Education’s compli-\nance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Mor-\ngans contended that because an Individualized Education Program\n(\"IEP\") developed in May 2000 for Bradley’s 2000-2001 school year\nwas inappropriate under the Act, they were entitled to have Bradley\nplaced in an out-of-state private residential school and have the State\nreimburse them their annual costs of $27,800. While the hearing offi-\ncer agreed that the IEP for Bradley was inappropriate, she directed the\nMorgans to follow an administrative process for developing a new\nIEP before any out-of-state placement would be considered. The hear-\ning officer also concluded that the Morgans had failed to establish the\nneed at that time for out-of-state placement and also the reasonable-\nness of its cost.\n\n  The district court granted summary judgment for Greenbrier\nCounty, and, for the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                                   I\n\n   During the 1999-2000 school year, Bradley was in the sixth grade\nat Greenbrier County (West Virginia) Elementary School. Because\nBradley had previously been diagnosed as dyslexic, he received both\nspecial education and regular education part time.\n\n   On May 23, 2000, the Morgans and their son attended a meeting\nscheduled to develop Bradley’s 2000-2001 IEP. The Morgans were\ndissatisfied with the IEP developed, and, based both on Bradley’s past\nlack of educational progress as well as the process followed in devel-\n\f            MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA                   3\noping the IEP, they requested a due process hearing to review the\n2000-2001 IEP. At the same time, the Morgans unilaterally enrolled\nBradley in a six-week summer course at the Oakland School in Vir-\nginia, a residential school that specializes in teaching dyslexic stu-\ndents.\n\n   The due process hearing was conducted before an impartial hearing\nofficer on July 27 and 28, 2000, in Lewisburg, West Virginia, and on\nAugust 25, 2000, following the hearing, the hearing officer issued a\nlengthy written decision that included detailed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law. In her decision, the hearing officer agreed with\nthe Morgans that the IEP developed for Bradley for the 2000-2001\nschool year was not appropriate in that it was not reasonably calcu-\nlated to provide Bradley with educational benefit. While the hearing\nofficer found \"serious procedural deficiencies,\" she nonetheless con-\ncluded that these deficiencies did not cause Bradley to lose \"educa-\ntional opportunity.\" The officer noted that because the Morgans\n\"elected to file a due process [hearing request] immediately, no IEP\ncommittee meeting could be reconvened as [had been] offered by the\nCounty.\" To remedy this short-circuiting of the process, the hearing\nofficer directed that the IEP committee meet as soon as possible, but\nin any case within 15 days of its order, to prepare an appropriate IEP\nfor Bradley’s 2000-2001 school year. Moreover, the hearing officer\ndetailed the process that had to be followed. The hearing officer con-\ncluded that only if the IEP committee concluded that Greenbrier\nCounty schools could not, based on evaluations, provide Bradley with\nan educational benefit in Greenbrier County, should the IEP commit-\ntee consider residential placement as requested by the Morgans.\n\n   With respect to the Morgans’ request that Bradley be placed forth-\nwith at an out-of-state residential school, the officer concluded that\nsuch a placement was not justified, and to order such a placement\nwithout pursuing a revised IEP would ignore the Act’s requirement\nthat, \"to the greatest extent possible, children are to be educated in the\nleast restrictive environment.\" See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A). In addi-\ntion, the hearing officer pointed out that the Morgans failed to provide\nany evidence \"as to the reasonableness of the costs (approximately\n$25,000 per year) of the parents’ proposed placement.\"\n\n  Similarly, with respect to the Morgans’ request for unilateral place-\nment of Bradley at the Oakland School summer program, the officer\n\f4           MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA\nconcluded that the Morgans had not presented sufficient evidence for\nsuch a placement and for the reasonableness of its costs.\n\n   Finally the hearing officer rejected Bradley’s claim for \"compensa-\ntory education.\" Noting that compensatory education is a remedy \"oc-\ncasionally used when the County schools knew or should have known\nthat the student’s IEP was inappropriate and when the student was not\nreceiving more than de minimis educational benefit or when the\nCounty schools acted in bad faith,\" the hearing officer found that\nthose circumstances had not been demonstrated in this case. The offi-\ncer stated that the County’s conduct amounting to procedural defi-\nciencies did not \"appear to be an act of deliberate indifference\ntowards the parents’ IDEA rights.\"\n\n   The Morgans commenced this action under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C.\n§ 415(i)(2)(A), to review the hearing officer’s decision (1) to refuse\nto approve the placement of Bradley at the Oakland School for the\n2000 summer session, the 2000-2001 school year, and such years\nthereafter as necessary, and (2) to deny Bradley’s claim for reim-\nbursement for expenses incurred in sending Bradley to the Oakland\nSchool. On the motion of Greenbrier County, the district court\ngranted summary judgment to the County, essentially agreeing with\nthe hearing officer on the issues raised. From the district court’s judg-\nment, this appeal followed.\n\n                                   II\n\n   Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"),\nState eligibility for federal funding requires the State to insure that a\nfree appropriate public education is available to all disabled children\nbetween ages 3 and 21 residing in the State. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1412(a)(1)(A). To provide a free appropriate public education to a\ndisabled student, a local educational agency must develop an appro-\npriate \"Individualized Education Program\" (\"IEP\") tailored to the\nindividual student. Id. §§ 1412(a)(4), 1414(d); Bd. of Educ. of Hendr-\nick Hudson Central Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 181-82\n(1982). The IDEA provides parents the opportunity to participate in\nthe development of the IEP, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1414(d)(1)(B), (d)(3), and\nprovides them procedural safeguards, id. § 1415.\n\f            MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA                 5\n   The required procedural safeguards include the opportunity for par-\nents to present complaints with respect to the State’s provision of a\nfree appropriate public education or to the identification, evaluation,\nor educational placement of their disabled child. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1415(b)(6). Parents may pursue their complaint further by request-\ning an \"impartial due process hearing,\" which, in West Virginia, is\nconducted by the State educational agency. Id. § 1415(f)-(g); W. Va.\nCode St. R. § 126-16-8.1.11. \"Any party aggrieved by the findings\nand decision\" made by the State educational agency is given the right\n\"to bring a civil action with respect to the complaint presented\" to the\nagency. Id. § 1415(i)(2)(A). In the judicial proceeding, the adminis-\ntrative findings of fact are considered \"prima facie correct, and if a\nreview court fails to adhere to them, it is obliged to explain why.\"\nMM ex rel. DM v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 303 F.3d 523, 530-\n31 (4th Cir. 2002). Stated differently, \"the deference due the decision\nof the underlying State administrative process requires that the party\nchallenging the administrative decision bear the burden of proof\"\nbefore the district court. Tice v. Botetourt County School Board, 908\nF.2d 1200, 1206 n.5 (4th Cir. 1990) (citing Spielberg v. Henrico\nCounty Public Schools, 853 F.2d 256, 258 n.2 (4th Cir. 1988)).\n\n   In this case, the hearing officer concluded that Bradley’s 2000-\n2001 IEP, developed for Bradley on May 23, 2000, was not appropri-\nate, and she directed the IEP committee to meet within 15 days to pre-\npare an appropriate one. She also specified the procedures that had to\nbe followed in the renewed effort. The hearing officer concluded that\nonly if the IEP committee concluded, after pursuing the specified pro-\ncedures, that Bradley would not receive educational benefit within\ncounty schools could the IEP committee consider an out-of-state\nplacement, as the Morgans requested. The Morgans have advanced no\nreason why this ruling was not appropriate and why they should not\nhave completed the specified administrative process before commenc-\ning this action. Indeed, they were essentially vindicated in their claim\nthat the original IEP was inappropriate and that a new one should be\ndeveloped. Accordingly, we find no error by the district court’s affir-\nmance of this ruling.\n\n   With respect to the Morgans’ claims that Bradley should be placed\nat an out-of-state residential school and that the State should reim-\nburse the Morgans for the cost, we agree with the district court and\n\f6            MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA\nthe hearing officer that the Morgans have essentially jumped the gun.\nThey have failed to demonstrate why only an out-of-state placement\nwas appropriate and why they should not be required to proceed with\nthe process ordered by the hearing officer. In addition, the Morgans\npresented no evidence sufficient to justify their placement of Bradley\nat an out-of-state residential school for the summer of 2000. Extended\nschool year services are not necessary to a free appropriate public\neducation under the IDEA unless \"the benefits a disabled child gains\nduring a regular school year will be significantly jeopardized if he is\nnot provided with an educational program during the summer\nmonths.\" MM ex rel. DM, 303 F.3d at 537-38. And with respect to\nboth the summer placement and the proposed permanent placement\nat the Oakland School, the Morgans failed to present any evidence to\njustify the reasonableness of the costs. Finding no error below, we\naffirm.\n\n   We must note, however, that our judgment is a narrow one, ruling\nonly on the limited issues placed before us by the Morgans’ com-\nplaint. We do not have before us the issue of the appropriateness of\nany IEP that was developed or any actions taken after the due process\nhearing. Thus, we do not rule on whether, in the appropriate circum-\nstances, the Morgans might not still be entitled to some reimburse-\nment or other relief.\n\n    For the reasons given, the judgment of the district court is\n\n                                                              AFFIRMED.\n\nWILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n  Although I agree with my colleagues that VM1 has \"essentially\njumped the gun\" by failing to attend the second IEP meeting ordered\nby the hearing officer, I write separately to explain why I believe that\nVM must follow the process ordered by the hearing officer.2 I also\n    1\n     In order to protect the privacy of the minor child and his family, I\nrefer to the child as BM and the parents collectively as VM.\n   2\n     The majority styles its opinion as an affirmance of the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment, but, when a plaintiff fails to exhaust admin-\n\f             MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA                     7\nwrite to state my disagreement with the majority’s treatment of the\ndistrict court’s decision regarding VM’s claim for compensatory edu-\ncation. Additionally, because VM is likely to pursue reimbursement\nfor placing BM at the Oakland School in the future, I take this oppor-\ntunity to note the proper legal standards under the IDEA to be consid-\nered when determining if a proposed parental placement is\nappropriate.\n\n   The IDEA requires that parties exhaust their administrative reme-\ndies before filing suit. 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(i)(2) (West 2000). At oral\nargument, VM nonetheless argued that exhaustion should not be\nrequired here because the objections made to the first IEP will likely\nbe repeated during any future IEP meeting. In a similar situation, the\nTenth Circuit explained that \"nothing in the IDEA . . . states that a\nplaintiff need not exhaust administrative remedies if his objection to\na second IEP is the same as his objection to his first IEP.\" Urban v.\nJefferson County Sch. Dist. R-1, 89 F.3d 720, 725 (10th Cir. 1996).\nLikewise, even assuming VM’s objections to BM’s second IEP would\nhave been the same as the objections to the first — i.e., the IEP would\nnot recommend placement in the Oakland School — an exhaustion of\nremedies is still required.3\n\n  Because a child’s education is something near the heart of all par-\nents, a parent aggrieved by an adverse ruling in this context might\n\nistrative remedies, the typical disposition is a dismissal of the action for\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction. See MM ex rel. DM v. School Dist. of\nGreenville County, 303 F.3d 523, 536 (4th Cir. 2002). Because summary\njudgment is a ruling on the merits, affirming the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in this case may bar VM from relitigating his reim-\nbursement claim in a later action. See generally Grausz v. Englander,\n321 F.3d 467, 472 (4th Cir. 2003) (explaining that res judicata requires\na prior final decision on the merits). I believe the appropriate action, con-\nsistent with the majority’s approach, is to dismiss this action for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction\n   3\n     Although it may seem inequitable to require a second IEP meeting\nwhere a plaintiff argues that second meeting was ordered solely because\nof the legal errors made by the hearing officer when determining if the\nparental placement was proper, the IDEA does not provide an exception\nto the exhaustion requirement for this circumstance.\n\f8           MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA\nfind it difficult to understand the application of a rigid exhaustion\nrequirement when the result is a possible loss of further educational\nopportunity. The IDEA, however, provides a panoply of procedural\nsafeguards and administrative remedies based on Congress’ belief that\ncourts should not \"substitute their own notions of sound educational\npolicy for those of the school authorities which they review.\" Bd. of\nEduc. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 206 (1983). Given this Congressional\nintent, it would be improper to second-guess the school district’s deci-\nsions before they are made. If this system seems burdensome, the\nremedy lies in Congress, not the courts. Because VM \"jumped the\ngun,\" the administrative process was unable to run its course in this\ncase. I agree with the majority that VM should convene a second IEP\nmeeting with the school district, create a second IEP, and then, if the\nconcerns are not resolved, institute a civil action after that IEP is\nreviewed at a due process hearing.\n\n   As for VM’s compensatory education claim, VM has exhausted\nadministrative remedies. I thus dissent from my colleague’s failure to\naddress the district court’s disposition of this claim. Compensatory\neducation is \"educational services ordered by the court to be provided\nprospectively to compensate for a past deficient program.\" G ex rel.\nRG v. Fort Bragg Dependent Schs., 343 F.3d 295, 308 (4th Cir.\n2003). The hearing officer, in her final order, clearly stated that an\naward of compensatory education was improper and, as shown by the\nfact that the district court addressed the claim, VM’s complaint suffi-\nciently stated a request for compensatory education. Accordingly, VM\nproperly instituted a civil action on that claim. See 20 U.S.C.A.\n1415(i)(2) (West 2000); Urban, 89 F.3d at 725 (reviewing a claim for\ncompensatory services, after holding that other IDEA claims had not\nbeen exhausted).\n\n   The district court granted summary judgment on that claim, stating\nthat \"case law does not address the type of prospective relief being\nsought in this case.\" (J.A. at 586.) Unfortunately, the district court did\nnot have the benefit of our opinion in G v. Fort Bragg, 343 F.3d at\n309, at the time it issued its order. In G v. Fort Bragg, we held, in\naccord with our sister circuits, that \"the IDEA permits an award of\n[compensatory education] in some circumstances.\" Id. Because the\ndistrict court believed that claims for compensatory education were\nnot cognizable under the IDEA, the district court did not examine the\n\f             MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA                     9\nmerits of the claim, and I likewise refrain from doing so. I only note\nthat, because the hearing officer issued a final order categorically\ndenying compensatory education, VM properly exhausted the admin-\nistrative remedies with respect to that claim. I would thus reverse the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment on this claim and remand\nthe claim for further proceedings in light of G v. Fort Bragg.\n\n   Finally, because VM is likely to pursue reimbursement for private\neducational expenses in the future, and the majority opinion does not\nforeclose such a possibility, I want to address two areas where the\nlegal standards to be applied in these circumstances differ from those\ntypically employed under the IDEA.4 Reimbursement of private edu-\ncation expenses under IDEA is appropriate when the reviewing court\nfinds that: (1) the public school’s placement was not providing the\nchild with a free appropriate public education; and (2) the parents’\nalternative placement was proper under IDEA. Sch. Comm. v. Dep’t\nof Educ., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).\n\n   Congress passed the IDEA in order to give disabled and handi-\ncapped children access to public schools. See Sch. Comm., 471 U.S.\nat 373. In Carter v. Florence County Sch. Dist. Four, 950 F.2d 156,\n163 (4th Cir. 1991), aff’d on other grounds, 510 U.S. 7 (1993), how-\never, we held that, despite the congressional intent to give disabled\nchildren the ability to attend public school, the standard for determin-\ning the appropriateness of a parental placement in a private school is\nnot overly stringent. We explained \"when a public school system has\ndefaulted on its obligations under the Act, a private school placement\nis ‘proper under the Act’ if the education provided by the private\nschool is ‘reasonably calculated to enable the child to receive educa-\n  4\n    Specifically, at the due process hearing, the hearing officer cited to an\nunpublished disposition dealing with residential care outside of school,\nBoard of Educ. v. Brett Y ex rel. Mark Y, 1998 WL 390553, 155 F.3d 557\n(4th Cir. 1998), for the proposition that reimbursement was proper only\nwhere the \"educational benefits which can be provided through residen-\ntial care are essential for that child to make any progress at all.\" (J.A. at\n543.) The hearing officer also believed that the least restrictive environ-\nment test, 20 U.S.C.A. § 1412(5)(A) (West 2000), strictly applied to\nparental placements. (J.A. at 544.)\n\f10          MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA\ntional benefits,’\" Carter, 950 F.2d at 163 (quoting Rowley, 458 U.S.\nat 207), a standard not applied by the hearing officer.5\n\n   Additionally, in Carter, we expressed strong doubt as to whether\nthe least restrictive environment requirement of the IDEA, 20\nU.S.C.A. § 1412(5)(A) (West 2000), applies to parental placements.\nCarter, 950 F.2d at 160. We noted \"the school district has presented\nno evidence that the policy was meant to restrict parental options.\"\nId. (emphasis in original). Moreover, other circuits addressing the\nissue have held that the least restrictive environment requirement does\nnot apply with the same force to parental placements as it does to\nplacements advocated by school districts. See M.S. ex rel. S.S. v. Bd.\nof Educ., 231 F.3d 96, 105 (2d Cir. 2000) (stating that mainstreaming\n\"remains a consideration\" but noting that parents \"may not be subject\nto the same mainstreaming requirements\"); Cleveland Heights-\nUniversity Heights Sch. Dist. v. Boss, 144 F.3d 391, 399-400 (6th Cir.\n1998) (failure to meet mainstreaming requirements does not bar reim-\nbursement). As we have explained, \"the Act’s preference for main-\nstreaming was aimed at preventing schools from segregating\nhandicapped students from the general student body.\" Carter, 950\nF.2d at 160 (emphasis in original). Although we have not definitively\nresolved the proper role of the mainstreaming requirement when con-\nsidering parental placements, contrary to the hearing officer’s\napproach,6 it is clear that requirement should not be applied in the\nstrictest sense.\n\n   In sum, I concur in my colleague’s analysis of the reimbursement\nclaim, but I would have clarified that the appropriate disposition of\nthe claim is a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n  5\n     Instead, the hearing officer applied the standard applicable when\ndetermining whether services beyond the regular school day are appro-\npriate under the IDEA. (J.A. at 543) (citing Board of Educ. v. Brett Y ex\nrel. Mark Y, 1998 WL 390553, 155 F.3d 557 (4th Cir. 1998) (unpub-\nlished) (holding reimbursement of extended school year services proper\nwhere \"educational benefits which can be provided through residential\ncare are essential for that child to make any progress at all\").\n   6\n     The due process hearing officer strictly applied the least restrictive\nenvironment test when reviewing VM’s request for reimbursement dur-\ning the hearing. (J.A. at 544.)\n\f           MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA            11\nBecause VM did exhaust the administrative remedies with regard to\nthe claim for compensatory education, I would reverse the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment on that claim and remand for fur-\nther proceedings.\n\f",

GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA\nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in this circuit. See\nLocal Rule 36(c).\n\n\n                             OPINION\n\nPER CURIAM:\n\n   Victor and Kimberly Morgan, on behalf of their minor child Brad-\nley, who is dyslexic, commenced this action to review the decision of\na West Virginia hearing officer rejecting in part their complaint about\nthe Greenbrier County (West Virginia) Board of Education’s compli-\nance with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The Mor-\ngans contended that because an Individualized Education Program\n(\"IEP\") developed in May 2000 for Bradley’s 2000-2001 school year\nwas inappropriate under the Act, they were entitled to have Bradley\nplaced in an out-of-state private residential school and have the State\nreimburse them their annual costs of $27,800. While the hearing offi-\ncer agreed that the IEP for Bradley was inappropriate, she directed the\nMorgans to follow an administrative process for developing a new\nIEP before any out-of-state placement would be considered. The hear-\ning officer also concluded that the Morgans had failed to establish the\nneed at that time for out-of-state placement and also the reasonable-\nness of its cost.\n\n  The district court granted summary judgment for Greenbrier\nCounty, and, for the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                                   I\n\n   During the 1999-2000 school year, Bradley was in the sixth grade\nat Greenbrier County (West Virginia) Elementary School. Because\nBradley had previously been diagnosed as dyslexic, he received both\nspecial education and regular education part time.\n\n   On May 23, 2000, the Morgans and their son attended a meeting\nscheduled to develop Bradley’s 2000-2001 IEP. The Morgans were\ndissatisfied with the IEP developed, and, based both on Bradley’s past\nlack of educational progress as well as the process followed in devel-\n\f            MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA                   3\noping the IEP, they requested a due process hearing to review the\n2000-2001 IEP. At the same time, the Morgans unilaterally enrolled\nBradley in a six-week summer course at the Oakland School in Vir-\nginia, a residential school that specializes in teaching dyslexic stu-\ndents.\n\n   The due process hearing was conducted before an impartial hearing\nofficer on July 27 and 28, 2000, in Lewisburg, West Virginia, and on\nAugust 25, 2000, following the hearing, the hearing officer issued a\nlengthy written decision that included detailed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law. In her decision, the hearing officer agreed with\nthe Morgans that the IEP developed for Bradley for the 2000-2001\nschool year was not appropriate in that it was not reasonably calcu-\nlated to provide Bradley with educational benefit. While the hearing\nofficer found \"serious procedural deficiencies,\" she nonetheless con-\ncluded that these deficiencies did not cause Bradley to lose \"educa-\ntional opportunity.\" The officer noted that because the Morgans\n\"elected to file a due process [hearing request] immediately, no IEP\ncommittee meeting could be reconvened as [had been] offered by the\nCounty.\" To remedy this short-circuiting of the process, the hearing\nofficer directed that the IEP committee meet as soon as possible, but\nin any case within 15 days of its order, to prepare an appropriate IEP\nfor Bradley’s 2000-2001 school year. Moreover, the hearing officer\ndetailed the process that had to be followed. The hearing officer con-\ncluded that only if the IEP committee concluded that Greenbrier\nCounty schools could not, based on evaluations, provide Bradley with\nan educational benefit in Greenbrier County, should the IEP commit-\ntee consider residential placement as requested by the Morgans.\n\n   With respect to the Morgans’ request that Bradley be placed forth-\nwith at an out-of-state residential school, the officer concluded that\nsuch a placement was not justified, and to order such a placement\nwithout pursuing a revised IEP would ignore the Act’s requirement\nthat, \"to the greatest extent possible, children are to be educated in the\nleast restrictive environment.\" See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(5)(A). In addi-\ntion, the hearing officer pointed out that the Morgans failed to provide\nany evidence \"as to the reasonableness of the costs (approximately\n$25,000 per year) of the parents’ proposed placement.\"\n\n  Similarly, with respect to the Morgans’ request for unilateral place-\nment of Bradley at the Oakland School summer program, the officer\n\f4           MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA\nconcluded that the Morgans had not presented sufficient evidence for\nsuch a placement and for the reasonableness of its costs.\n\n   Finally the hearing officer rejected Bradley’s claim for \"compensa-\ntory education.\" Noting that compensatory education is a remedy \"oc-\ncasionally used when the County schools knew or should have known\nthat the student’s IEP was inappropriate and when the student was not\nreceiving more than de minimis educational benefit or when the\nCounty schools acted in bad faith,\" the hearing officer found that\nthose circumstances had not been demonstrated in this case. The offi-\ncer stated that the County’s conduct amounting to procedural defi-\nciencies did not \"appear to be an act of deliberate indifference\ntowards the parents’ IDEA rights.\"\n\n   The Morgans commenced this action under the IDEA, 20 U.S.C.\n§ 415(i)(2)(A), to review the hearing officer’s decision (1) to refuse\nto approve the placement of Bradley at the Oakland School for the\n2000 summer session, the 2000-2001 school year, and such years\nthereafter as necessary, and (2) to deny Bradley’s claim for reim-\nbursement for expenses incurred in sending Bradley to the Oakland\nSchool. On the motion of Greenbrier County, the district court\ngranted summary judgment to the County, essentially agreeing with\nthe hearing officer on the issues raised. From the district court’s judg-\nment, this appeal followed.\n\n                                   II\n\n   Under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\"IDEA\"),\nState eligibility for federal funding requires the State to insure that a\nfree appropriate public education is available to all disabled children\nbetween ages 3 and 21 residing in the State. 20 U.S.C.\n§ 1412(a)(1)(A). To provide a free appropriate public education to a\ndisabled student, a local educational agency must develop an appro-\npriate \"Individualized Education Program\" (\"IEP\") tailored to the\nindividual student.

She also specified the procedures that had to\nbe followed in the renewed effort. The hearing officer concluded that\nonly if the IEP committee concluded, after pursuing the specified pro-\ncedures, that Bradley would not receive educational benefit within\ncounty schools could the IEP committee consider an out-of-state\nplacement, as the Morgans requested. The Morgans have advanced no\nreason why this ruling was not appropriate and why they should not\nhave completed the specified administrative process before commenc-\ning this action. Indeed, they were essentially vindicated in their claim\nthat the original IEP was inappropriate and that a new one should be\ndeveloped. Accordingly, we find no error by the district court’s affir-\nmance of this ruling.\n\n   With respect to the Morgans’ claims that Bradley should be placed\nat an out-of-state residential school and that the State should reim-\nburse the Morgans for the cost, we agree with the district court and\n\f6            MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA\nthe hearing officer that the Morgans have essentially jumped the gun.\nThey have failed to demonstrate why only an out-of-state placement\nwas appropriate and why they should not be required to proceed with\nthe process ordered by the hearing officer. In addition, the Morgans\npresented no evidence sufficient to justify their placement of Bradley\nat an out-of-state residential school for the summer of 2000. Extended\nschool year services are not necessary to a free appropriate public\neducation under the IDEA unless \"the benefits a disabled child gains\nduring a regular school year will be significantly jeopardized if he is\nnot provided with an educational program during the summer\nmonths.\" MM ex rel. DM, 303 F.3d at 537-38. And with respect to\nboth the summer placement and the proposed permanent placement\nat the Oakland School, the Morgans failed to present any evidence to\njustify the reasonableness of the costs. Finding no error below, we\naffirm.\n\n   We must note, however, that our judgment is a narrow one, ruling\nonly on the limited issues placed before us by the Morgans’ com-\nplaint. We do not have before us the issue of the appropriateness of\nany IEP that was developed or any actions taken after the due process\nhearing. Thus, we do not rule on whether, in the appropriate circum-\nstances, the Morgans might not still be entitled to some reimburse-\nment or other relief.\n\n    For the reasons given, the judgment of the district court is\n\n                                                              AFFIRMED.\n\nWILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part:\n\n  Although I agree with my colleagues that VM1 has \"essentially\njumped the gun\" by failing to attend the second IEP meeting ordered\nby the hearing officer, I write separately to explain why I believe that\nVM must follow the process ordered by the hearing officer.2 I also\n    1\n     In order to protect the privacy of the minor child and his family, I\nrefer to the child as BM and the parents collectively as VM.\n   2\n     The majority styles its opinion as an affirmance of the district court’s\ngrant of summary judgment, but, when a plaintiff fails to exhaust admin-\n\f             MORGAN v.

Additionally, because VM is likely to pursue reimbursement\nfor placing BM at the Oakland School in the future, I take this oppor-\ntunity to note the proper legal standards under the IDEA to be consid-\nered when determining if a proposed parental placement is\nappropriate.\n\n   The IDEA requires that parties exhaust their administrative reme-\ndies before filing suit. 20 U.S.C.A. § 1415(i)(2) (West 2000). At oral\nargument, VM nonetheless argued that exhaustion should not be\nrequired here because the objections made to the first IEP will likely\nbe repeated during any future IEP meeting. In a similar situation, the\nTenth Circuit explained that \"nothing in the IDEA . . . states that a\nplaintiff need not exhaust administrative remedies if his objection to\na second IEP is the same as his objection to his first IEP.\" Urban v.\nJefferson County Sch. Dist. R-1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"153661\"><a href=\"/opinion/153661/urban-v-jefferson-co-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 725 (10th Cir. 1996).\nLikewise, even assuming VM’s objections to BM’s second IEP would\nhave been the same as the objections to the first — i.e., the IEP would\nnot recommend placement in the Oakland School — an exhaustion of\nremedies is still required.3\n\n  Because a child’s education is something near the heart of all par-\nents, a parent aggrieved by an adverse ruling in this context might\n\nistrative remedies, the typical disposition is a dismissal of the action for\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction. See MM ex rel. DM v. School Dist. of\nGreenville County, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779115\"><a href=\"/opinion/779115/mm-a-minor-by-and-through-her-parents-dm-and-em-and-on-their-own-behalf/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">523</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 536 (4th Cir. 2002). Because summary\njudgment is a ruling on the merits, affirming the district court’s grant of\nsummary judgment in this case may bar VM from relitigating his reim-\nbursement claim in a later action. See generally Grausz v. Englander,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781060\"><a href=\"/opinion/781060/henry-grausz-md-v-bradford-f-englander-linowes-and-blocher-llp/\"><span class=\"volume\">321</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 472 (4th Cir. 2003) (explaining that res judicata requires\na prior final decision on the merits). I believe the appropriate action, con-\nsistent with the majority’s approach, is to dismiss this action for lack of\nsubject matter jurisdiction\n   3\n     Although it may seem inequitable to require a second IEP meeting\nwhere a plaintiff argues that second meeting was ordered solely because\nof the legal errors made by the hearing officer when determining if the\nparental placement was proper, the IDEA does not provide an exception\nto the exhaustion requirement for this circumstance.\n\f8           MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA\nfind it difficult to understand the application of a rigid exhaustion\nrequirement when the result is a possible loss of further educational\nopportunity. The IDEA, however, provides a panoply of procedural\nsafeguards and administrative remedies based on Congress’ belief that\ncourts should not \"substitute their own notions of sound educational\npolicy for those of the school authorities which they review.\" Bd. of\nEduc. v. Rowley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110774\"><a href=\"/opinion/110774/hendrick-hudson-dist-bd-of-ed-v-rowley/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">176</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206 (1983). Given this Congressional\nintent, it would be improper to second-guess the school district’s deci-\nsions before they are made. If this system seems burdensome, the\nremedy lies in Congress, not the courts. Because VM \"jumped the\ngun,\" the administrative process was unable to run its course in this\ncase. I agree with the majority that VM should convene a second IEP\nmeeting with the school district, create a second IEP, and then, if the\nconcerns are not resolved, institute a civil action after that IEP is\nreviewed at a due process hearing.\n\n   As for VM’s compensatory education claim, VM has exhausted\nadministrative remedies. I thus dissent from my colleague’s failure to\naddress the district court’s disposition of this claim. Compensatory\neducation is \"educational services ordered by the court to be provided\nprospectively to compensate for a past deficient program.\" G ex rel.\nRG v. Fort Bragg Dependent Schs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">295</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (4th Cir.\n2003). The hearing officer, in her final order, clearly stated that an\naward of compensatory education was improper and, as shown by the\nfact that the district court addressed the claim, VM’s complaint suffi-\nciently stated a request for compensatory education. Accordingly, VM\nproperly instituted a civil action on that claim. See 20 U.S.C.A.\n1415(i)(2) (West 2000); Urban, 89 F.3d at 725 (reviewing a claim for\ncompensatory services, after holding that other IDEA claims had not\nbeen exhausted).\n\n   The district court granted summary judgment on that claim, stating\nthat \"case law does not address the type of prospective relief being\nsought in this case.\" (J.A. at 586.) Unfortunately, the district court did\nnot have the benefit of our opinion in G v. Fort Bragg, 343 F.3d at\n309, at the time it issued its order. In G v. Fort Bragg, we held, in\naccord with our sister circuits, that \"the IDEA permits an award of\n[compensatory education] in some circumstances.\" Id. Because the\ndistrict court believed that claims for compensatory education were\nnot cognizable under the IDEA, the district court did not examine the\n\f             MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA                     9\nmerits of the claim, and I likewise refrain from doing so. I only note\nthat, because the hearing officer issued a final order categorically\ndenying compensatory education, VM properly exhausted the admin-\nistrative remedies with respect to that claim. I would thus reverse the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment on this claim and remand\nthe claim for further proceedings in light of G v. Fort Bragg.\n\n   Finally, because VM is likely to pursue reimbursement for private\neducational expenses in the future, and the majority opinion does not\nforeclose such a possibility, I want to address two areas where the\nlegal standards to be applied in these circumstances differ from those\ntypically employed under the IDEA.4 Reimbursement of private edu-\ncation expenses under IDEA is appropriate when the reviewing court\nfinds that: (1) the public school’s placement was not providing the\nchild with a free appropriate public education; and (2) the parents’\nalternative placement was proper under IDEA.

Mark Y, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">390553</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">155</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1998) (unpub-\nlished) (holding reimbursement of extended school year services proper\nwhere \"educational benefits which can be provided through residential\ncare are essential for that child to make any progress at all\").\n   6\n     The due process hearing officer strictly applied the least restrictive\nenvironment test when reviewing VM’s request for reimbursement dur-\ning the hearing. (J.A. at 544.)\n\f           MORGAN v. GREENBRIER COUNTY WEST VIRGINIA            11\nBecause VM did exhaust the administrative remedies with regard to\nthe claim for compensatory education, I would reverse the district\ncourt’s grant of summary judgment on that claim and remand for fur-\nther proceedings.\n\f</pre>",
