After the Congregation entered\ninto an agreement of sale with the Sisters of Nazareth, the\ncurrent owners of the property, it sought zoning approval\nfrom the Township Zoning Hearing Board (\"ZHB\") seeking\neither a variance or a special exception, and alternatively,\npermission to use the property as an existing non-\nconforming use. When the Congregation’s application was\ndenied by the ZHB, the Congregation, along with its Rabbi,\nElliot Holin, filed suit in the District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania against the ZHB, Abington\nTownship, its Board of Commissioners, and its Director of\nCode Enforcement in both his individual and official\ncapacities, seeking injunctive, declaratory and\ncompensatory relief for alleged civil rights violations\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 1983. The complaint also alleged a\nviolation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. S 2000 et seq.; the\nMunicipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. S 11001A-11005A;\nArticle I, sections 3, 7, 20 and 26 of the Pennsylvania\nConstitution; and the First and Fourteenth Amendments of\nthe United States Constitution. [1a-20a].\n\nCentral to the case are certain provisions of the Abington\nTownship Zoning Ordinance whose purpose, under a 1996\nAmendment, is \"to provide low density, single family,\nneighborhoods.\" Under the Ordinance, the R-1 Residential\nDistrict only permits a handful of uses by right: agriculture,\nlivestock, single family detached dwellings, and\nconservation and recreation preserve. Similarly, the\nOrdinance only permits a handful of uses by \"special\nexception,\" including a kennel, riding academy, municipal\ncomplex, outdoor recreation, emergency services, and utility\n\n                                4\n\n\nfacilities. The Ordinance does not permit churches or other\nreligious institutions in R-1, except those that are legal,\nnonconforming uses, even by special exception. Nor does it\nallow a myriad of other uses such as schools, hospitals,\ntheaters, and daycare centers in R-1 Residential Districts.\nThese uses are, however, permitted in other districts in the\nTownship.\n\nThe Congregation moved for partial summary judgment\non its claim that the Ordinance is unreasonable on its face\nbecause it prohibits houses of worship from locating in\nresidential neighborhoods. The District Court granted the\nCongregation’s motion, finding instead that the Ordinance,\nas applied, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\fUnited States Constitution. The Court reasoned that a\n\"house of worship inherently further[s] the public welfare,\"\nand that the Township had no rational reason to allow\nsome uses by special exception, such as a country club\nsubsumed under \"outdoor recreation,\" but not the\nCongregation. The Court granted injunctive relief, ordering\nthe ZHB to conduct hearings on the Congregation’s\napplication for a special exception. The Court denied the\nTownship’s motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe Township appealed, and asked for a stay of the\ninjunction, both in the District Court and in this Court, but\nthose applications were also denied. The ZHB held the\nspecial exception hearing and concluded that the proposed\nuse would not \"adversely affect the health, safety and\nwelfare of the community,\" and that the use was\n\"consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the\nOrdinance.\" [3907a]. These are the requirements for a\nspecial exception, which must be awarded if they are met.\nThe ZHB thus granted the Congregation a special exception\nwith some limitations aimed at traffic, light pollution, and\nnoise. [3907a-3909a]. Since then, the Township has also\napproved the Congregation’s land development plan. The\nCongregation, however, has not begun building on the\nproperty; it awaits the outcome of the appeal brought in\nthis Court, and one brought in the Montgomery County\nCourt of Common Pleas by neighbors who oppose the\nsynagogue use. For reasons explained at length infra, given\nthe tenor of the District Court’s holding, which functionally\n\n                                5\n\n\naltered the Township’s zoning ordinance and poses a\ncontinuing burden on its enforcement, we conclude that the\ngrant of the special exception did not moot the case, hence\nwe reject the Congregation’s mootness argument.\n\nThe District Court’s holding of unconstitutionality rested\non its reading of City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,\n473 U.S. 432 (1985), where the Supreme Court concluded\nthat similarly situated group homes were impermissibly\ntreated differently because one home’s occupants were\nmentally handicapped. The District Court in effect read City\nof Cleburne as standing for the proposition that a\nmunicipality’s decision to distinguish between land uses is\nnot rational if both uses, permitted and not-permitted, have\nthe same impact on the municipality’s asserted goals. In so\nconcluding, the District Court overlooked the threshold step\nthat must be taken under the City of Cleburne analysis--\nthe court must first conclude that the two land uses are\n\"similarly situated.\"\n\nThe Township submits that the Congregation’s use is\ndifferent from the other uses permitted by special\nexception. It also contends that it had good reason to group\nchurches and other religious institutions in the CS-\nCommunity Service District with other institutional uses,\nsuch as hospitals and schools, and that it was not\nirrational to allow outdoor recreation and certain other uses\n\fin the R-1 Residential District (by special exception). The\nTownship invokes the well-established principle that, in the\nfederal Constitutional universe, federal courts accord\nsubstantial deference to local government in setting land\nuse policy, and that only where a local government’s\ndistinction between similarly situated uses is not rationally\nrelated to a legitimate state goal, or where the goal itself is\nnot legitimate, will a federal court upset a local\ngovernment’s land use policy determination. It argues that\nthe distinction between religious uses and other uses is not\nonly rational, but that under the District Court’s analysis,\nany use, or at least any religious use with a similar impact,\ncan automatically locate in the R-1 Residential District with\nspecial exception thereby giving a preference to religion, in\ncontradiction of the principles of local land use law.\n\n                                  6\n\n\nThe Township’s arguments are forceful, but we will not\nresolve them here, because the District Court did not\naddress the similarity of uses question, and the Abington\nOrdinance is not so clearly drafted that we may definitively\ndetermine what uses are permitted by special exception on\nour own. Put differently, because the District Court failed to\nevaluate whether the Congregation was similarly situated,\ni.e., similar in \"kind,\" to the uses that are currently\npermitted in the R-1 Residential District, we must vacate its\norder and remand so that the proper inquiry may be\nconducted. Since the special exception hearing was held\npursuant to an improper order by the District Court, the\nresulting grant of special exception by the ZHB and the\nland use permit issued by the Township are null and void.\n\nI. Facts and Procedural History\n\nThe Congregation is a Reform Jewish Synagogue,\nfounded in 1994, which conducts religious services, Hebrew\nclasses, and other related activities at various locations in\neastern Montgomery County. The Township is a political\nsubdivision located in eastern Montgomery County. It\noperates pursuant to the First Class Township Code of\nPennsylvania, 53 P.S. S 55101 et seq., and with respect to\nzoning, subdivision and land use matters, in accordance\nwith Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S.\nS 101 01 et seq. The ZHB has jurisdiction to hear and\nrender final adjudication on, inter alia, applications by\nlandowners for variances from and special exceptions under\nthe Township’s Zoning Ordinance. The ZHB and the\nTownship are separate entities. As we understand the\npractice, the Township does not customarily appear before\nthe ZHB to state a position on an application, although it\nis not foreclosed from doing so.\n\nA. The History of the Relevant Zoning Ordinance\n\nIn 1977, The Township developed a Comprehensive Plan\nfor development within the Township. [337a]. As part of this\nComprehensive Plan, The Township enacted Ordinance No.\n1469, which established a \"V-Residence\" District. Article III,\n\fS 301. [477a, 512a]. In the V-Residence District, pursuant\n\n                                7\n\n\nto S 301.2, certain uses were permitted as of right: single-\nfamily detached dwellings, tilling of the soil, township\nadministrative buildings, public libraries, public parks, play\nor recreational areas, or any similar uses operated by the\nTownship or other governmental agencies. [512a]. Other\nuses, such as churches, rectories, parish houses, convents,\nmonasteries and other similar institutions, were permitted\nas \"special exceptions\"; the ZHB may grant a\"special\nexception\" to certain predetermined uses and in so doing it\nmay attach conditions to the grant of the exception in order\nto preserve the purpose of the zoning ordinance.\n\nOn March 8, 1990, The Township enacted Ordinance No.\n1676, which amended S 301.2 of Ordinance No. 1469 (the\n\"V-Residence District\"). [806a]. The amendment, as it\npertains to the issues in this case, eliminated all uses by\nright except single-family detached dwellings, and accessory\nuses on the same lot that are customarily incidental to\nsingle-family dwellings. [806a]. All of the uses previously\npermitted by special exception, including \"religious\" uses,\nwere eliminated. The purpose of this amendment, as stated\nin the \"Legislative Intent\" of the Ordinance, was to create a\n\"low density\" area for single-family detached dwelling units.\n[806a].\n\nOn May 9, 1996, The Township re-classified its zoning\nordinances pursuant to Ordinance No. 1753 (the\n\"Ordinance\"). [977a]. This Ordinance changed the\ndesignation of The Township’s \"low density residential\ndistrict\" from V-Residence to R-1 Residential.[999a].\nSection 301 of the Ordinance permitted the following uses\nin R-1 by right: agriculture, livestock, single family\ndetached dwellings, conservation and recreation preserve.\n[1000a]. Uses permitted by special exception include:\nkennel (defined at 1074a), riding academy, municipal\ncomplex (defined [at 1094a] to include municipal\nadministration buildings, libraries, police barracks, or road\nmaintenance facilities), outdoor recreation (defined in\nArticle IV, section 706(G)(6) of the 1996 Ordinance to\ninclude \"public or private miniature golf courses, swimming\npools, ball courts, tennis courts, ball fields, trails, and\nsimilar uses, . . . [o]utdoor recreation shall[also] include\nany accessory use, such as snack bar, pro shops, club\n\n                                8\n\n\nhouses, country clubs\"), emergency services, and utility\nfacilities (defined [at 1108a] to include, inter alia, train\nstations and bus shelters). The stated purpose of the R-1\nResidential District was \"to provide low density, single\nfamily, neighborhoods.\" [1000a].\n\nChurches and other religious institutions, except those\nthat are legal, nonconforming uses, are not permitted in\n\fR-1 Residential Districts.1 Although religious institutions\nare not explicitly excluded by the language of the\nOrdinance, they are de jure excluded from that particular\nzone because they are not specifically listed among the uses\nthat may apply for special exceptions. Apparently, the only\noption for a religious institution wishing to locate in an R-1\nResidential District is to apply for a variance with the ZHB.\nAccording to the Ordinance, a variance is a \"grant of\nrelaxation by the [ZHB] from the dimensional and use\nregulations of th[e] Ordinance, when such action will not be\nconsidered contrary to the public interest, and where,\nowing to conditions unique to the property, and not\nresulting from the actions or situation of the applicant, a\nliteral enforcement of this code would result in undue and\nunnecessary hardship.\" [997a].\n\nThe variance standard is very different from the special\nexception standard because it requires the applicant to\ndemonstrate \"unnecessary hardship,\" which requires\nevidence that: \"(1) the physical features of the property are\nsuch that it cannot be used for a permitted purpose; or (2)\nthat the property can be conformed for a permitted use only\nat a prohibitive expense; or (3) that the property has no\nvalue for any purpose permitted by the zoning ordinance.\"\nHertzberg v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment, 554 Pa. 249, 721\nA.2d 43, 47 (1998). In contrast, for an application to merit\na special exception, it need only establish that the zoning\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. A non-conforming use is defined as: \"A building, lot, structure, sign or\nuse, which lawfully existed prior to the adoption, revision or amendment\nof this Ordinance, but does not comply with zoning use or district\nregulations by reasons of adoption, revision, or amendment of this\nOrdinance.\" [993a; see also 1191a]. Of the 36 churches and synagogues\ncurrently operating in the Township, 29 of them are legal, non-\nconforming uses outside of the CS, M, and A-O Districts. 25 of those\nplaces of worship are located in residential districts.\n\n                                9\n\n\nordinance allows the use and that the particular use\napplied for is consistent with the public interest. Ryan,\nPennsylvania Zoning Law and Practice, Vol. 2 SS 5.1.2,\n6.1.5; Heck v. Zoning Hearing Bd., 39 Pa. Commw. 570, 397\nA.2d 15 (1979). If that showing is made, the special\nexception must be granted, though appropriate conditions\nmay be attached.\n\nReligious institutions are permitted in the Township\nunder the Ordinance in the CS-Community Service District.\n[1024a]. In fact, the CS-District was specifically designed to\nprovide for, inter alia, the religious needs of the Township\ncommunity. [1024a]. The Township has provided for other\ninstitutional uses that are excluded from the R-1\nResidential District in the CS-District, including hospitals,\nschools, and community service centers. Religious\ninstitutions are also permitted in the M-Mixed Use District\n[1028a], and, by special exception, in the A-O\nApartment/Office District. [1019a].\n\fB. The History of the Property At Issue\n\nThe real property in question is located at 1908 Robert\nRoad and is zoned R-1 Residential. [298a]. It consists of a\n10.9-acre parcel of land, on which there are several\nbuildings. Prior to 1951, the property was a 38-acre piece\nof land used as a residence by a family. At that time, there\nwere three buildings on the 10.9 acres which are the\nsubject of this lawsuit: a three-story masonry residence, a\ndetached garage, and a two-story auxiliary residence, all\nconstructed in the mid-twenties. [292a].\n\nIn 1951, the property was purchased by the Sisters of\nNazareth, an Order of Roman Catholic Nuns. The Sisters\nconstructed additions as well as other buildings, including\na chapel and a 13,300 square foot main building.[292a].\nThe property was used as a convent, [292a], and at its\npeak, it was home to over 80 Sisters. [292a]. The nuns used\nthe convent to receive daily instruction on religious life,\nengaging in prayer for up to two and a half hours per day.\n[305a]. The Sisters had only limited contact with the\noutside world; visitors to the property were limited to\nvisiting on special occasions, and visits would not occur\n\n                                10\n\n\nmore than twice per year. [305a]. Ceremonies and religious\nservices were rarely attended by persons other than the\nSisters and their relatives. [305a]. On a daily basis, the\naverage number of vehicles parked at the property was five,\nand the primary use of the property was as a residence.\n[305a].\n\nUntil 1988, the 38-acre parcel had direct access to Valley\nRoad, a major road in The Township, by means of a long\ndriveway. In 1988, however, the Sisters subdivided the\nparcel and sold off nearly 28 acres as residential property,\nleaving the 10.9-acre plot before us, but relinquishing\ndirect access to Valley Road. Then, in 1995, due to a\ndecline in the number of nuns on the property, the Sisters\nleased the property to a community of Greek Orthodox\nMonks for religious services, family retreats, religious\nstudy, and prayer. [293a, 307a]. Since the 1990\namendments had removed religious uses from the list of\nuses permitted by special exception, the Monks filed an\napplication with the ZHB seeking a variance from the\nOrdinance to use the property as a monastery. The ZHB\ngranted this request, with certain conditions. [291a]. One of\nthe conditions was that the property deed be restricted to\nprevent further subdivision, and that a driveway be\nconstructed off of Robert Road (a 30-foot wide cul-de-sac\nroad). A stone driveway off of Robert Road is currently the\nonly access to the property. The surrounding area is\ncompletely residential, consisting of well-kept single-family\nhomes on large plots abutting shady streets. The immediate\nblock from which the driveway extends ends in a cul-de-\nsac.\n\fC. History of the Current Litigation\n\nIn August 1999, the Congregation entered into an\nagreement with the Sisters to purchase the property, and to\nuse it as a place for worship. [304a]. The Congregation filed\nan application with the ZHB, seeking to use the property as\nan existing non conforming use, or for a variance, or special\nexception. [2795a]. The Congregation proposed the\nfollowing regularly scheduled uses: (1) Shabbat services on\nalternate Fridays and Saturdays for up to an hour and a\nhalf; (2) Hebrew classes on Wednesdays from 4pm to 8pm;\n\n                                11\n\n\nand (3) religious classes for 2 hours on Sunday mornings.\n[1360a-1368a]. Other uses would include four High Holy\nDay services in the fall, religious meetings, Bar and Bat\nMitzvah services, outdoor wedding ceremonies, and other\nsimilar celebrations and receptions to follow. [1369a-1379a,\n1435a]. As part of its proposal, the Congregation sought\npermission to change the driveways, roadways, and parking\nlots on the property. [2798a].\n\nThe ZHB rejected the Congregation’s application,\nconcluding that the principal use of the property by the\nSisters was residential, and that the chapel was an\naccessory use to the property. The ZHB further noted that\nthe principal use by the Monks was also residential. The\nZHB concluded that the use of the property by the Sisters\nwas as a residential use in the V-Residential District, which\nwas lawfully permitted there. The ZHB ruled that if the use\nby the Sisters was non-conforming, the Sisters had\nabandoned the non-conforming use by filing a preliminary\nsubdivision plan (and by its subsequent approval) but that,\nat all events, the grant of a variance to the Monks\nextinguished any non-conforming use. Since the\nCongregation’s proposed use of the property was for\nreligious not residential purposes, there was no continuing\nnon-conforming use from the Sisters or the Monks. Since\nreligious institutions are not permitted in the R-1\nResidential District, the ZHB denied the request for\ncontinuation as a non-conforming use.\n\nThe ZHB also concluded that the Congregation had failed\nto show that it was entitled to a variance because there\nwere no unique physical features of the property that would\npreclude it from being used as zoned, and that the\nCongregation had failed to demonstrate unnecessary\nhardship. In so concluding, the ZHB observed that the\nOrdinance does not impose a substantial burden on the\nreligious exercise of any person because religious\ninstitutions are permitted in three other zoning districts\nwithin the Township. [297a-320a].\n\nThe Congregation had the right to file an appeal to the\nCourt of Common Pleas of Montgomery County to challenge\nthe ZHB’s decision. Instead, the Congregation filed the\npresent lawsuit in the District Court for the Eastern District\n\f                                12\n\n\nof Pennsylvania, seeking injunctive, declaratory and\ncompensatory relief for: alleged civil rights violations\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 1983; violation of the Religious\nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42\nU.S.C. S 2000 et seq.; the Municipalities Planning Code, 53\nP.S. S 11001A-11005A; Article I, sections 3, 7, 20 and 26 of\nthe Pennsylvania Constitution; and the First and\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\n[1a-29a].\n\nThe Congregation moved for partial summary judgment\non its claim that the Ordinance is unreasonable on its face\nbecause it prohibits houses of worship from locating in\nresidential neighborhoods. Essentially, this was a challenge\nto the facial validity of the Ordinance based on both state\nand federal constitutional law; the Congregation did not\nargue or present evidence that the Ordinance was\nunconstitutional as applied. The District Court granted the\nCongregation’s motion for partial summary judgment. In so\ndoing, the Court declined to rule on the facial validity of the\nOrdinance. Instead, based on the argument presented in\nthe Township’s cross-motion for summary judgment, the\nCourt concluded that the Ordinance, as applied, violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the United States\nConstitution. Congregation Kol Ami v. Abington Township,\n161 F. Supp.2d 432, 435-37 (E.D.Pa. 2001).\n\nThe Court relied on the Supreme Court’s decision in City\nof Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, 473 U.S. 432 (1985),\nwhich applied rational basis review to a zoning ordinance\nthat required special-use permits to operate group homes\nfor the mentally handicapped but not similar homes for\nother occupants, such as senior citizens and fraternities.\nThe critical portions of the District Court’s ruling were\nterse. First, it explained the relevance of Cleburne:\n\n       In that case, just as in the instant case, the defendant\n       city argued that the ordinance was aimed at avoiding\n       concentration of population and at lessening\n       congestion of the streets. However, the Court\n       concluded that \"these concerns obviously fail to explain\n       why apartment houses, fraternity and sorority houses,\n       hospitals and the like, may freely locate in the area\n       without a permit.\"\n\n                                13\n\n\nCongregation Kol Ami, 161 F. Supp.2d at 436 (quoting\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 450). In so doing, (here and later), the\nCourt looked to only part of the analysis in Cleburne for the\nproposition that a zoning ordinance is not rational when\nthe impact of permitted and non-permitted uses is similar.\n\nThe Court then went on to state:\n\n       Not only does a house of worship inherently further the\n\f       public welfare, but defendants’ traffic, noise and light\n       concerns also exist for the uses currently allowed to\n       request a special exception. Indeed, there can be no\n       rational reason to allow a train station, bus shelter,\n       municipal administration building, police barrack,\n       library, snack bar, pro shop, club house, country club\n       or other similar use to request a special exception\n       under the 1996 Ordinance, but not Kol Ami. Because\n       the ZHB failed to consider whether traffic, noise, light\n       or other disruptions warrant the denial of a special\n       exception, and failed to apply the 1996 Ordinance in a\n       way that accounts for that Ordinance’s differing\n       treatment of Kol Ami from the other permitted uses by\n       special exception, the Court finds that defendants\n       denied plaintiffs rights secured by the Constitution.\n\nCongregation Kol Ami, 161 F. Supp.2d at 437. These\nstatements were made without elaboration or citation.\nHowever, in their wake the Court granted injunctive relief to\nthe Congregation, ordering the ZHB to conduct hearings on\nthe Congregation’s application for a special exception. The\nTownship moved for reconsideration, which was denied.\n\nThe Township appealed and asked for a stay of the\ninjunction, both in the District Court and in this Court, but\nthese applications were denied. The ZHB held the special\nexception hearing between August 6 and August 9, 2001.\nOn August 15, 2001, it concluded that the use would not\n\"adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the\ncommunity,\" and that it was \"consistent with the spirit,\npurpose, and intent of the Ordinance.\" [3907a]. Thus, the\nZHB allowed the use by the Congregation, albeit with some\nlimitations aimed at traffic, light pollution, and noise.\n[3907a-3909a]. Since then, The Township has also\napproved the Congregation’s land development plan.\n\n                                14\n\n\nHowever, the Congregation has not begun construction as\nit awaits the result of the appeals in this Court, and by\nneighbors in the Court of Common Pleas. See\nhttp://www.rluipa.com/cases/KolAmi.html.\n\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. S 1292(a)(1).\nWe review the grant of summary judgment de novo . See\nOlson v. General Electric Astrospace, 101 F.3d 947, 951 (3d\nCir. 1996). We apply the same standard as the District\nCourt in determining whether summary judgment was\nappropriate. Michael v. Shiley, Inc., 46 F.3d 1316, 1321 (3d\nCir. 1995). Summary judgment should be granted when\nthere are no genuine issues of material fact. Fed. R. Civ. P.\n56(c). An issue is genuine if a reasonable jury could\npossibly hold in the nonmovant’s favor on that issue. Boyle\nv. County of Allegheny Pennsylvania, 139 F.3d 387, 393 (3d\nCir. 1998).\n\nII. Mootness\n\nAs a preliminary matter, we must address the\n\fCongregation’s argument that in view of the fact that the\nZHB has granted a special exception, there is no\nmeaningful relief that this court can give, and that the case\nis therefore moot. \"A case is moot when issues presented\nare no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable\ninterest in the outcome.\" Erie v. Pap’s A.M. , 529 U.S. 277,\n287 (2000) (internal citations omitted); see also Harris v.\nCity of Philadelphia, 47 F.3d 1311, 1326 (3d Cir. 1995) (\"As\na general principle, once a party has complied with a court\norder or injunction, and has not been penalized or suffered\nany prejudice that could be remedied on appeal, the appeal\nis moot,\" but also stating that a case is not moot where\nthere exists a \" ‘subject matter upon which the judgment of\nthe court can operate’ to make a substantive determination\non the merits.\") (internal citation omitted).\n\nThe Congregation argues that the Township’s appeal of\nthe District Court’s July 20, 2001 Order granting injunctive\nrelief became moot on August 15, 2001, the day on which\nthe Township fully complied with that Order by holding a\nhearing and issuing a written decision on the\nCongregation’s special exception application. In its\n\n                                15\n\n\nsubmission, once the special exception hearing was held,\nthe injunctive relief ordered by the District Court was fully\nexecuted and could not be undone. To properly address\nthis contention we must assess the character of the District\nCourt’s ruling and its effect on the parties.\n\nUnder the Ordinance, places of worship are not among\nthe uses that are permitted to apply for a special exception.\nSuch an omission is a de jure exclusion of that use from\nthe R-1 Residential District. In its opinion, the District\nCourt took note of the ZHB’s failure to specifically address\nplaintiffs’ request for a special exception, the ZHB’s\nconclusion that the Abington Ordinance does not permit\nplaces of worship to locate in an R-1 district, and its\nconclusion that the Ordinance does not specifically allow a\nspecial exception for places of worship. The Court then\nreasoned that a \"house of worship inherently further[s] the\npublic welfare,\" and that the Township had no rational\nreason to allow some uses by special exception, such as a\ncountry club [subsumed under \"outdoor recreation],\" but\nnot the Congregation. Congregation Kol Ami, 161 F.\nSupp.2d at 437.\n\nThe District Court’s conclusion appears to be a blanket\ndetermination that, as a category, places of worship cannot\nbe excluded from residential districts. In combination with\nthe Court’s Order requiring the ZHB to hold a special\nexception hearing, the Court functionally altered The\nTownship’s Ordinance in two ways. First, it gave the ZHB\nauthority it did not otherwise possess--the authority to\nentertain a request for a special exception by a place of\nworship in an R-1 Residential District. Prior to the District\nCourt’s Order, the only means for a place of worship to\nobtain permission to locate in the R-1 Residential District\n\fwas by way of a variance. By permitting places of worship\nto apply for a special exception, the District Court altered\nthe standard of proof that the Congregation must meet in\norder to obtain approval from the ZHB by removing the\nmuch more onerous requirement that the Congregation\nprove \"unnecessary hardship.\"\n\nAs previously mentioned, in order to prove \"unnecessary\nhardship\" an applicant must demonstrate that the land\ncannot be used for a permitted purpose, that converting the\n\n                                16\n\n\nland so that it may be used for a permitted purpose is\nprohibitively expensive, or that the property has no value\nfor any of the permitted purposes. In contrast, in order for\nan application to get a special exception, it need only\nestablish that the zoning ordinance allows the use and that\nthe particular use applied for is consistent with the public\ninterest. Ryan, Pennsylvania Zoning Law and Practice, Vol.\n2 SS 5.1.2, 6.1.5; Heck v. Zoning Hearing Bd., supra.\nMoreover, if a party meets the requirements of a special\nexception, the ZHB does not have discretion to deny the\nspecial exception -- it must be granted. Thus, the District\nCourt’s determination allows religious institutions to get\npermission to locate in the R-1 Residential District under a\nburden of proof significantly lower than that required under\nthe Ordinance.\n\nSecond, the Court’s categorical determination that\nhouses of worship further the public interest opened the\ndoor for other places of worship to request the same\ntreatment -- a special exception hearing in residential\nzones where they are currently excluded. Supreme Court\nprecedent is clear that the First Amendment prohibits\nmunicipalities from applying their laws differently among\nvarious religious groups. See, e.g., Larson v. Valente, 456\nU.S. 228 (1982) (finding state statute that regulated\ncharitable solicitations preferred one denomination over\nanother and therefore violated the Establishment Clause);\nFowler v. Rhode Island, 345 U.S. 67 (1957) (holding\napplication of ordinance that prohibited preaching in public\nparks only against Jehovah’s Witnesses but not other\nministers violated First and Fourteenth Amendments).\nFurther, discrimination against a future similarly situated\nreligious landowner would be a clear violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause. See, e.g., Cleburne, supra; Cornerstone\nBible Church v. Hastings, 948 F.2d 464 (8th Cir. 1991). As\na result, the District Court’s determination altered\nAbington’s zoning plan by giving the ZHB authority to grant\na special exception to places of worship in an R-1\nResidential District not only in this case, but also in future\nsituations where a place of worship seeks to locate in such\na district.\n\nThese effects, which operate by virtue of the precedential\n\n                                17\n\feffect of the District Court’s opinion (unless reversed on\nappeal), impose a burden on the Township. As long as a\ngovernment is saddled with an \"ongoing injury\" caused by\na judgment that its law is unconstitutional, the case is not\nmoot. Erie, 529 U.S. at 288. In Erie, the owner of a nude\ndancing establishment prevailed in the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court, which found the aspect of a city ordinance\nbanning nude dancing unconstitutional under the First\nAmendment. Before the U.S. Supreme Court heard the\ncity’s appeal, however, the owner ceased to offer nude\ndancing at his establishment and therefore argued that the\ncase was moot. Id. at 286-87. The Court disagreed and\nconcluded that the city suffered an \"ongoing injury because\nit is barred from enforcing the public nudity provisions of\nits ordinance.\" Id. at 288. Such is the case here, where\nAbington is barred from enforcing its zoning ordinance as\nwritten. Thus, we conclude that Abington has \"suffered . . .\nprejudice\" as a result of complying with the District Court’s\nOrder, and that there is an ongoing injury that can be\nremedied on appeal. Harris, 47 F.3d at 1326; see also 13A\nCharles A. Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure\nS 3533.10 (1984).2\n\nThe Congregation makes much of the fact that the\nDistrict Court did not order the ZHB to grant the special\nexception, but only required it to hold a hearing. That is,\nbecause the ZHB’s determination to grant the special\nexception is said to have been \"voluntary,\" the Congregation\nsubmits that we do not have any power to undo what has\nbeen \"voluntarily\" done. We disagree. This argument\noverlooks the fact that the ZHB was completely without\nauthority to consider the request for a special exception\nabsent the District Court’s Order, which compelled it to do\nso. We conclude that the District Court’s Order requiring\nthe hearing, but not a particular outcome, is not a\njurisdictional obstacle, and that this appeal is not moot.\nHence, we turn to the merits.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Additionally, the neighbors residing near the proposed site are also\naggrieved by the District Court’s decision, which places an intense use\nof property squarely within what has heretofore been a quiet residential\nneighborhood. They are currently challenging the ZHB’s approval of a\nspecial exception in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.\n\n                                 18\n\n\nIII. Equal Protection Analysis\n\nA.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment commands that no State shall \"deny to any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the\nlaws.\" U.S. Const. Amend. XIV. This is \"essentially a\ndirection that all persons similarly situated should be\ntreated alike.\" City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 439 (citing\nPlyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 216 (1982)). However, courts\n\fare reluctant to overturn governmental action on the\nground that it denies equal protection of the laws:\n\n       The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason\n       to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will\n       eventually be rectified by the democratic process and\n       that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no\n       matter how unwisely we may think a political branch\n       has acted. Thus, we will not overturn such a statute\n       unless the varying treatment of different groups or\n       persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any\n       combination of legitimate purposes that we can only\n       conclude that the legislature’s actions were irrational.\n\nVance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 97 (1979).\n\nLike other economic and social legislation, land use\nordinances that do not classify by race, alienage, or\nnational origin, will survive an attack based on the Equal\nProtection Clause if the law is \" ‘reasonable, not arbitrary’\nand bears ‘a rational relationship to a (permissible) state\nobjective.’ \" Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, 416 U.S. 1, 8\n(1974). However, land use regulations must possess a\nlegitimate interest in promoting the public health, safety,\nmorals, and the general welfare of its citizens in order to\npass scrutiny. See Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.,\n272 U.S. 365, 395 (1926) (citation omitted). Land use\nordinances will be deemed \"irrational\" when a plaintiff\ndemonstrates either that the state interest is illegitimate (an\nends-focus) or that the chosen classification is not\nrationally related to the interest (a means-focus).\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has not yet directly addressed\n\n                                19\n\n\nthe constitutional incidents of municipal restrictions on use\nof land by religious institutions,3 its application of the\nrational basis test in cases involving other alleged liberty\nrestrictions by municipalities exercising land use authority\nsuggests that the same highly deferential standard of\nreview is applicable here. In Village of Euclid , a zoning\nordinance classified different portions of land into six\ncategories. The owners of a vacant plot of land that fell\npartially within a zone restricted to two-family dwellings\nfiled suit claiming that they were being deprived of liberty\nand property without due process within the meaning of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. They argued that the land had\nbeen held for industrial development, and that under the\nordinance the land would be greatly reduced in value since\nit could not be put to that use.\n\nThe Court noted that the case involved the \"validity of\nwhat is really the crux of the more recent zoning legislation,\nnamely, the creation and maintenance of residential\ndistricts, from which business and trade of every sort,\nincluding hotels and apartment houses, are excluded.\" 272\nU.S. at 390. The Court proceeded by observing the logic of\nsuch a design in land use -- that \"the segregation of\n\fresidential, business, and industrial buildings\" would\n\"increase the safety and security of home life; greatly tend\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3. See, e.g., Christian Gospel Church, Inc. v. City of San Francisco, 896\nF.2d 1221 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 999 (1991) (holding\nthat denying a permit to establish a church in a residential area did not\nviolate the Free Exercise Clause because the zoning system protected\ngovernment interests, nor did it violate the Equal Protection Clause\nbecause there was no discrimination against appellant); Messiah Baptist\nChurch v. County of Jefferson, 859 F.2d 820 (10th Cir. 1988), cert.\ndenied, 490 U.S. 1005 (1989) (holding that denial of a permit to build a\nchurch was not a violation of the Due Process of Free Exercise Clause);\nGrosz v. City of Miami Beach, 721 F.2d 729 (11th Cir. 1983), cert.\ndenied, 469 U.S. 827 (1984) (holding that a zoning law affecting\nappellee’s ability to conduct religious services in his home was not a\nviolation of the Free Exercise Clause or the Due Process Clause);\nLakewood, Ohio Congregation of Jehovah’s Witnesses v. City of\nLakewood, 699 F.2d 303 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 104 S.Ct. 72 (1983)\n(holding that denial of a variance to build a church in a residential area\nwas not a violation of the Free Exercise Clause of the Due Process\nClause because it was a legitimate exercise of the city’s police power).\n\n                                20\n\n\nto prevent street accidents, especially to children; by\nreducing the traffic and resulting confusion in residential\nsections; decrease noise and other conditions which\nproduce or intensify nervous disorders; preserve a more\nfavorable environment in which to rear children, etc.\" Id. at\n394. Thus, the Court sustained the ordinance as\"having [a]\nsubstantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or\ngeneral welfare.\" Id. The Court further noted that zoning\nordinances should be treated deferentially like other\n\"practice-forbidding laws,\" and be upheld even if uses that\n\"are neither offensive or dangerous will share the same\nfate.\" Id. at 388.\n\nSimilarly, the Court upheld against attack the zoning\nordinance in Village of Belle Terre. In that case, the Court\naddressed the validity of a zoning ordinance that restricted\na portion of the village to one-family dwellings. The term\n\"family\" was defined to mean individuals related by blood,\nadoption, marriage, or living and cooking together as a\nsingle housekeeping unit, but it excluded the latter category\nif the household consisted of more than two individuals\nwho were not related by blood, adoption, or marriage. Six\nstudents attending college at the State University at Stony\nBrook, none of whom was related by blood, adoption, or\nmarriage, brought suit challenging the validity of the\nordinance. The Court observed that the \"regimes of\nboarding houses, fraternity houses, and the like present\nurban problems. More people occupy a given space; more\ncars rather continuously pass by; more cars are parked;\nnoise travels with crowds.\" 416 U.S. at 9. Thus, the Court\nconcluded that the ordinance was rationally related to a\nlegitimate state objective, holding that a \"quiet place where\nyards are wide, people few, and motor vehicles restricted\nare legitimate guidelines in a land-use project addressed to\n\ffamily needs. . . . It is ample to lay out zones where family\nvalues, youth values, and the blessings of quiet seclusion\nand clean air make the area a sanctuary for people.\" Id.\n\nAs the foregoing cases make clear, local zoning\nordinances are subject to a very forgiving standard of\nreview. That zoning ordinances are subject to such\ndeferential review, however, does not mean that they are\nsubject to no meaningful review. For example, in City of\n\n                                21\n\n\nCleburne, which we will discuss extensively in Section IV\ninfra, the Court struck down an ordinance requiring group\nhomes for the \"feebleminded\" to apply for special use\npermits in the same zone where other groups homes, such\nas fraternities and homes for the aged, were permitted by\nright. Applying rational basis review, the Court concluded\nthat the \"State may not rely on a classification whose\nrelationship to an asserted goal is so attenuated as to\nrender the distinction arbitrary and irrational. Furthermore,\nsome objectives -- such as ‘a bare . . . desire to harm a\npolitically unpopular group’ -- are not legitimate state\ninterests.\" City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 446-47 (internal\ncitations omitted); see also Midnight Sessions, Ltd. v. City of\nPhiladelphia, 945 F.2d 667, 685 (3d Cir. 1991) (finding\n\"negative attitudes or biases, unfounded fears or\nspeculation, prejudice, self-interest, or ignorance[are]\narbitrary and irrational\" ends).4\n\nAlthough a finding of bare animus towards a group or\n\"fear, unsubstantiated by factors which are properly\ncognizable in a zoning proceeding,\" is not necessary for a\nzoning ordinance to fail under an equal protection\nchallenge, such evidence is likely sufficient. City of\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 448. However, absent such animus or\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n4. Likewise, in Seattle Title Trust Co. v. Roberge, 278 U.S. 116 (1928), the\nCourt struck down a zoning ordinance that permitted a \"philanthropic\nhome for children or for old people\" in a particular district \"when the\nwritten consent shall have been obtained of the owners of two-thirds of\nthe property within four hundred feet of the proposed building.\" Id. at\n118. The Court noted that owners could \"withhold consent for selfish\nreasons or arbitrarily and may subject the trustee[owner] to their will or\ncaprice.\" Id. at 122. Thus, the Court struck down the ordinance because\na zoning \" ‘restriction cannot be imposed if it does not bear a substantial\nrelation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare.’ \" Id. at\n121 (quoting Nectow v. Cambridge, 277 U.S. 183, 188 (1928)). In that\ncase, Seattle had failed to show how the maintenance and construction\nof the homes for the aged would \"work any injury, inconvenience or\nannoyance to the community, the district or any person.\" Id. at 122; see\nalso Hooper v. Barnalillo County Assessor, 472 U.S. 612, 619-20 (1985)\n(finding legislation not rationally related to purpose of encouraging\nVietnam veterans to settle in New Mexico where legislation might have\ndiscouraged some veterans from settling there).\n\n                                22\n\fother improper motive, a land use ordinance will typically\nbe upheld.\n\nB.\n\nAs the preceding more general discussion suggests, the\nfederal courts have given states and local communities\nbroad latitude to determine their zoning plans. Indeed, land\nuse law is one of the bastions of local control, largely free\nof federal intervention. As the Supreme Court stated in\nSchad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 68\n(1981), \"[t]he power of local governments to zone and\ncontrol land use is undoubtedly broad and its proper\nexercise is an essential aspect of achieving a satisfactory\nquality of life in both urban and rural communities.. . .\n[T]he courts generally have emphasized the breadth of\nmunicipal power to control land use . . . .\" See also FERC\nv. Mississippi, 456 U.S. 742, 768 n.30 (1982) (\"[R]egulation\nof land use is perhaps the quintessential state activity.\");\nIzzo v. River Edge, 843 F.2d 765, 769 (3d Cir. 1988) (\"Land\nuse policy customarily has been considered a feature of\nlocal government and an area in which the tenets of\nfederalism are particularly strong.\").\n\nThe breadth of this power, as noted by the Court in\nVillage of Belle Terre, 416 U.S. at 9, \"is not confined to\nelimination of filth, stench, and unhealthy places. It is\nample to lay out zones where family values, youth values,\nand the blessings of quiet seclusion and clean air make the\narea a sanctuary for people.\" A necessary corollary of the\nextensive zoning authority bestowed upon local\nmunicipalities, including the authority to create exclusively\nresidential districts, is the authority to make distinctions\nbetween different uses and to exclude some uses within\ncertain zones. Indeed, zoning is by its very design\ndiscriminatory, and that, alone, does not render it invalid.\n\nConcomitantly, in Lakewood, Oh. Congregation of\nJehovah’s Witnesses, Inc. v. City of Lakewood, 699 F.2d\n303 (6th Cir. 1983), the Sixth Circuit upheld a zoning\nordinance that prohibited the construction of church\nbuildings in virtually all residential districts of the city\nusing rational basis review. When the Congregation of\n\n                                23\n\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses was denied a permit to build a church\non a plot of land that the Congregation purchased in an\narea zoned for single-family dwellings, the Congregation\nfiled suit alleging that Lakewood’s ordinance, which created\nareas exclusively for residential use, violated the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment. Noting that, under\ncases such as Village of Euclid and Village of Belle Terre,\nthe city \"may, within constitutional limits, zone to preserve\na peaceful sanctuary for its citizens,\" the Sixth Circuit\nobserved that the \"broad lines\" drawn by the city \"to protect\nits tranquil neighborhoods\" were a \" ‘reasonable margin to\ninsure effective enforcement’ of quiet residential zones.\" Id.\n\fat 308-09. Thus, the Court held that the \"ordinance is\nconstitutional although it creates exclusive residential\ndistricts and thereby prohibits the construction of church\nbuildings in the districts.\" Id.\n\nCases such as Lakewood, as well as Village of Euclid and\nVillage of Belle Terre, demonstrate the breadth of a\nmunicipality’s power to discriminate in the land use\ncontext. Indeed, because the purpose of zoning ordinances\nis to distinguish among uses in order to draft\ncomprehensive municipal plans, a degree of arbitrariness is\ninevitable. The question presented in these cases is when\ndoes a distinction cross the constitutional line. As long as\na municipality has a rational basis for distinguishing\nbetween uses, and that distinction is related to the\nmunicipality’s legitimate goals, then federal courts will be\nreluctant to conclude that the ordinance is improper.\n\nIV. City of Cleburne and \"Similarly Situated\" Uses\n\nWhile City of Cleburne ultimately turned on the fact that\nthe city held an irrational animus toward the mentally\nretarded, the Court provided a useful roadmap for\nanalyzing equal protection challenges of zoning ordinances.\nCity of Cleburne made two determinations crucial to the\noutcome in the case: 1) the proposed use, a group home for\nthe mentally retarded, was similarly situated to the allowed\nuses, other group homes, pursuant to the zoning\nordinance, City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 447-50; and 2)\nthere was no rational reason behind the differential\ntreatment of the similarly situated uses, id. at 450, 461,\n\n                                24\n\n\nwhich appears to have been a function of animus against\nthe retarded. Notably, the Court’s holding that there was no\nrational basis for the city’s distinction between the CLC and\nthe other permitted uses followed only after the Court\ndetermined that CLC and the other permitted uses were\n\"similarly situated.\" This two-step inquiry properly places\nthe initial burden on the complaining party first to\ndemonstrate that it is \"similarly situated\" to an entity that\nit is being treated differently before the local municipality\nmust offer a justification for its ordinance.\n\nOf course, the nature of the issue in City of Cleburne\nrendered quite easy the determination that CLC was\nsimilarly situated to the other permitted uses. The Court\nwas comparing uses that were obviously similarly situated,\nso that the inquiry into whether the rationale offered by the\ncity -- that the uses would have a different impact --\nbecame the crux of the decision. The Court thus framed the\nquestion before it as follows: \"May the city require the\npermit for this facility when other care and multiple-\ndwelling facilities are freely permitted?\" id. at 448; it\npresumed that it was comparing similar uses. Yet, in\nanswering the question presented, the Court relied on the\nfact that the impact on CLC would have to be different from\nthe other similar uses, and not just compared with other,\n\fdissimilar uses permitted in the district. The Court noted\nthat the mentally retarded are \"different,\" but that this\ndifference was \"largely irrelevant unless the . .. home and\nthose who would occupy it would threaten legitimate\ninterests of the city in a way that other permitted uses such\nas boarding houses and hospitals would not.\" Id. (emphasis\nadded). The focus, then, was first and foremost on whether\nsimilarly situated uses were being treated differently.\n\nOther courts have tracked the two-step analysis laid out\nin City of Cleburne, determining first if the uses are\n\"similarly situated\" and, if they are, asking if there is a\nrational basis for distinguishing between them. In\nCornerstone Bible Church v. Hastings, supra , the Eighth\nCircuit relied on City of Cleburne and required the city to\nprovide a rational basis for the \"apparent unequal\ntreatment of similarly situated entities\" only after first\nconcluding that the church was similarly situated to\n\n                                25\n\n\npermitted uses in a commercial zoning district. 948 F.2d at\n472. Similarly, in Christian Gospel Church v. San Francisco,\n896 F.2d 1221 (9th Cir. 1990), a church sought a permit to\nbuild a church in an area zoned for single-family\nresidences. The Court stated that \"[i]n order to prevail, the\nChurch must make a showing that a class that is similarly\nsituated has been treated disparately.\" Id. at 1225. In\nconcluding that there was no equal protection violation, the\nCourt observed that the church \"was treated no differently\nthan a school or community center would have been,\" and,\nthus, that the church had failed to establish that other\nsimilarly situated uses had been treated differently. Id.\n\nIn sum, the first inquiry a court must make in an equal\nprotection challenge to a zoning ordinance is to examine\nwhether the complaining party is similarly situated to other\nuses that are either permitted as of right, or by special\npermit, in a certain zone. If, and only if, the entities are\nsimilarly situated, then the city must justify its different\ntreatment of the two, perhaps by citing to the different\nimpact that such entities may have on the asserted goal of\nthe zoning plan.\n\nV. Application to the Abington Ordinance\n\nA. The District Court’s Approach\n\nAs noted above, the Congregation moved for partial\nsummary judgment on the ground that the Ordinance was\nfacially unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause\nand the Due Process Clause. The District Court, however,\nproceeded to evaluate whether the Ordinance violated the\nEqual Protection Clause as applied, and did so in order to\n\"avoid making [an] unnecessarily broad constitutional\njudgment.\" Congregation Kol Ami, 161 F. Supp.2d at 436.\n\nRelying on City of Cleburne, the District Court concluded\nthat the Ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the\n\fCongregation because it did not permit the Congregation to\napply for a special exception in an R-1 Residential District.\nAs the District Court viewed it, the issue was whether the\nTownship’s scheme was rationally related to its proffered\nreason for excluding the Congregation -- a concern over\n\n                                26\n\n\ntraffic, light, and noise pollution. That is, the question was\nwhether it was permissible for the Township to allow uses\nother than residences in the R-1 Residential District, while\nsimultaneously excluding the Congregation. The District\nCourt observed that Abington’s \"traffic, noise and light\nconcerns also exist for the uses currently allowed to request\na special exception.\" Id. at 437. Thus, the court concluded\nthat the means employed by the Ordinance, i.e.,\ndistinguishing between country clubs and the\nCongregation, was not rationally related to the goal of\npreventing traffic, noise, and light pollution in the\nneighborhood. Accordingly, the court ordered the ZHB to\nhold a hearing on whether the Congregation was entitled to\na special exception.\n\nThe Township submits that the District Court erred in its\nequal protection analysis, for which it relied primarily on\nCity of Cleburne. We agree. First, the District Court failed to\nmake the preliminary determination in the equal protection\nanalysis, as we identified above. See supra Section IV. That\nis, the District Court failed to inquire whether the uses\npermitted by special exception, such as country clubs, were\n\"similarly situated\" to religious institutions or to the\nCongregation in particular. Rather, the District Court\nconcluded that because the impact of the uses, either\nsimilar or not, was the same, there could be no rational\nbasis for distinguishing between them, and that the\nCongregation must therefore be able to apply for a special\nexception.\n\nAt oral argument the Congregation claimed that the\nDistrict Court had focused, and that this Court should\nfocus, on the impact of the different uses because that was\nthe proffered reason offered by Abington for distinguishing\nbetween country clubs and religious uses. However, based\non our review of City of Cleburne and other caselaw,\ndiscussed supra Section III, we conclude that this argument\noverlooks the fact that Abington need not justify its\nexclusion of religious uses if such a use is not similarly\nsituated to, for example, a country club. As the Ninth\nCircuit noted in Christian Gospel Church,\"[i]n order to\nprevail, the Church must make a showing that a class that\nis similarly situated has been treated disparately.\" 896 F.2d\n\n                                27\n\n\nat 1225. It is not until this showing is made that it becomes\n\"incumbent on the City to provide a rational basis for [the]\napparent unequal treatment of similarly situated entities.\"\nCornerstone, 948 F.2d at 472. That Abington offered a\n\frationale based on the Congregation’s impact does not\nrelieve the Congregation of its burden to demonstrate, at\nthe outset, that it is similarly situated to the uses permitted\nby special exception in the R-1 District.\n\nSo then, the Congregation must demonstrate that it is\nsimilarly situated to other permitted entities by\ndemonstrating that it is similarly situated in relation to the\nTownship’s purpose in creating the R-1 Residential District.\nSee, e.g., Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty, 272 U.S. 365,\n388 (1926) (\"[T]he question whether the power exists to\nforbid the erection of a building of a particular kind or for\na particular use . . . is to be determined, not by an abstract\nconsideration of the building or of the thing considered\napart, but by considering it in connection with the\ncircumstances and the locality.\").\n\nThe Township’s purpose in creating R-1, as stated in the\nOrdinance, is to provide \"low density single-family,\nneighborhoods.\" [1000a]. The burden on the Congregation\nis to demonstrate that it is just as compatible with this goal\nas is, for example, a country club. To be sure, it may be\nthat an inquiry into whether something is \"similarly\nsituated\" will involve an inquiry into whether the two\nentities have the same impact. But the analysis for equal\nprotection purposes is more nuanced. In City of Cleburne,\nfor example, the nature of the uses was dwellings for large\nnumbers of people. In this case, a court must evaluate not\nonly the impact of the Congregation as compared with a\ncountry club, the example raised by the Congregation at\noral argument, but also what requirements or needs it may\nhave in order to operate within the neighborhood. Should\nthe Congregation prevail, the burden then shifts to the\nTownship to offer any evidence of a rational reason for\ndistinguishing between the uses.\n\nWe will turn presently to the similarity   of uses issue. But\nfirst we are constrained to note that if   we were to conclude,\nas the District Court did, that all uses   with a similar impact\nmust be treated alike, regardless of the   fact that such uses\n\n                                28\n\n\nmay be fundamentally distinct, we would turn zoning law\non its head. That is, such a conclusion would mean not\nonly that churches must be allowed in a zone where\ncountry clubs are allowed (based on the conclusion that\ncountry clubs impact light, traffic and noise as well), but\nalso, by necessity, that a host of other uses that impact\nlight, traffic and noise must also be permitted in such\nzones. But this would strip of any real meaning the\nauthority bestowed upon municipalities to zone since the\nbroad power to zone carries with it the corollary authority\nto discriminate against a host of uses that a municipality\ndetermines are not particularly suited for a certain district.\nPlacing the burden on the complaining party first to\nestablish that it is similarly situated with other, permitted\nuses preserves the clearly established local authority in the\nland use context. The District Court did not do this and\n\fhence its judgment must be set aside. To the extent that\nthe District Court’s conclusion rests on the notion that a\n\"house of worship inherently further[s] the public welfare,\"\nCongregation Kol Ami, 161 F. Supp.2d at 437, it is seriously\nproblematic for the reasons set forth in the margin. 5\n\n(Text continued on page 31)\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The Congregation concedes that \"a municipality may indeed decree\nthat some [uses] are suitable in a particular district and some are not.\nFor example, it could decide that it wishes to permit golf clubs in a\nresidential neighborhood, but exclude tennis clubs.\" The Congregation\nalso acknowledges that \"a local government may generally exclude a use\nfrom a residential zone because the use ‘lacks residential character,’\neven if the excluded use would be similarly intense as those permitted.\"\nHowever, the Congregation contends that a local government \"may not\npermit any of those things and prohibit houses of worship and rely on\n‘compatibility with residential life’ as its reason for distinguishing the\nuses.\" In its submission, \"The Constitution privileges the activity of\nreligious worship at least to this extent: that it bars government from\nfinding nonreligious uses, other than ‘residences’ themselves, permissible\nwithin a residential district, while excluding religious uses for reasons\nrelated solely to the ‘character’ of the activity.\"\n\nThis argument, which is essentially a challenge to the facial validity of\nthe Ordinance under the Equal Protection Clause, is not necessary to\nour disposition of the case, nor do we think it prudent to pass upon it\nnow; as the District Court noted in ruling on the Ordinance as applied\nto the Congregation, and as the Supreme Court observed in City of\nCleburne, it is preferable, when possible, to\"avoid making unnecessarily\n\n                                29\n\n\nbroad constitutional judgments.\" City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 447; see\nalso Congregation Kol Ami, 161 F. Supp. 2d at 436. However, we do note\nthat this argument seems to boil down to a contention that religious\ninstitutions get a preference in the land use context, and we think that\nsuch a preference would pose a significant problem.\n\nFirst, under Employment Div., Dep’t of Human Resources of Ore. v.\nSmith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990), a local government must even-handedly\napply its laws and cannot single out religion for either discriminatory or\npreferential treatment. Id. at 879 (\"the right of free exercise does not\nrelieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a ‘valid and neutral\nlaw of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or\nprescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).’ \"). As the\nCourt observed, \"We have never held that an individual’s religious beliefs\nexcuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting\nconduct that the State is free to regulate.\" Id. at 878-79. Second, a\nconclusion that religious uses may not be excluded from residential\ndistricts takes away the deference that has been granted to local\nmunicipalities to make a determination whether or not such a use is\nsuited for a residential district. As stated at oral argument, it creates a\n\"cookie-cutter\" approach to zoning that seems contrary to, at the very\nleast, the Supreme Court’s observation that \"regulation of land use is\nperhaps the quintessential state activity.\" FERC v. Missippi, 456 U.S.\n742, 768 n.30 (1982).\n\fSecond, we are unpersuaded by the Congregation’s citation to several\ndecisions in state courts holding that houses of worship are inherently\ncompatible with residential zoning. See, e.g., State v. Maxwell, 617 P.2d\n816 (Haw. 1980); Board of Zoning Appeals v. Schulte, 172 N.E.2d 39 (Ind.\n1961); Diocese of Rochester v. Planning Bd. of Brighton, 136 N.E.2d 827\n(N.Y. 1956); Congregation Committee v. City Council of Haltom City, 287\nS.W.2d 700 (Tex. 1956); O’Brien v. Chicago, 105 N.E.2d 917 (Ill. 1952).\nAlthough some jurisdictions have so held, not all states espouse this\nruling, see, e.g., Seward Chapel, Inc. v. City of Seward, 655 P.2d 1293\n(Alaska 1982); Milwaukie Co. of Jehovah’s Witnesses v. Mullen, 214 Ore.\n281 (1958); West Hartford Methodist Church v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals,\n143 Conn. 263 (1956); Miami Beach United Lutheran Church of the\nEpiphany v. Miami Beach, 82 So.2d 880 (Fla. 1955); Corporation of the\nPresiding Bishop of the Church of Latter Day Saints v. Porterville, 203\nP.2d 823 (Cal. Dist. Ct. App. 1949), nor does the Congregation cite a\nfederal case explicitly upholding this extremely broad principle. Most\nimportantly, although the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not spoken\ndirectly on this subject, lower court decisions demonstrate that it is not\ngood law in Pennsylvania. See, e.g., Church of Our Lord Jesus Christ v.\n\n                                30\n\n\nB. Similarity of Uses\n\nSince we review the grant of (partial) summary judgment\nde novo, see Olson v. General Electric Astrospace, 101 F.3d\n947, 951 (3d Cir. 1996), we apply the same standard as the\nDistrict Court in determining whether summary judgment\nwas appropriate, Michael v. Shiley, Inc., 46 F.3d 1316, 1321\n(3d Cir. 1995). Therefore, we may analyze whether the\nCongregation is similarly situated to uses permitted by\nspecial exception in the R-1 Residential District, i.e.,\nwhether, as submitted by the Congregation at oral\nargument, Congregation Kol Ami is similarly situated to a\ncountry club. We are tempted to do this because the\nDistrict Court, albeit in summary fashion, did so, and\nbecause delay in disposition of this matter impedes the\nCongregation’s relocation efforts.\n\nIn response to questioning at oral argument, the\nCongregation contends that it is similarly situated to a\ncountry club, a use that is permitted by special exception\nin the R-1 Residential District. In its submission, a country\nclub conducts activities at the same time and with the\nsame number of people as the Congregation would, yet the\ncountry club is permitted by special exception but the\nCongregation is not. The Congregation submits that it\nshould make no difference that \"Congregation\" Kol Ami,\nand not \"Country Club\" Kol Ami, applied for a special\nexception.\n\nIf Abington permitted full-scale country clubs, this\nargument might have some force. It is unclear however,\nbased on a review of the Abington Ordinance, whether\ncountry clubs, as described by the Congregation, are\npermitted in the R-1 Residential District in Abington.\nLeaving aside the religious events conducted at the\nsynagogues, which have no analogue to any of the uses\n_________________________________________________________________\n\fLower Merion Township, 34 Pa. D. & C.2d 239 (Mont. Co. Ct. of Comm.\nPleas 1964) (upholding generally applicable zoning regulation that denied\nchurch a special exception to locate in a residential area). At all events,\nthe U.S. Supreme Court’s holding in Smith renders questionable the\ncontinuing vitality of this line of state cases for the reasons discussed\nabove.\n\n                                31\n\n\npermitted in R-1 by special exception, the country club\ndescribed at oral argument was one that would be on a par\nwith a 450-family synagogue regularly hosting weddings\nand Bar and Bat Mitzvah services.[OA Trans. At 62, 68,\n93]. But we cannot tell whether the Ordinance would\npermit such a club. The R-1 Residential District permits\n\"Outdoor Recreation\" by special exception.[1001a]. Outdoor\nrecreation is then defined as follows:\n\n       Public or private miniature golf courses, swimming\n       pools, ball courts, tennis courts, ball fields, trails, and\n       similar uses which are not enclosed in buildings and\n       are operated on a commercial or membership basis,\n       primarily for the use of patrons who do not reside on\n       the same lot on premises. Outdoor recreation shall\n       include any accessory use, such as snack bars, pro\n       shops, club houses, country clubs, or similar uses\n       which are designed and intended primarily for the use\n       of patrons of the principal recreational use. Outdoor\n       recreation shall not include amusement parks, open\n       space recreational uses, overnight camping parks, or\n       other uses specifically provided herein.\n\n(Emphasis added). [1098a].\n\nThis ordinance is not a model of clarity, but its text does\nnot appear to permit full-scale country clubs. While\n\"country clubs\" are permitted within the meaning of\n\"outdoor recreation,\" when read in connection with the\npermitted \"outdoor recreation\" it seems that country clubs\nlike those envisioned by the Congregation are not\npermitted. For example, the use permits miniature golf\ncourses, not full-scale golf courses, which is a limitation\nthat seems to restrict the possibility that any grand country\nclub could or would locate in the R-1 Residential District.\nRather, under the text of the Ordinance the type of country\nclub permitted in the R-1 Residential District appears\nspecifically designed to be an accessory use and, as such,\nto serve those uses listed in the sentence preceding the list\nof accessory uses, such as miniature golf courses,\nswimming pools, and tennis courts. Under this reading, the\nCongregation’s argument that such clubs could be used for\n\n                                32\n\n\nweddings and other celebrations would be inconsistent with\nthe precise language of the Ordinance.6\n\fBut this argument, which depends on a rather crabbed\ncharacterization of \"country club,\" is less than fully\nconvincing. At all events, because the ordinance is so\npoorly written that we cannot be sure what it means, we\nwill remand so that the District Court can consider the\nsimilarity issue in the first instance. In consideration of this\nremand, we make a number of observations for the\nguidance of the District Court.\n\nFirst, we note that of the uses permitted by special\nexception in the R-1 Residential District, the country club\ncomparison seems to be the only possible similarity. 7 We\nare mindful that in City of Cleburne, the different housing\narrangements used for comparison were, essentially,\nmultiple housing arrangements. It is hard to describe how\none of the arrangements differed from the other insofar as\nits use was concerned. Clearly, as the similarity of use\nwanes, so too the inequality in treatment will be\nincreasingly tolerated under the law. On the basis of the\npresent record, it seems doubtful that the Congregation is\nsimilarly situated to the other uses permitted by special\nexception in R-1. Kennels, riding academies, and outdoor\nrecreation facilities are very low-intense uses of land that\npreserve residential character. [1074a-75a, 1098a]. Train\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. We note, in this regard, that restaurants and clubs in general are not\npermitted either by right or by special exception in the R-1 Residential\nDistrict. Rather, restaurants are permitted only in commercial districts,\nsuch as in the Town Commercial District [1007a], Special Commercial\nDistrict [1010a], Planned Business Districts[1014a], Mixed Use Districts\n[1028a], and as an accessory use to a golf course [1097a]. \"Clubs\" are\npermitted in the Apartment-Office Districts [1018a], Mixed Use Districts\n[1028a], and Recreation/Conservation Districts[1036a]. Country clubs of\nthe type conceived of by the Congregation, with full-scale golf courses,\nare permitted in the Community Service Districts by conditional use\npermit (where houses of worship are permitted by right), Apartment-\nOffice Districts, and Recreational/Conservation Districts by special\nexception. [1019a, 1036a].\n\n7. Although the notion that a country club and a synagogue are similarly\nsituated at first seems counterintuitive, perhaps an explanation (beyond\nsimilarity of impacts) can be found.\n\n                                33\n\n\nstations and bus shelters are located adjacent to (usually\nlong established) public rights of way which transport\nsuburban commuters into Philadelphia and support\nregional transportation. [1108a]. Municipal complexes,\nemergency services, and utility facilities for sewers and\nelectricity are indispensable to the health, safety, and\nadministration of a residential community [1094a, 1108a].\nAll of these uses would appear to have functionally different\npurposes than the Congregation, and would seem\ncompatible with a low-density residential neighborhood so\nas to represent a lower likelihood of generating negative\nsecondary effects.\n\fIn addition to the fact that the uses permitted by right or\nby special exception differ in scale and purpose from the\nCongregation, we note that the Congregation’s proposed use\npresents an intense use of the land, which the Township\nmight determine was incompatible with its residential\ndesignation. Services and educational classes typically\nrequire a large number of people to arrive and leave by car\nat roughly the same time. As we previously observed, a\nmunicipality may chart out a \"quiet place where yards are\nwide, people few, and motor vehicles restricted are\nlegitimate guidelines in a land-use project addressed to\nfamily needs. . . . The police power is not confined to\nelimination of filth, stench, and unhealthy places. It is\nample to lay out zones where . . . the blessings of quiet\nseclusion and clean air make the area a sanctuary for\npeople.\" Village of Belle Terre, 446 U.S. at 9.\n\nAs represented at oral argument by the Township, the\nCongregation stated at the initial proceeding before the ZHB\nthat it had a membership of 207 families and predicted a\ngrowth to about 350 families. By the time the special\nexception hearing was held, the Congregation was willing to\nput a cap at 450 families. There is no doubt that the\nCongregation is growing, probably due to a popular rabbi.\nThe Congregation may well grow larger. With a large and\ngrowing congregation comes increased traffic and noise.\nIndeed, at the special exception hearing, the Congregation\nreported that it would need to expand the existing parking\nlot to 137 spaces, but might need to make available an\nadditional 54 spaces for reserve parking for heavy-use\n\n                                34\n\n\noccasions. [3904a]. This matter might well be considered by\nthe District Court on remand.\n\nC. Rationality\n\nSince we remand for resolution of the similarity of uses\nissue, we need not reach the ultimate rationality question,\neven though the District Court did so. We do however, offer\nsome observations on that issue should the District Court\nneed to revisit it.\n\nFirst, we note that there is no evidence of anti-Jewish or\nanti-religious animus in the record. Although such evidence\nis not necessary to sustain an equal protection violation,\nthis court has stated that \"negative attitudes or biases,\nunfounded fears or speculation, prejudice, self-interest, or\nignorance [are] arbitrary and irrational\" ends that warrant\nfinding a statute unconstitutional. Midnight Sessions, 945\nF.2d at 685.\n\nSecond, the facts of this case illustrate why religious uses\nmay be, in some cases, incompatible with a place of\"quiet\nseclusion.\" When conducting its Comprehensive Plan in\n1992, the Township determined that institutional uses,\nsuch as schools, churches, and hospitals, have distinctive\nrequirements that would best be addressed by placing them\n\fin particular districts. Specifically, the Township concluded\nthat although these entities \"provide many benefits to the\ncommunity,\" they also \"have specific use, space and\nlocational requirements which are inherently different from\nother land categories . . . [and] necessitate[ ] a separate\nland use classification.\" [889a]. To that end, the CS-\nCommunity Service District was established to meet the\nparticular needs of churches and other institutions.\n[1024a].\n\nIn view of the enormously broad leeway afforded\nmunicipalities in making land use classifications, see\ndiscussion supra, it is strongly arguable that the\nTownship’s decision to group churches together with\nschools, hospitals, and other institutions is rationally\nrelated to the needs of these entities, their impact on\nneighboring properties, and their inherent compatibility or\nincompatibility with adjoining uses. If so, the foregoing\n\n                                35\n\n\nstandard of review in land use cases will be met. Such\nplanning is the raison d’etre of zoning ordinances, and\nbroad latitude is given to authorities that rationally conduct\nthis municipal function. See Euclid, 272 U.S. at 388-89\n(\"The inclusion of a reasonable margin to insure effective\nenforcement, will not put upon a law, otherwise valid, the\nstamp of invalidity.\").\n\nFinally, we do not believe land use planners can assume\nanymore that religious uses are inherently compatible with\nfamily and residential uses. See, e.g., Megachurches as\nMinitowns, NYT F1, F6 (May 9, 2002). Churches may be\nincompatible with residential zones, as they \"bring\ncongestion; they generate traffic and create parking\nproblems; they can cause a deterioration of property values\nin a residential zone . . . .\" Jewish Reconstructionist\nSynagogue v. Village of Roslyn Harbor, 38 N.Y.2d 283, 293\n(1975). Thus, the District Court must refrain from making\na blanket determination that religious institutions are\ninherently compatible, and, as argued by the Congregation,\n\"essential to residential zoning.\" See supra n.5. These\nmatters need to be considered on remand as well.\n\nD. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment and order of the\nDistrict Court will be vacated and the case remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. The\nspecial exception granted by the ZHB and the land use\npermit issued by the Township are declared to be null and\nvoid. Parties to bear their own costs.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\f36\n\f",

After the Congregation entered\ninto an agreement of sale with the Sisters of Nazareth, the\ncurrent owners of the property, it sought zoning approval\nfrom the Township Zoning Hearing Board (\"ZHB\") seeking\neither a variance or a special exception, and alternatively,\npermission to use the property as an existing non-\nconforming use. When the Congregation’s application was\ndenied by the ZHB, the Congregation, along with its Rabbi,\nElliot Holin, filed suit in the District Court for the Eastern\nDistrict of Pennsylvania against the ZHB, Abington\nTownship, its Board of Commissioners, and its Director of\nCode Enforcement in both his individual and official\ncapacities, seeking injunctive, declaratory and\ncompensatory relief for alleged civil rights violations\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 1983. The complaint also alleged a\nviolation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized\nPersons Act of 2000, 42 U.S.C. S 2000 et seq.; the\nMunicipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S. S 11001A-11005A;\nArticle I, sections 3, 7, 20 and 26 of the Pennsylvania\nConstitution; and the First and Fourteenth Amendments of\nthe United States Constitution. [1a-20a].\n\nCentral to the case are certain provisions of the Abington\nTownship Zoning Ordinance whose purpose, under a 1996\nAmendment, is \"to provide low density, single family,\nneighborhoods.\" Under the Ordinance, the R-1 Residential\nDistrict only permits a handful of uses by right: agriculture,\nlivestock, single family detached dwellings, and\nconservation and recreation preserve. Similarly, the\nOrdinance only permits a handful of uses by \"special\nexception,\" including a kennel, riding academy, municipal\ncomplex, outdoor recreation, emergency services, and utility\n\n                                4\n\n\nfacilities. The Ordinance does not permit churches or other\nreligious institutions in R-1, except those that are legal,\nnonconforming uses, even by special exception. Nor does it\nallow a myriad of other uses such as schools, hospitals,\ntheaters, and daycare centers in R-1 Residential Districts.\nThese uses are, however, permitted in other districts in the\nTownship.\n\nThe Congregation moved for partial summary judgment\non its claim that the Ordinance is unreasonable on its face\nbecause it prohibits houses of worship from locating in\nresidential neighborhoods. The District Court granted the\nCongregation’s motion, finding instead that the Ordinance,\nas applied, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the\n\fUnited States Constitution. The Court reasoned that a\n\"house of worship inherently further[s] the public welfare,\"\nand that the Township had no rational reason to allow\nsome uses by special exception, such as a country club\nsubsumed under \"outdoor recreation,\" but not the\nCongregation. The Court granted injunctive relief, ordering\nthe ZHB to conduct hearings on the Congregation’s\napplication for a special exception. The Court denied the\nTownship’s motion for reconsideration.\n\nThe Township appealed, and asked for a stay of the\ninjunction, both in the District Court and in this Court, but\nthose applications were also denied. The ZHB held the\nspecial exception hearing and concluded that the proposed\nuse would not \"adversely affect the health, safety and\nwelfare of the community,\" and that the use was\n\"consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the\nOrdinance.\" [3907a]. These are the requirements for a\nspecial exception, which must be awarded if they are met.\nThe ZHB thus granted the Congregation a special exception\nwith some limitations aimed at traffic, light pollution, and\nnoise. [3907a-3909a]. Since then, the Township has also\napproved the Congregation’s land development plan. The\nCongregation, however, has not begun building on the\nproperty; it awaits the outcome of the appeal brought in\nthis Court, and one brought in the Montgomery County\nCourt of Common Pleas by neighbors who oppose the\nsynagogue use. For reasons explained at length infra, given\nthe tenor of the District Court’s holding, which functionally\n\n                                5\n\n\naltered the Township’s zoning ordinance and poses a\ncontinuing burden on its enforcement, we conclude that the\ngrant of the special exception did not moot the case, hence\nwe reject the Congregation’s mootness argument.\n\nThe District Court’s holding of unconstitutionality rested\non its reading of City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), where the Supreme Court concluded\nthat similarly situated group homes were impermissibly\ntreated differently because one home’s occupants were\nmentally handicapped. The District Court in effect read City\nof Cleburne as standing for the proposition that a\nmunicipality’s decision to distinguish between land uses is\nnot rational if both uses, permitted and not-permitted, have\nthe same impact on the municipality’s asserted goals. In so\nconcluding, the District Court overlooked the threshold step\nthat must be taken under the City of Cleburne analysis--\nthe court must first conclude that the two land uses are\n\"similarly situated.\"\n\nThe Township submits that the Congregation’s use is\ndifferent from the other uses permitted by special\nexception. It also contends that it had good reason to group\nchurches and other religious institutions in the CS-\nCommunity Service District with other institutional uses,\nsuch as hospitals and schools, and that it was not\nirrational to allow outdoor recreation and certain other uses\n\fin the R-1 Residential District (by special exception). The\nTownship invokes the well-established principle that, in the\nfederal Constitutional universe, federal courts accord\nsubstantial deference to local government in setting land\nuse policy, and that only where a local government’s\ndistinction between similarly situated uses is not rationally\nrelated to a legitimate state goal, or where the goal itself is\nnot legitimate, will a federal court upset a local\ngovernment’s land use policy determination. It argues that\nthe distinction between religious uses and other uses is not\nonly rational, but that under the District Court’s analysis,\nany use, or at least any religious use with a similar impact,\ncan automatically locate in the R-1 Residential District with\nspecial exception thereby giving a preference to religion, in\ncontradiction of the principles of local land use law.\n\n                                  6\n\n\nThe Township’s arguments are forceful, but we will not\nresolve them here, because the District Court did not\naddress the similarity of uses question, and the Abington\nOrdinance is not so clearly drafted that we may definitively\ndetermine what uses are permitted by special exception on\nour own. Put differently, because the District Court failed to\nevaluate whether the Congregation was similarly situated,\ni.e., similar in \"kind,\" to the uses that are currently\npermitted in the R-1 Residential District, we must vacate its\norder and remand so that the proper inquiry may be\nconducted. Since the special exception hearing was held\npursuant to an improper order by the District Court, the\nresulting grant of special exception by the ZHB and the\nland use permit issued by the Township are null and void.\n\nI. Facts and Procedural History\n\nThe Congregation is a Reform Jewish Synagogue,\nfounded in 1994, which conducts religious services, Hebrew\nclasses, and other related activities at various locations in\neastern Montgomery County. The Township is a political\nsubdivision located in eastern Montgomery County. It\noperates pursuant to the First Class Township Code of\nPennsylvania, 53 P.S. S 55101 et seq., and with respect to\nzoning, subdivision and land use matters, in accordance\nwith Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code, 53 P.S.\nS 101 01 et seq. The ZHB has jurisdiction to hear and\nrender final adjudication on, inter alia, applications by\nlandowners for variances from and special exceptions under\nthe Township’s Zoning Ordinance. The ZHB and the\nTownship are separate entities. As we understand the\npractice, the Township does not customarily appear before\nthe ZHB to state a position on an application, although it\nis not foreclosed from doing so.\n\nA. The History of the Relevant Zoning Ordinance\n\nIn 1977, The Township developed a Comprehensive Plan\nfor development within the Township. [337a]. As part of this\nComprehensive Plan, The Township enacted Ordinance No.\n1469, which established a \"V-Residence\" District. Article III,\n\fS 301. [477a, 512a]. In the V-Residence District, pursuant\n\n                                7\n\n\nto S 301.2, certain uses were permitted as of right: single-\nfamily detached dwellings, tilling of the soil, township\nadministrative buildings, public libraries, public parks, play\nor recreational areas, or any similar uses operated by the\nTownship or other governmental agencies. [512a]. Other\nuses, such as churches, rectories, parish houses, convents,\nmonasteries and other similar institutions, were permitted\nas \"special exceptions\"; the ZHB may grant a\"special\nexception\" to certain predetermined uses and in so doing it\nmay attach conditions to the grant of the exception in order\nto preserve the purpose of the zoning ordinance.\n\nOn March 8, 1990, The Township enacted Ordinance No.\n1676, which amended S 301.2 of Ordinance No. 1469 (the\n\"V-Residence District\"). [806a]. The amendment, as it\npertains to the issues in this case, eliminated all uses by\nright except single-family detached dwellings, and accessory\nuses on the same lot that are customarily incidental to\nsingle-family dwellings. [806a]. All of the uses previously\npermitted by special exception, including \"religious\" uses,\nwere eliminated. The purpose of this amendment, as stated\nin the \"Legislative Intent\" of the Ordinance, was to create a\n\"low density\" area for single-family detached dwelling units.\n[806a].\n\nOn May 9, 1996, The Township re-classified its zoning\nordinances pursuant to Ordinance No. 1753 (the\n\"Ordinance\"). [977a]. This Ordinance changed the\ndesignation of The Township’s \"low density residential\ndistrict\" from V-Residence to R-1 Residential.[999a].\nSection 301 of the Ordinance permitted the following uses\nin R-1 by right: agriculture, livestock, single family\ndetached dwellings, conservation and recreation preserve.\n[1000a]. Uses permitted by special exception include:\nkennel (defined at 1074a), riding academy, municipal\ncomplex (defined [at 1094a] to include municipal\nadministration buildings, libraries, police barracks, or road\nmaintenance facilities), outdoor recreation (defined in\nArticle IV, section 706(G)(6) of the 1996 Ordinance to\ninclude \"public or private miniature golf courses, swimming\npools, ball courts, tennis courts, ball fields, trails, and\nsimilar uses, . . . [o]utdoor recreation shall[also] include\nany accessory use, such as snack bar, pro shops, club\n\n                                8\n\n\nhouses, country clubs\"), emergency services, and utility\nfacilities (defined [at 1108a] to include, inter alia, train\nstations and bus shelters). The stated purpose of the R-1\nResidential District was \"to provide low density, single\nfamily, neighborhoods.\" [1000a].\n\nChurches and other religious institutions, except those\nthat are legal, nonconforming uses, are not permitted in\n\fR-1 Residential Districts.1 Although religious institutions\nare not explicitly excluded by the language of the\nOrdinance, they are de jure excluded from that particular\nzone because they are not specifically listed among the uses\nthat may apply for special exceptions. Apparently, the only\noption for a religious institution wishing to locate in an R-1\nResidential District is to apply for a variance with the ZHB.\nAccording to the Ordinance, a variance is a \"grant of\nrelaxation by the [ZHB] from the dimensional and use\nregulations of th[e] Ordinance, when such action will not be\nconsidered contrary to the public interest, and where,\nowing to conditions unique to the property, and not\nresulting from the actions or situation of the applicant, a\nliteral enforcement of this code would result in undue and\nunnecessary hardship.\" [997a].\n\nThe variance standard is very different from the special\nexception standard because it requires the applicant to\ndemonstrate \"unnecessary hardship,\" which requires\nevidence that: \"(1) the physical features of the property are\nsuch that it cannot be used for a permitted purpose; or (2)\nthat the property can be conformed for a permitted use only\nat a prohibitive expense; or (3) that the property has no\nvalue for any purpose permitted by the zoning ordinance.\"\nHertzberg v.

In contrast, for an application to merit\na special exception, it need only establish that the zoning\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n1. A non-conforming use is defined as: \"A building, lot, structure, sign or\nuse, which lawfully existed prior to the adoption, revision or amendment\nof this Ordinance, but does not comply with zoning use or district\nregulations by reasons of adoption, revision, or amendment of this\nOrdinance.\" [993a; see also 1191a]. Of the 36 churches and synagogues\ncurrently operating in the Township, 29 of them are legal, non-\nconforming uses outside of the CS, M, and A-O Districts. 25 of those\nplaces of worship are located in residential districts.\n\n                                9\n\n\nordinance allows the use and that the particular use\napplied for is consistent with the public interest.

If that showing is made, the special\nexception must be granted, though appropriate conditions\nmay be attached.\n\nReligious institutions are permitted in the Township\nunder the Ordinance in the CS-Community Service District.\n[1024a]. In fact, the CS-District was specifically designed to\nprovide for, inter alia, the religious needs of the Township\ncommunity. [1024a]. The Township has provided for other\ninstitutional uses that are excluded from the R-1\nResidential District in the CS-District, including hospitals,\nschools, and community service centers. Religious\ninstitutions are also permitted in the M-Mixed Use District\n[1028a], and, by special exception, in the A-O\nApartment/Office District. [1019a].\n\fB. The History of the Property At Issue\n\nThe real property in question is located at 1908 Robert\nRoad and is zoned R-1 Residential. [298a]. It consists of a\n10.9-acre parcel of land, on which there are several\nbuildings. Prior to 1951, the property was a 38-acre piece\nof land used as a residence by a family. At that time, there\nwere three buildings on the 10.9 acres which are the\nsubject of this lawsuit: a three-story masonry residence, a\ndetached garage, and a two-story auxiliary residence, all\nconstructed in the mid-twenties. [292a].\n\nIn 1951, the property was purchased by the Sisters of\nNazareth, an Order of Roman Catholic Nuns. The Sisters\nconstructed additions as well as other buildings, including\na chapel and a 13,300 square foot main building.[292a].\nThe property was used as a convent, [292a], and at its\npeak, it was home to over 80 Sisters. [292a]. The nuns used\nthe convent to receive daily instruction on religious life,\nengaging in prayer for up to two and a half hours per day.\n[305a]. The Sisters had only limited contact with the\noutside world; visitors to the property were limited to\nvisiting on special occasions, and visits would not occur\n\n                                10\n\n\nmore than twice per year. [305a]. Ceremonies and religious\nservices were rarely attended by persons other than the\nSisters and their relatives. [305a]. On a daily basis, the\naverage number of vehicles parked at the property was five,\nand the primary use of the property was as a residence.\n[305a].\n\nUntil 1988, the 38-acre parcel had direct access to Valley\nRoad, a major road in The Township, by means of a long\ndriveway. In 1988, however, the Sisters subdivided the\nparcel and sold off nearly 28 acres as residential property,\nleaving the 10.9-acre plot before us, but relinquishing\ndirect access to Valley Road. Then, in 1995, due to a\ndecline in the number of nuns on the property, the Sisters\nleased the property to a community of Greek Orthodox\nMonks for religious services, family retreats, religious\nstudy, and prayer. [293a, 307a]. Since the 1990\namendments had removed religious uses from the list of\nuses permitted by special exception, the Monks filed an\napplication with the ZHB seeking a variance from the\nOrdinance to use the property as a monastery. The ZHB\ngranted this request, with certain conditions. [291a]. One of\nthe conditions was that the property deed be restricted to\nprevent further subdivision, and that a driveway be\nconstructed off of Robert Road (a 30-foot wide cul-de-sac\nroad). A stone driveway off of Robert Road is currently the\nonly access to the property. The surrounding area is\ncompletely residential, consisting of well-kept single-family\nhomes on large plots abutting shady streets. The immediate\nblock from which the driveway extends ends in a cul-de-\nsac.\n\fC. History of the Current Litigation\n\nIn August 1999, the Congregation entered into an\nagreement with the Sisters to purchase the property, and to\nuse it as a place for worship. [304a]. The Congregation filed\nan application with the ZHB, seeking to use the property as\nan existing non conforming use, or for a variance, or special\nexception. [2795a]. The Congregation proposed the\nfollowing regularly scheduled uses: (1) Shabbat services on\nalternate Fridays and Saturdays for up to an hour and a\nhalf; (2) Hebrew classes on Wednesdays from 4pm to 8pm;\n\n                                11\n\n\nand (3) religious classes for 2 hours on Sunday mornings.\n[1360a-1368a]. Other uses would include four High Holy\nDay services in the fall, religious meetings, Bar and Bat\nMitzvah services, outdoor wedding ceremonies, and other\nsimilar celebrations and receptions to follow. [1369a-1379a,\n1435a]. As part of its proposal, the Congregation sought\npermission to change the driveways, roadways, and parking\nlots on the property. [2798a].\n\nThe ZHB rejected the Congregation’s application,\nconcluding that the principal use of the property by the\nSisters was residential, and that the chapel was an\naccessory use to the property. The ZHB further noted that\nthe principal use by the Monks was also residential. The\nZHB concluded that the use of the property by the Sisters\nwas as a residential use in the V-Residential District, which\nwas lawfully permitted there. The ZHB ruled that if the use\nby the Sisters was non-conforming, the Sisters had\nabandoned the non-conforming use by filing a preliminary\nsubdivision plan (and by its subsequent approval) but that,\nat all events, the grant of a variance to the Monks\nextinguished any non-conforming use. Since the\nCongregation’s proposed use of the property was for\nreligious not residential purposes, there was no continuing\nnon-conforming use from the Sisters or the Monks. Since\nreligious institutions are not permitted in the R-1\nResidential District, the ZHB denied the request for\ncontinuation as a non-conforming use.\n\nThe ZHB also concluded that the Congregation had failed\nto show that it was entitled to a variance because there\nwere no unique physical features of the property that would\npreclude it from being used as zoned, and that the\nCongregation had failed to demonstrate unnecessary\nhardship. In so concluding, the ZHB observed that the\nOrdinance does not impose a substantial burden on the\nreligious exercise of any person because religious\ninstitutions are permitted in three other zoning districts\nwithin the Township. [297a-320a].\n\nThe Congregation had the right to file an appeal to the\nCourt of Common Pleas of Montgomery County to challenge\nthe ZHB’s decision. Instead, the Congregation filed the\npresent lawsuit in the District Court for the Eastern District\n\f                                12\n\n\nof Pennsylvania, seeking injunctive, declaratory and\ncompensatory relief for: alleged civil rights violations\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. S 1983; violation of the Religious\nLand Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000, 42\nU.S.C. S 2000 et seq.; the Municipalities Planning Code, 53\nP.S. S 11001A-11005A; Article I, sections 3, 7, 20 and 26 of\nthe Pennsylvania Constitution; and the First and\nFourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.\n[1a-29a].\n\nThe Congregation moved for partial summary judgment\non its claim that the Ordinance is unreasonable on its face\nbecause it prohibits houses of worship from locating in\nresidential neighborhoods. Essentially, this was a challenge\nto the facial validity of the Ordinance based on both state\nand federal constitutional law; the Congregation did not\nargue or present evidence that the Ordinance was\nunconstitutional as applied. The District Court granted the\nCongregation’s motion for partial summary judgment. In so\ndoing, the Court declined to rule on the facial validity of the\nOrdinance. Instead, based on the argument presented in\nthe Township’s cross-motion for summary judgment, the\nCourt concluded that the Ordinance, as applied, violated\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the United States\nConstitution.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 435-37 (E.D.Pa. 2001).\n\nThe Court relied on the Supreme Court’s decision in City\nof Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985),\nwhich applied rational basis review to a zoning ordinance\nthat required special-use permits to operate group homes\nfor the mentally handicapped but not similar homes for\nother occupants, such as senior citizens and fraternities.\nThe critical portions of the District Court’s ruling were\nterse. First, it explained the relevance of Cleburne:\n\n       In that case, just as in the instant case, the defendant\n       city argued that the ordinance was aimed at avoiding\n       concentration of population and at lessening\n       congestion of the streets. However, the Court\n       concluded that \"these concerns obviously fail to explain\n       why apartment houses, fraternity and sorority houses,\n       hospitals and the like, may freely locate in the area\n       without a permit.\"\n\n                                13\n\n\nCongregation Kol Ami, 161 F. Supp.2d at 436 (quoting\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 450). In so doing, (here and later), the\nCourt looked to only part of the analysis in Cleburne for the\nproposition that a zoning ordinance is not rational when\nthe impact of permitted and non-permitted uses is similar.\n\nThe Court then went on to state:\n\n       Not only does a house of worship inherently further the\n\f       public welfare, but defendants’ traffic, noise and light\n       concerns also exist for the uses currently allowed to\n       request a special exception. Indeed, there can be no\n       rational reason to allow a train station, bus shelter,\n       municipal administration building, police barrack,\n       library, snack bar, pro shop, club house, country club\n       or other similar use to request a special exception\n       under the 1996 Ordinance, but not Kol Ami. Because\n       the ZHB failed to consider whether traffic, noise, light\n       or other disruptions warrant the denial of a special\n       exception, and failed to apply the 1996 Ordinance in a\n       way that accounts for that Ordinance’s differing\n       treatment of Kol Ami from the other permitted uses by\n       special exception, the Court finds that defendants\n       denied plaintiffs rights secured by the Constitution.\n\nCongregation Kol Ami, 161 F. Supp.2d at 437. These\nstatements were made without elaboration or citation.\nHowever, in their wake the Court granted injunctive relief to\nthe Congregation, ordering the ZHB to conduct hearings on\nthe Congregation’s application for a special exception. The\nTownship moved for reconsideration, which was denied.\n\nThe Township appealed and asked for a stay of the\ninjunction, both in the District Court and in this Court, but\nthese applications were denied. The ZHB held the special\nexception hearing between August 6 and August 9, 2001.\nOn August 15, 2001, it concluded that the use would not\n\"adversely affect the health, safety and welfare of the\ncommunity,\" and that it was \"consistent with the spirit,\npurpose, and intent of the Ordinance.\" [3907a]. Thus, the\nZHB allowed the use by the Congregation, albeit with some\nlimitations aimed at traffic, light pollution, and noise.\n[3907a-3909a]. Since then, The Township has also\napproved the Congregation’s land development plan.\n\n                                14\n\n\nHowever, the Congregation has not begun construction as\nit awaits the result of the appeals in this Court, and by\nneighbors in the Court of Common Pleas.

Mootness\n\nAs a preliminary matter, we must address the\n\fCongregation’s argument that in view of the fact that the\nZHB has granted a special exception, there is no\nmeaningful relief that this court can give, and that the case\nis therefore moot. \"A case is moot when issues presented\nare no longer ‘live’ or the parties lack a legally cognizable\ninterest in the outcome.\" Erie v. Pap’s A.M. , </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118353\"><a href=\"/opinion/118353/erie-v-paps-am/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">277</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n287 (2000) (internal citations omitted); see also Harris v.\nCity of Philadelphia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"689895\"><a href=\"/opinion/689895/martin-harris-jesse-kithcart-william-davis-randall-cummings-evelyn-lingham/\"><span class=\"volume\">47</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1311</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1326 (3d Cir. 1995) (\"As\na general principle, once a party has complied with a court\norder or injunction, and has not been penalized or suffered\nany prejudice that could be remedied on appeal, the appeal\nis moot,\" but also stating that a case is not moot where\nthere exists a \" ‘subject matter upon which the judgment of\nthe court can operate’ to make a substantive determination\non the merits.\") (internal citation omitted).\n\nThe Congregation argues that the Township’s appeal of\nthe District Court’s July 20, 2001 Order granting injunctive\nrelief became moot on August 15, 2001, the day on which\nthe Township fully complied with that Order by holding a\nhearing and issuing a written decision on the\nCongregation’s special exception application. In its\n\n                                15\n\n\nsubmission, once the special exception hearing was held,\nthe injunctive relief ordered by the District Court was fully\nexecuted and could not be undone. To properly address\nthis contention we must assess the character of the District\nCourt’s ruling and its effect on the parties.\n\nUnder the Ordinance, places of worship are not among\nthe uses that are permitted to apply for a special exception.\nSuch an omission is a de jure exclusion of that use from\nthe R-1 Residential District. In its opinion, the District\nCourt took note of the ZHB’s failure to specifically address\nplaintiffs’ request for a special exception, the ZHB’s\nconclusion that the Abington Ordinance does not permit\nplaces of worship to locate in an R-1 district, and its\nconclusion that the Ordinance does not specifically allow a\nspecial exception for places of worship. The Court then\nreasoned that a \"house of worship inherently further[s] the\npublic welfare,\" and that the Township had no rational\nreason to allow some uses by special exception, such as a\ncountry club [subsumed under \"outdoor recreation],\" but\nnot the Congregation. Congregation Kol Ami, 161 F.\nSupp.2d at 437.\n\nThe District Court’s conclusion appears to be a blanket\ndetermination that, as a category, places of worship cannot\nbe excluded from residential districts. In combination with\nthe Court’s Order requiring the ZHB to hold a special\nexception hearing, the Court functionally altered The\nTownship’s Ordinance in two ways. First, it gave the ZHB\nauthority it did not otherwise possess--the authority to\nentertain a request for a special exception by a place of\nworship in an R-1 Residential District. Prior to the District\nCourt’s Order, the only means for a place of worship to\nobtain permission to locate in the R-1 Residential District\n\fwas by way of a variance. By permitting places of worship\nto apply for a special exception, the District Court altered\nthe standard of proof that the Congregation must meet in\norder to obtain approval from the ZHB by removing the\nmuch more onerous requirement that the Congregation\nprove \"unnecessary hardship.\"\n\nAs previously mentioned, in order to prove \"unnecessary\nhardship\" an applicant must demonstrate that the land\ncannot be used for a permitted purpose, that converting the\n\n                                16\n\n\nland so that it may be used for a permitted purpose is\nprohibitively expensive, or that the property has no value\nfor any of the permitted purposes. In contrast, in order for\nan application to get a special exception, it need only\nestablish that the zoning ordinance allows the use and that\nthe particular use applied for is consistent with the public\ninterest. Ryan, Pennsylvania Zoning Law and Practice, Vol.\n2 SS 5.1.2, 6.1.5; Heck v. Zoning Hearing Bd., supra.\nMoreover, if a party meets the requirements of a special\nexception, the ZHB does not have discretion to deny the\nspecial exception -- it must be granted. Thus, the District\nCourt’s determination allows religious institutions to get\npermission to locate in the R-1 Residential District under a\nburden of proof significantly lower than that required under\nthe Ordinance.\n\nSecond, the Court’s categorical determination that\nhouses of worship further the public interest opened the\ndoor for other places of worship to request the same\ntreatment -- a special exception hearing in residential\nzones where they are currently excluded. Supreme Court\nprecedent is clear that the First Amendment prohibits\nmunicipalities from applying their laws differently among\nvarious religious groups. See, e.g., Larson v. Valente, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110697\"><a href=\"/opinion/110697/larson-v-valente/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982) (finding state statute that regulated\ncharitable solicitations preferred one denomination over\nanother and therefore violated the Establishment Clause);\nFowler v. Rhode Island, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1957) (holding\napplication of ordinance that prohibited preaching in public\nparks only against Jehovah’s Witnesses but not other\nministers violated First and Fourteenth Amendments).\nFurther, discrimination against a future similarly situated\nreligious landowner would be a clear violation of the Equal\nProtection Clause. See, e.g., Cleburne, supra; Cornerstone\nBible Church v. Hastings, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571319\"><a href=\"/opinion/571319/cornerstone-bible-church-james-bzoskie-v-city-of-hastings/\"><span class=\"volume\">948</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1991). As\na result, the District Court’s determination altered\nAbington’s zoning plan by giving the ZHB authority to grant\na special exception to places of worship in an R-1\nResidential District not only in this case, but also in future\nsituations where a place of worship seeks to locate in such\na district.\n\nThese effects, which operate by virtue of the precedential\n\n                                17\n\feffect of the District Court’s opinion (unless reversed on\nappeal), impose a burden on the Township. As long as a\ngovernment is saddled with an \"ongoing injury\" caused by\na judgment that its law is unconstitutional, the case is not\nmoot. Erie, 529 U.S. at 288. In Erie, the owner of a nude\ndancing establishment prevailed in the Pennsylvania\nSupreme Court, which found the aspect of a city ordinance\nbanning nude dancing unconstitutional under the First\nAmendment. Before the U.S. Supreme Court heard the\ncity’s appeal, however, the owner ceased to offer nude\ndancing at his establishment and therefore argued that the\ncase was moot. Id. at 286-87. The Court disagreed and\nconcluded that the city suffered an \"ongoing injury because\nit is barred from enforcing the public nudity provisions of\nits ordinance.\" Id. at 288. Such is the case here, where\nAbington is barred from enforcing its zoning ordinance as\nwritten. Thus, we conclude that Abington has \"suffered . . .\nprejudice\" as a result of complying with the District Court’s\nOrder, and that there is an ongoing injury that can be\nremedied on appeal. Harris, 47 F.3d at 1326; see also 13A\nCharles A. Wright, et al., Federal Practice and Procedure\nS 3533.10 (1984).2\n\nThe Congregation makes much of the fact that the\nDistrict Court did not order the ZHB to grant the special\nexception, but only required it to hold a hearing. That is,\nbecause the ZHB’s determination to grant the special\nexception is said to have been \"voluntary,\" the Congregation\nsubmits that we do not have any power to undo what has\nbeen \"voluntarily\" done. We disagree. This argument\noverlooks the fact that the ZHB was completely without\nauthority to consider the request for a special exception\nabsent the District Court’s Order, which compelled it to do\nso. We conclude that the District Court’s Order requiring\nthe hearing, but not a particular outcome, is not a\njurisdictional obstacle, and that this appeal is not moot.\nHence, we turn to the merits.\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n2. Additionally, the neighbors residing near the proposed site are also\naggrieved by the District Court’s decision, which places an intense use\nof property squarely within what has heretofore been a quiet residential\nneighborhood. They are currently challenging the ZHB’s approval of a\nspecial exception in the Montgomery County Court of Common Pleas.\n\n                                 18\n\n\nIII. Equal Protection Analysis\n\nA.\n\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment commands that no State shall \"deny to any\nperson within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the\nlaws.\" U.S. Const. Amend. XIV. This is \"essentially a\ndirection that all persons similarly situated should be\ntreated alike.\" City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 439 (citing\nPlyler v. Doe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110742\"><a href=\"/opinion/110742/plyler-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 216 (1982)). However, courts\n\fare reluctant to overturn governmental action on the\nground that it denies equal protection of the laws:\n\n       The Constitution presumes that, absent some reason\n       to infer antipathy, even improvident decisions will\n       eventually be rectified by the democratic process and\n       that judicial intervention is generally unwarranted no\n       matter how unwisely we may think a political branch\n       has acted. Thus, we will not overturn such a statute\n       unless the varying treatment of different groups or\n       persons is so unrelated to the achievement of any\n       combination of legitimate purposes that we can only\n       conclude that the legislature’s actions were irrational.\n\nVance v. Bradley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110020\"><a href=\"/opinion/110020/vance-v-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">440</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 97 (1979).\n\nLike other economic and social legislation, land use\nordinances that do not classify by race, alienage, or\nnational origin, will survive an attack based on the Equal\nProtection Clause if the law is \" ‘reasonable, not arbitrary’\nand bears ‘a rational relationship to a (permissible) state\nobjective.’ \" Village of Belle Terre v. Boraas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109004\"><a href=\"/opinion/109004/village-of-belle-terre-v-boraas/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8\n(1974). However, land use regulations must possess a\nlegitimate interest in promoting the public health, safety,\nmorals, and the general welfare of its citizens in order to\npass scrutiny. See Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100934\"><a href=\"/opinion/100934/village-of-euclid-v-ambler-realty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 395 (1926) (citation omitted). Land use\nordinances will be deemed \"irrational\" when a plaintiff\ndemonstrates either that the state interest is illegitimate (an\nends-focus) or that the chosen classification is not\nrationally related to the interest (a means-focus).\n\nWhile the Supreme Court has not yet directly addressed\n\n                                19\n\n\nthe constitutional incidents of municipal restrictions on use\nof land by religious institutions,3 its application of the\nrational basis test in cases involving other alleged liberty\nrestrictions by municipalities exercising land use authority\nsuggests that the same highly deferential standard of\nreview is applicable here. In Village of Euclid , a zoning\nordinance classified different portions of land into six\ncategories. The owners of a vacant plot of land that fell\npartially within a zone restricted to two-family dwellings\nfiled suit claiming that they were being deprived of liberty\nand property without due process within the meaning of\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. They argued that the land had\nbeen held for industrial development, and that under the\nordinance the land would be greatly reduced in value since\nit could not be put to that use.\n\nThe Court noted that the case involved the \"validity of\nwhat is really the crux of the more recent zoning legislation,\nnamely, the creation and maintenance of residential\ndistricts, from which business and trade of every sort,\nincluding hotels and apartment houses, are excluded.\" 272\nU.S. at 390. The Court proceeded by observing the logic of\nsuch a design in land use -- that \"the segregation of\n\fresidential, business, and industrial buildings\" would\n\"increase the safety and security of home life; greatly tend\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n3.

Thus, the Court sustained the ordinance as\"having [a]\nsubstantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or\ngeneral welfare.\" Id. The Court further noted that zoning\nordinances should be treated deferentially like other\n\"practice-forbidding laws,\" and be upheld even if uses that\n\"are neither offensive or dangerous will share the same\nfate.\" Id. at 388.\n\nSimilarly, the Court upheld against attack the zoning\nordinance in Village of Belle Terre. In that case, the Court\naddressed the validity of a zoning ordinance that restricted\na portion of the village to one-family dwellings. The term\n\"family\" was defined to mean individuals related by blood,\nadoption, marriage, or living and cooking together as a\nsingle housekeeping unit, but it excluded the latter category\nif the household consisted of more than two individuals\nwho were not related by blood, adoption, or marriage. Six\nstudents attending college at the State University at Stony\nBrook, none of whom was related by blood, adoption, or\nmarriage, brought suit challenging the validity of the\nordinance. The Court observed that the \"regimes of\nboarding houses, fraternity houses, and the like present\nurban problems. More people occupy a given space; more\ncars rather continuously pass by; more cars are parked;\nnoise travels with crowds.\" 416 U.S. at 9. Thus, the Court\nconcluded that the ordinance was rationally related to a\nlegitimate state objective, holding that a \"quiet place where\nyards are wide, people few, and motor vehicles restricted\nare legitimate guidelines in a land-use project addressed to\n\ffamily needs. . . . It is ample to lay out zones where family\nvalues, youth values, and the blessings of quiet seclusion\nand clean air make the area a sanctuary for people.\" Id.\n\nAs the foregoing cases make clear, local zoning\nordinances are subject to a very forgiving standard of\nreview. That zoning ordinances are subject to such\ndeferential review, however, does not mean that they are\nsubject to no meaningful review. For example, in City of\n\n                                21\n\n\nCleburne, which we will discuss extensively in Section IV\ninfra, the Court struck down an ordinance requiring group\nhomes for the \"feebleminded\" to apply for special use\npermits in the same zone where other groups homes, such\nas fraternities and homes for the aged, were permitted by\nright. Applying rational basis review, the Court concluded\nthat the \"State may not rely on a classification whose\nrelationship to an asserted goal is so attenuated as to\nrender the distinction arbitrary and irrational. Furthermore,\nsome objectives -- such as ‘a bare . . . desire to harm a\npolitically unpopular group’ -- are not legitimate state\ninterests.\" City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 446-47 (internal\ncitations omitted); see also Midnight Sessions, Ltd. v.

It is\nample to lay out zones where family values, youth values,\nand the blessings of quiet seclusion and clean air make the\narea a sanctuary for people.\" A necessary corollary of the\nextensive zoning authority bestowed upon local\nmunicipalities, including the authority to create exclusively\nresidential districts, is the authority to make distinctions\nbetween different uses and to exclude some uses within\ncertain zones. Indeed, zoning is by its very design\ndiscriminatory, and that, alone, does not render it invalid.\n\nConcomitantly, in Lakewood, Oh. Congregation of\nJehovah’s Witnesses, Inc. v. City of Lakewood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"414083\"><a href=\"/opinion/414083/lakewood-ohio-congregation-of-jehovahs-witnesses-inc-v-city-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">699</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 1983), the Sixth Circuit upheld a zoning\nordinance that prohibited the construction of church\nbuildings in virtually all residential districts of the city\nusing rational basis review. When the Congregation of\n\n                                23\n\n\nJehovah’s Witnesses was denied a permit to build a church\non a plot of land that the Congregation purchased in an\narea zoned for single-family dwellings, the Congregation\nfiled suit alleging that Lakewood’s ordinance, which created\nareas exclusively for residential use, violated the Free\nExercise Clause of the First Amendment. Noting that, under\ncases such as Village of Euclid and Village of Belle Terre,\nthe city \"may, within constitutional limits, zone to preserve\na peaceful sanctuary for its citizens,\" the Sixth Circuit\nobserved that the \"broad lines\" drawn by the city \"to protect\nits tranquil neighborhoods\" were a \" ‘reasonable margin to\ninsure effective enforcement’ of quiet residential zones.\" Id.\n\fat 308-09. Thus, the Court held that the \"ordinance is\nconstitutional although it creates exclusive residential\ndistricts and thereby prohibits the construction of church\nbuildings in the districts.\" Id.\n\nCases such as Lakewood, as well as Village of Euclid and\nVillage of Belle Terre, demonstrate the breadth of a\nmunicipality’s power to discriminate in the land use\ncontext. Indeed, because the purpose of zoning ordinances\nis to distinguish among uses in order to draft\ncomprehensive municipal plans, a degree of arbitrariness is\ninevitable. The question presented in these cases is when\ndoes a distinction cross the constitutional line. As long as\na municipality has a rational basis for distinguishing\nbetween uses, and that distinction is related to the\nmunicipality’s legitimate goals, then federal courts will be\nreluctant to conclude that the ordinance is improper.\n\nIV. City of Cleburne and \"Similarly Situated\" Uses\n\nWhile City of Cleburne ultimately turned on the fact that\nthe city held an irrational animus toward the mentally\nretarded, the Court provided a useful roadmap for\nanalyzing equal protection challenges of zoning ordinances.\nCity of Cleburne made two determinations crucial to the\noutcome in the case: 1) the proposed use, a group home for\nthe mentally retarded, was similarly situated to the allowed\nuses, other group homes, pursuant to the zoning\nordinance, City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 447-50; and 2)\nthere was no rational reason behind the differential\ntreatment of the similarly situated uses, id. at 450, 461,\n\n                                24\n\n\nwhich appears to have been a function of animus against\nthe retarded. Notably, the Court’s holding that there was no\nrational basis for the city’s distinction between the CLC and\nthe other permitted uses followed only after the Court\ndetermined that CLC and the other permitted uses were\n\"similarly situated.\" This two-step inquiry properly places\nthe initial burden on the complaining party first to\ndemonstrate that it is \"similarly situated\" to an entity that\nit is being treated differently before the local municipality\nmust offer a justification for its ordinance.\n\nOf course, the nature of the issue in City of Cleburne\nrendered quite easy the determination that CLC was\nsimilarly situated to the other permitted uses. The Court\nwas comparing uses that were obviously similarly situated,\nso that the inquiry into whether the rationale offered by the\ncity -- that the uses would have a different impact --\nbecame the crux of the decision. The Court thus framed the\nquestion before it as follows: \"May the city require the\npermit for this facility when other care and multiple-\ndwelling facilities are freely permitted?\" id. at 448; it\npresumed that it was comparing similar uses. Yet, in\nanswering the question presented, the Court relied on the\nfact that the impact on CLC would have to be different from\nthe other similar uses, and not just compared with other,\n\fdissimilar uses permitted in the district. The Court noted\nthat the mentally retarded are \"different,\" but that this\ndifference was \"largely irrelevant unless the . .. home and\nthose who would occupy it would threaten legitimate\ninterests of the city in a way that other permitted uses such\nas boarding houses and hospitals would not.\" Id. (emphasis\nadded). The focus, then, was first and foremost on whether\nsimilarly situated uses were being treated differently.\n\nOther courts have tracked the two-step analysis laid out\nin City of Cleburne, determining first if the uses are\n\"similarly situated\" and, if they are, asking if there is a\nrational basis for distinguishing between them. In\nCornerstone Bible Church v. Hastings, supra , the Eighth\nCircuit relied on City of Cleburne and required the city to\nprovide a rational basis for the \"apparent unequal\ntreatment of similarly situated entities\" only after first\nconcluding that the church was similarly situated to\n\n                                25\n\n\npermitted uses in a commercial zoning district. 948 F.2d at\n472. Similarly, in Christian Gospel Church v. San Francisco,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"537066\"><a href=\"/opinion/537066/christian-gospel-church-inc-v-city-and-county-of-san-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1990), a church sought a permit to\nbuild a church in an area zoned for single-family\nresidences. The Court stated that \"[i]n order to prevail, the\nChurch must make a showing that a class that is similarly\nsituated has been treated disparately.\" Id. at 1225. In\nconcluding that there was no equal protection violation, the\nCourt observed that the church \"was treated no differently\nthan a school or community center would have been,\" and,\nthus, that the church had failed to establish that other\nsimilarly situated uses had been treated differently. Id.\n\nIn sum, the first inquiry a court must make in an equal\nprotection challenge to a zoning ordinance is to examine\nwhether the complaining party is similarly situated to other\nuses that are either permitted as of right, or by special\npermit, in a certain zone. If, and only if, the entities are\nsimilarly situated, then the city must justify its different\ntreatment of the two, perhaps by citing to the different\nimpact that such entities may have on the asserted goal of\nthe zoning plan.\n\nV. Application to the Abington Ordinance\n\nA. The District Court’s Approach\n\nAs noted above, the Congregation moved for partial\nsummary judgment on the ground that the Ordinance was\nfacially unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause\nand the Due Process Clause. The District Court, however,\nproceeded to evaluate whether the Ordinance violated the\nEqual Protection Clause as applied, and did so in order to\n\"avoid making [an] unnecessarily broad constitutional\njudgment.\" Congregation Kol Ami, 161 F. Supp.2d at 436.\n\nRelying on City of Cleburne, the District Court concluded\nthat the Ordinance was unconstitutional as applied to the\n\fCongregation because it did not permit the Congregation to\napply for a special exception in an R-1 Residential District.\nAs the District Court viewed it, the issue was whether the\nTownship’s scheme was rationally related to its proffered\nreason for excluding the Congregation -- a concern over\n\n                                26\n\n\ntraffic, light, and noise pollution. That is, the question was\nwhether it was permissible for the Township to allow uses\nother than residences in the R-1 Residential District, while\nsimultaneously excluding the Congregation. The District\nCourt observed that Abington’s \"traffic, noise and light\nconcerns also exist for the uses currently allowed to request\na special exception.\" Id. at 437. Thus, the court concluded\nthat the means employed by the Ordinance, i.e.,\ndistinguishing between country clubs and the\nCongregation, was not rationally related to the goal of\npreventing traffic, noise, and light pollution in the\nneighborhood. Accordingly, the court ordered the ZHB to\nhold a hearing on whether the Congregation was entitled to\na special exception.\n\nThe Township submits that the District Court erred in its\nequal protection analysis, for which it relied primarily on\nCity of Cleburne. We agree. First, the District Court failed to\nmake the preliminary determination in the equal protection\nanalysis, as we identified above. See supra Section IV. That\nis, the District Court failed to inquire whether the uses\npermitted by special exception, such as country clubs, were\n\"similarly situated\" to religious institutions or to the\nCongregation in particular. Rather, the District Court\nconcluded that because the impact of the uses, either\nsimilar or not, was the same, there could be no rational\nbasis for distinguishing between them, and that the\nCongregation must therefore be able to apply for a special\nexception.\n\nAt oral argument the Congregation claimed that the\nDistrict Court had focused, and that this Court should\nfocus, on the impact of the different uses because that was\nthe proffered reason offered by Abington for distinguishing\nbetween country clubs and religious uses. However, based\non our review of City of Cleburne and other caselaw,\ndiscussed supra Section III, we conclude that this argument\noverlooks the fact that Abington need not justify its\nexclusion of religious uses if such a use is not similarly\nsituated to, for example, a country club. As the Ninth\nCircuit noted in Christian Gospel Church,\"[i]n order to\nprevail, the Church must make a showing that a class that\nis similarly situated has been treated disparately.\" </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n                                <span class=\"page\">27</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\nat 1225. It is not until this showing is made that it becomes\n\"incumbent on the City to provide a rational basis for [the]\napparent unequal treatment of similarly situated entities.\"\nCornerstone, 948 F.2d at 472. That Abington offered a\n\frationale based on the Congregation’s impact does not\nrelieve the Congregation of its burden to demonstrate, at\nthe outset, that it is similarly situated to the uses permitted\nby special exception in the R-1 District.\n\nSo then, the Congregation must demonstrate that it is\nsimilarly situated to other permitted entities by\ndemonstrating that it is similarly situated in relation to the\nTownship’s purpose in creating the R-1 Residential District.\nSee, e.g., Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"100934\"><a href=\"/opinion/100934/village-of-euclid-v-ambler-realty-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n388 (1926) (\"[T]he question whether the power exists to\nforbid the erection of a building of a particular kind or for\na particular use . . . is to be determined, not by an abstract\nconsideration of the building or of the thing considered\napart, but by considering it in connection with the\ncircumstances and the locality.\").\n\nThe Township’s purpose in creating R-1, as stated in the\nOrdinance, is to provide \"low density single-family,\nneighborhoods.\" [1000a]. The burden on the Congregation\nis to demonstrate that it is just as compatible with this goal\nas is, for example, a country club. To be sure, it may be\nthat an inquiry into whether something is \"similarly\nsituated\" will involve an inquiry into whether the two\nentities have the same impact. But the analysis for equal\nprotection purposes is more nuanced. In City of Cleburne,\nfor example, the nature of the uses was dwellings for large\nnumbers of people. In this case, a court must evaluate not\nonly the impact of the Congregation as compared with a\ncountry club, the example raised by the Congregation at\noral argument, but also what requirements or needs it may\nhave in order to operate within the neighborhood. Should\nthe Congregation prevail, the burden then shifts to the\nTownship to offer any evidence of a rational reason for\ndistinguishing between the uses.\n\nWe will turn presently to the similarity   of uses issue. But\nfirst we are constrained to note that if   we were to conclude,\nas the District Court did, that all uses   with a similar impact\nmust be treated alike, regardless of the   fact that such uses\n\n                                28\n\n\nmay be fundamentally distinct, we would turn zoning law\non its head. That is, such a conclusion would mean not\nonly that churches must be allowed in a zone where\ncountry clubs are allowed (based on the conclusion that\ncountry clubs impact light, traffic and noise as well), but\nalso, by necessity, that a host of other uses that impact\nlight, traffic and noise must also be permitted in such\nzones. But this would strip of any real meaning the\nauthority bestowed upon municipalities to zone since the\nbroad power to zone carries with it the corollary authority\nto discriminate against a host of uses that a municipality\ndetermines are not particularly suited for a certain district.\nPlacing the burden on the complaining party first to\nestablish that it is similarly situated with other, permitted\nuses preserves the clearly established local authority in the\nland use context. The District Court did not do this and\n\fhence its judgment must be set aside. To the extent that\nthe District Court’s conclusion rests on the notion that a\n\"house of worship inherently further[s] the public welfare,\"\nCongregation Kol Ami, 161 F. Supp.2d at 437, it is seriously\nproblematic for the reasons set forth in the margin. 5\n\n(Text continued on page 31)\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n5. The Congregation concedes that \"a municipality may indeed decree\nthat some [uses] are suitable in a particular district and some are not.\nFor example, it could decide that it wishes to permit golf clubs in a\nresidential neighborhood, but exclude tennis clubs.\" The Congregation\nalso acknowledges that \"a local government may generally exclude a use\nfrom a residential zone because the use ‘lacks residential character,’\neven if the excluded use would be similarly intense as those permitted.\"\nHowever, the Congregation contends that a local government \"may not\npermit any of those things and prohibit houses of worship and rely on\n‘compatibility with residential life’ as its reason for distinguishing the\nuses.\" In its submission, \"The Constitution privileges the activity of\nreligious worship at least to this extent: that it bars government from\nfinding nonreligious uses, other than ‘residences’ themselves, permissible\nwithin a residential district, while excluding religious uses for reasons\nrelated solely to the ‘character’ of the activity.\"\n\nThis argument, which is essentially a challenge to the facial validity of\nthe Ordinance under the Equal Protection Clause, is not necessary to\nour disposition of the case, nor do we think it prudent to pass upon it\nnow; as the District Court noted in ruling on the Ordinance as applied\nto the Congregation, and as the Supreme Court observed in City of\nCleburne, it is preferable, when possible, to\"avoid making unnecessarily\n\n                                29\n\n\nbroad constitutional judgments.\" City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 447; see\nalso Congregation Kol Ami, 161 F. Supp. 2d at 436. However, we do note\nthat this argument seems to boil down to a contention that religious\ninstitutions get a preference in the land use context, and we think that\nsuch a preference would pose a significant problem.\n\nFirst, under Employment Div., Dep’t of Human Resources of Ore. v.\nSmith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990), a local government must even-handedly\napply its laws and cannot single out religion for either discriminatory or\npreferential treatment. Id. at 879 (\"the right of free exercise does not\nrelieve an individual of the obligation to comply with a ‘valid and neutral\nlaw of general applicability on the ground that the law proscribes (or\nprescribes) conduct that his religion prescribes (or proscribes).’ \"). As the\nCourt observed, \"We have never held that an individual’s religious beliefs\nexcuse him from compliance with an otherwise valid law prohibiting\nconduct that the State is free to regulate.\" Id. at 878-79. Second, a\nconclusion that religious uses may not be excluded from residential\ndistricts takes away the deference that has been granted to local\nmunicipalities to make a determination whether or not such a use is\nsuited for a residential district. As stated at oral argument, it creates a\n\"cookie-cutter\" approach to zoning that seems contrary to, at the very\nleast, the Supreme Court’s observation that \"regulation of land use is\nperhaps the quintessential state activity.\" FERC v.

Therefore, we may analyze whether the\nCongregation is similarly situated to uses permitted by\nspecial exception in the R-1 Residential District, i.e.,\nwhether, as submitted by the Congregation at oral\nargument, Congregation Kol Ami is similarly situated to a\ncountry club. We are tempted to do this because the\nDistrict Court, albeit in summary fashion, did so, and\nbecause delay in disposition of this matter impedes the\nCongregation’s relocation efforts.\n\nIn response to questioning at oral argument, the\nCongregation contends that it is similarly situated to a\ncountry club, a use that is permitted by special exception\nin the R-1 Residential District. In its submission, a country\nclub conducts activities at the same time and with the\nsame number of people as the Congregation would, yet the\ncountry club is permitted by special exception but the\nCongregation is not. The Congregation submits that it\nshould make no difference that \"Congregation\" Kol Ami,\nand not \"Country Club\" Kol Ami, applied for a special\nexception.\n\nIf Abington permitted full-scale country clubs, this\nargument might have some force. It is unclear however,\nbased on a review of the Abington Ordinance, whether\ncountry clubs, as described by the Congregation, are\npermitted in the R-1 Residential District in Abington.\nLeaving aside the religious events conducted at the\nsynagogues, which have no analogue to any of the uses\n_________________________________________________________________\n\fLower Merion Township, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Pa.

Outdoor\n       recreation shall not include amusement parks, open\n       space recreational uses, overnight camping parks, or\n       other uses specifically provided herein.\n\n(Emphasis added). [1098a].\n\nThis ordinance is not a model of clarity, but its text does\nnot appear to permit full-scale country clubs. While\n\"country clubs\" are permitted within the meaning of\n\"outdoor recreation,\" when read in connection with the\npermitted \"outdoor recreation\" it seems that country clubs\nlike those envisioned by the Congregation are not\npermitted. For example, the use permits miniature golf\ncourses, not full-scale golf courses, which is a limitation\nthat seems to restrict the possibility that any grand country\nclub could or would locate in the R-1 Residential District.\nRather, under the text of the Ordinance the type of country\nclub permitted in the R-1 Residential District appears\nspecifically designed to be an accessory use and, as such,\nto serve those uses listed in the sentence preceding the list\nof accessory uses, such as miniature golf courses,\nswimming pools, and tennis courts. Under this reading, the\nCongregation’s argument that such clubs could be used for\n\n                                32\n\n\nweddings and other celebrations would be inconsistent with\nthe precise language of the Ordinance.6\n\fBut this argument, which depends on a rather crabbed\ncharacterization of \"country club,\" is less than fully\nconvincing. At all events, because the ordinance is so\npoorly written that we cannot be sure what it means, we\nwill remand so that the District Court can consider the\nsimilarity issue in the first instance. In consideration of this\nremand, we make a number of observations for the\nguidance of the District Court.\n\nFirst, we note that of the uses permitted by special\nexception in the R-1 Residential District, the country club\ncomparison seems to be the only possible similarity. 7 We\nare mindful that in City of Cleburne, the different housing\narrangements used for comparison were, essentially,\nmultiple housing arrangements. It is hard to describe how\none of the arrangements differed from the other insofar as\nits use was concerned. Clearly, as the similarity of use\nwanes, so too the inequality in treatment will be\nincreasingly tolerated under the law. On the basis of the\npresent record, it seems doubtful that the Congregation is\nsimilarly situated to the other uses permitted by special\nexception in R-1. Kennels, riding academies, and outdoor\nrecreation facilities are very low-intense uses of land that\npreserve residential character. [1074a-75a, 1098a]. Train\n_________________________________________________________________\n\n6. We note, in this regard, that restaurants and clubs in general are not\npermitted either by right or by special exception in the R-1 Residential\nDistrict. Rather, restaurants are permitted only in commercial districts,\nsuch as in the Town Commercial District [1007a], Special Commercial\nDistrict [1010a], Planned Business Districts[1014a], Mixed Use Districts\n[1028a], and as an accessory use to a golf course [1097a]. \"Clubs\" are\npermitted in the Apartment-Office Districts [1018a], Mixed Use Districts\n[1028a], and Recreation/Conservation Districts[1036a]. Country clubs of\nthe type conceived of by the Congregation, with full-scale golf courses,\nare permitted in the Community Service Districts by conditional use\npermit (where houses of worship are permitted by right), Apartment-\nOffice Districts, and Recreational/Conservation Districts by special\nexception. [1019a, 1036a].\n\n7. Although the notion that a country club and a synagogue are similarly\nsituated at first seems counterintuitive, perhaps an explanation (beyond\nsimilarity of impacts) can be found.\n\n                                33\n\n\nstations and bus shelters are located adjacent to (usually\nlong established) public rights of way which transport\nsuburban commuters into Philadelphia and support\nregional transportation. [1108a]. Municipal complexes,\nemergency services, and utility facilities for sewers and\nelectricity are indispensable to the health, safety, and\nadministration of a residential community [1094a, 1108a].\nAll of these uses would appear to have functionally different\npurposes than the Congregation, and would seem\ncompatible with a low-density residential neighborhood so\nas to represent a lower likelihood of generating negative\nsecondary effects.\n\fIn addition to the fact that the uses permitted by right or\nby special exception differ in scale and purpose from the\nCongregation, we note that the Congregation’s proposed use\npresents an intense use of the land, which the Township\nmight determine was incompatible with its residential\ndesignation. Services and educational classes typically\nrequire a large number of people to arrive and leave by car\nat roughly the same time. As we previously observed, a\nmunicipality may chart out a \"quiet place where yards are\nwide, people few, and motor vehicles restricted are\nlegitimate guidelines in a land-use project addressed to\nfamily needs. . . . The police power is not confined to\nelimination of filth, stench, and unhealthy places. It is\nample to lay out zones where . . . the blessings of quiet\nseclusion and clean air make the area a sanctuary for\npeople.\" Village of Belle Terre, 446 U.S. at 9.\n\nAs represented at oral argument by the Township, the\nCongregation stated at the initial proceeding before the ZHB\nthat it had a membership of 207 families and predicted a\ngrowth to about 350 families. By the time the special\nexception hearing was held, the Congregation was willing to\nput a cap at 450 families. There is no doubt that the\nCongregation is growing, probably due to a popular rabbi.\nThe Congregation may well grow larger. With a large and\ngrowing congregation comes increased traffic and noise.\nIndeed, at the special exception hearing, the Congregation\nreported that it would need to expand the existing parking\nlot to 137 spaces, but might need to make available an\nadditional 54 spaces for reserve parking for heavy-use\n\n                                34\n\n\noccasions. [3904a]. This matter might well be considered by\nthe District Court on remand.\n\nC. Rationality\n\nSince we remand for resolution of the similarity of uses\nissue, we need not reach the ultimate rationality question,\neven though the District Court did so. We do however, offer\nsome observations on that issue should the District Court\nneed to revisit it.\n\nFirst, we note that there is no evidence of anti-Jewish or\nanti-religious animus in the record. Although such evidence\nis not necessary to sustain an equal protection violation,\nthis court has stated that \"negative attitudes or biases,\nunfounded fears or speculation, prejudice, self-interest, or\nignorance [are] arbitrary and irrational\" ends that warrant\nfinding a statute unconstitutional. Midnight Sessions, 945\nF.2d at 685.\n\nSecond, the facts of this case illustrate why religious uses\nmay be, in some cases, incompatible with a place of\"quiet\nseclusion.\" When conducting its Comprehensive Plan in\n1992, the Township determined that institutional uses,\nsuch as schools, churches, and hospitals, have distinctive\nrequirements that would best be addressed by placing them\n\fin particular districts. Specifically, the Township concluded\nthat although these entities \"provide many benefits to the\ncommunity,\" they also \"have specific use, space and\nlocational requirements which are inherently different from\nother land categories . . . [and] necessitate[ ] a separate\nland use classification.\" [889a]. To that end, the CS-\nCommunity Service District was established to meet the\nparticular needs of churches and other institutions.\n[1024a].\n\nIn view of the enormously broad leeway afforded\nmunicipalities in making land use classifications, see\ndiscussion supra, it is strongly arguable that the\nTownship’s decision to group churches together with\nschools, hospitals, and other institutions is rationally\nrelated to the needs of these entities, their impact on\nneighboring properties, and their inherent compatibility or\nincompatibility with adjoining uses. If so, the foregoing\n\n                                35\n\n\nstandard of review in land use cases will be met. Such\nplanning is the raison d’etre of zoning ordinances, and\nbroad latitude is given to authorities that rationally conduct\nthis municipal function. See Euclid, 272 U.S. at 388-89\n(\"The inclusion of a reasonable margin to insure effective\nenforcement, will not put upon a law, otherwise valid, the\nstamp of invalidity.\").\n\nFinally, we do not believe land use planners can assume\nanymore that religious uses are inherently compatible with\nfamily and residential uses. See, e.g., Megachurches as\nMinitowns, NYT F1, F6 (May 9, 2002). Churches may be\nincompatible with residential zones, as they \"bring\ncongestion; they generate traffic and create parking\nproblems; they can cause a deterioration of property values\nin a residential zone . . . .\" Jewish Reconstructionist\nSynagogue v. Village of Roslyn Harbor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2591262\"><a href=\"/opinion/2591262/synagogue-v-roslyn-harbor/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 293\n(1975). Thus, the District Court must refrain from making\na blanket determination that religious institutions are\ninherently compatible, and, as argued by the Congregation,\n\"essential to residential zoning.\" See supra n.5. These\nmatters need to be considered on remand as well.\n\nD. Conclusion\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment and order of the\nDistrict Court will be vacated and the case remanded for\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. The\nspecial exception granted by the ZHB and the land use\npermit issued by the Township are declared to be null and\nvoid. Parties to bear their own costs.\n\nA True Copy:\nTeste:\n\n       Clerk of the United States Court of Appeals\n       for the Third Circuit\n\f36\n\f</pre>",
