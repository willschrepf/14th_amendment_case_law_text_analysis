An Iowa prison official testified it was an \"ongoing problem\" at the time Foster's belongings were searched that \"some inmates got the idea that if they declared something to be legal, we couldn't undeclare it, they could make us... make a search of it all in front of them.\" (Tr. 66.) Foster's two locker boxes did contain legal materials-but also mixed in were twelve personal letters, thirty-three magazines, and numerous other pieces of nonlegal material.

The prison officials' reports and testimony establish that after the prison officials realized Foster's legal and nonlegal materials were mixed together, the officials removed all materials from Foster's presence and separated the legal materials from the nonlegal materials. The officials then left the legal materials in Foster's two locker boxes and took the nonlegal materials to the investigation office where the nonlegal materials alone were thoroughly searched. A prison official testified the legal materials were later searched in Foster's presence. Because Foster does not present any evidence to the contrary, we conclude the district court's finding is not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Foster claims the prison lacks a security interest to justify searching an inmate's legal papers outside that inmate's presence when the inmate has mixed nonlegal material in with his legal papers. We review the district court's conclusion de novo and assume for purposes of this part of our discussion that the mere separation of Foster's legal and nonlegal materials qualifies as a search. <i>See Randolph,</i> 276 F.3d at 403 (standard of review). At the time Foster's materials were searched, Iowa prison officials were bound by the <i>Dee v. Brewer</i> consent decree which gave inmates the right to be present during a search of their legal materials in the absence of exigent circumstances. <i>Wycoff v. Hedgepeth,</i> 34 F.3d 614, 615 (8th Cir.1994). The exigent circumstances exception was based on the prison's \"legitimate security interest in searching outside the inmate's presence for [contraband] that may be secreted in an inmate's legal papers\" such as drugs or plans for illegal activity. <i>Id.</i> at 618. \"Otherwise, security officials fear, the inmate population will learn the search techniques employed and devise methods of concealment that will frustrate future searches.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Explaining how an inmate's presence relates to the prison's security interest, a prison official testified:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, I don't want to send the inmate to school on places [a prison official] may look.
