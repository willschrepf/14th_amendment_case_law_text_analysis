The court\ngenerally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order\nand judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.\n\n      **\n         After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has\ndetermined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the\ndetermination of this appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G).\nThe case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\fgrouped into four categories: (1) He was sexually harassed by Defendant Juanita\n\nMcCulley, a secretary in the education department where Mr. Joseph worked, in\n\nviolation of his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual\n\npunishment and in violation of his Fifth Amendment right to equal protection; (2)\n\nthe Defendants unlawfully retaliated against Mr. Joseph by (a) terminating him\n\nfrom his job in the education department, (b) removing him from the prison GED\n\nprogram, (c) denying him access to the law library and (4) classifying him as in\n\nthe “red card” high-visibility program; (3) the district court abused its discretion\n\nwhen it refused to allow Mr. Joseph to amend his complaint; and (4) the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion when it refused to appoint counsel for Mr. Joseph.\n\n      In his report and recommendation, the magistrate judge determined that the\n\nBureau of Prisons was immune from suit, as were the individual Defendants in\n\ntheir official capacities. The magistrate judge therefore recommended that the\n\nclaims against the Bureau of Prisons and the individual Defendants in their\n\nofficial capacities be dismissed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of\n\nsubject jurisdiction. The magistrate judge also recommended that the claims\n\nagainst the individual Defendants in their individual capacities be dismissed\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim for relief.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f                                     I. DISCUSSION\n\n        We review de novo a district court’s dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n12(b)(1) for lack of subject jurisdiction.    See Redmon ex rel. Redmon v. United\n\nStates , 934 F.2d 1151, 1155 (10th Cir. 1991). We also review de novo a district\n\ncourt’s dismissal pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim\n\nfor relief.   See Bauchman ex rel. Bauchman v. West High Sch.     , 132 F.3d 542, 550\n\n(10th Cir. 1997). We construe the pleadings and papers of a pro se appellant\n\nliberally. See Haines v. Kerner , 404 U.S. 519, 520-21 (1972) (per curiam).\n\n        A. Sexual Harassment\n\n        Mr. Joseph asserted that Ms. McCulley violated his Eighth Amendment\n\nrights by subjecting him to sexual harassment: She allegedly touched him several\n\ntimes in a suggestive manner and exposed her breasts to him. “As a threshold\n\nmatter of law, we must first decide whether [Mr. Joseph] could have suffered, at\n\nthe hands of corrections officials, any deprivation of his constitutional rights\n\nunder the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the cruel and\n\nunusual punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment.” Harris by and through\n\nHarris v. Maynard, 843 F.2d 414, 415 (10th Cir. 1988).\n\n        “We agree . . . that an inmate has a constitutional right to be secure in h[is]\n\nbodily integrity and free from attack by prison guards.” Hovater v. Robinson, 1\n\nF.3d 1063, 1068 (10th Cir. 1993). Further, “because the sexual harassment or\n\n\n                                             -3-\n\fabuse of an inmate by a corrections officer can never serve a legitimate\n\npenological purpose and may well result in severe physical and psychological\n\nharm, such abuse can, in certain circumstances, constitute the ‘unnecessary and\n\nwanton infliction of pain,’” that is forbidden by the Eighth Amendment. Freitas\n\nv. Ault, 109 F.3d 1335, 1338 (8th Cir. 1997) (quoting Whitley v. Albers, 475 U.S.\n\n312, 319 (1986)) (internal quotation marks omitted)); see also Barney v.\n\nPulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299, 1310 (10th Cir. 1998) (recognizing inmates’ sexual\n\nharassment allegations may be sufficiently serious to state a claim under the\n\nEighth Amendment). “To prevail on a constitutional claim of sexual harassment,\n\nan inmate must therefore prove, as an objective matter, that the alleged abuse or\n\nharassment caused ‘pain’ and, as a subjective matter, that the officer in question\n\nacted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind.” Freitas, 109 F.3d at 1338 (citing\n\nHudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. 1, 8 (1992)).\n\n      We agree with the district court that the alleged instances of sexual\n\nharassment were not “objectively, sufficiently serious” to demonstrate a use of\n\nforce of a constitutional magnitude. See Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 834\n\n(1994) (internal quotation marks omitted). See also, Boddie v. Schnieder, 105\n\nF.3d 857, 860-61 (2d Cir. 1997) (noting that sexual abuse by a corrections officer\n\nmay be cognizable as a violation of a prisoner's Eighth Amendment rights, but\n\nultimately holding that the circumstances alleged by the plaintiff were not “severe\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fenough to be objectively, sufficiently serious”) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). In addition, there is no evidence of deliberate indifference on the part\n\nof the Defendants. Cf. Barney, 143 F.3d at 1310 (noting that inmates failed to\n\nshow deliberate indifference). Finally, as to Mr. Joseph’s claim that the unwanted\n\ntouching caused him emotional distress and violated the Eighth Amendment, the\n\nclaim is insufficient to implicate the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n\n      B. Retaliation\n\n      With respect to plaintiff's retaliation claims, Mr. Joseph must demonstrate\n\nthat the various disciplinary actions were taken because of the exercise of his\n\nconstitutional rights. See Peterson v. Shanks, 149 F.3d 1140, 1144 (10th Cir.\n\n1998). Mr. Joseph claims that the denial of access to the prison law library, his\n\nloss of his prison job, his expulsion from the GED program, and his classification\n\nas a “red card” high-visibility prisoner for escapees, sexual deviants, and sexual\n\nstalkers violated his Fifth Amendment rights to equal protection, his First\n\nAmendment rights, and his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and\n\nunusual punishment.\n\n      In Craig v. Eberly, 164 F.3d 490 (10th Cir. 1998), we summarized the\n\napplicable standards for constitutional challenges to prison conditions:\n\n      [J]ail officials [must] provide humane conditions of confinement by\n      ensuring [that] inmates receive the basic necessities of adequate food,\n\n                                         -5-\n\f       clothing, shelter, and medical care and by taking reasonable measures\n       to guarantee the inmates’ safety. To hold a jailer personally liable for\n       violating an inmate’s right to humane conditions of confinement, a\n       plaintiff must satisfy two requirements, consisting of an objective and\n       subjective component.\n                The objective component requires that the alleged deprivation be\n       sufficiently serious. . . . [J]ail conditions may be restrictive and even\n       harsh without violating constitutional rights. Indeed, only those\n       deprivations denying the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities\n       . . . are sufficiently grave to form\n       the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation. This inquiry turns not only\n       on the severity of the alleged deprivations, but also on their duration.\n\nId. at 495 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n              1. Loss of Job and Expulsion from the GED Program\n\n       As to Mr. Joseph’s loss of his job and expulsion from the GED program,\n\n“[p]risoners have no constitutional right to educational or vocational\n\nopportunities during incarceration.” Wishon v. Gammon, 978 F.2d 446, 450 (8th\n\nCir. 1992); see also Templeman v. Gunter, 16 F.3d 367, 370 (10th Cir. 1994)\n\n(stating that “[w]ithout . . . a statute [entitling a prisoner to a prison job],\n\nprisoners do not have a constitutional right to employment”). Mr. Joseph states\n\nno Eighth Amendment claim.\n\n       As to his equal protection claim, “if the state provides educational or\n\nvocational opportunities to its prisoners, it cannot deny equal access to such\n\nservices to all prisoners absent a rational basis.” Wishon, 978 F.2d at 449; see\n\nalso Barney, 143 F.3d at 1312 n.15 (“The Equal Protection Clause in the prison-\n\nconditions context is usually invoked to remedy disparities in educational,\n\n                                            -6-\n\fvocational, and recreational programs offered to male and female inmates.”)\n\n(citation omitted). There is no evidence that Mr. Joseph was treated differently\n\nfrom other inmates who were similarly situated. Mr. Joseph’s equal protection\n\nclaim also fails.\n\n             2. Access to Law Library\n\n      As to the denial of access to the law library, to state a cognizable claim\n\nunder Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343 (1996), Mr. Joseph had to demonstrate an\n\nactual injury that hindered his effort to pursue a nonfrivolous legal claim. See id.\n\nat 351-53. There is no allegation that Mr. Joseph’s ability to litigate this claim or\n\nany others have been diminished as a result of the denial of access. In addition,\n\nMr. Joseph points to only one request for law library services. Mr. Joseph’s\n\nallegations of constitutional deprivations in this regard are unsubstantial.\n\n             3. “Red Card” Status\n\n       The Constitution does not entitle an inmate to any particular degree of\n\nliberty in prison; thus, changes to an inmate’s prison classification do not involve\n\ndeprivations of liberty. See Templeman, 16 F.3d at 369. Mr. Joseph’s\n\nclassification on “red card” status amounts to a security classification decision,\n\nanalogous to a transfer to administrative segregation resulting from disciplinary\n\nviolations. See id.\n\n      Although a state may create liberty interests that are protected by the Due\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fProcess Clause, such interests\n\n             will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which,\n             while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected\n             manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process\n             Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and\n             significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the\n             ordinary incidents of prison life.\n\nSandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995) (citations omitted). Moreover, our\n\nreview of the record fails to reveal the imposition of the “atypical and significant\n\nhardship” contemplated by Sandin or procedural irregularities leading to his\n\nclassification on red-card status placement in administrative segregation. Under\n\nthese circumstances, there was no violation of Mr. Joseph’s due process rights.\n\nNor were his First Amendment or equal protection rights affected. Mr. Joseph\n\nhas failed to allege or show harm that he has suffered by being placed on red-card\n\nstatus or that similarly situated individuals of different races were treated\n\ndifferently. See Powells v. Minnehaha County Sheriff Dep’t, 198 F.3d 711, 712\n\n(8th Cir. 1999).\n\n      C. Appointment of Counsel\n\n      Mr. Joseph argues the district court erred in denying his motion to appoint\n\ncounsel. “We review the denial of appointment of counsel in a civil case for an\n\nabuse of discretion.” Rucks v. Boergermann, 57 F.3d 978, 979 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nIn considering whether to appoint counsel, the factors the district court should\n\nconsider include “‘the merits of the litigant’s claims, the nature of the factual\n\n                                          -8-\n\fissues raised in the claims, the litigant’s ability to present his claims, and the\n\ncomplexity of the legal issues raised by the claims.’” Id. at 979 (quoting\n\nWilliams v. Meese, 926 F.2d 994, 996 (10th Cir.1991)). After careful review of\n\nthe record, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nMr. Joseph’s motion to appoint counsel.\n\n      D. Motion to Amend Complaint\n\n      We review the district court’s denial of a motion to amend a complaint for\n\nan abuse of discretion. See Lambertsen v. Utah Dep’t of Corrections, 79 F.3d\n\n1024, 1029 (10th Cir.1996). The magistrate judge noted that Mr. Joseph offered\n\nno new facts to include in his complaint to cure any deficiencies and that he did\n\nnot tender an amended complaint to the court. The district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Mr. Joseph’s motion to amend.\n\n                                  II. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s order granting the\n\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss and we deny Mr. Joseph’s motion to proceed in\n\nforma pauperis.\n\n                                                 Entered for the Court,\n\n\n\n                                                 Robert H.

Sexual Harassment\n\n        Mr. Joseph asserted that Ms. McCulley violated his Eighth Amendment\n\nrights by subjecting him to sexual harassment: She allegedly touched him several\n\ntimes in a suggestive manner and exposed her breasts to him. “As a threshold\n\nmatter of law, we must first decide whether [Mr. Joseph] could have suffered, at\n\nthe hands of corrections officials, any deprivation of his constitutional rights\n\nunder the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and the cruel and\n\nunusual punishments clause of the Eighth Amendment.” Harris by and through\n\nHarris v.

In addition, there is no evidence of deliberate indifference on the part\n\nof the Defendants. Cf. Barney, 143 F.3d at 1310 (noting that inmates failed to\n\nshow deliberate indifference). Finally, as to Mr. Joseph’s claim that the unwanted\n\ntouching caused him emotional distress and violated the Eighth Amendment, the\n\nclaim is insufficient to implicate the Eighth Amendment.\n\n\n\n      B. Retaliation\n\n      With respect to plaintiff's retaliation claims, Mr. Joseph must demonstrate\n\nthat the various disciplinary actions were taken because of the exercise of his\n\nconstitutional rights. See Peterson v. Shanks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755905\"><a href=\"/opinion/755905/david-s-peterson-v-john-shanks-warden-wilfred-romero-and-major-ruben/\"><span class=\"volume\">149</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1144 (10th Cir.\n\n1998). Mr. Joseph claims that the denial of access to the prison law library, his\n\nloss of his prison job, his expulsion from the GED program, and his classification\n\nas a “red card” high-visibility prisoner for escapees, sexual deviants, and sexual\n\nstalkers violated his Fifth Amendment rights to equal protection, his First\n\nAmendment rights, and his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and\n\nunusual punishment.\n\n      In Craig v. Eberly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"157299\"><a href=\"/opinion/157299/craig-v-eberly/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (10th Cir. 1998), we summarized the\n\napplicable standards for constitutional challenges to prison conditions:\n\n      [J]ail officials [must] provide humane conditions of confinement by\n      ensuring [that] inmates receive the basic necessities of adequate food,\n\n                                         -5-\n\f       clothing, shelter, and medical care and by taking reasonable measures\n       to guarantee the inmates’ safety. To hold a jailer personally liable for\n       violating an inmate’s right to humane conditions of confinement, a\n       plaintiff must satisfy two requirements, consisting of an objective and\n       subjective component.\n                The objective component requires that the alleged deprivation be\n       sufficiently serious. . . . [J]ail conditions may be restrictive and even\n       harsh without violating constitutional rights. Indeed, only those\n       deprivations denying the minimal civilized measure of life’s necessities\n       . . . are sufficiently grave to form\n       the basis of an Eighth Amendment violation. This inquiry turns not only\n       on the severity of the alleged deprivations, but also on their duration.\n\nId. at 495 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n              1. Loss of Job and Expulsion from the GED Program\n\n       As to Mr. Joseph’s loss of his job and expulsion from the GED program,\n\n“[p]risoners have no constitutional right to educational or vocational\n\nopportunities during incarceration.” Wishon v. Gammon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593362\"><a href=\"/opinion/593362/robert-shawn-wishon-v-james-tony-gammon-jim-moore-dick-moore-george/\"><span class=\"volume\">978</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">446</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 450 (8th\n\nCir. 1992); see also Templeman v. Gunter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"662539\"><a href=\"/opinion/662539/vernon-templeman-v-frank-gunter-mr-gasko-george-sullivan-lou-a-hesse/\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 370 (10th Cir. 1994)\n\n(stating that “[w]ithout . . . a statute [entitling a prisoner to a prison job],\n\nprisoners do not have a constitutional right to employment”). Mr. Joseph states\n\nno Eighth Amendment claim.\n\n       As to his equal protection claim, “if the state provides educational or\n\nvocational opportunities to its prisoners, it cannot deny equal access to such\n\nservices to all prisoners absent a rational basis.” Wishon, 978 F.2d at 449; see\n\nalso Barney, 143 F.3d at 1312 n.15 (“The Equal Protection Clause in the prison-\n\nconditions context is usually invoked to remedy disparities in educational,\n\n                                            -6-\n\fvocational, and recreational programs offered to male and female inmates.”)\n\n(citation omitted). There is no evidence that Mr. Joseph was treated differently\n\nfrom other inmates who were similarly situated. Mr. Joseph’s equal protection\n\nclaim also fails.\n\n             2. Access to Law Library\n\n      As to the denial of access to the law library, to state a cognizable claim\n\nunder Lewis v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1996), Mr. Joseph had to demonstrate an\n\nactual injury that hindered his effort to pursue a nonfrivolous legal claim. See id.\n\nat 351-53. There is no allegation that Mr. Joseph’s ability to litigate this claim or\n\nany others have been diminished as a result of the denial of access. In addition,\n\nMr. Joseph points to only one request for law library services. Mr. Joseph’s\n\nallegations of constitutional deprivations in this regard are unsubstantial.\n\n             3. “Red Card” Status\n\n       The Constitution does not entitle an inmate to any particular degree of\n\nliberty in prison; thus, changes to an inmate’s prison classification do not involve\n\ndeprivations of liberty. See Templeman, 16 F.3d at 369. Mr. Joseph’s\n\nclassification on “red card” status amounts to a security classification decision,\n\nanalogous to a transfer to administrative segregation resulting from disciplinary\n\nviolations. See id.\n\n      Although a state may create liberty interests that are protected by the Due\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fProcess Clause, such interests\n\n             will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which,\n             while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected\n             manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process\n             Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and\n             significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the\n             ordinary incidents of prison life.\n\nSandin v. Conner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117957\"><a href=\"/opinion/117957/sandin-v-conner/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 484 (1995) (citations omitted). Moreover, our\n\nreview of the record fails to reveal the imposition of the “atypical and significant\n\nhardship” contemplated by Sandin or procedural irregularities leading to his\n\nclassification on red-card status placement in administrative segregation. Under\n\nthese circumstances, there was no violation of Mr. Joseph’s due process rights.\n\nNor were his First Amendment or equal protection rights affected. Mr. Joseph\n\nhas failed to allege or show harm that he has suffered by being placed on red-card\n\nstatus or that similarly situated individuals of different races were treated\n\ndifferently. See Powells v. Minnehaha County Sheriff Dep’t, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767035\"><a href=\"/opinion/767035/ricky-l-powells-v-minnehaha-county-sheriff-department-minnehaha-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">711</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 712\n\n(8th Cir. 1999).\n\n      C. Appointment of Counsel\n\n      Mr. Joseph argues the district court erred in denying his motion to appoint\n\ncounsel. “We review the denial of appointment of counsel in a civil case for an\n\nabuse of discretion.” Rucks v. Boergermann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"697779\"><a href=\"/opinion/697779/gregory-lee-rucks-v-gary-boergermann/\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 979 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\nIn considering whether to appoint counsel, the factors the district court should\n\nconsider include “‘the merits of the litigant’s claims, the nature of the factual\n\n                                          -8-\n\fissues raised in the claims, the litigant’s ability to present his claims, and the\n\ncomplexity of the legal issues raised by the claims.’” Id. at 979 (quoting\n\nWilliams v. Meese, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"556551\"><a href=\"/opinion/556551/55-fair-emplpraccas-390-55-empl-prac-dec-p-40577-haywood-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">926</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 996 (10th Cir.1991)). After careful review of\n\nthe record, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying\n\nMr. Joseph’s motion to appoint counsel.\n\n      D. Motion to Amend Complaint\n\n      We review the district court’s denial of a motion to amend a complaint for\n\nan abuse of discretion. See Lambertsen v. Utah Dep’t of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"153180\"><a href=\"/opinion/153180/lambertsen-v-ut-dept-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1024</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1029 (10th Cir.1996). The magistrate judge noted that Mr. Joseph offered\n\nno new facts to include in his complaint to cure any deficiencies and that he did\n\nnot tender an amended complaint to the court. The district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Mr. Joseph’s motion to amend.\n\n                                  II. CONCLUSION\n\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s order granting the\n\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss and we deny Mr. Joseph’s motion to proceed in\n\nforma pauperis.\n\n                                                 Entered for the Court,\n\n\n\n                                                 Robert H.
