For the\n\nreasons that follow, we will affirm the District Court’s judgment.\n\n       This case arises from the result of a routine search of Santiago’s prison bunk at the\n\nFederal Correctional Institution at Fort Dix, New Jersey. During this search, conducted\n\non December 22, 2004, a correctional officer was injured by a tattoo gun needle\n\nsurreptitiously taped to the frame of Santiago’s bunk. Santiago was charged with\n\npossession of a hazardous tool (Code 108A) and conduct which disrupts the orderly\n\nrunning of the institution (Code 299), both violations of the Bureau of Prison’s (“BOP”)\n\ndisciplinary code.\n\n       On December 22, 2004, Santiago was provided a copy of an incident report\n\ndescribing the charges against him. Santiago was then given a timely hearing before the\n\nUnit Discipline Committee (“UDC”) where he denied the charges. Citing the seriousness\n\nof the charges, the UDC referred the case to a Disciplinary Hearing Officer (“DHO”). At\n\nthe initial DHO hearing, on January 3, 2005, Santiago claimed he had never received a\n\ncopy of the incident report. A rescheduled hearing was held on January 6, 2005. Prior to\n\nthat hearing, Santiago was informed of his rights and a staff representative was appointed\n\nfor him. Santiago requested no witnesses at the hearing and again reiterated his\n\ninnocence. The DHO reviewed the incident report, Santiago’s statement, three\n\nphotographs showing the needle, and a medical report describing the injury to the officer\n\nwho discovered the needle. The DHO determined that the weight of that evidence\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fsupported a finding that Santiago’s actions were consistent with a violation of the BOP\n\nCode. For the Code 108A violation, Santiago received 60 days in disciplinary\n\nsegregation, 40 days disallowance of good-conduct time, and 108 days forfeiture of non-\n\nvested good-conduct time. On the Code 299 violation, the DHO imposed 30 days in\n\ndisciplinary segregation, 27 days disallowance of good-conduct time, and 54 days\n\nforfeiture of non-vested good-conduct time.\n\n       After exhausting his administrative remedies, Santiago filed the instant § 2241\n\npetition claiming that the DHO’s finding of guilt was not supported by sufficient evidence\n\nand that he was denied due process. In support of these claims, Santiago argued that the\n\nBOP failed to conduct an adequate investigation into whether he was responsible for the\n\nneedle and that certain witnesses and testimony were not made available to him during his\n\nhearing. In an order entered on September 20, 2006, the District Court denied Santiago’s\n\nhabeas petition, holding that Santiago received procedural due process, in accordance\n\nwith Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539 (1974).1 The Court specifically noted that the\n\nDHO’s disciplinary finding was supported by sufficient evidence, and that the sanctions\n\nimposed were within the permissible range for Santiago’s offenses. Santiago filed a\n\n\n\n       1\n         At a prison disciplinary hearing, due process requires that the inmate: (i) appear\nbefore an impartial decision-making body; (ii) be given at least 24 hours’ written notice\nof the charges; (iii) be afforded an opportunity to call witnesses and present documentary\nevidence; (iv) be permitted assistance from an inmate representative; and (v) receive a\nwritten decision explaining the decision-maker’s conclusions. See Wolff, 418 U.S. at\n563-71. Further, the decision-maker’s conclusion must be supported by at least “some\nevidence.” Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst. v. Hill, 472 U.S. 445, 454-56 (1985).\n\n                                            -3-\n\ftimely appeal.2\n\n       To the extent that Santiago argues that the DHO’s finding of guilt was false\n\nbecause there was no evidence to support it, we disagree. In order to comport with due\n\nprocess, a disciplinary decision must have support, but only by “some evidence” in the\n\nrecord. Hill, 472 U.S. at 454-56. The Hill standard is minimal and does not require\n\nexamination of the entire record, an independent assessment of the credibility of\n\nwitnesses, or even a weighing of the evidence. See Thompson v. Owens, 889 F.2d 500,\n\n502 (3d Cir. 1989). We agree with the District Court that some evidence existed to\n\nsupport the DHO’s conclusions. Id. at 564-65; see also Hill, 472 U.S. at 455-56.\n\nAlthough Santiago argues that he had no knowledge of the needle’s presence, it was\n\nfound within an area that Santiago was responsible for keeping contraband-free. Further,\n\nin the absence of direct evidence indicating an inmate’s guilt of possession, the “some\n\nevidence” standard may be satisfied by application of the constructive possession doctrine\n\nin limited circumstances where a small number of inmates are potentially guilty of the\n\noffense charged. See White v. Kane, 860 F. Supp. 1075, 1079 n.5 (E.D. Pa. 1994), aff’d,\n\n52 F.3d 319 (3d Cir. 1995). During the disciplinary proceeding, Santiago also received\n\n\n\n\n       2\n         We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(a). In reviewing a\nfederal habeas judgment, we exercise plenary review over a district court’s legal\nconclusions and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its findings of fact. See Rios v.\nWiley, 201 F.3d 257, 262 (3d Cir. 2000). Although the issues in Santiago’s appeal\ncontain some elements of a factual nature, the inquiry is legal in nature, and we therefore\nexercise plenary review over the District Court’s conclusions regarding this matter. Id.\n\n                                            -4-\n\fthe process due him in accordance with established Supreme Court precedent. See Wolff,\n\n418 U.S. at 563-71. Finally, even if we were to assume that a due process right to\n\nexpungement exists, the District Court properly denied Santiago’s request because he\n\nfailed to establish that the information he sought to have expunged was faulty. Cf. Paine\n\nv. Baker, 595 F.2d 197 (4th Cir. 1979).\n\n       The remainder of Santiago’s claims can be disposed of with little discussion. We\n\nhave reviewed these remaining arguments and find that they are either meritless or\n\nprecluded from review. To the extent that Santiago failed to raise these allegations at any\n\npoint during his prison disciplinary proceedings, or in his § 2241 petition, we will not\n\nconsider them for the first time on appeal. See Morris v. Hoffa, 361 F.3d 177, 191 (3d\n\nCir. 2004) (“[A]bsent compelling circumstances an appellate court will not consider\n\nissues that are raised for the first time on appeal.”)\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court\n\ndenying Santiago’s habeas petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -5-\n\f",

We\n\nhave reviewed these remaining arguments and find that they are either meritless or\n\nprecluded from review. To the extent that Santiago failed to raise these allegations at any\n\npoint during his prison disciplinary proceedings, or in his § 2241 petition, we will not\n\nconsider them for the first time on appeal.
