We will reverse the order and remand the cause to the district c\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                              I.\n\n          On December 6, 1994, Robert Nami, Maurice Thompson, Bart Fernandez\n\nThompson filed a pro se complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the\n\nsubjected to cruel and unusual punishment and denied access to the courts.\n\nplaintiffs were inmates housed in protective custody1 in the Administrative\n\nSupervision Unit (or \"Unit\") at the Wagner Youth Correctional Facility in Bo\n\nJersey.   The defendants are: William Fauver, Commissioner of the New Jersey\n\nCorrections; Joseph Butler, Wagner's Administrator; Willie Boggan, the Assi\n\nSuperintendent of the Unit; and Prem Sinha, the law librarian at Wagner.    Th\n\nseek declaratory and injunctive relief, and compensatory and punitive damage\n\n          The defendants moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss on\nthat: the complaint does not allege specific conduct by the defendants that\n\nplaintiffs; the defendants cannot be held liable under § 1983 on the basis o\n\nsuperior; and the defendants are state officials who are being sued for dama\n\nofficial capacities and are therefore immune from suit under the Eleventh Am\n\ndistrict court found that to the extent the plaintiffs sought injunctive rel\n\ndefendants were not immune under the Eleventh Amendment, but agreed that th\n\nfailed to specify which defendants were responsible for the adoption and exe\n\n1\n          Protective custody inmates are those whose well-being might be im\nthey to remain in the general population.\n\n\n                                 2\n\fvarious policies and practices complained of.       Rather than allowing the plai\n\namend their complaint to correct that deficiency, the district court granted\n\ndismiss.\n\n                                              II.\n\n           Because the district court's final order granted the defendants'\n\ndismiss the complaint under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), our review is plenary.\n\ndetermine whether, under any reasonable reading of the pleadings, the plain\n\nentitled to relief, and we must accept as true the factual allegations in th\n\nand all reasonable inferences that can be drawn therefrom.       Holder v. City\n\n987 F.2d 188, 194 (3d Cir. 1993).     The complaint will be deemed to have alle\n\nfacts if it adequately put the defendants on notice of the essential element\n\nplaintiffs' cause of action.     Since this is a § 1983 action, the plaintiffs\n\nto relief if their complaint sufficiently alleges deprivation of any right s\n\nConstitution.   Id.   In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, we do not inquir\n\nplaintiffs will ultimately prevail, only whether they are entitled to offer\n\nsupport their claims.   Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974).      The di\n\norder granting the defendants' motion to dismiss will be affirmed only if it\n\nthe plaintiffs could prove no set of facts that would entitle them to relie\n\nGibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957).\n\n                                              III.\n\n                                 Cruel and Unusual Punishment\n\n           The plaintiffs' claim of cruel and unusual punishment is based on\n\nallegations:\n\n           1. Inmates at the Unit are \"double celled,\" housed two to a singl\n\nfoot cell with only one bed, so that one of them must sleep on the floor by\n\nCells have solid doors with only a four inch wide window for cell inspection\n\ndifficult to summon help.     Inmates often share cells with others who suffer\n\n\n                                  3\n\fpsychiatric problems and/or who are violent felons, and non-smokers must of\n\nsmokers. Floor space is minimal, effectively confining inmates to their beds\n\nventilation system often shuts down for hours at a time.   Double celling has\n\nrapes and other assaults, as well as psychological stress.   Inmates who refu\n\nup\" have been punished with periods of administrative segregation and loss o\n\n          2. Inmates must spend 24 hours a day in their cells except for ou\n\nrecreation, visits and half-hour to one-hour job assignments.\n\n          3. Out of cell recreation is limited to one two-and-a-half hour p\n\nper week, in contrast to the seven day per week policy enjoyed by the genera\n\nand protective custody inmates in other facilities.   Moreover, during outdoo\n\ninmates are denied bathroom access, resulting in unsanitary conditions in th\n\nyard.   Those who cannot wait to use the bathroom inside risk punishment.\n\n          4. Access to drug and alcohol programs required by the parole boar\n\nand educational programs, is more restricted for inmates in protective custo\n\ninmates in the general population.   General population inmates work at the U\n\nthough a statute prohibits inmates not under protective custody from enterin\n\nprotective custody area.\n\n          5. When transported to other locations -- for example, to visit th\n\ninmates must wear a painful device, the \"black box,\" which is so uncomfortab\n\ninmates are deterred from seeking medical or dental help; general population\n\napparently do not have to wear this device, nor do inmates in protective cus\n\nfacilities.\n\n          6. One of the plaintiffs, Kenneth Thompson, alleges that his requ\n\ndentist and an eye doctor have been ignored.\n\n          Rather than examining the plaintiffs' allegations concerning the c\n\ntheir confinement as a whole, the district court split these allegations int\n\ncategories. First, the court analyzed the double celling allegations, inferr\n\n\n                                4\n\fv. Chapman, 452 U.S. 337 (1981), that double celling is not per se a constit\n\nviolation, and concluded that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim in that\n\nSecond, the court addressed the allegation that there have been increased ra\n\nassaults, finding that the claim based upon these allegations lacked merit b\n\nplaintiffs failed to show \"deliberate indifference,\" citing Young v. Quinla\n\n351, 360 n.22 (3d Cir. 1992).   Finally, the court treated the remaining Eig\n\nallegations as amounting to an equal protection claim, based on a comparison\n\nplaintiffs' treatment with that of the general population of the prison.   It\n\nclaim to likewise be without merit.\n\n          We conclude that the district court erred.   While Rhodes may stand\n\nproposition that double celling does not per se amount to an Eighth Amendmen\n\nit does not stand for the proposition that double celling can never amount\n\nAmendment violation.   The Supreme Court held only that, under the circumstan\n\nparticular case, the double celling in question did not violate the plaintif\n\nAmendment rights. The Court noted that\n          No static `test' can exist by which courts can determine whether\n          conditions of confinement are cruel and unusual, for the Eighth\n          Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of dec\n          that mark the progress of a maturing society.\n\nId. at 346 (citation and internal quotations omitted). The court went on to\n          conditions must not involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction\n          pain, nor may they be grossly disproportionate to the severity of\n          crime warranting imprisonment. . . . [Conditions may constitute c\n          and unusual punishment if] they result[] in unquestioned and serio\n          deprivations of basic human needs . . . , [which] deprive inmates\n          the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities . . . .\n\nId. at 347.\n\n          In other words, it is implicit in Rhodes that double celling can\n\nEighth Amendment violation if combined with other adverse conditions.   Thus,\n\nOwens, 907 F.2d 418 (3d Cir. 1990), we noted that, to determine whether cond\n\nconfinement violate the Eighth Amendment, it is necessary to examine the tot\n\n\n\n                                5\n\fconditions at the institution, and we held that double celling at SCI Pittsb\n\nthe Eighth Amendment because of those conditions.    Id. at 426-427.   Relevant\n\nconsiderations include the length of confinement, the amount of time prisone\n\nin their cells each day, sanitation, lighting, bedding, ventilation, noise,\n\nrehabilitation programs, opportunities for activities outside the cells, and\n\nand functioning of basic physical facilities such as plumbing, ventilation,\n\nId. at 427.   Here, the allegations in the complaint raise another significan\n\nconsideration; that plaintiffs were subject to sexual assaults, and that the\n\nby failing to protect plaintiffs adequately, were deliberately indifferent\n\npotential for this type of harm.    If proven, these allegations, irrespective\n\nthe harm resulted from double celling or other conditions of the confinement\n\nestablish deliberate indifference as contemplated by Rhodes v. Chapman.\n\n          As in Rhodes, courts finding double celling permissible have empha\n\ngeneral prison conditions were otherwise adequate.   Id.   We stress that the\n\nRhodes were different in many ways from those in the case before us (and con\n\ndifferent from the grim conditions related in Tillery).    The cells in Rhode\n\nNonetheless, cells housing two inmates had two-tiered bunk beds, each cell h\n\nair circulation vents and a built-in radio, one wall consisted only of bars\n\n6:30 a.m. and 9:30 p.m. inmates had access to \"dayrooms\" (designed to be cou\n\nliving room at home, each included a television, card tables and chairs).\n\n          The district court failed to analyze the relevant consideration l\n\nNor did the court discuss double celling in the overall context of prison co\n\nthat extent the district court erred.2   Although the complaint alleged that\n\nin rapes and other assaults was a result of double celling, the district co\n\n\n2\n          Since under Tillery the plaintiffs' other Eighth Amendment claims\nunavoidably part of the analysis of the double celling issue, we need not a\nseparately in detail here.\n\n\n                                6\n\fthis allegation separately.      The court found that the plaintiffs did not sta\n\nbecause they had failed \"to indicate any conduct by the defendants which cou\n\n`deliberate indifference.'\" (Dist. Ct. at 9, citing Young v. Quinlan, 960 F\n\nn.22 (3d Cir. 1992)).    Here, the court also erred.\n\n            In Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. 294 (1991), the Supreme Court held\n\nestablish an Eighth Amendment violation an inmate must allege both an objec\n\nthat the deprivation was sufficiently serious -- and a subjective element -\n\nofficial acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind, i.e., deliberate\n\n            It cannot be wholly determined from the record whether in this cas\n\nofficials actually displayed deliberate indifference.     Nonetheless, this com\n\nactually states that \"letters have been written to the [administration] conc\n\nmatters set forth in the complaint.     All requests for administrative remedi\n\nrefused.\"    (Complaint at 3.)   This suggests that the defendants here were on\n\nby plaintiffs' reports of rape, violence and the other conditions alleged in\n\ncomplaint.    Although, by itself, such notice may not equal proof of delibera\n\nindifference, it nevertheless directly contradicts the district court's taci\n\nwhich has no support in the record, that plaintiffs could prove no set of fa\n\neither show deliberate indifference or otherwise entitle them to relief.\n\n            Finally, the district court erred in its consideration of the plai\n\nremaining Eighth Amendment allegations. The court stated that\n          there is no support for the assertion that plaintiffs' constitutio\n          rights are being violated by denying them the same `rights and\n          privileges' afforded to inmates in the general population and this\n          Court defers to the judgment of the prison officials in adopting a\n          executing policies and practices that they believe, in their\n          discretion, are needed to preserve internal order and to maintain\n          institutional security.\n\n\n(Dist. Ct. at 9-10.)    That may be true (although, since the defendants did n\nopportunity to explain the justifications for these \"policies and practices,\n\n\n\n                                   7\n\fassumption that they are legitimate is perhaps premature); however, the plai\n\nto have raised these allegations as part of their Eighth Amendment claim, no\n\nequal protection claim.   For example, the plaintiffs complain about use of \"\n\nnot simply because general population prisoners are not subjected to them, b\n\nthey are so uncomfortable that they deter inmates from seeking medical and d\n\nFor the reasons stated above, these remaining allegations should have been\n\nalong with the issue of double celling, and should at least have been consid\n\nof the plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claims.\n\n          Thus, with regard to the plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claims, we c\n\nthe district court erred.   Based upon the record before us, we cannot say t\n\nplaintiffs would be unable to prove that prison conditions were objectively\n\nand that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to plaintiffs' pligh\n\nthat the district court entertained, but rejected (Dist. Ct. at 5), the pos\n\nplaintiffs may be able to satisfy some deficiencies in their original pleadi\n\nan amended complaint.   Plaintiffs may be able to allege in an amended compla\n\nexample, sufficient facts to support a finding that some defendants display\n\nindifference to certain harms, or that all officials were deliberately indif\n\npossibility that the conditions under which they housed the plaintiffs signi\n\nincreased the possibility of such well-known harms as prison rape.\n\n                                              IV.\n\n                                    Access to the Courts\n\n          The plaintiffs' denial of access to the courts claim is based on t\n\nallegations.   Protective custody inmates are denied access to paralegals or\n\ntrained in law who could assist them with drafting legal papers.   Paralegals\n\navailable to protective custody inmates facing disciplinary charges, while d\n\nrefuses to help protective custody inmates prepare habeas corpus petitions\n\ncomplaints. Moreover, Sinha has attempted to frustrate the plaintiffs in thi\n\n\n                                8\n\fdelaying return of documents and failing to make copies of legal documents.\n\ncustody inmates are effectively prevented from helping each other by a polic\n\nthem from talking to each other through the doors and passing items to betwe\n\nthose who violate that policy risk disciplinary action.   In addition, prison\n\nwith a Catch 22-style problem: in order to obtain access to legal materials,\n\nsubmit written requests for specific materials; however, they cannot effecti\n\nbecause they lack access to the very legal materials that would advise them\n\nmaterials to request.   The plaintiffs also allege that everyone who has att\n\na civil complaint to attack these procedures has been transferred.\n\n          As we stated in Abdul-Akbar v. Watson, 4 F.3d 195, 204 (3d Cir. 19\n\nstandard in resolving a claim of denial of access to the courts is\n\n\n          whether the mix of paralegal services, copying services and avail\n          research materials can provide sufficient information so that a\n          prisoner's claims or defenses can be reasonably and adequately\n          presented.\n\nAs with claims involving double celling, in addressing a claim of denial of\ncourts \"each legal resource package must be evaluated as a whole on a case-\n\nId. at 203.\n\n          However, just as the district court failed to address the plaintif\ncelling claims as a whole, in addressing their claim of denial of access to\n\ndistrict court only analyzed one allegation, denial of access to paralegals.\n\ncourt addressed it by relying on defendant Boggan's affidavit in an unrelate\n\nwhich he states that paralegals are available on written request to help inm\n\nlegal problem or lawsuit.   Because the plaintiffs did not allege that they h\n\nwritten requests, the district court held that they had failed to state a cl\n\nof access to the courts.\n\n\n\n\n                                9\n\f           The district court erred here as well.   In choosing to believe Bog\n\naffidavit, the court failed to take the allegations in the complaint as true\n\nin considering a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).   In addition, the co\n\naddress the remaining allegations at all.   Since the plaintiffs' allegations\n\nevidently false, and since their allegations do not facially indicate that t\n\ncould not state a claim, the district court erred by granting the defendant\n\ndismiss.\n\n                                             V.\n\n           In conclusion, the district court should not have granted the defe\n\nto dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6). We will reverse the judgment of the district\n\nremand the matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                10\n\f",

The defendants are: William Fauver, Commissioner of the New Jersey\n\nCorrections; Joseph Butler, Wagner's Administrator; Willie Boggan, the Assi\n\nSuperintendent of the Unit; and Prem Sinha, the law librarian at Wagner.    Th\n\nseek declaratory and injunctive relief, and compensatory and punitive damage\n\n          The defendants moved under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) to dismiss on\nthat: the complaint does not allege specific conduct by the defendants that\n\nplaintiffs; the defendants cannot be held liable under § 1983 on the basis o\n\nsuperior; and the defendants are state officials who are being sued for dama\n\nofficial capacities and are therefore immune from suit under the Eleventh Am\n\ndistrict court found that to the extent the plaintiffs sought injunctive rel\n\ndefendants were not immune under the Eleventh Amendment, but agreed that th\n\nfailed to specify which defendants were responsible for the adoption and exe\n\n1\n          Protective custody inmates are those whose well-being might be im\nthey to remain in the general population.\n\n\n                                 2\n\fvarious policies and practices complained of.       Rather than allowing the plai\n\namend their complaint to correct that deficiency, the district court granted\n\ndismiss.\n\n                                              II.\n\n           Because the district court's final order granted the defendants'\n\ndismiss the complaint under Fed.

Inmates at the Unit are \"double celled,\" housed two to a singl\n\nfoot cell with only one bed, so that one of them must sleep on the floor by\n\nCells have solid doors with only a four inch wide window for cell inspection\n\ndifficult to summon help.     Inmates often share cells with others who suffer\n\n\n                                  3\n\fpsychiatric problems and/or who are violent felons, and non-smokers must of\n\nsmokers. Floor space is minimal, effectively confining inmates to their beds\n\nventilation system often shuts down for hours at a time.   Double celling has\n\nrapes and other assaults, as well as psychological stress.   Inmates who refu\n\nup\" have been punished with periods of administrative segregation and loss o\n\n          2. Inmates must spend 24 hours a day in their cells except for ou\n\nrecreation, visits and half-hour to one-hour job assignments.\n\n          3. Out of cell recreation is limited to one two-and-a-half hour p\n\nper week, in contrast to the seven day per week policy enjoyed by the genera\n\nand protective custody inmates in other facilities.   Moreover, during outdoo\n\ninmates are denied bathroom access, resulting in unsanitary conditions in th\n\nyard.   Those who cannot wait to use the bathroom inside risk punishment.\n\n          4. Access to drug and alcohol programs required by the parole boar\n\nand educational programs, is more restricted for inmates in protective custo\n\ninmates in the general population.   General population inmates work at the U\n\nthough a statute prohibits inmates not under protective custody from enterin\n\nprotective custody area.\n\n          5. When transported to other locations -- for example, to visit th\n\ninmates must wear a painful device, the \"black box,\" which is so uncomfortab\n\ninmates are deterred from seeking medical or dental help; general population\n\napparently do not have to wear this device, nor do inmates in protective cus\n\nfacilities.\n\n          6. One of the plaintiffs, Kenneth Thompson, alleges that his requ\n\ndentist and an eye doctor have been ignored.\n\n          Rather than examining the plaintiffs' allegations concerning the c\n\ntheir confinement as a whole, the district court split these allegations int\n\ncategories. First, the court analyzed the double celling allegations, inferr\n\n\n                                4\n\fv. Chapman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110518\"><a href=\"/opinion/110518/rhodes-v-chapman/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">337</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1981), that double celling is not per se a constit\n\nviolation, and concluded that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim in that\n\nSecond, the court addressed the allegation that there have been increased ra\n\nassaults, finding that the claim based upon these allegations lacked merit b\n\nplaintiffs failed to show \"deliberate indifference,\" citing Young v. Quinla\n\n351, 360 n.22 (3d Cir. 1992).   Finally, the court treated the remaining Eig\n\nallegations as amounting to an equal protection claim, based on a comparison\n\nplaintiffs' treatment with that of the general population of the prison.   It\n\nclaim to likewise be without merit.\n\n          We conclude that the district court erred.   While Rhodes may stand\n\nproposition that double celling does not per se amount to an Eighth Amendmen\n\nit does not stand for the proposition that double celling can never amount\n\nAmendment violation.   The Supreme Court held only that, under the circumstan\n\nparticular case, the double celling in question did not violate the plaintif\n\nAmendment rights. The Court noted that\n          No static `test' can exist by which courts can determine whether\n          conditions of confinement are cruel and unusual, for the Eighth\n          Amendment must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of dec\n          that mark the progress of a maturing society.\n\nId. at 346 (citation and internal quotations omitted). The court went on to\n          conditions must not involve the wanton and unnecessary infliction\n          pain, nor may they be grossly disproportionate to the severity of\n          crime warranting imprisonment. . . . [Conditions may constitute c\n          and unusual punishment if] they result[] in unquestioned and serio\n          deprivations of basic human needs . . . , [which] deprive inmates\n          the minimal civilized measure of life's necessities . . . .\n\nId. at 347.\n\n          In other words, it is implicit in Rhodes that double celling can\n\nEighth Amendment violation if combined with other adverse conditions.   Thus,\n\nOwens, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544257\"><a href=\"/opinion/544257/major-tillery-victor-hassine-kenneth-davenport-william-grandison-nelson/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (3d Cir. 1990), we noted that, to determine whether cond\n\nconfinement violate the Eighth Amendment, it is necessary to examine the tot\n\n\n\n                                5\n\fconditions at the institution, and we held that double celling at SCI Pittsb\n\nthe Eighth Amendment because of those conditions.    Id. at 426-427.   Relevant\n\nconsiderations include the length of confinement, the amount of time prisone\n\nin their cells each day, sanitation, lighting, bedding, ventilation, noise,\n\nrehabilitation programs, opportunities for activities outside the cells, and\n\nand functioning of basic physical facilities such as plumbing, ventilation,\n\nId. at 427.   Here, the allegations in the complaint raise another significan\n\nconsideration; that plaintiffs were subject to sexual assaults, and that the\n\nby failing to protect plaintiffs adequately, were deliberately indifferent\n\npotential for this type of harm.    If proven, these allegations, irrespective\n\nthe harm resulted from double celling or other conditions of the confinement\n\nestablish deliberate indifference as contemplated by Rhodes v. Chapman.\n\n          As in Rhodes, courts finding double celling permissible have empha\n\ngeneral prison conditions were otherwise adequate.   Id.   We stress that the\n\nRhodes were different in many ways from those in the case before us (and con\n\ndifferent from the grim conditions related in Tillery).    The cells in Rhode\n\nNonetheless, cells housing two inmates had two-tiered bunk beds, each cell h\n\nair circulation vents and a built-in radio, one wall consisted only of bars\n\n6:30 a.m. and 9:30 p.m. inmates had access to \"dayrooms\" (designed to be cou\n\nliving room at home, each included a television, card tables and chairs).\n\n          The district court failed to analyze the relevant consideration l\n\nNor did the court discuss double celling in the overall context of prison co\n\nthat extent the district court erred.2   Although the complaint alleged that\n\nin rapes and other assaults was a result of double celling, the district co\n\n\n2\n          Since under Tillery the plaintiffs' other Eighth Amendment claims\nunavoidably part of the analysis of the double celling issue, we need not a\nseparately in detail here.\n\n\n                                6\n\fthis allegation separately.      The court found that the plaintiffs did not sta\n\nbecause they had failed \"to indicate any conduct by the defendants which cou\n\n`deliberate indifference.'\" (Dist. Ct. at 9, citing Young v. Quinlan, 960 F\n\nn.22 (3d Cir. 1992)).    Here, the court also erred.\n\n            In Wilson v. Seiter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112626\"><a href=\"/opinion/112626/wilson-v-seiter/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">294</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991), the Supreme Court held\n\nestablish an Eighth Amendment violation an inmate must allege both an objec\n\nthat the deprivation was sufficiently serious -- and a subjective element -\n\nofficial acted with a sufficiently culpable state of mind, i.e., deliberate\n\n            It cannot be wholly determined from the record whether in this cas\n\nofficials actually displayed deliberate indifference.     Nonetheless, this com\n\nactually states that \"letters have been written to the [administration] conc\n\nmatters set forth in the complaint.     All requests for administrative remedi\n\nrefused.\"    (Complaint at 3.)   This suggests that the defendants here were on\n\nby plaintiffs' reports of rape, violence and the other conditions alleged in\n\ncomplaint.    Although, by itself, such notice may not equal proof of delibera\n\nindifference, it nevertheless directly contradicts the district court's taci\n\nwhich has no support in the record, that plaintiffs could prove no set of fa\n\neither show deliberate indifference or otherwise entitle them to relief.\n\n            Finally, the district court erred in its consideration of the plai\n\nremaining Eighth Amendment allegations. The court stated that\n          there is no support for the assertion that plaintiffs' constitutio\n          rights are being violated by denying them the same `rights and\n          privileges' afforded to inmates in the general population and this\n          Court defers to the judgment of the prison officials in adopting a\n          executing policies and practices that they believe, in their\n          discretion, are needed to preserve internal order and to maintain\n          institutional security.\n\n\n(Dist. Ct. at 9-10.)    That may be true (although, since the defendants did n\nopportunity to explain the justifications for these \"policies and practices,\n\n\n\n                                   7\n\fassumption that they are legitimate is perhaps premature); however, the plai\n\nto have raised these allegations as part of their Eighth Amendment claim, no\n\nequal protection claim.   For example, the plaintiffs complain about use of \"\n\nnot simply because general population prisoners are not subjected to them, b\n\nthey are so uncomfortable that they deter inmates from seeking medical and d\n\nFor the reasons stated above, these remaining allegations should have been\n\nalong with the issue of double celling, and should at least have been consid\n\nof the plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claims.\n\n          Thus, with regard to the plaintiffs' Eighth Amendment claims, we c\n\nthe district court erred.   Based upon the record before us, we cannot say t\n\nplaintiffs would be unable to prove that prison conditions were objectively\n\nand that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to plaintiffs' pligh\n\nthat the district court entertained, but rejected (Dist. Ct. at 5), the pos\n\nplaintiffs may be able to satisfy some deficiencies in their original pleadi\n\nan amended complaint.   Plaintiffs may be able to allege in an amended compla\n\nexample, sufficient facts to support a finding that some defendants display\n\nindifference to certain harms, or that all officials were deliberately indif\n\npossibility that the conditions under which they housed the plaintiffs signi\n\nincreased the possibility of such well-known harms as prison rape.\n\n                                              IV.\n\n                                    Access to the Courts\n\n          The plaintiffs' denial of access to the courts claim is based on t\n\nallegations.   Protective custody inmates are denied access to paralegals or\n\ntrained in law who could assist them with drafting legal papers.   Paralegals\n\navailable to protective custody inmates facing disciplinary charges, while d\n\nrefuses to help protective custody inmates prepare habeas corpus petitions\n\ncomplaints. Moreover, Sinha has attempted to frustrate the plaintiffs in thi\n\n\n                                8\n\fdelaying return of documents and failing to make copies of legal documents.\n\ncustody inmates are effectively prevented from helping each other by a polic\n\nthem from talking to each other through the doors and passing items to betwe\n\nthose who violate that policy risk disciplinary action.   In addition, prison\n\nwith a Catch 22-style problem: in order to obtain access to legal materials,\n\nsubmit written requests for specific materials; however, they cannot effecti\n\nbecause they lack access to the very legal materials that would advise them\n\nmaterials to request.   The plaintiffs also allege that everyone who has att\n\na civil complaint to attack these procedures has been transferred.\n\n          As we stated in Abdul-Akbar v.

Because the plaintiffs did not allege that they h\n\nwritten requests, the district court held that they had failed to state a cl\n\nof access to the courts.\n\n\n\n\n                                9\n\f           The district court erred here as well.

In addition, the co\n\naddress the remaining allegations at all.   Since the plaintiffs' allegations\n\nevidently false, and since their allegations do not facially indicate that t\n\ncould not state a claim, the district court erred by granting the defendant\n\ndismiss.\n\n                                             V.\n\n           In conclusion, the district court should not have granted the defe\n\nto dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).
