Hebbe appeals the district court’s ruling with\nrespect to two distinct constitutional claims. First, Hebbe\nclaims that the prison officials violated his constitutional right\nof court access because they denied him use of the prison law\nlibrary without providing any alternative means of legal\nresearch assistance during the limited time period in which he\nwas permitted to appeal his state court criminal conviction.\nSecond, Hebbe claims that subsequently the prison officials\n\f                           HEBBE v. PLILER                        10903\nviolated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel\nand unusual punishment because they forced him to choose\nbetween two constitutional rights, his right to exercise and his\nright of court access, by allowing him out of his cell only two\nhours per day, four days per week, for a period of eight\nmonths. We reverse the district court’s ruling as to both\nclaims and remand the case for further proceedings.\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n   Paul Hebbe was convicted, pursuant to a plea agreement, of\ntwo counts of burglary. He was sentenced to a term of eigh-\nteen years and four months. He appealed his conviction to the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal. The court appointed pro bono\ncounsel to represent him on appeal.\n\n   On November 9, 1998, while Hebbe was imprisoned in the\nCSP, a fight broke out and parts of the facility, including the\npart in which he was held, were subjected to a “lockdown.”\nDuring lockdowns, CSP inmates are confined to their cells at\nalmost all times and are not allowed to exercise outdoors or\nuse the institution’s law library. On November 18, 1998,\nHebbe’s pro bono appellate counsel withdrew and filed a “no\nissue” Wende brief in the California Court of Appeal.1 The\ncourt accepted the brief, and advised Hebbe of his right to\nfile, pro se, a supplemental appellate brief within thirty days,\nby December 18, 1998. Hebbe states in his complaint that he\nwas still on lockdown, and thus had no access to the law\nlibrary for that entire thirty-day period. He asserts that he was\ntherefore unable to research and file a supplemental appellate\nbrief by the December 18, 1998 deadline.\n\n     The CSP alleges that it provides inmates with emergency\n     1\n   A Wende brief is one that an appellate counsel can file when he finds\nno legitimate issues for appeal. See People v. Wende, 25 Cal.3d 436\n(1979). When an attorney files a Wende brief the court is then obliged to\nundertake an independent review of the record for valid claims.\n\f10904                         HEBBE v. PLILER\nlibrary services during a lockdown through a paging system,\nalthough this system offers extremely limited access to legal\nmaterials.2 According to the prison officials, Hebbe was\nallowed access to this paging system while he was on lock-\ndown; according to Hebbe, however, the prison officials never\ninformed him of the program’s existence or that he had a right\nto use the program to access legal reference materials. Hebbe\nalleges that he did not learn of the existence of the paging sys-\ntem until January of 1999. Consequently, he asserts, he did\nnot file a supplemental brief before the California Court of\nAppeal’s December 18, 1998, filing deadline. For the pur-\nposes of a motion to dismiss, we construe the pleading in the\nlight most favorable to the party opposing the motion, and\nresolve all doubts in the pleader’s favor. See Hospital Bldg.\nCo. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital, 425 U.S. 738 (1976). We\ntherefore take the factual allegations in Hebbe’s complaint as\ntrue. See Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, 307 F.3d 1119,\n1121 (9th Cir. 2002)\n\n   On March 8, 1999 Hebbe’s section of the prison was\nremoved from lockdown status and he was once again\nallowed to access the prison’s law library. Shortly thereafter,\nthere was another disturbance and the prison officials put\nHebbe’s section of the prison back on lockdown, from March\n  2\n    Using the paging system, inmates with legal deadlines may forward\nrequests for legal references to the library, and library staff will deliver the\nrequested items to the inmates, beginning after the third day of lockdown.\nHowever, the prison restricts each inmate to a maximum of three items at\na time, and these items may not be more than thirty pages each. If a docu-\nment is larger than thirty pages then the prison will only deliver the docu-\nment in thirty page increments. Further, the library staff will send only\nitems that the inmates must request by using a specific form of correct\ncitation, which it defines narrowly. If the citation is not sufficiently clear\nthen the library staff will deny the request. For example, the library staff\nwill deny a request for “Plessy v. Ferguson,” as it is not specific enough.\nAlso, the library staff will deny a request for “114 S. Ct. 2364, Heck v.\nHumphrey” as it is not in the correct citation format. Other citation defects\nthat if found will result in the library staff ignoring the request are mis-\nspellings in case names and lack of all parallel citation.\n\f                           HEBBE v. PLILER                        10905\n28, 1999 until April 18, 1999. On April 20, 1999, Hebbe filed\na “continuance request,” with the California Court of Appeal\nasserting that the lockdown had made it impossible for him to\nresearch and draft an appellate brief. The California Court of\nAppeal, which had dismissed Hebbe’s appeal after he failed\nto file a supplemental brief by the court’s deadline, construed\nthe “continuance request” as a petition for rehearing and\ndenied it on May 5, 1999.\n\n  From November 10, 1998 to February 14, 2000, a period\nof a little more than 15 months, Hebbe spent approximately\nseven months in lockdown, without access to the law library\nand without an opportunity to exercise outdoors.3 For the\nperiod of time totaling eight months in which Hebbe was not\non lockdown,4 the CSP allowed him two hours per day, four\ndays per week, during which he could either exercise outdoors\nor use the law library. These eight hours per week were\nHebbe’s only opportunity to do either.\n\n   On February 14, 2000, Hebbe filed a complaint in the dis-\ntrict court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that the prison\nofficials had violated his constitutional rights. Only two of the\nclaims listed in that complaint are relevant for purposes of this\nappeal: the claim that the prison officials violated Hebbe’s\nright of access-to-courts by preventing him from using the\nlaw library during the lockdown, and his claim that the prison\nofficials violated his Eighth Amendment rights by forcing him\nto choose between outdoor exercise and use of the law library\nwhen he was not on lockdown.5\n  3\n     Hebbe was in lockdown between November 10, 1998 - March 8, 1999,\nMarch 28, 1999 - April 18, 1999, and September 11, 1999 - November 10,\n1999. ER II 104. However, Hebbe was not himself responsible for any of\nthe prison lockdowns.\n   4\n     Specifically: March 8, 1999 - March 28, 1999, April 18, 1999 - Sep-\ntember 11, 1999, and November 10, 1999 - February 14, 2000.\n   5\n     Hebbe filed an amended complaint on July 17, 2000, reiterating these\nclaims.\n\f10906                       HEBBE v. PLILER\n   On April 10, 2001, the prison officials filed a Motion to\nDismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted. On February 20, 2002, the magistrate judge recom-\nmended dismissing Hebbe’s access-to-courts claim because\nhe “fail[ed] to allege he was unable to file a meritorious claim\nas a result of his [law] library restrictions.” The magistrate\njudge also recommended dismissing the claim that Hebbe was\nforced to choose between library access and outdoor exercise\nin contravention of the Eighth Amendment because Hebbe\n“concede[d] he had yard time and used the law library, and\nfail[ed] to allege an inability to file or a rejection of a merito-\nrious claim resulted from his having to divide his recreation\ntime between the yard and the law library.”\n\n   On April 19, 2002, the district court summarily upheld the\nfindings and recommendations of the magistrate judge and\nadopted them in full. The district court granted the prison offi-\ncials’ Motion to Dismiss Hebbe’s claims, with prejudice, dis-\nmissing both his claim that the prison officials impermissibly\nrestricted his court access during the lockdowns and his claim\nthat they unconstitutionally forced him to choose between\nusing the law library and exercising outdoors when the facil-\nity in which he was incarcerated was not on lockdown.6\nHebbe timely appeals the district court’s ruling on these two\ndistinct constitutional claims.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n   We “review de novo a district court’s disposition of a\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).” Coto Settlement\nv. Eisenberg, 593 F.3d 1031, 1034 (9th Cir. 2010). The prison\nofficials ask us to apply the standard for reviewing complaints\nthat the Supreme Court recently adopted in Iqbal v. Ashcroft,\n  6\n    The sole claim to survive the motion to dismiss was Hebbe’s claim that\nthe prison denied him yard time during the lockdown periods, in violation\nof the Eighth Amendment. On September 27, 2007, a jury returned a ver-\ndict in favor of the prison officials on this Eighth Amendment claim.\n\f                         HEBBE v. PLILER                    10907\nnamely, that a complaint may survive a motion to dismiss\nonly if, taking all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, it\ncontains enough facts to “state a claim to relief that is plausi-\nble on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949\n(2009) (quoting Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544,\n570 (2007)). But because Hebbe is an inmate who proceeded\npro se, his complaint “must be held to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,” as the Supreme\nCourt has reminded us since Twombly. See Erickson v.\nPardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam). Because Iqbal\nincorporated the Twombly pleading standard and Twombly did\nnot alter courts’ treatment of pro se filings, we continue to\nconstrue pro se filings liberally. This is particularly important\nwhere, as in the instant case, a petitioner is a pro se prisoner\nlitigant in a civil rights matter. See Bretz v. Kelman, 773 F.2d\n1026, 1027 n.1 (9th Cir. 1985) (courts “have an obligation\nwhere the petitioner is pro se, particularly in civil rights cases,\nto construe the pleadings liberally and to afford the petitioner\nthe benefit of any doubt.”).\n\nA.   Hebbe’s court access claim survives the motion to\n     dismiss\n\n   Hebbe alleges that the prison officials violated his constitu-\ntional right to court access, grounded in the First Amendment\nright to petition and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due\nprocess, by denying him access to the prison law library while\nthe facility was on lockdown, and that the denial prevented\nhim from filing a brief in support of his appeal of his state\ncourt conviction.\n\n  [1] In 1977 the United States Supreme Court held that “the\nfundamental constitutional right of access to the courts\nrequires prison authorities to assist inmates in the preparation\nand filing of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners\nwith adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from per-\nsons trained in the law.” Bounds v. Smith, 430 U.S. 817, 828\n(1977). Nineteen years later, in Lewis v. Casey, the Court reit-\n\f10908                    HEBBE v. PLILER\nerated that penal institutions have a duty to afford prisoners\n“a reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed viola-\ntions of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.” 518\nU.S. 343, 351 (1996) (citing Bounds, 430 U.S. at 825). How-\never, the Lewis Court narrowed the scope of Bounds by hold-\ning that there is no “abstract, freestanding right to a law\nlibrary or legal assistance[. A]n inmate . . . must . . . demon-\nstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal\nassistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal\nclaim.” Id. at 351, 353 n.3.\n\n   [2] The Court explained that its “actual injury” require-\nment meant that the state was not required to provide library\naccess to “enable the prisoner to discover grievances” that\nmight be aired, id. at 354 (emphasis in original), but rather\nwas required to provide such access to facilitate the prisoner’s\npursuit of a certain “type of frustrated legal claim,” such as\n“direct appeals from the convictions for which [he] w[as]\nincarcerated” or “actions under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to vindicate\n‘basic constitutional rights.’ ” Id. (citing Wolff v. McDonnell,\n418 U.S. 539, 579 (1974)). Thus, the “tools” that Lewis and\nBounds “require[ ] to be provided are those that the inmates\nneed in order to attack their sentences, directly or collaterally,\nand in order to challenge the conditions of their confinement.”\nId. at 355. Hebbe’s claim that he was frustrated in his desire\nto use the law library facilities to research the pro se brief that\nhe wished to file on direct appeal of his state court conviction\ninvolves exactly the type of “actual injury” discussed in\nLewis. Hebbe did not wish to go on a “fishing expedition” to\ndiscover grievances, rather he wished simply to appeal his\nconviction, as was his fundamental right.\n\n   [3] When Hebbe’s pro bono appellate counsel filed a\nWende brief and withdrew from his case on November 18,\n1998, the California Court of Appeal correctly advised him of\nhis right to file, pro se, a supplemental appellate brief. Hebbe\nunquestionably had a right to use the legal materials available\nin the prison to research which issues he might address in that\n\f                         HEBBE v. PLILER                   10909\nbrief. The fact that Hebbe’s former attorney had filed a Wende\nbrief did not affect his right to file his own brief or his right\nto use the prison library facilities to research that brief. Nor\ndid the former attorney’s filing of the Wende brief necessarily\ndemonstrate that there were no nonfrivolous claims that\nHebbe might raise on direct appeal. As we held in Delgado\nv. Lewis, the filing of a Wende brief does not show disposi-\ntively that an appeal is without merit. 223 F.3d 976 (9th Cir.\n2000).\n\n   [4] Similarly, the fact that Hebbe entered a guilty plea did\nnot affect his right to appeal, nor did it affect his right to use\nthe prison library to research the pro se brief that he wished\nto file in support of that appeal. Under California law, individ-\nuals who have pleaded guilty may nonetheless prevail upon\nappeal in certain circumstances. See Cal. Penal Code\n§ 1237.5(a) (stating that individuals who enter guilty pleas\nmay appeal on the basis of “reasonable constitutional, juris-\ndictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the pro-\nceedings.”). Hebbe thus had a right to use the prison law\nlibrary to research the constitutional, jurisdictional, or other\nissues he might raise on appeal.\n\n   [5] Lewis may not have “guarantee[d] inmates the where-\nwithal to transform themselves into litigating engines capable\nof filing everything from shareholder derivative actions to\nslip-and-fall claims,” Lewis 518 U.S. at 355, but it did guaran-\ntee individuals like Hebbe the right to use the prison law\nlibrary to “attack their sentences, directly.” Id. Hebbe was\nimpermissibly denied the opportunity to appeal his convic-\ntion. This fulfills Lewis’s “actual injury” requirement. We\ntherefore reverse the district court’s ruling on Hebbe’s first\nclaim.\n\nB.   Hebbe’s Eighth Amendment claim survives the\n     motion to dismiss\n\n  Hebbe also alleges that the prison officials violated his\nEighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual\n\f10910                        HEBBE v. PLILER\npunishment during the period of time totaling eight months in\nwhich he was permitted to leave his cell for only two hours\nper day, four days per week. He asserts that, during that time,\nthe prison officials impermissibly forced him to choose\nbetween spending the eight hours per week on either using the\nlaw library or exercising outdoors.\n\n   [6] Forcing a prisoner to choose between using the prison\nlaw library and exercising outdoors is impermissible because\n“an inmate cannot be forced to sacrifice one constitutionally\nprotected right solely because another is respected.” Allen v.\nCity and County of Honolulu, 39 F.3d 936, 940 (9th Cir. 1994).7\nAs we discuss supra, the Supreme Court in Lewis emphasized\nthe continued vitality of this rule, but held that an inmate’s\nconstitutional right to use of a law library was not “freestand-\ning,” but rather predicated upon the pursuit of an “arguably\nactionable” legal claim. Id. at 351.\n\n   [7] Here, as Hebbe’s counsel underscored at oral argu-\nment, Hebbe wished to use the law library to research and file\nhis § 1983 complaint. The prison officials do not dispute that\nHebbe’s § 1983 action involves one or more non-frivolous,\n“arguably actionable” legal claims—nor could they, given\n   7\n     The prison officials urge, erroneously, that our holding in Allen applies\nonly to individuals held in segregated housing units or otherwise severely\nrestrictive conditions of confinement. No published opinion of our court\nadvances such a proposition and it is of little merit for constitutional pur-\nposes. What matters for cases such as the one before us is the amount of\ntime the prisoner is allowed out of his cell to access the law library and\nfor out-of-cell exercise, not any other limitation imposed upon his freedom\nor conditions to which he is subjected. Moreover, we note that there are\nmany similarities between Hebbe’s conditions of confinement and Allen’s.\nHebbe was on and off lockdown over the course of a 15-month period.\nDuring periods totaling seven of those 15 months, he had no access to the\nlibrary and no out-of-cell exercise at all. When he was released from lock-\ndown, Hebbe was allowed to leave his cell for only eight hours per week\nto either exercise or use the law library. Allen was, similarly, allowed to\nleave his cell for six hours per week to either exercise or use the law\nlibrary. Allen, 39 F.3d at 939.\n\f                        HEBBE v. PLILER                    10911\nthat one of those claims, Hebbe’s claim that his Eighth\nAmendment rights were violated when he was denied all out-\nof-cell exercise during the seven month period that he was\nheld on lockdown, was tried to a jury. In addition to that\nclaim, Hebbe had other nonfrivolous claims to research as\nwell. The two counts that are now on appeal before us are cer-\ntainly not frivolous. Hebbe also wished to use the law library\nto research the state habeas petition that he filed in Sacra-\nmento Superior Court, a purpose that falls squarely under\nLewis’s definition of nonfrivolous legal research. See Lewis,\n518 U.S. at 355 (interpreting Bounds as requiring prisons to\nprovide inmates with the legal research facilities that they\n“need in order to attack their sentences, directly or collateral-\nly”).\n\n   [8] That Hebbe used the law library to research the § 1983\naction during the time that he specifies in his complaint—i.e.\nfrom November 1998 to February 2000—is apparent both\nfrom the face of the complaint and the timing of its filing. The\nsame is true of Hebbe’s state habeas petition, which was filed\non May 20, 1999. Construing Hebbe’s pro se complaint liber-\nally, as we are required to do under Erickson v. Pardus, 551\nU.S. 89, 94 (2007) (per curiam), we hold that Hebbe has suffi-\nciently alleged for the purposes of surviving a motion to dis-\nmiss that he wished to research a nonfrivolous legal claim and\nthus had a cognizable constitutional right to use the law\nlibrary.\n\n   For the purposes of surviving a motion to dismiss, Hebbe\nhas therefore sufficiently alleged that prison officials violated\nhis Eighth Amendment rights because they forced him to\nchoose between his constitutional right to exercise and his\nconstitutional right of access to the courts for at least eight\nmonths. Allen, 39 F.3d at 940. We therefore reverse the dis-\ntrict court’s ruling and remand for further proceedings.\n\n  REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\f",

Hebbe appeals the district court’s ruling with\nrespect to two distinct constitutional claims. First, Hebbe\nclaims that the prison officials violated his constitutional right\nof court access because they denied him use of the prison law\nlibrary without providing any alternative means of legal\nresearch assistance during the limited time period in which he\nwas permitted to appeal his state court criminal conviction.\nSecond, Hebbe claims that subsequently the prison officials\n\f                           HEBBE v. PLILER                        10903\nviolated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel\nand unusual punishment because they forced him to choose\nbetween two constitutional rights, his right to exercise and his\nright of court access, by allowing him out of his cell only two\nhours per day, four days per week, for a period of eight\nmonths. We reverse the district court’s ruling as to both\nclaims and remand the case for further proceedings.\n\nI.       BACKGROUND\n\n   Paul Hebbe was convicted, pursuant to a plea agreement, of\ntwo counts of burglary. He was sentenced to a term of eigh-\nteen years and four months. He appealed his conviction to the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal. The court appointed pro bono\ncounsel to represent him on appeal.\n\n   On November 9, 1998, while Hebbe was imprisoned in the\nCSP, a fight broke out and parts of the facility, including the\npart in which he was held, were subjected to a “lockdown.”\nDuring lockdowns, CSP inmates are confined to their cells at\nalmost all times and are not allowed to exercise outdoors or\nuse the institution’s law library. On November 18, 1998,\nHebbe’s pro bono appellate counsel withdrew and filed a “no\nissue” Wende brief in the California Court of Appeal.1 The\ncourt accepted the brief, and advised Hebbe of his right to\nfile, pro se, a supplemental appellate brief within thirty days,\nby December 18, 1998. Hebbe states in his complaint that he\nwas still on lockdown, and thus had no access to the law\nlibrary for that entire thirty-day period. He asserts that he was\ntherefore unable to research and file a supplemental appellate\nbrief by the December 18, 1998 deadline.\n\n     The CSP alleges that it provides inmates with emergency\n     1\n   A Wende brief is one that an appellate counsel can file when he finds\nno legitimate issues for appeal. See People v. Wende, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1180855\"><a href=\"/opinion/1180855/people-v-wende/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(1979). When an attorney files a Wende brief the court is then obliged to\nundertake an independent review of the record for valid claims.\n\f10904                         HEBBE v. PLILER\nlibrary services during a lockdown through a paging system,\nalthough this system offers extremely limited access to legal\nmaterials.2 According to the prison officials, Hebbe was\nallowed access to this paging system while he was on lock-\ndown; according to Hebbe, however, the prison officials never\ninformed him of the program’s existence or that he had a right\nto use the program to access legal reference materials. Hebbe\nalleges that he did not learn of the existence of the paging sys-\ntem until January of 1999. Consequently, he asserts, he did\nnot file a supplemental brief before the California Court of\nAppeal’s December 18, 1998, filing deadline. For the pur-\nposes of a motion to dismiss, we construe the pleading in the\nlight most favorable to the party opposing the motion, and\nresolve all doubts in the pleader’s favor. See Hospital Bldg.\nCo. v. Trustees of Rex Hospital, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109449\"><a href=\"/opinion/109449/hospital-bldg-co-v-rex-hospital-trustees/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976). We\ntherefore take the factual allegations in Hebbe’s complaint as\ntrue. See Galbraith v. County of Santa Clara, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779529\"><a href=\"/opinion/779529/nelson-galbraith-v-county-of-santa-clara-a-municipality-of-the-state-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1119</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n1121 (9th Cir. 2002)\n\n   On March 8, 1999 Hebbe’s section of the prison was\nremoved from lockdown status and he was once again\nallowed to access the prison’s law library. Shortly thereafter,\nthere was another disturbance and the prison officials put\nHebbe’s section of the prison back on lockdown, from March\n  2\n    Using the paging system, inmates with legal deadlines may forward\nrequests for legal references to the library, and library staff will deliver the\nrequested items to the inmates, beginning after the third day of lockdown.\nHowever, the prison restricts each inmate to a maximum of three items at\na time, and these items may not be more than thirty pages each. If a docu-\nment is larger than thirty pages then the prison will only deliver the docu-\nment in thirty page increments. Further, the library staff will send only\nitems that the inmates must request by using a specific form of correct\ncitation, which it defines narrowly. If the citation is not sufficiently clear\nthen the library staff will deny the request. For example, the library staff\nwill deny a request for “Plessy v. Ferguson,” as it is not specific enough.\nAlso, the library staff will deny a request for “114 S. Ct. 2364, Heck v.\nHumphrey” as it is not in the correct citation format. Other citation defects\nthat if found will result in the library staff ignoring the request are mis-\nspellings in case names and lack of all parallel citation.\n\f                           HEBBE v. PLILER                        10905\n28, 1999 until April 18, 1999. On April 20, 1999, Hebbe filed\na “continuance request,” with the California Court of Appeal\nasserting that the lockdown had made it impossible for him to\nresearch and draft an appellate brief. The California Court of\nAppeal, which had dismissed Hebbe’s appeal after he failed\nto file a supplemental brief by the court’s deadline, construed\nthe “continuance request” as a petition for rehearing and\ndenied it on May 5, 1999.\n\n  From November 10, 1998 to February 14, 2000, a period\nof a little more than 15 months, Hebbe spent approximately\nseven months in lockdown, without access to the law library\nand without an opportunity to exercise outdoors.3 For the\nperiod of time totaling eight months in which Hebbe was not\non lockdown,4 the CSP allowed him two hours per day, four\ndays per week, during which he could either exercise outdoors\nor use the law library. These eight hours per week were\nHebbe’s only opportunity to do either.\n\n   On February 14, 2000, Hebbe filed a complaint in the dis-\ntrict court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that the prison\nofficials had violated his constitutional rights. Only two of the\nclaims listed in that complaint are relevant for purposes of this\nappeal: the claim that the prison officials violated Hebbe’s\nright of access-to-courts by preventing him from using the\nlaw library during the lockdown, and his claim that the prison\nofficials violated his Eighth Amendment rights by forcing him\nto choose between outdoor exercise and use of the law library\nwhen he was not on lockdown.5\n  3\n     Hebbe was in lockdown between November 10, 1998 - March 8, 1999,\nMarch 28, 1999 - April 18, 1999, and September 11, 1999 - November 10,\n1999. ER II 104. However, Hebbe was not himself responsible for any of\nthe prison lockdowns.\n   4\n     Specifically: March 8, 1999 - March 28, 1999, April 18, 1999 - Sep-\ntember 11, 1999, and November 10, 1999 - February 14, 2000.\n   5\n     Hebbe filed an amended complaint on July 17, 2000, reiterating these\nclaims.\n\f10906                       HEBBE v. PLILER\n   On April 10, 2001, the prison officials filed a Motion to\nDismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be\ngranted. On February 20, 2002, the magistrate judge recom-\nmended dismissing Hebbe’s access-to-courts claim because\nhe “fail[ed] to allege he was unable to file a meritorious claim\nas a result of his [law] library restrictions.” The magistrate\njudge also recommended dismissing the claim that Hebbe was\nforced to choose between library access and outdoor exercise\nin contravention of the Eighth Amendment because Hebbe\n“concede[d] he had yard time and used the law library, and\nfail[ed] to allege an inability to file or a rejection of a merito-\nrious claim resulted from his having to divide his recreation\ntime between the yard and the law library.”\n\n   On April 19, 2002, the district court summarily upheld the\nfindings and recommendations of the magistrate judge and\nadopted them in full. The district court granted the prison offi-\ncials’ Motion to Dismiss Hebbe’s claims, with prejudice, dis-\nmissing both his claim that the prison officials impermissibly\nrestricted his court access during the lockdowns and his claim\nthat they unconstitutionally forced him to choose between\nusing the law library and exercising outdoors when the facil-\nity in which he was incarcerated was not on lockdown.6\nHebbe timely appeals the district court’s ruling on these two\ndistinct constitutional claims.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n   We “review de novo a district court’s disposition of a\nmotion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).” Coto Settlement\nv. Eisenberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1405974\"><a href=\"/opinion/1405974/coto-settlement-v-eisenberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1034 (9th Cir. 2010). The prison\nofficials ask us to apply the standard for reviewing complaints\nthat the Supreme Court recently adopted in Iqbal v. Ashcroft,\n  6\n    The sole claim to survive the motion to dismiss was Hebbe’s claim that\nthe prison denied him yard time during the lockdown periods, in violation\nof the Eighth Amendment. On September 27, 2007, a jury returned a ver-\ndict in favor of the prison officials on this Eighth Amendment claim.\n\f                         HEBBE v. PLILER                    10907\nnamely, that a complaint may survive a motion to dismiss\nonly if, taking all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, it\ncontains enough facts to “state a claim to relief that is plausi-\nble on its face.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145875\"><a href=\"/opinion/145875/ashcroft-v-iqbal/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Twombly, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n570 (2007)). But because Hebbe is an inmate who proceeded\npro se, his complaint “must be held to less stringent standards\nthan formal pleadings drafted by lawyers,” as the Supreme\nCourt has reminded us since Twombly. See Erickson v.\nPardus, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145722\"><a href=\"/opinion/145722/erickson-v-pardus/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94 (2007) (per curiam). Because Iqbal\nincorporated the Twombly pleading standard and Twombly did\nnot alter courts’ treatment of pro se filings, we continue to\nconstrue pro se filings liberally. This is particularly important\nwhere, as in the instant case, a petitioner is a pro se prisoner\nlitigant in a civil rights matter. See Bretz v. Kelman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458756\"><a href=\"/opinion/458756/lr-bretz-v-zollie-kelman-jack-r-lande-eugene-r-welborn/\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1026</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1027 n.1 (9th Cir. 1985) (courts “have an obligation\nwhere the petitioner is pro se, particularly in civil rights cases,\nto construe the pleadings liberally and to afford the petitioner\nthe benefit of any doubt.”).\n\nA.   Hebbe’s court access claim survives the motion to\n     dismiss\n\n   Hebbe alleges that the prison officials violated his constitu-\ntional right to court access, grounded in the First Amendment\nright to petition and the Fourteenth Amendment right to due\nprocess, by denying him access to the prison law library while\nthe facility was on lockdown, and that the denial prevented\nhim from filing a brief in support of his appeal of his state\ncourt conviction.\n\n  [1] In 1977 the United States Supreme Court held that “the\nfundamental constitutional right of access to the courts\nrequires prison authorities to assist inmates in the preparation\nand filing of meaningful legal papers by providing prisoners\nwith adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from per-\nsons trained in the law.” Bounds v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109643\"><a href=\"/opinion/109643/bounds-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828\n(1977). Nineteen years later, in Lewis v. Casey, the Court reit-\n\f10908                    HEBBE v. PLILER\nerated that penal institutions have a duty to afford prisoners\n“a reasonably adequate opportunity to present claimed viola-\ntions of fundamental constitutional rights to the courts.” </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351 (1996) (citing Bounds, 430 U.S. at 825). How-\never, the Lewis Court narrowed the scope of Bounds by hold-\ning that there is no “abstract, freestanding right to a law\nlibrary or legal assistance[. A]n inmate . . . must . . . demon-\nstrate that the alleged shortcomings in the library or legal\nassistance program hindered his efforts to pursue a legal\nclaim.” Id. at 351, 353 n.3.\n\n   [2] The Court explained that its “actual injury” require-\nment meant that the state was not required to provide library\naccess to “enable the prisoner to discover grievances” that\nmight be aired, id. at 354 (emphasis in original), but rather\nwas required to provide such access to facilitate the prisoner’s\npursuit of a certain “type of frustrated legal claim,” such as\n“direct appeals from the convictions for which [he] w[as]\nincarcerated” or “actions under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to vindicate\n‘basic constitutional rights.’ ” Id. (citing Wolff v. McDonnell,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109097\"><a href=\"/opinion/109097/wolff-v-mcdonnell/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">539</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 579 (1974)). Thus, the “tools” that Lewis and\nBounds “require[ ] to be provided are those that the inmates\nneed in order to attack their sentences, directly or collaterally,\nand in order to challenge the conditions of their confinement.”\nId. at 355. Hebbe’s claim that he was frustrated in his desire\nto use the law library facilities to research the pro se brief that\nhe wished to file on direct appeal of his state court conviction\ninvolves exactly the type of “actual injury” discussed in\nLewis. Hebbe did not wish to go on a “fishing expedition” to\ndiscover grievances, rather he wished simply to appeal his\nconviction, as was his fundamental right.\n\n   [3] When Hebbe’s pro bono appellate counsel filed a\nWende brief and withdrew from his case on November 18,\n1998, the California Court of Appeal correctly advised him of\nhis right to file, pro se, a supplemental appellate brief. Hebbe\nunquestionably had a right to use the legal materials available\nin the prison to research which issues he might address in that\n\f                         HEBBE v. PLILER                   10909\nbrief. The fact that Hebbe’s former attorney had filed a Wende\nbrief did not affect his right to file his own brief or his right\nto use the prison library facilities to research that brief. Nor\ndid the former attorney’s filing of the Wende brief necessarily\ndemonstrate that there were no nonfrivolous claims that\nHebbe might raise on direct appeal. As we held in Delgado\nv. Lewis, the filing of a Wende brief does not show disposi-\ntively that an appeal is without merit. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770062\"><a href=\"/opinion/770062/jesus-garcia-delgado-v-gail-lewis-deputy-warden-attorney-general-of-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">223</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">976</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n2000).\n\n   [4] Similarly, the fact that Hebbe entered a guilty plea did\nnot affect his right to appeal, nor did it affect his right to use\nthe prison library to research the pro se brief that he wished\nto file in support of that appeal. Under California law, individ-\nuals who have pleaded guilty may nonetheless prevail upon\nappeal in certain circumstances. See Cal. Penal Code\n§ 1237.5(a) (stating that individuals who enter guilty pleas\nmay appeal on the basis of “reasonable constitutional, juris-\ndictional, or other grounds going to the legality of the pro-\nceedings.”). Hebbe thus had a right to use the prison law\nlibrary to research the constitutional, jurisdictional, or other\nissues he might raise on appeal.\n\n   [5] Lewis may not have “guarantee[d] inmates the where-\nwithal to transform themselves into litigating engines capable\nof filing everything from shareholder derivative actions to\nslip-and-fall claims,” Lewis 518 U.S. at 355, but it did guaran-\ntee individuals like Hebbe the right to use the prison law\nlibrary to “attack their sentences, directly.” Id. Hebbe was\nimpermissibly denied the opportunity to appeal his convic-\ntion. This fulfills Lewis’s “actual injury” requirement. We\ntherefore reverse the district court’s ruling on Hebbe’s first\nclaim.\n\nB.   Hebbe’s Eighth Amendment claim survives the\n     motion to dismiss\n\n  Hebbe also alleges that the prison officials violated his\nEighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual\n\f10910                        HEBBE v. PLILER\npunishment during the period of time totaling eight months in\nwhich he was permitted to leave his cell for only two hours\nper day, four days per week. He asserts that, during that time,\nthe prison officials impermissibly forced him to choose\nbetween spending the eight hours per week on either using the\nlaw library or exercising outdoors.\n\n   [6] Forcing a prisoner to choose between using the prison\nlaw library and exercising outdoors is impermissible because\n“an inmate cannot be forced to sacrifice one constitutionally\nprotected right solely because another is respected.” Allen v.\nCity and County of Honolulu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681671\"><a href=\"/opinion/681671/john-allen-v-city-county-of-honolulu-and-robert-johnson-sgt-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 940 (9th Cir. 1994).7\nAs we discuss supra, the Supreme Court in Lewis emphasized\nthe continued vitality of this rule, but held that an inmate’s\nconstitutional right to use of a law library was not “freestand-\ning,” but rather predicated upon the pursuit of an “arguably\nactionable” legal claim. Id. at 351.\n\n   [7] Here, as Hebbe’s counsel underscored at oral argu-\nment, Hebbe wished to use the law library to research and file\nhis § 1983 complaint. The prison officials do not dispute that\nHebbe’s § 1983 action involves one or more non-frivolous,\n“arguably actionable” legal claims—nor could they, given\n   7\n     The prison officials urge, erroneously, that our holding in Allen applies\nonly to individuals held in segregated housing units or otherwise severely\nrestrictive conditions of confinement. No published opinion of our court\nadvances such a proposition and it is of little merit for constitutional pur-\nposes. What matters for cases such as the one before us is the amount of\ntime the prisoner is allowed out of his cell to access the law library and\nfor out-of-cell exercise, not any other limitation imposed upon his freedom\nor conditions to which he is subjected. Moreover, we note that there are\nmany similarities between Hebbe’s conditions of confinement and Allen’s.\nHebbe was on and off lockdown over the course of a 15-month period.\nDuring periods totaling seven of those 15 months, he had no access to the\nlibrary and no out-of-cell exercise at all. When he was released from lock-\ndown, Hebbe was allowed to leave his cell for only eight hours per week\nto either exercise or use the law library. Allen was, similarly, allowed to\nleave his cell for six hours per week to either exercise or use the law\nlibrary. Allen, 39 F.3d at 939.\n\f                        HEBBE v. PLILER                    10911\nthat one of those claims, Hebbe’s claim that his Eighth\nAmendment rights were violated when he was denied all out-\nof-cell exercise during the seven month period that he was\nheld on lockdown, was tried to a jury. In addition to that\nclaim, Hebbe had other nonfrivolous claims to research as\nwell. The two counts that are now on appeal before us are cer-\ntainly not frivolous. Hebbe also wished to use the law library\nto research the state habeas petition that he filed in Sacra-\nmento Superior Court, a purpose that falls squarely under\nLewis’s definition of nonfrivolous legal research. See Lewis,\n518 U.S. at 355 (interpreting Bounds as requiring prisons to\nprovide inmates with the legal research facilities that they\n“need in order to attack their sentences, directly or collateral-\nly”).\n\n   [8] That Hebbe used the law library to research the § 1983\naction during the time that he specifies in his complaint—i.e.\nfrom November 1998 to February 2000—is apparent both\nfrom the face of the complaint and the timing of its filing. The\nsame is true of Hebbe’s state habeas petition, which was filed\non May 20, 1999. Construing Hebbe’s pro se complaint liber-\nally, as we are required to do under Erickson v. Pardus, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145722\"><a href=\"/opinion/145722/erickson-v-pardus/\"><span class=\"volume\">551</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94 (2007) (per curiam), we hold that Hebbe has suffi-\nciently alleged for the purposes of surviving a motion to dis-\nmiss that he wished to research a nonfrivolous legal claim and\nthus had a cognizable constitutional right to use the law\nlibrary.\n\n   For the purposes of surviving a motion to dismiss, Hebbe\nhas therefore sufficiently alleged that prison officials violated\nhis Eighth Amendment rights because they forced him to\nchoose between his constitutional right to exercise and his\nconstitutional right of access to the courts for at least eight\nmonths. Allen, 39 F.3d at 940. We therefore reverse the dis-\ntrict court’s ruling and remand for further proceedings.\n\n  REVERSED and REMANDED.\n\f</pre>",
