If the Secretary has reason to believe that the complaint shows that a recipient government has failed to comply with the provisions of this subpart, he will cause a prompt investigation to be made . . ..<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants in this case alleged that they have filed charges pursuant to this provision against eight recipient governments and have had charges filed on their behalf against three additional recipients.  Joint Appendix (J.A.) 150.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Appellants further alleged that, to their knowledge, no action has been taken on these complaints other than a form acknowledgment of five of the charges.  J.A. 151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These allegations, uncontradicted by the government, are sufficient to confer standing on the complaining appellants to challenge ORS's inaction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The agency's procedural regulations, which are binding on the agency,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> entitle complainants to a review of their complaint by the Secretary and, if the complaint raises a colorable claim of violation, a prompt investigation.  Complainants are injured if this procedural right is denied them, regardless of whether their complaint is ultimately found meritorious.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants therefore have established \"injury in fact,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> for their stake in the litigation is a personalized one, not a generalized grievance.  See United States v. SCRAP, 412 U.S. 669, 689 n. 14, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2417 n. 14, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973): \" 'Injury in fact' reflects the statutory requirement that a person be 'adversely affected' or 'aggrieved,' and it serves to distinguish a person with a direct stake in the outcome of a litigation even though small from a person with a mere interest in the problem.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> Appellants' complaint is specific to them: the complaints that they have filed with ORS have not received the attention due under the Act and regulations.  A court can redress appellants' injury, See Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976), by, E. g., ordering ORS to process promptly appellants' complaints and otherwise comply with the applicable regulations.  Appellants are clearly within the \"zone of interests\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> both of the statute and of the applicable procedural regulations that appellants claim have been violated.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even as to those appellants who have not filed administrative complaints with ORS,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> the district court's dismissal for lack of standing was premature.  Appellants have alleged that the recipient jurisdictions are dependent on revenue sharing funds to carry out vital municipal activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> They have also alleged that because the recipient governments are under an independent obligation not to discriminate in the provision of services, the governments do not have the option of declining the revenue sharing funds, and continuing to practice the discriminatory activities.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a> Moreover, the appellants have adduced evidence that initiating federal fund termination proceedings has in the past been highly effective in gaining compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> All of these allegations are uncontradicted by the United States.  The mere fact that ultimate relief to the appellants depends on the actions of third parties does not, by itself defeat appellants' standing, so long as they can establish a \"substantial likelihood\" that the relief they request will eliminate the asserted injury.  See Duke Power Co. v. Carolina Environmental Study Group, 438 U.S. 59, 75 n. 20, 98 S.Ct. 2620, 2631 n. 20, 57 L.Ed.2d 595 (1978).  \"Our recent cases have required no more than a showing that there is a 'substantial likelihood' that the relief requested will redress the injury claimed to satisfy the second prong of the constitutional standing requirement (that the court's remedial powers would redress the claimed injuries).\"In Duke Power, the appellees' standing was challenged on the grounds that there was no showing that declaring the Price-Anderson Act unconstitutional would necessarily eliminate nuclear reactors.  The Nuclear Regulatory Commission argued that, even in the absence of the Act, private companies might still build reactors, or alternatively, the United States itself might engage in nuclear power generation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although enactment of Price-Anderson was not a logically necessary condition to the existence of nuclear reactors, the Court held that the \"documentary evidence and testimony in the record,\" Id. at 77, 98 S.Ct. at 2633, adduced by the environmental group, was sufficient to establish that in fact nuclear plants might not be built.  In this case the appellants have adduced facts, uncontradicted by the government, that tend to show that the recipient governments would end discrimination rather than risk the loss of revenue sharing funds.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the very least, appellants were entitled to conduct discovery to buttress their allegation that there is a substantial likelihood that the relief they request will eliminate their injury.  Their pleadings are not so deficient on their face, nor so implausible, that the district court was entitled to conclude the standing issue on a motion to dismiss.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court denied standing to certain of the organizational plaintiffs as representatives of their members, concluding that representative standing is permissible only \"where it is difficult, if not impossible for the person whose rights are being asserted to present his grievances to the court, or there is a compelling need to grant third-party standing to protect the constitutional rights of parties not before the court.\"  Slip op. at 8. This formulation does not correctly express the law of standing as applied to an organization that seeks to represent its members.  In Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 511, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2211, 2212, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975), the Court made clear that the test for representational standing for an organization is similar to that for an individual member: \"The association must allege that its members, or any one of them, are suffering immediate or threatened injury as a result of the challenged action of the sort that would make out a justiciable case had the members themselves brought suit.\"  The only additional limitation would arise if individual members of the organization were indispensable parties to the suit, a factor not present here.

I am unable to concur in part I of the majority opinion, however, because of my belief that standing to sue in federal court must be based on more than allegations of violations of procedural regulations by an agency.  In my view, injury to an underlying substantive interest must be alleged.  Thus, in this case, standing is based on alleged harm resulting from discrimination rather than alleged violation of procedural regulations by the Secretary of Treasury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Sitting by designation pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 292(a)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The named individual plaintiffs/appellants are two California residents who allege that they have been denied employment on the basis of their race</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The complaint names twelve organizational plaintiffs, all of whom either provide services, or represent the interests of racial and ethnic minorities in the communities whose governments allegedly are in violation of &#167; 122(a) of the Revenue Sharing Act.

This action was filed before the enactment of the 1976 Amendments, and the suit challenges expenditures made prior to the effective date of those amendments.  Since the regulations promulgated by the Secretary are virtually identical to the added language, and have the force of law, we need not decide whether the instant action is governed by the Amendments, though we are mindful of the strong rule in favor of applying the law in effect at the time of decision, particularly where the statute is one to enforce civil rights.  See Bradley v. School Board of Richmond, 416 U.S. 696, 711, 94 S.Ct. 2006, 40 L.Ed.2d 476 (1974); Thorpe v. Housing Authority of Durham, 393 U.S. 268, 281-83, 89 S.Ct. 518, 21 L.Ed.2d 474 (1969); Womack v. Lynn, 164 U.S.App.D.C. 198, 504 F.2d 267 (1974).  In any event, the subsequent congressional ratification of the Secretary's regulations lends further support to appellants' claim that they have a legal right to prompt action on their complaint and that they are within the zone of interests both of the procedural and substantive provisions of the Act and of its implementing regulations.  See notes 14, 15 Infra</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> 31 C.F.R. &#167; 51.57 (1976).

However, appellants' affidavits establish that at least some of them (or their members) have filed administrative complaints.  See, e. g., Affidavit of Magdaleno Botello, P 1 (J.A. 95); Affidavit of Eduardo Rivera, Chairman of Concerned Citizens for Equal Employment, P 6 (J.A. 100-01); Affidavit of Raul Ceja, President of El Pueblo Unido, P 4 (J.A. 106); Affidavit of Ernesto Loredo, President of Tulare County Tenants' Union, P 6 (J.A. 110); Affidavit of Carlos Vasquez, Director of Casa Justica, P 3 (J.A. 112-13)</p>\n        <p>In addition, in its papers to this court, appellants suggest that complaints have also been filed by appellants NAACP, Sacramento Concilio Farmworkers Program, Huelga School Inc., Chicano Taxpayer's Association, Northside Community Design Center, and Latin American Union for Civil Rights.  Although the moving papers in the district court allege that complaints were filed against the recipient governments where these organizations operate, the papers do not show clearly who filed the complaints.  Assuming that these organizations did in fact file complaints (a question which the district court should address on remand), the decision of the district court, that these organizations \"have failed to allege that they have suffered concrete, specific injury . . ..\" (supra at 1064) must be reversed.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Appellants did not present their theory of harm to their procedural rights at any length in the original memorandum on standing, See Pl. Pts. and Authorities in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss at 26 (J.A. 87), and the district court did not discuss this ground for standing in its opinion.  On motion for reconsideration, however, appellants briefed this point extensively.  The district court denied the motion for reconsideration without opinion.  Committee for Full Employment v.

See, e. g., Rodway v. United States Department of Agriculture, 168 U.S.App.D.C. 387, 514 F.2d 809 (1975) (plaintiffs successfully challenged USDA failure to comply with the APA in promulgating coupon allotment system under the Food Stamp Act); Environmental Defense Fund v. Hardin, 138 U.S.App.D.C. 391, 428 F.2d 1093 (1970) (environmental groups had standing to challenge USDA's failure to take any action on petition to restrict use of DDT).  Complainants have a \"legal right\" to have their complaint processed promptly, and the Secretary's failure to do so constitutes a \"legal wrong\" which entitles them to judicial review.  See 5 U.S.C. &#167; 702 (1976)</p>\n        <p>The United States' only response to this argument is reliance on Califano v. Sanders, 430 U.S. 99, 97 S.Ct. 980, 51 L.Ed.2d 192 (1977).  Sanders held only that &#167; 10 was not an independent grant of jurisdiction to the federal courts.  But appellants do not base jurisdiction on &#167; 10 of the APA.  Rather, jurisdiction is grounded, Inter alia, on 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1331 (1976) (federal question jurisdiction).  Nothing in Sanders suggests that &#167; 10 does not grant a Cause of action to one suffering a legal wrong within the meaning of a relevant statute at the hands of an agency, so long as there is an independent statutory basis for jurisdiction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> The United States also disputes that appellants satisfy the \"injury in fact\" requirement.
