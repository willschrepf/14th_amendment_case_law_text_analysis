AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n      Mark McCormick and Margaret C. Callahan of Belin McCormick,\n\nP.C., Des Moines, and Bruce E. Bergman, Des Moines, and Mark\nGodwin, Des Moines, for appellant.\n\n\n\n      Brad P. Schroeder of Hartung & Schroeder, Des Moines, and\n\nBruce H. Stoltze of Stoltze & Updegraff, P.C., Des Moines, for appellees.\n\f                                         2\n\nHECHT, Justice.\n\n      This case was remanded to the district court for determination of\n\nwhether a class should be certified and for determination of what, if any,\n\npart of the City’s franchise fees for gas and electricity services are related\n\nto its administrative expenses in exercising its police power. Kragnes v.\n\nCity of Des Moines, 714 N.W.2d 632, 643 (Iowa 2006) (Kragnes I). The\n\ndistrict court certified a class, found the franchise fees cannot exceed\n\n$1,575,194 per year for the electric utility and $1,574,046 for the gas\n\nutility, entered judgment in favor of the certified class against the City in\n\nthe amount by which such fees exceeded that amount for the period from\n\nJuly 27, 1999, to May 26, 2009, and retained jurisdiction to determine\n\nthe amount of money to be refunded to members of the class, the\n\nmanner in which the refunds must be made, the fees to be paid to\n\ncounsel for the plaintiff class, and the costs of this action.      The City\n\nappeals and Kragnes cross-appeals. We affirm the judgment as modified\n\nand remand for further proceedings.\n\n      I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n      The background facts of this case are fully described in Kragnes I,\n\n714 N.W.2d at 633–37.       In 2004, the City of Des Moines considered\n\nraising property taxes to hire more police and firefighters, maintain the\n\nlibrary’s hours, and rehabilitate certain deteriorating neighborhoods.\n\nThe City realized the state was phasing out sales and use taxes on\n\nresidential gas and electric services and determined that it would be\n\npossible to increase the franchise fees on these services to raise revenue.\n\nAfter deciding this source of revenue was preferable to an increase in\n\nproperty taxes, the City renegotiated the franchise agreements with\n\nMidAmerican Energy (MEC), which provided gas and electric service for\n\nthe city, and increased the franchise fee from 1% to 3% for both gas and\n\f                                         3\n\nelectric services effective September 2004.      Effective June 2005, the\n\nfranchise fees were increased to 5% for each utility.\n\n      Lisa Kragnes promptly filed a petition in equity on behalf of herself\n\nand all others similarly situated challenging the franchise fees as illegal\n\ntaxes. She sought reimbursement for all illegal taxes paid through the\n\nallowable statute of limitations and sought an injunction prohibiting the\n\nCity from charging such franchise fees in the future. The district court\n\ngranted Kragnes’s motion for summary judgment and the City appealed.\n\nWe concluded in Kragnes I that\n      a city has the authority to assess a franchise fee expressed\n      as a percentage of the gross receipts derived from the utility’s\n      sale of its services to the public, so long as the charge is\n      reasonably related to the reasonable costs of inspecting,\n      licensing, supervising, or otherwise regulating the activity\n      that is being franchised.\nId. at 642–43. Because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether all or part of the franchise fees were reasonably related to the\n\nCity’s administrative expenses in exercising its police power, we\n\nremanded to the district court for the determination of whether a class\n\nshould be certified and for a trial on the merits. Id. at 643.\n\n      On remand, the district court certified a class consisting of all City\n\nof Des Moines utilities customers who paid the electricity or gas\n\nfranchise fee from July 27, 1999, forward. The City filed three motions\n\nto decertify the class, all of which were denied. After trial, the district\n\ncourt determined that a portion of the franchise fee collected was\n\nexcessive.   The court held the City must refund to the class, with\n\ninterest, the amount by which the franchise fees exceeded $1,575,194\n\nper year for the electric utility and $1,574,046 for the gas utility. The\n\ncourt retained jurisdiction to determine the details of how the refund\n\nwould be calculated and refunded to class members.           The court also\n\f                                          4\n\nconcluded injunctive relief was unnecessary because the legislature had\n\namended Iowa Code section 364.2(4)(f) to allow municipalities to impose\n\nfranchise fees in excess of the reasonable cost of inspecting, licensing,\n\nsupervising, or otherwise regulating utilities’ activities.    See 2009 Iowa\n\nActs ch. 179, § 228 (codified at Iowa Code section 364.2(4)(f) (Supp.\n\n2009)).\n\n        Both the City and Kragnes sought, and we granted, interlocutory\n\nappeal.     The City contends the district court should have granted its\n\nmotion to decertify the class for two reasons: (1) a fundamental conflict\n\nexists between members of the class, and (2) class members are not\n\npermitted to “opt out” of the litigation. In the alternative, if this litigation\n\nis allowed to proceed as a class action and a remedy is owed, the City\n\ncontends the class should be divided into subclasses.              The parties\n\ndisagree as to the categories and amounts of expenses that may be\n\ncounted as “reasonably related” to the administration of electric and gas\n\nfranchises during the relevant time period.          The City contends the\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to include as proper components of the\n\nfranchise fee the lost value of its trees and certain indirect operating\n\ncosts attributable to the utility franchises and in undervaluing as fee\n\ncomponents certain “non-annual unpredictable expenses attendant to\n\nthe City’s police power responsibilities.” Kragnes contends in her cross-\n\nappeal that the district court erred in allowing as franchise fee\n\ncomponents construction and engineering costs funded by federal and\n\nstate     government   appropriations    or   the   Wastewater    Reclamation\n\nAuthority, construction and overhead costs covered by sewer treatment\n\nfees paid by users of the City’s sanitary sewer system, administrative\n\noverhead in the amount of 12.78% added to construction and\n\f                                          5\n\nengineering   expenses    charged    by       contractors,   and   interest   on\n\nconstruction and engineering expenses.\n\n      The parties also hotly dispute the parameters of the remedy in this\n\nappeal.   The City contends the district court erred in concluding the\n\nplaintiff class is entitled to a refund, while Kragnes contends a full\n\nrefund must be ordered and injunctive relief should be granted requiring\n\nthe City to amend its ordinances in compliance with the amended\n\nlegislation found in sections 364.2(4)(f) and 384.3A, including providing\n\npublic notice and identifying the City’s costs of regulating the franchises\n\nand what amounts it seeks in excess of its regulation costs.\n\n      II. Scope of Review.\n\n      The parties agree as to the scope of review for the various issues\n\nraised. We will review a district court’s rulings regarding the certification\n\nof a class for an abuse of discretion. Vos v. Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co.,\n\n667 N.W.2d 36, 44 (Iowa 2003). “This discretion has been characterized\n\nas ‘broad.’ ” Vignaroli v. Blue Cross of Iowa, 360 N.W.2d 741, 744 (Iowa\n\n1985) (quoting 7A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 1785, at 134 (1972)).          Because the case was\n\ntried in equity, we will review de novo the district court’s conclusions\n\nregarding which of the City’s claimed expenses were reasonably related to\n\nthe administration of the gas and electric franchises. Iowa R. App. P.\n\n6.907; Fencl v. City of Harpers Ferry, 620 N.W.2d 808, 811 (Iowa 2000).\n\nWe may give weight to the findings of the district court, but we are not\n\nbound by them. Fencl, 620 N.W.2d at 811. Our review of the district\n\ncourt’s decision to grant Kragnes and the class a full refund is also\n\nde novo. We will review the district court’s application and interpretation\n\nof statutes for errors at law.   Beganovic v. Muxfeldt, 775 N.W.2d 313,\n\n317–18 (Iowa 2009). To the extent the City’s argument that members of\n\f                                       6\n\nthe plaintiff class must be allowed to opt out of the class raises a\n\nconstitutional claim, our review is de novo.      Simmons v. State Pub.\n\nDefender, 791 N.W.2d 69, 73 (Iowa 2010).\n\n      III. Discussion.\n\n      A. Should the Class Have Been Decertified Because of a\n\nConflict Among the Members?          The City argues the district court\n\nshould have granted its motion to decertify the class because a conflict of\n\ninterest exists between Kragnes, as the class representative, and other\n\nmembers of the class who will suffer economically as a result of a\n\njudgment in favor of the class. Specifically, the City contends it imposed\n\nthe franchise fees in lieu of raising property taxes. The franchise fees\n\nwere paid by anyone in the city who utilized gas and electric service,\n\nwhether or not they owned property. Further, if the City is required to\n\nrefund the roughly $40 million in excess tax that was collected from\n\n2004 until 2009, it will need to raise the revenue for this payment. The\n\nCity contends the most likely result of a refund is an increase of property\n\ntaxes. Because the burden of any prospective tax increase imposed to\n\nfinance the refund will be borne only by current property owners, the\n\nCity contends property owners will be required to pay a larger proportion\n\nof the refund than they paid when the illegal tax was collected from all\n\nutilities customers in the city.   In other words, the City contends a\n\nfundamental conflict exists between Kragnes and class members who are\n\nproperty owners and who would tend to oppose Kragnes’s refund\n\nobjective because they benefitted from the collection of the excessive\n\nfranchise fees from payors who were not property owners. The district\n\ncourt concluded the claimed conflict was speculative and denied the\n\nCity’s motion.\n\f                                              7\n\n       One of the prerequisites for class certification is that the class\n\nrepresentative will “fairly and adequately . . . protect the interests of the\n\nclass.” Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.262(2)(c). The City contends Kragnes cannot\n\nprotect the interests of the certified class because she has a conflict of\n\ninterest in the maintenance of the class action.             See id. r. 1.263(2)(b)\n\n(providing assessment of whether the class representative “fairly and\n\nadequately will protect the interests of the class” turns inter alia on a\n\nfinding that the representative has no conflict of interest).               However,\n\n“[n]ot every disagreement between a representative and other class\n\nmembers will stand in the way of a class action suit. The conflict must\n\nbe fundamental, going to the specific issues and controversies.”\n\nVignaroli, 360 N.W.2d at 746 (citation omitted).\n\n       The City relies on two opinions from the Eleventh Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals to support its argument that the intraclass conflict in this case\n\nis so fundamental as to preclude certification or require decertification.\n\nIn Pickett v. Iowa Beef Processors, a group of cattle producers filed an\n\nantitrust suit against Iowa Beef Processors (IBP), a meat packer.                 209\n\nF.3d 1276, 1277 (11th Cir. 2000). The plaintiffs alleged IBP had used\n\nforward contracts 1 and marketing agreements 2 to coerce producers\n\nselling cattle on the spot markets to accept lower prices in violation of the\n\nPackers and Stockyards Act.           Id. at 1278.      The plaintiffs specifically\n\nasserted IBP had used the forward contracts and marketing agreements\n\n\n\n       1A   “forward contract” is an agreement between a packer and a producer\nestablishing the price to be paid for the cattle weeks or months before the animals are\nready for slaughter. Pickett, 209 F.3d at 1278.\n       2“Marketing agreements” are “more extended versions of forward contracts.”\n\nUnder such agreements, the producer “promises to sell most of its cattle to a packer at\nprices determined by a negotiated formula, which can be adjusted after slaughter\naccording to the quality of the beef.” Id.\n\f                                         8\n\nto create a “captive supply,” depress the market price at strategic times,\n\nand force producers selling on the spot market to accept artificially low\n\nprices for their fattened cattle. Id. The relief sought by the plaintiffs for\n\nthe class included damages and an injunction prohibiting IBP from using\n\nsuch purchasing arrangements in the future. Id. at 1280. The district\n\ncourt certified a class of all cattle producers who sold cattle directly to\n\nIBP from February 1994 through and including the date of certification—\n\na class of at least 15,000 members including both producers who sold\n\ncattle on the spot market and those who sold cattle under forward\n\ncontracts or marketing agreements.           Id. at 1279.   On appeal, the\n\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the plaintiffs\n\ncould not adequately represent a class consisting of both producers who\n\nsold on the spot market and those who sold under forward contracts and\n\nmarketing agreements.        Id. at 1280–81.   The court reasoned that the\n\nclass could not include both the spot market producers who had\n\nallegedly been harmed by the forward contracts and marketing\n\nagreements and the producers who had benefitted from such marketing\n\nvehicles and wished to continue doing so.          Id. at 1280 (noting the\n\ncertified class “includes those who claim harm from the very same acts\n\nfrom which other members of the class have benefitted”).\n\n      In Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a group of\n\npharmaceuticals wholesalers filed an antitrust action alleging the\n\ndefendant Abbott Laboratories made agreements with other defendant\n\ndrug manufacturers preserving Abbott’s monopoly position in the market\n\nfor the drug Hytrin (terazosin hydrochloride) and keeping less expensive\n\ngeneric alternatives off the market. 350 F.3d 1181, 1183–84 (11th Cir.\n\n2003).   The district court certified a class including all entities who\n\npurchased    Hytrin   from    Abbott   at any    time   during the   periods\n\f                                             9\n\ncommencing March 31, 1998, through August 13, 1999.                    Id. at 1186.\n\nOn appeal, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, concluding\n\nthe plaintiffs had failed to prove they could adequately represent the\n\nclass that included some wholesalers who resold Hytrin on a cost-plus\n\nbasis and other wholesalers who utilized other pricing formulas. Id. at\n\n1190. The court reasoned that a potential, significant conflict among the\n\nclass members was suggested by the disparate pricing schemes of the\n\nclass members. 3       Id. at 1190–91.         Because the record on appeal\n\nsuggested those wholesalers who sold on a cost-plus basis would, unlike\n\nother wholesalers in the class, lose both margin and volume from generic\n\ncompetition preferred by other class members, the court reversed the\n\nclass certification order and remanded for development of the evidentiary\n\nrecord as to the potential conflict. 4 Id. at 1192.\n\n       The City contends the economic conflict of interest among the class\n\nmembers in this case is as fundamental as the conflicts perceived by the\n\ncourts in Pickett and Valley Drug. Suggesting many of the members of\n\nthe class are hostile to the refund because, as property taxpayers, they\n\nwill be adversely affected by it, the City asserts the district court abused\n\nits discretion in certifying and refusing to decertify the class.\n       Kragnes denies the alleged intraclass conflict is fundamental.\n\nFirst, she notes that the fact that some members of the class do not favor\n\nthe lawsuit is not sufficient to defeat certification of the class. Vignaroli,\n\n\n       3The  defendants alleged that three national wholesaler class members whose\ntransactions with Abbot constituted over 50% of the class claims were among those who\nsold Hytrin on a cost-plus basis and likely derived more profit from sales of branded\nproducts than from sales of generic drugs. Valley Drug, 350 F.3d 1190–91.\n        4The need for the development of the evidentiary record was the result of the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling precluding “downstream discovery” on the subject of the\nwholesalers’ sales practices bearing upon whether the cost-plus sellers achieved a net\ngain as a consequence of the unavailability of the competing generics. Id. at 1192.\n\f                                            10\n\n360 N.W.2d at 747. She argues the “crux” of the case against the City is\n\nthe illegality of the franchise fee and there is no conflict among the\n\nmembers as to that issue.          She argues the nature and extent of the\n\nrefund of the illegal franchise fees collected by the City are secondary to\n\nthe liability issue. Because it is unknown how the City will choose to\n\nfund the judgment against it in this case, Kragnes contends the fear that\n\nsome members of the class will suffer a loss as a result of any refund is\n\nbased on speculation. She points out that as of the time of trial, the City\n\nhad not decided how it was going to cover the cost of any refund and that\n\nit had considered options other than raising property tax, such as\n\nreducing   administrative      expenses,     cutting    or      deferring   capital\n\nimprovements, or obtaining funding through long-term debt.                     As a\n\nproperty owner in Des Moines, Kragnes contends she is in the perfect\n\nposition to represent the interests of other property-owning class\n\nmembers as she weighs the benefits of a refund against the potential\n\nconsequences.\n\n      We find no abuse of the district court’s broad discretion in\n\ncertifying and refusing to decertify the class. The heart of this case is the\n\nillegality of the franchise fee imposed by the City, and we agree with\n\nKragnes that there is no fundamental conflict among the class members\n\nas to that issue. See Vignaroli, 360 N.W.2d at 746–47. Each of the class\n\nmembers paid fees that the City should not have collected and in this\n\nfundamental     respect    their   claims    are   identical,    consistent,    and\n\ncompatible.\n\n      Although the City claims an economic conflict exists among class\n\nmembers, the district court did not abuse its discretion in reaching a\n\ncontrary conclusion.      To the extent the City contends this lawsuit will\n\ncause adverse consequences for property owners, we again note Kragnes\n\f                                                11\n\nherself is a property owner sharing that status with other property\n\nowners in the city. 5 The City seeks to neutralize the significance of this\n\nstatus shared by Kragnes and the other property-owning members of the\n\nclass with a retrospective and a prospective analysis of the alleged\n\neconomic conflict. In each of these analyses, however, the assertion of a\n\nfundamental conflict is substantially based on speculation.\n\n       In its retrospective analysis of the claimed conflict, the City\n\ncontends the property owners would have preferred the City generate\n\nrevenue through franchise fees paid by both property owners and\n\nnonowners alike rather than impose a property tax increase not directly\n\nshared by nonowners. 6 But this contention is infused with speculation\n\nas to whether and how much the City would have chosen to increase\n\nproperty taxes if it had not imposed the illegal franchise fees. Although\n\nthe record indicates the City considered increasing property taxes to\n\nraise funds for certain expenditures, it is impossible to know how much,\n\nif at all, the City’s elected leaders would have increased property taxes\n\nhad they not chosen instead to utilize the illegal franchise fees to raise\n\nrevenue. Viewed from the precollection vantage point, the City’s conflict\n\nargument assumes the City would have raised property taxes and would\nhave raised them in such an amount that at least some property owners\n\nwould have paid more in increased property taxes than they ultimately\n\n\n        5The federal cases cited by the City for the proposition that class certification is\n\nimproper when some members of the class benefited from the same conduct that\nharmed other members do not involve a named representative who arguably benefited\nfrom the conduct and thus shares the interest of the other class members who\nbenefited.\n       6The  City’s contention that the interests of property owners and nonowners\nconflict fundamentally because owners bear the burden of real estate taxes and\ntherefore have an aversion to tax increases not shared by nonowners is tinged with\nspeculation to the extent owners pass along property tax increases to nonowners\nthrough rents.\n\f                                              12\n\npaid in franchise fees.          We decline to engage in the retrospective\n\nspeculation undergirding the City’s assumption that the singular fiscal\n\nalternative to increasing franchise fees was an increase in property taxes.\n\nOther feasible precollection alternatives—including a decision against\n\nraising additional revenue—were available to the City.                Thus, from the\n\nprecollection vantage point, the contention that the interests of Kragnes\n\nare misaligned or fundamentally in conflict with those of other class\n\nmembers is speculative at best.\n\n       When the alleged conflict between the interests of Kragnes and\n\nother property-owning members of the class is viewed prospectively from\n\nthe postcollection or “refund” vantage point, we again find an abundance\n\nof speculation. Here the City’s conflict analysis assumes any refund will\n\nbe financed through a property tax increase in such an amount as will\n\ncause at least some property owners to pay more in increased property\n\ntaxes than they will receive in refunded franchise fees.                Although this\n\nprospect cannot be ruled out, the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in failing to assume the refund will be financed solely through\n\na property tax increase. 7\n\n       In the last analysis, the City’s characterization of the conflict\nbetween the interests of Kragnes and other class members is rife with\n\nspeculation—beginning with speculation about what City leaders would\n\nhave done in the past and ending with predictions about what City\n\n\n       7As    we have already noted, the general assembly recently adopted legislation\nuntethering the amount of franchise fees from the municipality’s cost of inspecting and\nmaintaining the utility. See Iowa Code § 364.2(4)(f). Under the new regime, the amount\nof franchise fees is instead limited prospectively to a maximum of 5% of the customer’s\nutility bills. Id. We decline to speculate about whether the City will finance the refund\nthrough this (or any other) revenue stream, through prospective budgetary and fiscal\nalternatives, or from a combination of such policy choices. The district court will on\nremand take evidence informing its decision on the appropriate structure of the refund\nmechanism.\n\f                                               13\n\nleaders will do in the future. And in between is speculation about the\n\neffect of hypothetical decisions on property owners. Did they pay less in\n\nfranchise fees than they would have paid in property taxes had the\n\nfranchise fees not been increased? Did some nonproperty-owning class\n\nmembers pay more in increased franchise fees than they would have paid\n\nthrough rent increases occasioned by property tax increases had the\n\nfranchise fees not been increased? How, if at all, will property tax rates\n\nbe affected by the refund remedy ultimately fashioned in this case? 8 See\n\nHispanics United of DuPage Cnty. v. Vill. of Addison, 160 F.R.D. 681, 690\n\n(N.D. Ill. 1995) (claimed conflict of interest between class members whose\n\nproperty would be destroyed by village’s redevelopment plan and class\n\nmembers whose property would not be destroyed and might increase in\n\nvalue was “dependent on myriad factors that cannot be forecast with any\n\ndegree of certainty” and did not defeat request for certification of class).\n\n       Furthermore, even if we assume without deciding that some\n\nmembers of the class prefer to leave their right to a refund unremedied,\n\nthis does not mandate a determination that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in certifying a class in this case.

We will not speculate whether the refund will be financed through spending\nreductions, tax increases, fee enhancements, or some combination of these and other\nalternatives, nor do we express an opinion as to how the refund should be structured in\nview of the alternatives shown by the evidence on remand to be available under the\ncircumstances.\n\f                                        14\n\nresult in higher benefits for some class members, larger contributions\n\nwould be required of presently working teachers); Lockwood Motors, Inc.\n\nv.

We\n\nacknowledge that other courts have declined requests for class\n\ncertification or affirmed such rulings on appeal in some cases based on\n\nevidence tending to establish a strong opposition of some class members\n\nto the objectives of the suit filed by the named plaintiffs. See, e.g., Gilpin\n\nv. Am. Fed. of State, Cnty., and Mun.

As the applicable standard of review accords broad\n\ndiscretion to the district court in this matter, however, we find no\n\f                                            15\n\nreversible error in the district court’s determination that no fundamental\n\nconflict of interest between Kragnes and other class members precluded\n\ncertification or mandated decertification in this case. 9\n\n       As we have described in the past, our class action rules “are\n\nremedial in nature and should be liberally construed to favor the\n\nmaintenance of class actions.”        Comes v. Microsoft Corp., 696 N.W.2d\n\n318, 320 (Iowa 2005). The goal of the class action rule is the\n       “efficient resolution of the claims . . . of many individuals in\n       a single action, the elimination of repetitious litigation and\n       possibly inconsistent adjudications involving common\n       questions, related events, or requests for similar relief, and\n       the establishment of an effective procedure for those whose\n       economic position is such that it is unrealistic to expect\n       them to seek to vindicate their rights in separate lawsuits.”\nId. (citation omitted).\n\n       The litigation of this case has resulted in two Supreme Court\n\nopinions, a forty-nine page district court decision after a fourteen-day\n\nbench trial involving the testimony of twenty-eight witnesses, including\n\neight experts—three for the City and five for Kragnes. The record fills five\n\nbankers’ boxes.     However, Kragnes’s claim standing alone would likely\n\nfall within the jurisdictional limit of the small claims court.          We think\n\nthis case demonstrates the very necessity and importance of class action\n\nlitigation both for the plaintiffs and for the City.         The likelihood of a\n\nplaintiff bringing such a complex suit requiring substantial resources to\n\nlitigate in small claims is highly unlikely.        And if she, and scores of\n\nthousands of others like her, did bring their claims individually, it could\n\neasily overwhelm the legal department of the City and the resources of\n\n\n\n\n       9We   express no opinion at this juncture whether further proceedings in this\nmatter will justify the division of the class into subclasses.

We affirm on this issue.\n\n      B. Must Members be Allowed to Opt Out of the Class?               Rule\n\n1.263(1) provides a list of factors to be considered by the district court\n\nwhen determining whether a class action should be permitted for the fair\n\nand efficient adjudication of the controversy, including:\n             a. Whether a joint or common interest exists among\n      members of the class.\n             b. Whether the prosecution of separate actions by or\n      against individual members of the class would create a risk\n      of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to\n      individual members of the class that would establish\n      incompatible standards of conduct for a party opposing the\n      class.\n             c. Whether adjudications with respect to individual\n      members of the class as a practical matter would be\n      dispositive of the interests of other members not parties to\n      the adjudication or substantially impair or impede their\n      ability to protect their interests.\nIowa R. Civ. P. 1.263(1).      The district court specifically found that\n\nmultiple lawsuits over the subject matter of this case could cause\n\nsubstantial harm to the rights of different class members because\n\ndifferent results might occur in the thousands of potential cases. The\n\ncourt also noted this large number of claims could, if pursued\nindividually, overwhelm the City’s legal department. These findings have\n\nspecial significance in the court’s determination of whether class\n\nmembers may opt out of the class under rule 1.267(1).\n\n      Rule 1.267(1) provides that a member may not elect to be excluded\n\nfrom the action if “[t]he certification order contains an affirmative finding\n\nunder rule 1.263(1)(a), (b), or (c).”         Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.267(1).\n\nNotwithstanding the district court’s affirmative findings under each of\n\nthe subsections of rule 1.263(1), the City relies on Phillips Petroleum Co.\n\nv. Shutts, 472 U.S. 797, 105 S. Ct. 2965, 86 L. Ed. 2d 628 (1985), for the\n\f                                       17\n\nproposition that individual members of a class have a due process right\n\nto opt out of class litigation.   Shutts involved a class action lawsuit\n\nagainst Phillips Petroleum, a company that produced natural gas from\n\nleased land in eleven different states.   472 U.S. at 799, 105 S. Ct. at\n\n2967, 86 L. Ed. 2d at 633.        The plaintiffs brought suit in Kansas\n\nclaiming to represent a class of 28,000 royalty owners from all fifty states\n\nand several foreign countries with ownership interests in the leased\n\nproperties. Id. Phillips challenged the inclusion of nonresidents within\n\nthe class, contending “that unless out-of-state plaintiffs affirmatively\n\nconsent, the Kansas courts may not exert jurisdiction over their claims.”\n\nId. at 806, 105 S. Ct. at 2971, 86 L. Ed. 2d at 638. Phillips argued that\n\nmany of the members of the proposed class lacked minimum contacts\n\nwith Kansas and could not be bound, consistent with the due process\n\nclause, by a judgment of the Kansas court. Id. After a discussion of the\n\ndevelopment of and rationales for class action litigation, the Supreme\n\nCourt “reject[ed the] contention that the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment requires that absent plaintiffs affirmatively ‘opt\n\nin’ to the class, rather than be deemed members of the class if they do\n\nnot ‘opt out.’ ” Id. at 812, 105 S. Ct. at 2974–75, 86 L. Ed. 2d at 642.\n\nThe Court concluded that the “procedure followed by Kansas, where a\n\nfully descriptive notice is sent first-class mail to each class member, with\n\nan explanation of the right to ‘opt out,’ satisfie[d] due process.” Id. at\n\n812, 105 S. Ct. at 2975, 86 L. Ed. 2d at 642.       Contrary to the City’s\n\nunderstanding of the case, Shutts does not stand for the proposition that\n\nthe Due Process Clause mandates that all class members must have the\n\nopportunity to opt out of a class action case.\n\n      In a subsequent case, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to\n\ndetermine whether an Alabama court’s certification of a class and\n\f                                        18\n\napproval of a settlement agreement resolving the claims of class members\n\nviolated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because\n\nall class members were not afforded the right to exclude themselves from\n\nthe class or the agreement. Adams v. Robertson, 520 U.S. 83, 85, 117\n\nS. Ct. 1028, 1029, 137 L. Ed. 2d 203, 207 (1997). However, the Court\n\ndid not decide the issue as it determined certiorari was improvidently\n\ngranted because the parties did not raise the federal issue below.       Id.\n\nThe Court noted that its decision in Shutts was limited to the\n\ndetermination of whether the Kansas court had jurisdiction over out-of-\n\nstate class members. Id. at 88–89, 117 S. Ct. at 1030, 137 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n209.\n\n       The Iowa rules regarding class actions were adopted in 1980 and\n\nwere based on the Model Class Actions Act. See Unif. Class Actions Act,\n\n12 U.L.A. 93 (2008). The commissioners’ comment to section 8 of the\n\nModel Act, which corresponds to Iowa rule 1.267(1), provides:\n              Under some circumstances members of a plaintiff\n       class cannot elect to be excluded because they are\n       indispensible parties. This would be determined by the\n       court in ruling on certification considering the criteria of\n       Section 3(a) [Iowa rule 1.263(1)]. Such situations might arise\n       in actions comparable to those under Federal Rule 23(b)(1);\n       see 3B Moore’s Federal Practice, ¶23.35. In most situations\n       members of a plaintiff class will be permitted to elect to be\n       excluded.\n              A class member aggrieved by an affirmative finding\n       under Section 3(a)(1), (2) or (3) might seek relief through one\n       of the extraordinary writs or through an interlocutory appeal\n       if authorized by the state practice.\nId. § 8 cmt., 12 U.L.A. 109. Similarly, class actions certified pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule 23(b)(1) do not permit members of a plaintiff class to opt out\n\nof the litigation. Certification pursuant to Federal Rule 23(b)(1) requires\n\nthe court to make findings nearly identical to the findings required by\n\f                                               19\n\nIowa rule 1.263(1).10 Members of a class certified pursuant to Federal\n\nRule 23(b)(1) are not provided an opportunity by the rule to exclude\n\nthemselves from the action. 7AA Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &\n\nMary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1786, at 496–97 (3d ed.\n\n2005). Rather, “it is reasonably certain that the named representatives\n\nwill protect the absent members and give them the functional equivalent\n\nof a day in court.” Id. at 496.\n\n      We believe the procedural safeguards in our rules of civil procedure\n\nregarding class actions take into account due process concerns of all\n\nparties involved—both the plaintiff class members as well as the\n\ndefendants. Accordingly, we reject the City’s contention that the district\n\ncourt’s application of rule 1.267(1) violates due process because class\n\nmembers are not given the option of excluding themselves from the\n\nplaintiff class under the circumstances of this case.\n\n      C. Did the District Court Properly Determine What Costs Were\n\nAllowable as Regulation of the Franchises?                     The district court\n\nconcluded that an annual amount of $1,575,194 should be allocated to\n\nthe City’s administrative expenses in maintaining and managing the\n\n\n\n      10Federal   Rule 23 provides, in relevant part\n      (b) Types of Class Actions. A class action may be maintained if Rule\n          23(a) is satisfied and if:\n      (1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would\n         create a risk of:\n         (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class\n             members that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the\n             party opposing the class; or\n         (B) adjudications with respect to individual class member that, as a\n             practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other class\n             members not parties to the individual adjudications or would\n             substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests[.]\n      Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.\n\f                                        20\n\nelectric utility and $1,574,046 should be allocated for the City’s\n\nmaintenance and management of the gas utility.             These amounts\n\nincluded increased construction costs due to the presence of utilities,\n\nincreased operating costs due to the presence of utilities, degradation\n\ncosts, disruption costs, the cost of the franchise fee study, and one-time,\n\nunexpected acute costs. Both parties take issue with several of the costs\n\nallowed, or not allowed, by the district court.\n\n      Our decision in Kragnes I directed the district court to “determine\n\nwhat, if any, part of the franchise fees are related to the City’s\n\nadministrative expenses in exercising its police power, including the\n\ncosts associated with any incidental consequences of the franchised\n\nservices.” Kragnes I, 714 N.W.2d at 643. This does not require the City\n\nto calculate its administrative expenses to a mathematical certainty. Id.\n\nat 642. The district court concluded that Kragnes, as the plaintiff, bore\n\nthe burden of showing what, if any part of the franchise fees are not\n\nrelated to the City’s administrative expenses and neither party challenges\n\non appeal this allocation of the burden. However, the parties disagree\n\nwith several specific costs the district court found the City should or\n\nshould not be able to recover through the franchise fee.\n\n      1. Lost value of trees. The district court did not include the lost\n\nvalue of the City’s trees due to trimming and removal to accommodate\n\nthe utilities as an allowable incidental cost of the franchise.   The City\n\ncontends this was error.\n\n      Both the City and Kragnes offered expert testimony appraising the\n\nvalue of the trees located in the right-of-way which are trimmed or\n\f                                            21\n\nremoved by MEC 11 to accommodate electric lines.               The City’s expert,\n\nKeith Majors, conducted a survey of a portion of the City’s right-of-way,\n\nattempting to count and value the trees that had been trimmed or\n\nremoved.         Majors opined the City’s trees suffered approximately $5.2\n\nmillion in damage each year due to MEC’s trimming. Although Kragnes\n\ncontends the loss of value of the trees in the right-of-way is not the type\n\nof cost that should be considered part of the City’s administration of the\n\nfranchise, Kragnes also provided expert testimony from Jim Rock as to\n\nthe value of the trimmed and removed trees. Rock attempted to recreate\n\nMajors’ survey and testified he was unable to verify Majors’ calculations\n\nof the number, type, and size of private and public trees affecting the\n\nright-of-way. Although Rock identified more trees affecting the right-of-\n\nway than did Majors, his appraisal of the value of the damage sustained\n\nby the City’s trees was significantly less than Majors’ estimate.                He\n\nconcluded the annual loss of value was $622,981.                Rock opined that\n\nMajors’ calculations failed to account for the fact that the trees are only\n\ntrimmed, on average, once every five years and that the damage assessed\n\nin Majors’ report was cumulative rather than annual.\n\n       The district court concluded the lost tree value was not the type of\n\nincidental consequence that should be considered by the court in\n\ncalculating an appropriate franchise fee because it is “nothing more than\n\na theoretical concept.”       The district court further noted if it were to\n\nconsider tree damage a cost related to the administration of the\n\nfranchise, it would accept Rock’s valuation of the damage.\n\n\n\n\n       11Trial  testimony established that MEC did not perform the trimming itself\nduring the years at issue but contracted with Wright Tree Service for the maintenance\nof all trees, publicly and privately owned, interfering with the electric lines.\n\f                                               22\n\n        The City contends the damage to the trees is analogous to the\n\ndamage done to sidewalks and streets as a consequence of the\n\nmaintenance of the utility, a degradation cost which was allowed by the\n\ndistrict court as a component of the franchise fee. As the City argues,\n\ntrees are valuable assets which are damaged when they are trimmed to\n\naccommodate electric lines, no matter how carefully the trimming is\n\ndone.    Although trees may be pruned to promote growth and health,\n\ntrees that are trimmed to accommodate electric lines are trimmed\n\nwithout regard to the utility, function, and beauty of the tree. They are\n\ntrimmed only to provide sufficient clearance for the electric lines. Rock\n\nagreed that the trees are damaged when they are trimmed but disagreed\n\nthat the City suffers a loss when the trees are trimmed because the City,\n\nor any owner, also receives a benefit from the trimming of the trees—the\n\nsafe and reliable delivery of electrical service.           This benefit offsets any\n\nloss, argues Kragnes. 12\n\n        Our review of the record leads us to agree with the City that the\n\ntrees in the right-of-way are valuable assets and even when the trimming\n\ndone by the utility is done correctly and in accordance with the best\n\ntrimming practices, the trees are damaged in a quantifiable manner.\nHowever, we find Rock’s valuation of the tree damage to be more credible\n\nand conclude the amount of $622,981 should be allocated to the\n\nmaintenance of the electric utility.\n\n        2. Indirect operating costs.        The City contends the district court\n\nundervalued the indirect operating costs associated with maintaining\n\n\n        12Kragnes also elicited testimony at trial and argues in her brief that MEC enjoys\nimmunity for any damage sustained by the tree due to its trimming as long as the\ntrimming was in accordance with best practices. Kragnes, however, cites no authority\nfor its immunity argument and accordingly, we deem the argument waived. Iowa R.\nApp. P. 6.903(2)(g)(3).\n\f                                       23\n\nand managing the right-of-way in which the gas and electric utilities are\n\nlocated. Kragnes and the City agree that a portion of the City’s operating\n\ncosts are appropriately included in the franchise fees.       Specifically,\n\nKragnes agrees that to the extent the City’s costs to maintain the right-\n\nof-way are increased because of the presence of the utilities, those\n\nincreased costs are appropriately included as a component of the\n\nfranchise fee. However, the City seeks to recover 6% of the total costs of\n\nthe general maintenance of the right-of-way—costs that would be\n\nincurred whether or not the utilities were present in the right-of-way.\n\nThe City contends a portion of the total cost of maintaining the right-of-\n\nway is nonetheless appropriately included as a component of the\n\nfranchise fees because the City incurs the cost of maintaining the right-\n\nof-way through which the utilities run for the benefit of the general\n\npublic. The City contends all users of the right-of-way benefit from the\n\nCity’s maintenance and management of the right-of-way, including the\n\nutility providers, so it is appropriate to recoup a portion of the cost of\n\nmaintaining and managing the right-of-way through the franchise fees.\n\n      We agree with Kragnes that the cost of maintaining the right-of-\n\nway that would be incurred whether or not the utilities were present is\n\nnot appropriately included in the franchise fee amount. The costs the\n\nCity would incur to maintain the right-of-way even if the utilities were\n\nnot located there are not an incidental consequence of inspecting,\n\nlicensing, supervising, or otherwise regulating the franchised activity.\n\nWe agree with the district court’s conclusion that the allowable indirect\n\noperating costs are $107,824 per year per utility.\n\n      3.   Other/acute costs.   The City argued that it is appropriate to\n\ninclude an annual amount intended to cover the cost of unexpected,\n\nacute costs related to managing or administering the franchise and\n\f                                       24\n\nsought an allocation of $250,000 per year per utility. The City’s expert,\n\nNick Dragisich, conducted a study of the City’s expenses incurred due to\n\nthe management and maintenance of the gas and electric utility\n\nfranchises.    Dragisich noted that study did not include or consider\n\n“unforeseen    and/or   emergency    costs”   related   to   the   franchise\n\nmanagement. The study noted that such unpredictable events did not\n\noccur in the time frame covered by the study, from 2001 through 2006,\n\nbut cited as examples of such events “the ice storm [in] 1991 and the\n\nsnow storm of 1998” which caused “considerable damage” and resulted\n\nin “considerable costs” to the City in cleaning the debris from the right-\n\nof-way.    The City also offered testimony of other one-time acute costs\n\nincluding $1.625 million to bury electric lines at the City’s expense to\n\npromote development and the City’s $1.6 million settlement of a tort\n\nlawsuit for a pedestrian injured on a City grate providing access to a gas\n\nline.\n\n        The district court concluded the franchise fee can recover\n\nunexpected acute costs, but concluded $100,000 per year per utility was\n\nan appropriate amount. Both the City and Kragnes appeal the district\n\ncourt’s valuation of this component of the franchise fee.          The City\n\ncontends the full $250,000 it requested for each utility should be\n\ncounted. Kragnes asserts no amount should be counted for unexpected\n\nacute costs.     In the alternative, Kragnes argues that even if it is\n\nreasonable to count some amount for unexpected acute costs, the City\n\nhas failed to present evidence to support either the amount it requested\n\nor the amount included in the franchise fee by the district court.\n\n        Although we agree the category of unexpected “acute” costs could\n\nbe counted as a component of a franchise fee in an appropriate case, we\n\nconclude the record in this case provides inadequate support for its\n\f                                             25\n\ninclusion here.       The City offered general testimony tending to prove it\n\nspent $1.6 million to bury electric lines, but we find such costs are in the\n\nnature of capital expenses rather than acute costs. We further conclude\n\nthe settlement of the tort claim was not reasonably related to the cost of\n\ninspecting, licensing, supervising, or otherwise regulating the activity\n\nthat is being franchised, and therefore the district court correctly\n\ndeclined to count the item as a component of the franchise fee. Lastly,\n\nthe City produced testimony that various storms cost “hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars” to clean up. Although the City is not required to\n\naccount    for    its   franchise-related        administrative   expenses      to   a\n\nmathematical certainty, we conclude the evidence as to the cost of the\n\nstorm clean-up was not in sufficient detail to allocate a value to it.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude the district court should not have included any\n\nvalue to the claimed acute costs in the computation of the franchise fees.\n\n      4.   Construction costs paid by the federal and state government.\n\nKragnes contends the district court erred in counting as a franchise fee\n\ncomponent        an   amount   for     certain    increased   construction      costs.\n\nKragnes’s expert, Charles Finch, opined that to the extent some\n\nconstruction      projects   receive    funding     from   the    state   or   federal\n\ngovernment, such construction costs are not actually incurred by the\n\ncity. Kragnes accordingly contends this component of the franchise fee\n\nmust be reduced by 35%, an amount calculated by Finch to account for\n\nthe portion of construction costs offset by state and federal funds. The\n\nCity, however, asserts Finch’s calculations do not bear out. The City’s\n\nexpert, Dragisich, testified that even if it is assumed that 35% of the cost\n\nof a construction project affecting the right-of-way is offset by federal or\n\nstate funds, it does not necessarily follow that the state/federal funds are\n\nactually allocated to the portion of the contract that accounts for the\n\f                                             26\n\nincrease in construction costs attributable to the presence of utilities in\n\nthe right-of-way.      Further, the City argues that once state or federal\n\nfunds are received by the City, they become the City’s funds without\n\nregard to their source.       Simply put, the City contends the court must\n\nfocus on whether the City proved its construction costs attributable to\n\nthe presence of the utilities in the right-of-way are increased, and it\n\nmatters not in calculating the appropriate franchise fee what revenue\n\nstream the City used to pay them. We agree. The source of the funds\n\nused to pay for the increased construction costs attributable to the\n\nutilities is not relevant to the determination of whether such costs are a\n\nproper component of the franchise fee.\n\n       5.   Construction costs paid by WRA/sewer users on WRA/sewer\n\nprojects.      Kragnes contends the district court erred in including as\n\nfranchise fee components any increased construction costs resulting\n\nfrom projects related to the Wastewater Reclamation Authority (WRA) 13\n\nand sanitary sewer. Kragnes argues such costs should not be counted\n\nbecause they are recouped by the City from the WRA and consumers of\n\nsewer services.\n\n       However, the City’s expert explained that the method proposed by\nKragnes’s expert to “back out” the construction costs of WRA and sewer\n\nprojects shifts the increased cost of construction due to the presence of\n\ngas and electric utilities almost entirely to the WRA and sewer users. He\n\ninstead opined it is more appropriate to require the customers of utilities\n\nto bear their fair proportion of the increased costs and require the City to\n\n\n       13The  WRA is a consortium of cities which provides waste treatment facilities\nand services to the member municipalities, including the City of Des Moines. The cities\neach maintain their own sanitary sewer systems for waste collection and connect their\nsystems to WRA facilities for treatment. As the operating contractor for the WRA, the\nCity of Des Moines manages the construction projects for the WRA.\n\f                                       27\n\nin turn reimburse the WRA and sewer utility to avoid “double-dipping” by\n\nthe City. The district court credited the City’s expert. It did not reduce\n\nthis component of the franchise fee by the amount the City’s\n\nconstruction costs are increased as a consequence of WRA and sewer\n\nconstruction projects and it required the City to “negotiate some method\n\nof reimbursement with the enterprise entities to avoid any double\n\nrecovery.”\n\n      We also find the City’s expert’s testimony on this issue credible\n\nand agree with the resolution adopted by the district court.\n\n      6.     Administrative overhead fee on construction and engineering\n\nproject bills.   Kragnes asserts the district court erred in counting a\n\n12.78% administrative fee as a component of the franchise fee.         She\n\nargues this is inappropriate because any increase in administration costs\n\nincurred by the contractor due to the presence of utilities are accounted\n\nfor in the construction contract price. Kragnes further contends that to\n\nthe extent the 12.78% fee represents additional City personnel cost\n\nattributable to administering payment of the construction contracts, it\n\nhas already been accounted for in the operating expense portion of the\n\ndistrict court’s calculation of the franchise fee.    The City disagrees,\n\ncontending the administrative fee does not purport to cover additional\n\ncosts incurred by the construction company but rather addresses the\n\nCity’s additional administrative overhead. The City’s expert, Dragisich,\n\nwas questioned on this precise point and explained that he had taken\n\ncare to insure that costs were not double counted and that the\n\nadministrative fee on third-party contracts did not overlap with the\n\noperating expenses calculated separately. Dragisich also described the\n\ntypes of additional administrative costs incurred by the City on third-\n\nparty construction contracts due to the presence of utilities in the right-\n\f                                       28\n\nof-way. He noted this cost component might include the time required to\n\nnotify the police and fire departments of the timing and location of road\n\nclosures and how to reroute emergency vehicles. This component might\n\nalso include the administrative costs associated with posting notices on\n\nthe City’s website or placing placards on properties informing the public\n\nabout road closures or temporary utility interruptions attributable to\n\nconstruction.\n\n       We find credible Dragisich’s testimony that the City does incur\n\nsome additional administrative overhead in connection with construction\n\nprojects as a consequence of the presence of utilities.     We find such\n\nadministrative costs have not been counted twice and were therefore\n\ncorrectly included by the district court as a component of the franchise\n\nfee.\n\n       7. Interest on the construction costs. Kragnes contends the district\n\ncourt erred in counting bond expense/interest as an element of the\n\nincreased construction and engineering costs. She argues that because\n\nfranchise fees are received quarterly, the City does not need to borrow\n\nmoney to pay construction costs.      However, the City’s expert testified\n\nthat while Kragnes’s logic might work “in a perfect world,” it did not\n\nnecessarily work in reality.    Even if it is assumed the City receives\n\nfranchise fees quarterly, it does not necessarily follow that the City will\n\nalways have funds in hand to pay construction contract payments when\n\nthey are due. The timing of construction projects and the payments due\n\non construction contracts are not necessarily aligned with the City’s\n\nreceipt of franchise fees. Further, as the City’s expert noted, the City’s\n\nconstruction costs fluctuate greatly from year to year and franchise fee\n\nreceipts are not necessarily sufficient to cover this category of costs.\n\f                                        29\n\nAccordingly, we conclude the district court committed no error in\n\ncounting this category of cost as part of the franchise fee.\n\n      8. Increased construction costs. Kragnes and the City disagreed as\n\nto the amount of increased construction and engineering costs incurred\n\nby the City for the accommodation of the gas and electric utilities.\n\nKragnes argues that construction costs were increased by 5% and\n\nengineering costs were increased by 3.5% as a consequence of the\n\npresence of utility structures and equipment in the right-of-way.         The\n\nCity, however, offered testimony suggesting construction costs are\n\nincreased by 15% and engineering costs are increased by 20%.              The\n\ndistrict court found the City’s evidence on this issue more persuasive.\n\n      The main issue of dispute involves a survey created and\n\nimplemented by the City’s expert. City employees were asked whether\n\ntheir work was affected or increased due to the presence of utilities in the\n\nright-of-way. Each employee was also asked how much his or her work\n\nincreased due to each utility (including gas, water, electric, cable, etc.).\n\nThe survey respondents assigned a percentage value for each factor. The\n\nCity’s expert, Dragisich, added the values of the increased work and\n\ncame up with a total increase in work, and concluded engineering costs\n\nwere increased by 20% and construction costs were increased by 15%.\n\nKragnes’s expert, Finch, concluded it was more appropriate to average\n\nthe increased work for all the utilities, producing a 3.5% increase in\n\nengineering costs and 5% increased construction costs.\n\n      We note the City’s expert had extensive construction experience,\n\nincluding the bidding of construction projects conducted in the right-of-\n\nway. He is also a licensed engineer. Although this is a close issue, we\n\ncredit Dragisich’s opinion based on his relevant experience.      We agree\n\nwith the district court’s findings that the increased engineering costs\n\f                                           30\n\nshould be valued at 20% and the increased construction costs should be\n\nvalued at 15%, and adopt them as our own.\n\n      D. Did the District Court Err in Ordering a Refund to all Class\n\nMembers?         As we have already noted, the district court found the\n\nappropriate annual franchise fee is $1,575,194 for the electric utility and\n\n$1,574,046 for the gas utility and declared the plaintiff should have a\n\njudgment against the City in the amount by which the franchise fees\n\ncollected during the period commencing July 27, 1999, and ending\n\nMay 26, 2009, exceeded the annual franchise fee. Citing McKesson Corp.\n\nv. Division of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18, 110 S. Ct.\n\n2238, 110 L. Ed. 2d 17 (1990), the district court concluded the Due\n\nProcess Clause affords the plaintiff class members a meaningful\n\nopportunity to secure postpayment relief for their overpayment of\n\nfranchise fees.     The court further reasoned there must be financial\n\nconsequences       from   the   illegal   taxation   of   the   City’s   residents\n\nnotwithstanding that the funds received from the illegal taxation of the\n\nCity’s residents were used wisely, legally, and with the best intentions for\n\nthe residents.\n\n      The court ordered relief in the form of a refund of the franchise fee\n\noverpayments in an amount to be determined by the court based on\n\nevidence adduced in further proceedings of the actual amount of\n\nfranchise fees collected during the subject period reduced by the annual\n\nfranchise fee determined by the court. The City contends that, even if it\n\ndid charge an excessive franchise fee, the district court erred in\n\nconcluding the class members are entitled to a refund of any amount\n\nthey were overcharged.\n\n      The City contends McKesson and Hagge v. Iowa Department of\n\nRevenue and Finance, 504 N.W.2d 448 (Iowa 1993), are distinguishable\n\f                                               31\n\nand provide no legal basis for ordering a refund in this case.                   We\n\nacknowledge the City’s contention that the plaintiffs in those cases\n\nclaimed deprivation of a federal constitutional right (Commerce Clause\n\nviolation in McKesson and intergovernmental tax immunity in Hagge) in\n\naddition to their due process claims. See McKesson, 496 U.S. at 22, 110\n\nS. Ct. at 2242, 110 L. Ed. 2d at 26; Hagge, 504 N.W.2d at 449. While it\n\nis true that the excessive fees in this case were not found to violate any\n\nfederal constitutional right, we conclude the reasoning stated in\n\nMcKesson and Hagge is compelling, and we therefore apply it in this\n\ncase.\n\n        Meaningful backward-looking relief is especially appropriate to\n\nrectify the class members’ overpayments under the circumstances\n\npresented in this case.           “Because exaction of a tax constitutes a\n\ndeprivation of property,” procedural safeguards are generally required to\n\nprotect against “unlawful exactions in order to satisfy the commands of\n\nthe Due Process Clause.” McKesson, 496 U.S. at 36, 110 S. Ct. at 2250,\n\n110 L. Ed. 2d at 35–36.            However, because “[a]llowing taxpayers to\n\nlitigate   their   tax   liabilities   prior   to   payment   might   threaten    a\n\ngovernment’s financial security,” states have been permitted to restrict\n\nthe ability of the taxpayer to challenge the lawfulness of the tax before it\n\nis paid. Id. at 37, 110 S. Ct. at 2250, 110 L. Ed. 2d at 36. That was the\n\ncase here—Kragnes and the other members of the class had no\n\npredeprivation remedy.          Instead they were required to raise their\n\nobjections to fees in a postdeprivation refund action.\n\n        To satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause,\n        therefore, in this refund action the State must provide\n        taxpayers with, not only a fair opportunity to challenge the\n        accuracy and legal validity of their tax obligation, but also a\n        “clear and certain remedy,” for any erroneous or unlawful\n\f                                        32\n      tax collection to ensure that the opportunity to contest the\n      tax is a meaningful one.\n\nId. at 39, 110 S. Ct. at 2251, 110 L. Ed. 2d at 37 (footnote and internal\ncitation omitted).\n\n      We further note that Kragnes filed this action soon after the City\n\ndecided to commence collecting the franchise fees at issue here.              On\n\nnotice of Kragnes’s claim that the franchise fees were excessive in\n\namount and therefore illegal, the City nonetheless collected them and,\n\nduring the pendency of this action, even increased the amount of the fees\n\ncollected. The failure of the City to respond differently after it was on\n\nnotice of Kragnes’s claim does not mitigate in favor of depriving Kragnes\n\nand the class of a remedy for the unlawful taxation. See id. at 45, 110\n\nS. Ct. at 2254–55, 110 L. Ed. 2d at 41 (noting State has available a range\n\nof procedures to limit the financial impact of refunding taxes, including\n\nrefraining from collecting a tax which has been declared illegal during the\n\npendency of an appeal or placing disputed funds into an escrow account\n\nor utilizing “other accounting devices such that the State can predict\n\nwith greater accuracy the availability of undisputed treasury funds”).\n\n“[The City’s] failure to avail itself of certain of these methods of self-\n\nprotection   weakens   any    ‘equitable’    justification   for   avoiding   its\n\nconstitutional obligation to provide relief.” Id. at 45, 110 S. Ct. at 2255,\n\n110 L. Ed. 2d at 41.\n\n      The City cites the Restatement (Third) of Restitution in support of\n\nits contention that no refund of any overpayment should be ordered\n\nunder the circumstances presented here.               Section 19(1) of the\n\nRestatement states the general rule that a taxpayer who pays an illegally\n\nassessed or collected tax, fee, or charge has a claim in restitution against\n\nthe government to prevent unjust enrichment in the absence of a\n\f                                        33\n\ndifferent rule imposed by statute. Restatement (Third) of Restitution and\n\nUnjust Enrichment § 19(1), at 259 (2011). As has already been noted,\n\nthis court has ordered a refund when a taxpayer overpaid taxes to the\n\nIowa Department of Revenue and Finance. Hagge, 504 N.W.2d at 452.\n\nThe City contends the district court erred, however, in this case in failing\n\nto apply section 19(2) of the Restatement allowing the court to consider\n\nwhether, under the circumstances of a particular case, a restitutionary\n\nremedy should be denied on the ground it would “disrupt orderly fiscal\n\nadministration or result in severe public hardship.” Restatement (Third)\n\nof Restitution § 19(2), at 259. Subject to constitutional limitations, the\n\nrule stated in section 19(2) authorizes the court to limit relief to the\n\nclaimant to avoid either adverse governmental consequence.             Id. § 19\n\ncmt. b, at 260. The City directs us specifically to illustration 17:\n\n      City assesses a property tax on a nondiscriminatory basis.\n      The tax is subsequently determined to be improperly\n      authorized and void. In response to Taxpayers’ suit against\n      City to recover the tax collected from them, City\n      demonstrates that the revenues illegally collected were spent\n      exclusively on ordinary municipal services benefitting\n      Taxpayers among other residents. Under the circumstances,\n      the court may find that neither City nor its residents have\n      been unjustly enriched at Taxpayers’ expense.\n\nId. § 19 cmt. f, illus. 17, at 267.\n\n      This court rejected an equity-based argument opposing a tax\n\nrefund in Hagge. In that case, the State urged a refund should be denied\n\nbecause such relief would impose an onerous fiscal burden.                 We\n\nconcluded, however, that “equity cannot override the clear commands of\n\nthe Due Process Clause.” Hagge, 504 N.W.2d at 452. As in Hagge, we\n\nare not convinced that a properly structured refund in this case will\n\ncreate an onerous fiscal burden on the City or create such disruption\n\f                                            34\n\nand instability as to give rise to countervailing public interests weighing\n\nagainst a refund.\n\n        Undaunted by our rejection of an equitable argument in Hagge, the\n\nCity offers up other equity-based reasons for denying a refund of the\n\nexcessive franchise fees.       Among these reasons are the notion that\n\nrestitution of the excess fees should not be ordered when the excess fees\n\nwere paid by a broad-based group and the plaintiff class would\n\nessentially recover from itself, and the equitable principle that no refund\n\nwill be ordered when the improper tax was collected from a broad\n\nconstituency and the funds were used for the general benefit of a similar\n\npublic constituency.      We conclude the district court correctly declined\n\nthese equity-based entreaties to forego altogether a refund remedy in this\n\ncase.   This conclusion is strongly influenced by the fact that the City\n\ncontinued and increased its collection of the franchise fees after being\n\nput on notice of the claim in this litigation that the fees exceeded the\n\namount authorized by law.             Under these circumstances, equitable\n\nprinciples will not shield the City from a refund. 14\n\n\n        14We note that although the general assembly ratified the City’s collection\n\nof electric and gas franchise fees in excess of the cost of regulating the utilities,\nthe legislature declined to retroactively authorize the excessive fees although it\nclearly knew how. In 2007, the general assembly enacted similar legislation\nratifying the imposition of franchise fees for cable television services. See Iowa\nCode § 477A.7(5) (Supp. 2007); Zaber v. City of Dubuque, 789 N.W.2d 634, 637\n(Iowa 2010). The general assembly explicitly provided that the ratification was\nretroactive. Iowa Code § 477A.7(5); Zaber, 789 N.W.2d at 637. However, in this\ninstance, the legislature decided not to enact a retroactive ratification of\nfranchise fees, but instead made the ratification prospective only. In fact, an\nearly draft of the bill contained a retroactive provision, but that portion was\nstricken in a vote on the floor of the House. See Senate Amendment 3328 to\nS.F. 478, 83 G.A., 1st Sess. (Iowa 2009) (providing in § 202 that any amount of\nelectric or gas franchise fees previously assessed that exceeds the city’s cost of\nregulating the franchise is “declared to be authorized and legally assessed by\nand paid to the city”); Journal of the House, Saturday, April 25, 2009, at pages\n2072–2075 (motion by Oldson, offering amendment H–1780, which, among\nother things, struck the ratification language then found in § 221); 2009 Iowa\n\f                                          35\n\n      The City next contends that if a refund is to be required, it should\n\nbe limited to those class members who can show they would have paid\n\nless if the City had raised the same amount of revenue through property\n\ntaxes. We disagree. We cannot assume the City would have chosen to\n\nincrease real estate taxes by an equivalent amount if the excessive\n\nfranchise fees had not been conceived and collected. In the last analysis,\n\nthe determination of what would have occurred had the excessive\n\nfranchise fees not been collected would require speculation in which the\n\ncourt will not engage. We conclude the most fair remedy in this case is\n\nthe refund which will, to the extent possible, refund to members of the\n\nplaintiff class the excess fees extracted from them and restore the parties\n\nto the status quo ante. We also note the City has available to it the full\n\nrange of legal tax and fee options, budgetary measures, and spending\n\npolicy choices to cover the refund and its ongoing future expenses.\n\n      Comment f to section 19 makes clear that while “[s]ignificant\n\ndisruption and hardship are grounds to limit restitution . . . the mere\n\nfact that relief will be expensive is not.”            Restatement (Third) of\n\nRestitution § 19 cmt. f, at 266.       It further notes that a restitutionary\n\nremedy may be fashioned in a way that minimizes the disruption to the\n\ntaxing authority, “such as by allowing refunds in the form of credits\n\nagainst future assessments.” Id. § 19 cmt. f, at 267. Our disposition of\n\nthis appeal will allow the district court to structure the refund in a way\n\nthat balances the respective interests of the City and the members of the\n\nplaintiff class.\n\n________________________\nActs ch. 179 (amending Iowa Code ch. 364 regarding franchise fees without\nprovision for retroactive ratification of franchise fees).      Such retroactive\nratification has been approved by this court. Zaber, 789 N.W.2d at 656. Thus,\nthe legislature also declined to shield the City from the financial impact of this\nlitigation.\n\f                                      36\n\n      E.   Should the District Court Have Divided the Class Into\n\nSubclasses for the Remaining Proceedings? The City argues that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in not dividing the class into\n\nsubclasses for remedial purposes.    Specifically, the City contends that\n\nwhile the class members interests may be sufficiently alike for purposes\n\nof the resolution of the legal issue in this case, they have significantly\n\ndifferent interests and preferences with regard to the determination of an\n\nappropriate remedy.      These different interests, the City contends,\n\nrequires the division of the class into subclasses.    The district court\n\nconcluded the conflict perceived by the City was speculative and declined\n\nto divide the class.\n\n      The City contends that as a remedial plan is put together, someone\n\nmust represent the interests of those class members that have an\n\ninterest in minimizing the amount of the refund. For example, the City\n\ncontends that the implementation of a remedy must be preceded by an\n\ninitial determination of whether or not potential class members must\n\nsubmit a claim. The City also contends decisions must be made with\n\nregard to the types of notice and information that are to be included with\n\nany refund checks or claim forms because these should vary depending\n\non whether the class member favors or opposes the collection of\n\nfranchise fees as a source of revenue for the City. The City favors the\n\ncreation of subclasses because it harbors doubts that Kragnes “will\n\nvigorously pursue the positions on these issues that are of greatest\n\nadvantage to those class members who benefit from revenue generation\n\nthrough the franchise fee.”\n\n      Kragnes contends that to the extent that no conflict exists\n\nwarranting the decertification of the class, no conflict exists warranting\n\nthe creation of subclasses. She notes she is a property owner and thus a\n\f                                       37\n\nmember of the group the City contends would likely favor the generation\n\nof revenue through franchise fees rather than real estate taxes. However,\n\nclearly she does not favor the refund outcome the City predicts for her as\n\na property owner.\n\n      We conclude the City’s arguments for the creation of subclasses\n\nare speculative on this record. We affirm the district court’s certification\n\nof the class. As administration of this action proceeds on remand, the\n\ndistrict court shall exercise its discretion in ruling on motions, if any,\n\nrequesting the establishment of subclasses. Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.262(3)(c).\n\n      F. Did the District Court Correctly Decline to Order the City\n\nto Amend its Franchise Ordinances?           Kragnes asserts the district\n\ncourt erred in holding amendments of Iowa Code sections 384.3A and\n\n364.2 do not require the City to amend its franchise fee ordinances.\n\nKragnes contends the City should be enjoined from collecting franchise\n\nfees pursuant to the ordinances in effect at the time of this lawsuit until\n\nthe City enacts a new ordinance in compliance with sections 384.3A and\n\n364.2, which became effective May 26, 2009.\n\n      A franchise fee assessed by a city may be based upon a\n      percentage of gross revenues generated from sales of the\n      franchisee within the city not to exceed five percent, without\n      regard to the city’s cost of inspecting, supervising, and\n      otherwise regulating the franchise. Franchise fees collected\n      pursuant to an ordinance in effect on May 26, 2009, shall be\n      deposited in the city’s general fund and such fees collected\n      in excess of the amounts necessary to inspect, supervise,\n      and otherwise regulate the franchise may be used by the city\n      for any other purpose authorized by law. Franchise fees\n      collected pursuant to an ordinance that is adopted or\n      amended on or after May 26, 2009, to increase the\n      percentage rate at which franchise fees are assessed shall be\n      credited to the franchise fee account within the city’s general\n      fund and used pursuant to section 384.3A. If a city franchise\n      fee is assessed to customers of a franchise, the fee shall not\n      be assessed to the city as a customer. Before a city adopts or\n      amends a franchise fee rate ordinance or franchise\n      ordinance to increase the percentage rate at which franchise\n\f                                        38\n      fees are assessed, a revenue purpose statement shall be\n      prepared specifying the purpose or purposes for which the\n      revenue collected from the increased rate will be expended. If\n      property tax relief is listed as a purpose, the revenue\n      purpose statement shall also include information regarding\n      the amount of the property tax relief to be provided with\n      revenue collected from the increased rate. The revenue\n      purpose statement shall be published as provided in section\n      362.3.\n\nIowa Code § 364.2(4)(f) (Supp. 2009).\n\n      The City’s ordinances currently in effect authorize the City to\n\ncollect franchise fees of 5%. However, Kragnes asserts the effect of this\n\nlawsuit is “to lower the allowed percentage rate of franchise fee under the\n\nCity ordinances to the costs of regulation, which is less than 5%.”\n\nAccording to Kragnes, if the City wishes to collect a 5% franchise fee, it\n\nmust enact a new ordinance “to increase the percentage rate at which\n\nfranchise fees are collected” and comply with the notice and revenue\n\nstatement requirements of section 364.2(4)(f) as well as the spending\n\nlimitations of section 384.3A for ordinances enacted after May 26, 2009.\n\n      The City contends the plain language of section 362.2(4)(f) allows it\n\nto continue to collect a 5% franchise fee pursuant to its ordinances\n\nwhich were in effect on May 26, 2009.        The City points out that the\n\nstatute explicitly addresses how funds collected pursuant to ordinances\n\nin effect on May 26, 2009, may be spent, clearly evidencing an intent to\n\n“grandfather in” existing ordinances. The statute further distinguishes\n\nbetween existing ordinances and ordinances enacted or amended after\n\nMay 26, 2009, and requires cities seeking to amend or enact ordinances\n\nafter May 2009 to comply with certain requirements.\n\n      We are not persuaded by Kragnes’s argument that the effect of this\n\nlawsuit and our decision in Kragnes I is to rewrite the City’s franchise fee\n\nordinance. Our decisions simply render the ordinance unenforceable for\n\nthe designated time frame in excess of the costs to maintain and regulate\n\f                                         39\n\nthe franchise.   We agree that the plain language of section 364.2(4)(f)\n\ngrandfathers in franchise fee ordinances in effect on May 26, 2009, and\n\nauthorizes the collection of up to a 5% franchise fee pursuant to those\n\nexisting ordinances.    The district court correctly declined Kragnes’s\n\ninvitation to order the City to adopt a new franchise fee ordinance.\n\n      IV. Conclusion.\n\n      We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ncertifying and denying the City’s motions to decertify the class. We also\n\nconclude the members of the plaintiff class have no due process right to\n\nopt out of the class and the failure of the rules of civil procedure to allow\n\nthem to do so is not unconstitutional.\n\n      After our de novo review of the record, we conclude certain\n\namounts allocated or not allocated by the district court as proper\n\ncomponents of the franchise fees should be modified.        Specifically, we\n\nconclude the City should be able to include the lost value of trees due to\n\ntrimming and removal to accommodate electrical lines in the amount of\n\n$622,981 each year for the electric utility franchise. We also conclude\n\nthe City shall not, based on this record, recoup any amount for\n\nunpredictable, acute costs. We affirm in all other respects the district\n\ncourt’s determination of the allowable amount of franchise fees. For ease\n\nof reference, the franchise fees allowed are as follows.\n\n                           Gas Utility               Electric Utility\n Degradation Costs         $35,030.00/year           $37,373.00/year\n Construction Costs        $1,314,563.00/year        $1,314,563.00/year\n Operating Costs           $107,824.00/year          $107,824.00/year\n Disruption Costs          $2,038.00/year            $843.00/year\n Franchise Fee Study       $14,591.00/year           $14,591.00/year\n Lost Tree Value           $0.00/year                $622,981.00/year\n Acute Costs               $0.00/year                $0.00/year\n Total                     $1,474,046.00/year        $2,098,175.00/year\n\f                                        40\n\n      We further conclude the district court properly ordered a refund of\n\nfees in excess of the totals itemized above.    We remand for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion, for findings as to the amounts\n\nto be distributed to the members of the class, and for a determination of\n\nthe appropriate restitutionary arrangement by which such amounts shall\n\nbe paid.   And, finally, we conclude the district court correctly denied\n\nKragnes’s request for an injunction preventing the City from collecting\n\nfranchise fees pursuant to the ordinances in effect on May 26, 2009.\n\n      AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED AND REMANDED.\n\n      All justices concur except Cady, C.J., who dissents and Waterman\n\nand Mansfield, JJ., who take no part.\n\f                                          41\n\n                                    #09–1473, Kragnes v. City of Des Moines\n\n\nCADY, Chief Justice (dissenting).\n\n      I respectfully dissent.     A basic and fundamental conflict exists\n\nbetween the members of the class.           This conflict is inimical to the\n\nfundamental purpose of class actions and, under the law, does not\n\npermit Kragnes to pursue her claim as a class action. I would hold the\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to decertify the class.\n\n      Several requirements must be met before our law permits class\n\ncertification.    One basic prerequisite is the class representative must\n\n“fairly and adequately” protect the interest of the class. Iowa R. Civ. P.\n\n1.262(2)(c).     This requirement relates to the associated rule that the\n\nclaim of the class representative be typical of that of the other class\n\nmembers. When a conflict exists between class members that relates to\n\nthe issues and is fundamental to the case, class certification is improper.\n\nValley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharm., Inc., 350 F.3d 1181, 1189 (11th Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n      The fundamental conflict in this case can be traced to the\n\nfundamental economic reality of the relationship between a city and its\n\npeople.   A city is its people, and a government is established by the\n\npeople to govern and provide public services and protection for the\n\nbenefit of the people.      In turn, the people provide revenue to the\n\ngovernment so it can operate to carry out its vital public mission. Thus,\n\nthe public mission pursued by government is, one way or the other, paid\n\nby the people.\n\n      In this case, the City of Des Moines sought to raise additional\n\nrevenue for the purpose of providing more public services in the form of\n\nadditional police and fire protection, enhanced public library access, and\n\f                                         42\n\nneeded repairs to deteriorating neighborhoods.     A city is authorized to\n\nraise revenue for such purposes. However, the particular means utilized\n\nby the City to raise the revenue was ultimately found in this case to be\n\ncontrary to the law, but not until the revenue had been collected and\n\nspent on the needed services that have been enjoyed by the public.\n\n       The representative plaintiff brought this lawsuit not only to force\n\nthe City to utilize a lawful means to collect its needed revenue, but also\n\nto obtain a judgment on behalf of all people who paid the fee equal to the\n\ntotal amount of the revenue that had been collected through the illegal\n\nfee.   Class certification allowed her to lump together all residents who\n\nhad paid the illegal tax to elevate the amount of the claim into a\n\nsubstantial judgment. The judgment is so large that the City will now\n\nneed to raise additional revenue or reduce City services to refund the\n\nimproper fee to all the residents who paid it. This inevitable result is not\n\nspeculative.   It is logic.   It is also economic reality based on sound\n\neconomic principle. To pay the judgment to the class, the City will need\n\nto use existing revenue belonging to the class, tax the class, or cut\n\nservices provided to the class. These consequences necessarily divide the\n\nclass and render its members antagonistic. There is little utility in suing\n\nyourself, especially when the associated attorney fees and litigation\n\nexpenses of suing yourself will run into the millions of dollars.      Most\n\npeople    would   be    unwilling   to   pursue   litigation   under   such\n\ncircumstances.\n\n       Accordingly, this case could not present a more basic conflict\n\nbetween a representative plaintiff and those members of the class who\n\nwould not want to force city government to find additional revenue to pay\n\nthe judgment that will inevitably adversely affect most members of the\n\nclass. In other words, the lawsuit is a microcosm of the larger tension in\n\f                                         43\n\nsociety between those who focus on immediate gratification and those\n\nwho seek to make decisions today with future consequences in mind.\n\nThis case forces the latter to join in the approach of the former. In this\n\ncase, the remedy seeks an immediate perceived benefit at a future cost\n\nthat makes the benefit an illusion. This sleight of hand is found at the\n\nheart of the case and presents a most basic conflict that pits the\n\nrepresentative plaintiff, who advocates for a refund, against those class\n\nmembers who understand the futility of a refund and would advocate\n\nagainst it. It is simply unfair for our class action law to be used as a\n\nvehicle to grow a judgment into an amount that will force the City to take\n\naction adverse to the class. A plaintiff who pursues such a goal cannot\n\npossibly represent the interest of the remaining class members.\n\n      This type of inherent conflict in a class is inconsistent with the use\n\nof class action and is not permitted by our law. An analogous case that\n\nbest illustrates this point is Ihrke v. Northern States Power Co., 459 F.2d\n\n566 (8th Cir.), vacated as moot, 409 U.S. 815, 93 S. Ct. 66, 34 L. Ed. 2d\n\n72 (1972). Like this case, Ihrke involved an action brought by a utility\n\ncustomer on behalf of all utility customers. 459 F.2d at 567. The legal\n\nclaim alleged the regulations governing the termination of utility service\n\nwere unconstitutional because customers had been deprived of adequate\n\nprior notice and a fair and impartial hearing prior to the termination of\n\nutility services.   Id.   The court found the class was inherently\n\nantagonistic because not all customers would be in support of a\n\npretermination hearing.    Id. at 572.    Instead, some customers would\n\n“likely . . . feel” that the additional expense of providing a termination\n\nhearing would “conceivably result in a rate increase to all customers.”\n\nId. at 572–73. As with the utility customers in Ihrke, many Des Moines\n\ntaxpayers would be reluctant for government to make expenditures when\n\f                                         44\n\nthey realize those expenditures come from their pocket, one way or the\n\nother.\n\n         Other courts have expressed a slightly different principle that a\n\nclass action cannot be maintained when people in the class would\n\noppose the claim or the remedy sought. In Mayfield v. Dalton, 109 F.3d\n\n1423, 1424 (9th Cir. 1997), two members of the Marine Corp. sought to\n\ncertify a class consisting of all members of the armed forces to challenge\n\nthe constitutionality of a Department of Defense requirement that all\n\nsoldiers provide a DNA sample for future analysis. The court found the\n\nclass to be antagonistic because there were “undoubtedly” people in the\n\nclass who would not oppose the DNA repository and who would want the\n\nrequirement enforced. Mayfield, 109 F.3d at 1427. In this case, there\n\nare undoubtedly people in the class who do not oppose the illegal fee\n\nused to enhance City operations.\n\n         Antagonism also exists in a class when the class consists of people\n\nwho utilize limited resources from a common pool, and named members\n\nof the class seek a remedy that will result in a shift of these limited\n\nresources. See Miller v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 241 F.R.D. 285, 290 (S.D.\n\nOhio 2006) (finding an inherent conflict precluding class certification\n\nwhen female members of a university rowing team claimed the university\n\nwas violating Title IX and sought to establish a class consisting of all\n\nfemale participants in university athletic programs because the remedy\n\nof compliance with Title IX would not be amenable to all class members\n\nbecause compliance would likely only be achieved by shifting resources\n\nfrom one sport to another); see also Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. United\n\nStates, 199 F.R.D. 357, 364–65 (E.D. Okla. 2001) (finding named\n\nplaintiffs’ interests were antagonistic because the agency would be\n\nrequired to reimburse money from limited appropriations in order to\n\f                                       45\n\nmake the required refund).      There are undoubtedly many people in\n\nDes Moines who would oppose a rather insignificant individual refund\n\nthat will only result in a substantial reallocation of resources or\n\nadditional taxation.\n\n      The conflict in this case is as fundamental as the legal principles\n\nthat demand the class to be decertified. Class actions are institutions of\n\nrepresentation, not opposition. They are institutions of social value and\n\npublic good, not personal gain.     The class needs to have a sense of\n\nmission so that all interests are represented. See Hansberry v. Lee, 311\n\nU.S. 32, 44, 61 S. Ct. 115, 119, 85 L. Ed. 22, 28 (1940) (holding plaintiff\n\nseeking to enforce an agreement cannot represent class members who do\n\nnot want it enforced); see also 7A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &\n\nMary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1768, at 389 (3d ed.\n\n2005).   This case is as far from a class action as a case could be.     A\n\nsingle plaintiff should not be permitted to drag nearly an entire\n\ncommunity into a lawsuit that seeks a remedy akin to suing yourself.\n\n      Kragnes certainly had a right to challenge the government action.\n\nShe had a right to turn to the courts to force the City to use the proper\n\nchannels to raise city revenue.   She was free as well to seek her own\n\nrefund. At times, the pursuit of principle alone might be worth the cost,\n\nbut a class action nevertheless requires the pursuit to be shared by the\n\nclass. When public monies or public sacrifice will be used to pay for a\n\npublic interest lawsuit, the representative class requirement for class\n\ncertification ensures that the public actually supports the effort.\n\nConsidering the marginal utility of the remedy sought, considering the\n\nsubsequent legislative adoption of the challenged fee, considering the\n\npublic benefit provided by the challenged government action, and\n\nconsidering the substantial public expense of litigation, it is doubtful\n\f                                         46\n\nmany class members would share in Kragnes’s enthusiasm for her\n\nlawsuit. One of the benefits of a class action is that it allows a plaintiff to\n\npursue a claim by giving an attorney a financial incentive to provide\n\nrepresentation.   It also allows the court to dispose of a multiplicity of\n\nidentical individual claims in an economical manner.            In this case,\n\nhowever, there was no evidence that similar claims were filed or even the\n\nfear of a multitude of similar claims. Moreover, while it is important to\n\nprovide a financial incentive for legal representation in meritorious\n\nlitigation, it should not, in the end, become the only benefit of a class\n\naction.\n\f",

Kragnes v.\n\nCity of Des Moines, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2233359\"><a href=\"/opinion/2233359/kragnes-v-city-of-des-moines/\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643 (Iowa 2006) (Kragnes I). The\n\ndistrict court certified a class, found the franchise fees cannot exceed\n\n$1,575,194 per year for the electric utility and $1,574,046 for the gas\n\nutility, entered judgment in favor of the certified class against the City in\n\nthe amount by which such fees exceeded that amount for the period from\n\nJuly 27, 1999, to May 26, 2009, and retained jurisdiction to determine\n\nthe amount of money to be refunded to members of the class, the\n\nmanner in which the refunds must be made, the fees to be paid to\n\ncounsel for the plaintiff class, and the costs of this action.      The City\n\nappeals and Kragnes cross-appeals. We affirm the judgment as modified\n\nand remand for further proceedings.\n\n      I. Background Facts and Proceedings.\n\n      The background facts of this case are fully described in Kragnes I,\n\n714 N.W.2d at 633–37.       In 2004, the City of Des Moines considered\n\nraising property taxes to hire more police and firefighters, maintain the\n\nlibrary’s hours, and rehabilitate certain deteriorating neighborhoods.\n\nThe City realized the state was phasing out sales and use taxes on\n\nresidential gas and electric services and determined that it would be\n\npossible to increase the franchise fees on these services to raise revenue.\n\nAfter deciding this source of revenue was preferable to an increase in\n\nproperty taxes, the City renegotiated the franchise agreements with\n\nMidAmerican Energy (MEC), which provided gas and electric service for\n\nthe city, and increased the franchise fee from 1% to 3% for both gas and\n\f                                         3\n\nelectric services effective September 2004.      Effective June 2005, the\n\nfranchise fees were increased to 5% for each utility.\n\n      Lisa Kragnes promptly filed a petition in equity on behalf of herself\n\nand all others similarly situated challenging the franchise fees as illegal\n\ntaxes. She sought reimbursement for all illegal taxes paid through the\n\nallowable statute of limitations and sought an injunction prohibiting the\n\nCity from charging such franchise fees in the future. The district court\n\ngranted Kragnes’s motion for summary judgment and the City appealed.\n\nWe concluded in Kragnes I that\n      a city has the authority to assess a franchise fee expressed\n      as a percentage of the gross receipts derived from the utility’s\n      sale of its services to the public, so long as the charge is\n      reasonably related to the reasonable costs of inspecting,\n      licensing, supervising, or otherwise regulating the activity\n      that is being franchised.\nId. at 642–43. Because there was a genuine issue of material fact as to\n\nwhether all or part of the franchise fees were reasonably related to the\n\nCity’s administrative expenses in exercising its police power, we\n\nremanded to the district court for the determination of whether a class\n\nshould be certified and for a trial on the merits. Id. at 643.\n\n      On remand, the district court certified a class consisting of all City\n\nof Des Moines utilities customers who paid the electricity or gas\n\nfranchise fee from July 27, 1999, forward. The City filed three motions\n\nto decertify the class, all of which were denied. After trial, the district\n\ncourt determined that a portion of the franchise fee collected was\n\nexcessive.   The court held the City must refund to the class, with\n\ninterest, the amount by which the franchise fees exceeded $1,575,194\n\nper year for the electric utility and $1,574,046 for the gas utility. The\n\ncourt retained jurisdiction to determine the details of how the refund\n\nwould be calculated and refunded to class members.           The court also\n\f                                          4\n\nconcluded injunctive relief was unnecessary because the legislature had\n\namended Iowa Code section 364.2(4)(f) to allow municipalities to impose\n\nfranchise fees in excess of the reasonable cost of inspecting, licensing,\n\nsupervising, or otherwise regulating utilities’ activities.    See 2009 Iowa\n\nActs ch. 179, § 228 (codified at Iowa Code section 364.2(4)(f) (Supp.\n\n2009)).\n\n        Both the City and Kragnes sought, and we granted, interlocutory\n\nappeal.     The City contends the district court should have granted its\n\nmotion to decertify the class for two reasons: (1) a fundamental conflict\n\nexists between members of the class, and (2) class members are not\n\npermitted to “opt out” of the litigation. In the alternative, if this litigation\n\nis allowed to proceed as a class action and a remedy is owed, the City\n\ncontends the class should be divided into subclasses.              The parties\n\ndisagree as to the categories and amounts of expenses that may be\n\ncounted as “reasonably related” to the administration of electric and gas\n\nfranchises during the relevant time period.          The City contends the\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to include as proper components of the\n\nfranchise fee the lost value of its trees and certain indirect operating\n\ncosts attributable to the utility franchises and in undervaluing as fee\n\ncomponents certain “non-annual unpredictable expenses attendant to\n\nthe City’s police power responsibilities.” Kragnes contends in her cross-\n\nappeal that the district court erred in allowing as franchise fee\n\ncomponents construction and engineering costs funded by federal and\n\nstate     government   appropriations    or   the   Wastewater    Reclamation\n\nAuthority, construction and overhead costs covered by sewer treatment\n\nfees paid by users of the City’s sanitary sewer system, administrative\n\noverhead in the amount of 12.78% added to construction and\n\f                                          5\n\nengineering   expenses    charged    by       contractors,   and   interest   on\n\nconstruction and engineering expenses.\n\n      The parties also hotly dispute the parameters of the remedy in this\n\nappeal.   The City contends the district court erred in concluding the\n\nplaintiff class is entitled to a refund, while Kragnes contends a full\n\nrefund must be ordered and injunctive relief should be granted requiring\n\nthe City to amend its ordinances in compliance with the amended\n\nlegislation found in sections 364.2(4)(f) and 384.3A, including providing\n\npublic notice and identifying the City’s costs of regulating the franchises\n\nand what amounts it seeks in excess of its regulation costs.\n\n      II.

Discussion.\n\n      A. Should the Class Have Been Decertified Because of a\n\nConflict Among the Members?          The City argues the district court\n\nshould have granted its motion to decertify the class because a conflict of\n\ninterest exists between Kragnes, as the class representative, and other\n\nmembers of the class who will suffer economically as a result of a\n\njudgment in favor of the class. Specifically, the City contends it imposed\n\nthe franchise fees in lieu of raising property taxes. The franchise fees\n\nwere paid by anyone in the city who utilized gas and electric service,\n\nwhether or not they owned property. Further, if the City is required to\n\nrefund the roughly $40 million in excess tax that was collected from\n\n2004 until 2009, it will need to raise the revenue for this payment. The\n\nCity contends the most likely result of a refund is an increase of property\n\ntaxes. Because the burden of any prospective tax increase imposed to\n\nfinance the refund will be borne only by current property owners, the\n\nCity contends property owners will be required to pay a larger proportion\n\nof the refund than they paid when the illegal tax was collected from all\n\nutilities customers in the city.   In other words, the City contends a\n\nfundamental conflict exists between Kragnes and class members who are\n\nproperty owners and who would tend to oppose Kragnes’s refund\n\nobjective because they benefitted from the collection of the excessive\n\nfranchise fees from payors who were not property owners. The district\n\ncourt concluded the claimed conflict was speculative and denied the\n\nCity’s motion.\n\f                                              7\n\n       One of the prerequisites for class certification is that the class\n\nrepresentative will “fairly and adequately . . . protect the interests of the\n\nclass.” Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.262(2)(c). The City contends Kragnes cannot\n\nprotect the interests of the certified class because she has a conflict of\n\ninterest in the maintenance of the class action.             See id. r. 1.263(2)(b)\n\n(providing assessment of whether the class representative “fairly and\n\nadequately will protect the interests of the class” turns inter alia on a\n\nfinding that the representative has no conflict of interest).               However,\n\n“[n]ot every disagreement between a representative and other class\n\nmembers will stand in the way of a class action suit. The conflict must\n\nbe fundamental, going to the specific issues and controversies.”\n\nVignaroli, 360 N.W.2d at 746 (citation omitted).\n\n       The City relies on two opinions from the Eleventh Circuit Court of\n\nAppeals to support its argument that the intraclass conflict in this case\n\nis so fundamental as to preclude certification or require decertification.\n\nIn Pickett v. Iowa Beef Processors, a group of cattle producers filed an\n\nantitrust suit against Iowa Beef Processors (IBP), a meat packer.                 </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"74480\"><a href=\"/opinion/74480/henry-lee-pickett-v-iowa-beef-processors/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1276</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1277 (11th Cir. 2000). The plaintiffs alleged IBP had used\n\nforward contracts 1 and marketing agreements 2 to coerce producers\n\nselling cattle on the spot markets to accept lower prices in violation of the\n\nPackers and Stockyards Act.           Id. at 1278.      The plaintiffs specifically\n\nasserted IBP had used the forward contracts and marketing agreements\n\n\n\n       1A   “forward contract” is an agreement between a packer and a producer\nestablishing the price to be paid for the cattle weeks or months before the animals are\nready for slaughter. Pickett, 209 F.3d at 1278.\n       2“Marketing agreements” are “more extended versions of forward contracts.”\n\nUnder such agreements, the producer “promises to sell most of its cattle to a packer at\nprices determined by a negotiated formula, which can be adjusted after slaughter\naccording to the quality of the beef.” Id.\n\f                                         8\n\nto create a “captive supply,” depress the market price at strategic times,\n\nand force producers selling on the spot market to accept artificially low\n\nprices for their fattened cattle. Id. The relief sought by the plaintiffs for\n\nthe class included damages and an injunction prohibiting IBP from using\n\nsuch purchasing arrangements in the future. Id. at 1280. The district\n\ncourt certified a class of all cattle producers who sold cattle directly to\n\nIBP from February 1994 through and including the date of certification—\n\na class of at least 15,000 members including both producers who sold\n\ncattle on the spot market and those who sold cattle under forward\n\ncontracts or marketing agreements.           Id. at 1279.   On appeal, the\n\nEleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, holding that the plaintiffs\n\ncould not adequately represent a class consisting of both producers who\n\nsold on the spot market and those who sold under forward contracts and\n\nmarketing agreements.        Id. at 1280–81.   The court reasoned that the\n\nclass could not include both the spot market producers who had\n\nallegedly been harmed by the forward contracts and marketing\n\nagreements and the producers who had benefitted from such marketing\n\nvehicles and wished to continue doing so.          Id. at 1280 (noting the\n\ncertified class “includes those who claim harm from the very same acts\n\nfrom which other members of the class have benefitted”).\n\n      In Valley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a group of\n\npharmaceuticals wholesalers filed an antitrust action alleging the\n\ndefendant Abbott Laboratories made agreements with other defendant\n\ndrug manufacturers preserving Abbott’s monopoly position in the market\n\nfor the drug Hytrin (terazosin hydrochloride) and keeping less expensive\n\ngeneric alternatives off the market. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76384\"><a href=\"/opinion/76384/valley-drug-v-geneva-pharmaceuticals/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1183–84 (11th Cir.\n\n2003).   The district court certified a class including all entities who\n\npurchased    Hytrin   from    Abbott   at any    time   during the   periods\n\f                                             9\n\ncommencing March 31, 1998, through August 13, 1999.                    Id. at 1186.\n\nOn appeal, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, concluding\n\nthe plaintiffs had failed to prove they could adequately represent the\n\nclass that included some wholesalers who resold Hytrin on a cost-plus\n\nbasis and other wholesalers who utilized other pricing formulas. Id. at\n\n1190. The court reasoned that a potential, significant conflict among the\n\nclass members was suggested by the disparate pricing schemes of the\n\nclass members. 3       Id. at 1190–91.         Because the record on appeal\n\nsuggested those wholesalers who sold on a cost-plus basis would, unlike\n\nother wholesalers in the class, lose both margin and volume from generic\n\ncompetition preferred by other class members, the court reversed the\n\nclass certification order and remanded for development of the evidentiary\n\nrecord as to the potential conflict. 4 Id. at 1192.\n\n       The City contends the economic conflict of interest among the class\n\nmembers in this case is as fundamental as the conflicts perceived by the\n\ncourts in Pickett and Valley Drug. Suggesting many of the members of\n\nthe class are hostile to the refund because, as property taxpayers, they\n\nwill be adversely affected by it, the City asserts the district court abused\n\nits discretion in certifying and refusing to decertify the class.\n       Kragnes denies the alleged intraclass conflict is fundamental.\n\nFirst, she notes that the fact that some members of the class do not favor\n\nthe lawsuit is not sufficient to defeat certification of the class. Vignaroli,\n\n\n       3The  defendants alleged that three national wholesaler class members whose\ntransactions with Abbot constituted over 50% of the class claims were among those who\nsold Hytrin on a cost-plus basis and likely derived more profit from sales of branded\nproducts than from sales of generic drugs. Valley Drug, 350 F.3d 1190–91.\n        4The need for the development of the evidentiary record was the result of the\n\ndistrict court’s ruling precluding “downstream discovery” on the subject of the\nwholesalers’ sales practices bearing upon whether the cost-plus sellers achieved a net\ngain as a consequence of the unavailability of the competing generics. Id. at 1192.\n\f                                            10\n\n360 N.W.2d at 747. She argues the “crux” of the case against the City is\n\nthe illegality of the franchise fee and there is no conflict among the\n\nmembers as to that issue.          She argues the nature and extent of the\n\nrefund of the illegal franchise fees collected by the City are secondary to\n\nthe liability issue. Because it is unknown how the City will choose to\n\nfund the judgment against it in this case, Kragnes contends the fear that\n\nsome members of the class will suffer a loss as a result of any refund is\n\nbased on speculation. She points out that as of the time of trial, the City\n\nhad not decided how it was going to cover the cost of any refund and that\n\nit had considered options other than raising property tax, such as\n\nreducing   administrative      expenses,     cutting    or      deferring   capital\n\nimprovements, or obtaining funding through long-term debt.                     As a\n\nproperty owner in Des Moines, Kragnes contends she is in the perfect\n\nposition to represent the interests of other property-owning class\n\nmembers as she weighs the benefits of a refund against the potential\n\nconsequences.\n\n      We find no abuse of the district court’s broad discretion in\n\ncertifying and refusing to decertify the class. The heart of this case is the\n\nillegality of the franchise fee imposed by the City, and we agree with\n\nKragnes that there is no fundamental conflict among the class members\n\nas to that issue. See Vignaroli, 360 N.W.2d at 746–47. Each of the class\n\nmembers paid fees that the City should not have collected and in this\n\nfundamental     respect    their   claims    are   identical,    consistent,    and\n\ncompatible.\n\n      Although the City claims an economic conflict exists among class\n\nmembers, the district court did not abuse its discretion in reaching a\n\ncontrary conclusion.      To the extent the City contends this lawsuit will\n\ncause adverse consequences for property owners, we again note Kragnes\n\f                                                11\n\nherself is a property owner sharing that status with other property\n\nowners in the city. 5 The City seeks to neutralize the significance of this\n\nstatus shared by Kragnes and the other property-owning members of the\n\nclass with a retrospective and a prospective analysis of the alleged\n\neconomic conflict. In each of these analyses, however, the assertion of a\n\nfundamental conflict is substantially based on speculation.\n\n       In its retrospective analysis of the claimed conflict, the City\n\ncontends the property owners would have preferred the City generate\n\nrevenue through franchise fees paid by both property owners and\n\nnonowners alike rather than impose a property tax increase not directly\n\nshared by nonowners. 6 But this contention is infused with speculation\n\nas to whether and how much the City would have chosen to increase\n\nproperty taxes if it had not imposed the illegal franchise fees. Although\n\nthe record indicates the City considered increasing property taxes to\n\nraise funds for certain expenditures, it is impossible to know how much,\n\nif at all, the City’s elected leaders would have increased property taxes\n\nhad they not chosen instead to utilize the illegal franchise fees to raise\n\nrevenue. Viewed from the precollection vantage point, the City’s conflict\n\nargument assumes the City would have raised property taxes and would\nhave raised them in such an amount that at least some property owners\n\nwould have paid more in increased property taxes than they ultimately\n\n\n        5The federal cases cited by the City for the proposition that class certification is\n\nimproper when some members of the class benefited from the same conduct that\nharmed other members do not involve a named representative who arguably benefited\nfrom the conduct and thus shares the interest of the other class members who\nbenefited.\n       6The  City’s contention that the interests of property owners and nonowners\nconflict fundamentally because owners bear the burden of real estate taxes and\ntherefore have an aversion to tax increases not shared by nonowners is tinged with\nspeculation to the extent owners pass along property tax increases to nonowners\nthrough rents.\n\f                                              12\n\npaid in franchise fees.          We decline to engage in the retrospective\n\nspeculation undergirding the City’s assumption that the singular fiscal\n\nalternative to increasing franchise fees was an increase in property taxes.\n\nOther feasible precollection alternatives—including a decision against\n\nraising additional revenue—were available to the City.                Thus, from the\n\nprecollection vantage point, the contention that the interests of Kragnes\n\nare misaligned or fundamentally in conflict with those of other class\n\nmembers is speculative at best.\n\n       When the alleged conflict between the interests of Kragnes and\n\nother property-owning members of the class is viewed prospectively from\n\nthe postcollection or “refund” vantage point, we again find an abundance\n\nof speculation. Here the City’s conflict analysis assumes any refund will\n\nbe financed through a property tax increase in such an amount as will\n\ncause at least some property owners to pay more in increased property\n\ntaxes than they will receive in refunded franchise fees.                Although this\n\nprospect cannot be ruled out, the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in failing to assume the refund will be financed solely through\n\na property tax increase. 7\n\n       In the last analysis, the City’s characterization of the conflict\nbetween the interests of Kragnes and other class members is rife with\n\nspeculation—beginning with speculation about what City leaders would\n\nhave done in the past and ending with predictions about what City\n\n\n       7As    we have already noted, the general assembly recently adopted legislation\nuntethering the amount of franchise fees from the municipality’s cost of inspecting and\nmaintaining the utility. See Iowa Code § 364.2(4)(f). Under the new regime, the amount\nof franchise fees is instead limited prospectively to a maximum of 5% of the customer’s\nutility bills. Id. We decline to speculate about whether the City will finance the refund\nthrough this (or any other) revenue stream, through prospective budgetary and fiscal\nalternatives, or from a combination of such policy choices. The district court will on\nremand take evidence informing its decision on the appropriate structure of the refund\nmechanism.\n\f                                               13\n\nleaders will do in the future. And in between is speculation about the\n\neffect of hypothetical decisions on property owners. Did they pay less in\n\nfranchise fees than they would have paid in property taxes had the\n\nfranchise fees not been increased? Did some nonproperty-owning class\n\nmembers pay more in increased franchise fees than they would have paid\n\nthrough rent increases occasioned by property tax increases had the\n\nfranchise fees not been increased? How, if at all, will property tax rates\n\nbe affected by the refund remedy ultimately fashioned in this case? 8 See\n\nHispanics United of DuPage Cnty. v.

We think\n\nthis case demonstrates the very necessity and importance of class action\n\nlitigation both for the plaintiffs and for the City.         The likelihood of a\n\nplaintiff bringing such a complex suit requiring substantial resources to\n\nlitigate in small claims is highly unlikely.        And if she, and scores of\n\nthousands of others like her, did bring their claims individually, it could\n\neasily overwhelm the legal department of the City and the resources of\n\n\n\n\n       9We   express no opinion at this juncture whether further proceedings in this\nmatter will justify the division of the class into subclasses.

Rule\n\n1.263(1) provides a list of factors to be considered by the district court\n\nwhen determining whether a class action should be permitted for the fair\n\nand efficient adjudication of the controversy, including:\n             a. Whether a joint or common interest exists among\n      members of the class.\n             b. Whether the prosecution of separate actions by or\n      against individual members of the class would create a risk\n      of inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to\n      individual members of the class that would establish\n      incompatible standards of conduct for a party opposing the\n      class.\n             c. Whether adjudications with respect to individual\n      members of the class as a practical matter would be\n      dispositive of the interests of other members not parties to\n      the adjudication or substantially impair or impede their\n      ability to protect their interests.\nIowa R. Civ. P. 1.263(1).      The district court specifically found that\n\nmultiple lawsuits over the subject matter of this case could cause\n\nsubstantial harm to the rights of different class members because\n\ndifferent results might occur in the thousands of potential cases. The\n\ncourt also noted this large number of claims could, if pursued\nindividually, overwhelm the City’s legal department. These findings have\n\nspecial significance in the court’s determination of whether class\n\nmembers may opt out of the class under rule 1.267(1).\n\n      Rule 1.267(1) provides that a member may not elect to be excluded\n\nfrom the action if “[t]he certification order contains an affirmative finding\n\nunder rule 1.263(1)(a), (b), or (c).”         Iowa R.

Shutts involved a class action lawsuit\n\nagainst Phillips Petroleum, a company that produced natural gas from\n\nleased land in eleven different states.   472 U.S. at 799, 105 S. Ct. at\n\n2967, 86 L. Ed. 2d at 633.        The plaintiffs brought suit in Kansas\n\nclaiming to represent a class of 28,000 royalty owners from all fifty states\n\nand several foreign countries with ownership interests in the leased\n\nproperties. Id. Phillips challenged the inclusion of nonresidents within\n\nthe class, contending “that unless out-of-state plaintiffs affirmatively\n\nconsent, the Kansas courts may not exert jurisdiction over their claims.”\n\nId. at 806, 105 S. Ct. at 2971, 86 L. Ed. 2d at 638. Phillips argued that\n\nmany of the members of the proposed class lacked minimum contacts\n\nwith Kansas and could not be bound, consistent with the due process\n\nclause, by a judgment of the Kansas court. Id. After a discussion of the\n\ndevelopment of and rationales for class action litigation, the Supreme\n\nCourt “reject[ed the] contention that the Due Process Clause of the\n\nFourteenth Amendment requires that absent plaintiffs affirmatively ‘opt\n\nin’ to the class, rather than be deemed members of the class if they do\n\nnot ‘opt out.’ ” Id. at 812, 105 S. Ct. at 2974–75, 86 L. Ed. 2d at 642.\n\nThe Court concluded that the “procedure followed by Kansas, where a\n\nfully descriptive notice is sent first-class mail to each class member, with\n\nan explanation of the right to ‘opt out,’ satisfie[d] due process.” Id. at\n\n812, 105 S. Ct. at 2975, 86 L. Ed. 2d at 642.       Contrary to the City’s\n\nunderstanding of the case, Shutts does not stand for the proposition that\n\nthe Due Process Clause mandates that all class members must have the\n\nopportunity to opt out of a class action case.\n\n      In a subsequent case, the Supreme Court granted certiorari to\n\ndetermine whether an Alabama court’s certification of a class and\n\f                                        18\n\napproval of a settlement agreement resolving the claims of class members\n\nviolated the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because\n\nall class members were not afforded the right to exclude themselves from\n\nthe class or the agreement.

However, the Court\n\ndid not decide the issue as it determined certiorari was improvidently\n\ngranted because the parties did not raise the federal issue below.

Class Actions Act,\n\n12 U.L.A. 93 (2008). The commissioners’ comment to section 8 of the\n\nModel Act, which corresponds to Iowa rule 1.267(1), provides:\n              Under some circumstances members of a plaintiff\n       class cannot elect to be excluded because they are\n       indispensible parties. This would be determined by the\n       court in ruling on certification considering the criteria of\n       Section 3(a) [Iowa rule 1.263(1)]. Such situations might arise\n       in actions comparable to those under Federal Rule 23(b)(1);\n       see 3B Moore’s Federal Practice, ¶23.35. In most situations\n       members of a plaintiff class will be permitted to elect to be\n       excluded.\n              A class member aggrieved by an affirmative finding\n       under Section 3(a)(1), (2) or (3) might seek relief through one\n       of the extraordinary writs or through an interlocutory appeal\n       if authorized by the state practice.\nId. § 8 cmt., 12 U.L.A. 109. Similarly, class actions certified pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule 23(b)(1) do not permit members of a plaintiff class to opt out\n\nof the litigation. Certification pursuant to Federal Rule 23(b)(1) requires\n\nthe court to make findings nearly identical to the findings required by\n\f                                               19\n\nIowa rule 1.263(1).10 Members of a class certified pursuant to Federal\n\nRule 23(b)(1) are not provided an opportunity by the rule to exclude\n\nthemselves from the action. 7AA Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &\n\nMary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1786, at 496–97 (3d ed.\n\n2005). Rather, “it is reasonably certain that the named representatives\n\nwill protect the absent members and give them the functional equivalent\n\nof a day in court.” Id. at 496.\n\n      We believe the procedural safeguards in our rules of civil procedure\n\nregarding class actions take into account due process concerns of all\n\nparties involved—both the plaintiff class members as well as the\n\ndefendants. Accordingly, we reject the City’s contention that the district\n\ncourt’s application of rule 1.267(1) violates due process because class\n\nmembers are not given the option of excluding themselves from the\n\nplaintiff class under the circumstances of this case.\n\n      C. Did the District Court Properly Determine What Costs Were\n\nAllowable as Regulation of the Franchises?                     The district court\n\nconcluded that an annual amount of $1,575,194 should be allocated to\n\nthe City’s administrative expenses in maintaining and managing the\n\n\n\n      10Federal   Rule 23 provides, in relevant part\n      (b) Types of Class Actions. A class action may be maintained if Rule\n          23(a) is satisfied and if:\n      (1) prosecuting separate actions by or against individual class members would\n         create a risk of:\n         (A) inconsistent or varying adjudications with respect to individual class\n             members that would establish incompatible standards of conduct for the\n             party opposing the class; or\n         (B) adjudications with respect to individual class member that, as a\n             practical matter, would be dispositive of the interests of the other class\n             members not parties to the individual adjudications or would\n             substantially impair or impede their ability to protect their interests[.]\n      Fed. R. Civ. P. 23.\n\f                                        20\n\nelectric utility and $1,574,046 should be allocated for the City’s\n\nmaintenance and management of the gas utility.             These amounts\n\nincluded increased construction costs due to the presence of utilities,\n\nincreased operating costs due to the presence of utilities, degradation\n\ncosts, disruption costs, the cost of the franchise fee study, and one-time,\n\nunexpected acute costs. Both parties take issue with several of the costs\n\nallowed, or not allowed, by the district court.\n\n      Our decision in Kragnes I directed the district court to “determine\n\nwhat, if any, part of the franchise fees are related to the City’s\n\nadministrative expenses in exercising its police power, including the\n\ncosts associated with any incidental consequences of the franchised\n\nservices.” Kragnes I, 714 N.W.2d at 643. This does not require the City\n\nto calculate its administrative expenses to a mathematical certainty. Id.\n\nat 642. The district court concluded that Kragnes, as the plaintiff, bore\n\nthe burden of showing what, if any part of the franchise fees are not\n\nrelated to the City’s administrative expenses and neither party challenges\n\non appeal this allocation of the burden. However, the parties disagree\n\nwith several specific costs the district court found the City should or\n\nshould not be able to recover through the franchise fee.\n\n      1. Lost value of trees. The district court did not include the lost\n\nvalue of the City’s trees due to trimming and removal to accommodate\n\nthe utilities as an allowable incidental cost of the franchise.   The City\n\ncontends this was error.\n\n      Both the City and Kragnes offered expert testimony appraising the\n\nvalue of the trees located in the right-of-way which are trimmed or\n\f                                            21\n\nremoved by MEC 11 to accommodate electric lines.               The City’s expert,\n\nKeith Majors, conducted a survey of a portion of the City’s right-of-way,\n\nattempting to count and value the trees that had been trimmed or\n\nremoved.         Majors opined the City’s trees suffered approximately $5.2\n\nmillion in damage each year due to MEC’s trimming. Although Kragnes\n\ncontends the loss of value of the trees in the right-of-way is not the type\n\nof cost that should be considered part of the City’s administration of the\n\nfranchise, Kragnes also provided expert testimony from Jim Rock as to\n\nthe value of the trimmed and removed trees. Rock attempted to recreate\n\nMajors’ survey and testified he was unable to verify Majors’ calculations\n\nof the number, type, and size of private and public trees affecting the\n\nright-of-way. Although Rock identified more trees affecting the right-of-\n\nway than did Majors, his appraisal of the value of the damage sustained\n\nby the City’s trees was significantly less than Majors’ estimate.                He\n\nconcluded the annual loss of value was $622,981.                Rock opined that\n\nMajors’ calculations failed to account for the fact that the trees are only\n\ntrimmed, on average, once every five years and that the damage assessed\n\nin Majors’ report was cumulative rather than annual.\n\n       The district court concluded the lost tree value was not the type of\n\nincidental consequence that should be considered by the court in\n\ncalculating an appropriate franchise fee because it is “nothing more than\n\na theoretical concept.”       The district court further noted if it were to\n\nconsider tree damage a cost related to the administration of the\n\nfranchise, it would accept Rock’s valuation of the damage.\n\n\n\n\n       11Trial  testimony established that MEC did not perform the trimming itself\nduring the years at issue but contracted with Wright Tree Service for the maintenance\nof all trees, publicly and privately owned, interfering with the electric lines.\n\f                                               22\n\n        The City contends the damage to the trees is analogous to the\n\ndamage done to sidewalks and streets as a consequence of the\n\nmaintenance of the utility, a degradation cost which was allowed by the\n\ndistrict court as a component of the franchise fee. As the City argues,\n\ntrees are valuable assets which are damaged when they are trimmed to\n\naccommodate electric lines, no matter how carefully the trimming is\n\ndone.    Although trees may be pruned to promote growth and health,\n\ntrees that are trimmed to accommodate electric lines are trimmed\n\nwithout regard to the utility, function, and beauty of the tree. They are\n\ntrimmed only to provide sufficient clearance for the electric lines. Rock\n\nagreed that the trees are damaged when they are trimmed but disagreed\n\nthat the City suffers a loss when the trees are trimmed because the City,\n\nor any owner, also receives a benefit from the trimming of the trees—the\n\nsafe and reliable delivery of electrical service.           This benefit offsets any\n\nloss, argues Kragnes. 12\n\n        Our review of the record leads us to agree with the City that the\n\ntrees in the right-of-way are valuable assets and even when the trimming\n\ndone by the utility is done correctly and in accordance with the best\n\ntrimming practices, the trees are damaged in a quantifiable manner.\nHowever, we find Rock’s valuation of the tree damage to be more credible\n\nand conclude the amount of $622,981 should be allocated to the\n\nmaintenance of the electric utility.\n\n        2. Indirect operating costs.        The City contends the district court\n\nundervalued the indirect operating costs associated with maintaining\n\n\n        12Kragnes also elicited testimony at trial and argues in her brief that MEC enjoys\nimmunity for any damage sustained by the tree due to its trimming as long as the\ntrimming was in accordance with best practices. Kragnes, however, cites no authority\nfor its immunity argument and accordingly, we deem the argument waived. Iowa R.\nApp. P. 6.903(2)(g)(3).\n\f                                       23\n\nand managing the right-of-way in which the gas and electric utilities are\n\nlocated. Kragnes and the City agree that a portion of the City’s operating\n\ncosts are appropriately included in the franchise fees.       Specifically,\n\nKragnes agrees that to the extent the City’s costs to maintain the right-\n\nof-way are increased because of the presence of the utilities, those\n\nincreased costs are appropriately included as a component of the\n\nfranchise fee. However, the City seeks to recover 6% of the total costs of\n\nthe general maintenance of the right-of-way—costs that would be\n\nincurred whether or not the utilities were present in the right-of-way.\n\nThe City contends a portion of the total cost of maintaining the right-of-\n\nway is nonetheless appropriately included as a component of the\n\nfranchise fees because the City incurs the cost of maintaining the right-\n\nof-way through which the utilities run for the benefit of the general\n\npublic. The City contends all users of the right-of-way benefit from the\n\nCity’s maintenance and management of the right-of-way, including the\n\nutility providers, so it is appropriate to recoup a portion of the cost of\n\nmaintaining and managing the right-of-way through the franchise fees.\n\n      We agree with Kragnes that the cost of maintaining the right-of-\n\nway that would be incurred whether or not the utilities were present is\n\nnot appropriately included in the franchise fee amount. The costs the\n\nCity would incur to maintain the right-of-way even if the utilities were\n\nnot located there are not an incidental consequence of inspecting,\n\nlicensing, supervising, or otherwise regulating the franchised activity.\n\nWe agree with the district court’s conclusion that the allowable indirect\n\noperating costs are $107,824 per year per utility.\n\n      3.   Other/acute costs.   The City argued that it is appropriate to\n\ninclude an annual amount intended to cover the cost of unexpected,\n\nacute costs related to managing or administering the franchise and\n\f                                       24\n\nsought an allocation of $250,000 per year per utility. The City’s expert,\n\nNick Dragisich, conducted a study of the City’s expenses incurred due to\n\nthe management and maintenance of the gas and electric utility\n\nfranchises.    Dragisich noted that study did not include or consider\n\n“unforeseen    and/or   emergency    costs”   related   to   the   franchise\n\nmanagement. The study noted that such unpredictable events did not\n\noccur in the time frame covered by the study, from 2001 through 2006,\n\nbut cited as examples of such events “the ice storm [in] 1991 and the\n\nsnow storm of 1998” which caused “considerable damage” and resulted\n\nin “considerable costs” to the City in cleaning the debris from the right-\n\nof-way.    The City also offered testimony of other one-time acute costs\n\nincluding $1.625 million to bury electric lines at the City’s expense to\n\npromote development and the City’s $1.6 million settlement of a tort\n\nlawsuit for a pedestrian injured on a City grate providing access to a gas\n\nline.\n\n        The district court concluded the franchise fee can recover\n\nunexpected acute costs, but concluded $100,000 per year per utility was\n\nan appropriate amount. Both the City and Kragnes appeal the district\n\ncourt’s valuation of this component of the franchise fee.          The City\n\ncontends the full $250,000 it requested for each utility should be\n\ncounted. Kragnes asserts no amount should be counted for unexpected\n\nacute costs.     In the alternative, Kragnes argues that even if it is\n\nreasonable to count some amount for unexpected acute costs, the City\n\nhas failed to present evidence to support either the amount it requested\n\nor the amount included in the franchise fee by the district court.\n\n        Although we agree the category of unexpected “acute” costs could\n\nbe counted as a component of a franchise fee in an appropriate case, we\n\nconclude the record in this case provides inadequate support for its\n\f                                             25\n\ninclusion here.       The City offered general testimony tending to prove it\n\nspent $1.6 million to bury electric lines, but we find such costs are in the\n\nnature of capital expenses rather than acute costs. We further conclude\n\nthe settlement of the tort claim was not reasonably related to the cost of\n\ninspecting, licensing, supervising, or otherwise regulating the activity\n\nthat is being franchised, and therefore the district court correctly\n\ndeclined to count the item as a component of the franchise fee. Lastly,\n\nthe City produced testimony that various storms cost “hundreds of\n\nthousands of dollars” to clean up. Although the City is not required to\n\naccount    for    its   franchise-related        administrative   expenses      to   a\n\nmathematical certainty, we conclude the evidence as to the cost of the\n\nstorm clean-up was not in sufficient detail to allocate a value to it.\n\nAccordingly, we conclude the district court should not have included any\n\nvalue to the claimed acute costs in the computation of the franchise fees.\n\n      4.   Construction costs paid by the federal and state government.\n\nKragnes contends the district court erred in counting as a franchise fee\n\ncomponent        an   amount   for     certain    increased   construction      costs.\n\nKragnes’s expert, Charles Finch, opined that to the extent some\n\nconstruction      projects   receive    funding     from   the    state   or   federal\n\ngovernment, such construction costs are not actually incurred by the\n\ncity. Kragnes accordingly contends this component of the franchise fee\n\nmust be reduced by 35%, an amount calculated by Finch to account for\n\nthe portion of construction costs offset by state and federal funds. The\n\nCity, however, asserts Finch’s calculations do not bear out. The City’s\n\nexpert, Dragisich, testified that even if it is assumed that 35% of the cost\n\nof a construction project affecting the right-of-way is offset by federal or\n\nstate funds, it does not necessarily follow that the state/federal funds are\n\nactually allocated to the portion of the contract that accounts for the\n\f                                             26\n\nincrease in construction costs attributable to the presence of utilities in\n\nthe right-of-way.      Further, the City argues that once state or federal\n\nfunds are received by the City, they become the City’s funds without\n\nregard to their source.       Simply put, the City contends the court must\n\nfocus on whether the City proved its construction costs attributable to\n\nthe presence of the utilities in the right-of-way are increased, and it\n\nmatters not in calculating the appropriate franchise fee what revenue\n\nstream the City used to pay them. We agree. The source of the funds\n\nused to pay for the increased construction costs attributable to the\n\nutilities is not relevant to the determination of whether such costs are a\n\nproper component of the franchise fee.\n\n       5.   Construction costs paid by WRA/sewer users on WRA/sewer\n\nprojects.      Kragnes contends the district court erred in including as\n\nfranchise fee components any increased construction costs resulting\n\nfrom projects related to the Wastewater Reclamation Authority (WRA) 13\n\nand sanitary sewer. Kragnes argues such costs should not be counted\n\nbecause they are recouped by the City from the WRA and consumers of\n\nsewer services.\n\n       However, the City’s expert explained that the method proposed by\nKragnes’s expert to “back out” the construction costs of WRA and sewer\n\nprojects shifts the increased cost of construction due to the presence of\n\ngas and electric utilities almost entirely to the WRA and sewer users. He\n\ninstead opined it is more appropriate to require the customers of utilities\n\nto bear their fair proportion of the increased costs and require the City to\n\n\n       13The  WRA is a consortium of cities which provides waste treatment facilities\nand services to the member municipalities, including the City of Des Moines. The cities\neach maintain their own sanitary sewer systems for waste collection and connect their\nsystems to WRA facilities for treatment. As the operating contractor for the WRA, the\nCity of Des Moines manages the construction projects for the WRA.\n\f                                       27\n\nin turn reimburse the WRA and sewer utility to avoid “double-dipping” by\n\nthe City. The district court credited the City’s expert. It did not reduce\n\nthis component of the franchise fee by the amount the City’s\n\nconstruction costs are increased as a consequence of WRA and sewer\n\nconstruction projects and it required the City to “negotiate some method\n\nof reimbursement with the enterprise entities to avoid any double\n\nrecovery.”\n\n      We also find the City’s expert’s testimony on this issue credible\n\nand agree with the resolution adopted by the district court.\n\n      6.     Administrative overhead fee on construction and engineering\n\nproject bills.   Kragnes asserts the district court erred in counting a\n\n12.78% administrative fee as a component of the franchise fee.         She\n\nargues this is inappropriate because any increase in administration costs\n\nincurred by the contractor due to the presence of utilities are accounted\n\nfor in the construction contract price. Kragnes further contends that to\n\nthe extent the 12.78% fee represents additional City personnel cost\n\nattributable to administering payment of the construction contracts, it\n\nhas already been accounted for in the operating expense portion of the\n\ndistrict court’s calculation of the franchise fee.    The City disagrees,\n\ncontending the administrative fee does not purport to cover additional\n\ncosts incurred by the construction company but rather addresses the\n\nCity’s additional administrative overhead. The City’s expert, Dragisich,\n\nwas questioned on this precise point and explained that he had taken\n\ncare to insure that costs were not double counted and that the\n\nadministrative fee on third-party contracts did not overlap with the\n\noperating expenses calculated separately. Dragisich also described the\n\ntypes of additional administrative costs incurred by the City on third-\n\nparty construction contracts due to the presence of utilities in the right-\n\f                                       28\n\nof-way. He noted this cost component might include the time required to\n\nnotify the police and fire departments of the timing and location of road\n\nclosures and how to reroute emergency vehicles. This component might\n\nalso include the administrative costs associated with posting notices on\n\nthe City’s website or placing placards on properties informing the public\n\nabout road closures or temporary utility interruptions attributable to\n\nconstruction.\n\n       We find credible Dragisich’s testimony that the City does incur\n\nsome additional administrative overhead in connection with construction\n\nprojects as a consequence of the presence of utilities.     We find such\n\nadministrative costs have not been counted twice and were therefore\n\ncorrectly included by the district court as a component of the franchise\n\nfee.\n\n       7. Interest on the construction costs. Kragnes contends the district\n\ncourt erred in counting bond expense/interest as an element of the\n\nincreased construction and engineering costs. She argues that because\n\nfranchise fees are received quarterly, the City does not need to borrow\n\nmoney to pay construction costs.      However, the City’s expert testified\n\nthat while Kragnes’s logic might work “in a perfect world,” it did not\n\nnecessarily work in reality.    Even if it is assumed the City receives\n\nfranchise fees quarterly, it does not necessarily follow that the City will\n\nalways have funds in hand to pay construction contract payments when\n\nthey are due. The timing of construction projects and the payments due\n\non construction contracts are not necessarily aligned with the City’s\n\nreceipt of franchise fees. Further, as the City’s expert noted, the City’s\n\nconstruction costs fluctuate greatly from year to year and franchise fee\n\nreceipts are not necessarily sufficient to cover this category of costs.\n\f                                        29\n\nAccordingly, we conclude the district court committed no error in\n\ncounting this category of cost as part of the franchise fee.\n\n      8. Increased construction costs. Kragnes and the City disagreed as\n\nto the amount of increased construction and engineering costs incurred\n\nby the City for the accommodation of the gas and electric utilities.\n\nKragnes argues that construction costs were increased by 5% and\n\nengineering costs were increased by 3.5% as a consequence of the\n\npresence of utility structures and equipment in the right-of-way.         The\n\nCity, however, offered testimony suggesting construction costs are\n\nincreased by 15% and engineering costs are increased by 20%.              The\n\ndistrict court found the City’s evidence on this issue more persuasive.\n\n      The main issue of dispute involves a survey created and\n\nimplemented by the City’s expert. City employees were asked whether\n\ntheir work was affected or increased due to the presence of utilities in the\n\nright-of-way. Each employee was also asked how much his or her work\n\nincreased due to each utility (including gas, water, electric, cable, etc.).\n\nThe survey respondents assigned a percentage value for each factor. The\n\nCity’s expert, Dragisich, added the values of the increased work and\n\ncame up with a total increase in work, and concluded engineering costs\n\nwere increased by 20% and construction costs were increased by 15%.\n\nKragnes’s expert, Finch, concluded it was more appropriate to average\n\nthe increased work for all the utilities, producing a 3.5% increase in\n\nengineering costs and 5% increased construction costs.\n\n      We note the City’s expert had extensive construction experience,\n\nincluding the bidding of construction projects conducted in the right-of-\n\nway. He is also a licensed engineer. Although this is a close issue, we\n\ncredit Dragisich’s opinion based on his relevant experience.      We agree\n\nwith the district court’s findings that the increased engineering costs\n\f                                           30\n\nshould be valued at 20% and the increased construction costs should be\n\nvalued at 15%, and adopt them as our own.\n\n      D. Did the District Court Err in Ordering a Refund to all Class\n\nMembers?         As we have already noted, the district court found the\n\nappropriate annual franchise fee is $1,575,194 for the electric utility and\n\n$1,574,046 for the gas utility and declared the plaintiff should have a\n\njudgment against the City in the amount by which the franchise fees\n\ncollected during the period commencing July 27, 1999, and ending\n\nMay 26, 2009, exceeded the annual franchise fee.

The court further reasoned there must be financial\n\nconsequences       from   the   illegal   taxation   of   the   City’s   residents\n\nnotwithstanding that the funds received from the illegal taxation of the\n\nCity’s residents were used wisely, legally, and with the best intentions for\n\nthe residents.\n\n      The court ordered relief in the form of a refund of the franchise fee\n\noverpayments in an amount to be determined by the court based on\n\nevidence adduced in further proceedings of the actual amount of\n\nfranchise fees collected during the subject period reduced by the annual\n\nfranchise fee determined by the court. The City contends that, even if it\n\ndid charge an excessive franchise fee, the district court erred in\n\nconcluding the class members are entitled to a refund of any amount\n\nthey were overcharged.\n\n      The City contends McKesson and Hagge v. Iowa Department of\n\nRevenue and Finance, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2220657\"><a href=\"/opinion/2220657/hagge-v-iowa-dept-of-revenue-finance/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 1993), are distinguishable\n\f                                               31\n\nand provide no legal basis for ordering a refund in this case.                   We\n\nacknowledge the City’s contention that the plaintiffs in those cases\n\nclaimed deprivation of a federal constitutional right (Commerce Clause\n\nviolation in McKesson and intergovernmental tax immunity in Hagge) in\n\naddition to their due process claims. See McKesson, 496 U.S. at 22, 110\n\nS. Ct. at 2242, 110 L. Ed. 2d at 26; Hagge, 504 N.W.2d at 449. While it\n\nis true that the excessive fees in this case were not found to violate any\n\nfederal constitutional right, we conclude the reasoning stated in\n\nMcKesson and Hagge is compelling, and we therefore apply it in this\n\ncase.\n\n        Meaningful backward-looking relief is especially appropriate to\n\nrectify the class members’ overpayments under the circumstances\n\npresented in this case.           “Because exaction of a tax constitutes a\n\ndeprivation of property,” procedural safeguards are generally required to\n\nprotect against “unlawful exactions in order to satisfy the commands of\n\nthe Due Process Clause.” McKesson, 496 U.S. at 36, 110 S. Ct. at 2250,\n\n110 L. Ed. 2d at 35–36.            However, because “[a]llowing taxpayers to\n\nlitigate   their   tax   liabilities   prior   to   payment   might   threaten    a\n\ngovernment’s financial security,” states have been permitted to restrict\n\nthe ability of the taxpayer to challenge the lawfulness of the tax before it\n\nis paid. Id. at 37, 110 S. Ct. at 2250, 110 L. Ed. 2d at 36. That was the\n\ncase here—Kragnes and the other members of the class had no\n\npredeprivation remedy.          Instead they were required to raise their\n\nobjections to fees in a postdeprivation refund action.\n\n        To satisfy the requirements of the Due Process Clause,\n        therefore, in this refund action the State must provide\n        taxpayers with, not only a fair opportunity to challenge the\n        accuracy and legal validity of their tax obligation, but also a\n        “clear and certain remedy,” for any erroneous or unlawful\n\f                                        32\n      tax collection to ensure that the opportunity to contest the\n      tax is a meaningful one.\n\nId. at 39, 110 S. Ct. at 2251, 110 L. Ed. 2d at 37 (footnote and internal\ncitation omitted).\n\n      We further note that Kragnes filed this action soon after the City\n\ndecided to commence collecting the franchise fees at issue here.              On\n\nnotice of Kragnes’s claim that the franchise fees were excessive in\n\namount and therefore illegal, the City nonetheless collected them and,\n\nduring the pendency of this action, even increased the amount of the fees\n\ncollected. The failure of the City to respond differently after it was on\n\nnotice of Kragnes’s claim does not mitigate in favor of depriving Kragnes\n\nand the class of a remedy for the unlawful taxation. See id. at 45, 110\n\nS. Ct. at 2254–55, 110 L. Ed. 2d at 41 (noting State has available a range\n\nof procedures to limit the financial impact of refunding taxes, including\n\nrefraining from collecting a tax which has been declared illegal during the\n\npendency of an appeal or placing disputed funds into an escrow account\n\nor utilizing “other accounting devices such that the State can predict\n\nwith greater accuracy the availability of undisputed treasury funds”).\n\n“[The City’s] failure to avail itself of certain of these methods of self-\n\nprotection   weakens   any    ‘equitable’    justification   for   avoiding   its\n\nconstitutional obligation to provide relief.” Id. at 45, 110 S. Ct. at 2255,\n\n110 L. Ed. 2d at 41.\n\n      The City cites the Restatement (Third) of Restitution in support of\n\nits contention that no refund of any overpayment should be ordered\n\nunder the circumstances presented here.               Section 19(1) of the\n\nRestatement states the general rule that a taxpayer who pays an illegally\n\nassessed or collected tax, fee, or charge has a claim in restitution against\n\nthe government to prevent unjust enrichment in the absence of a\n\f                                        33\n\ndifferent rule imposed by statute. Restatement (Third) of Restitution and\n\nUnjust Enrichment § 19(1), at 259 (2011). As has already been noted,\n\nthis court has ordered a refund when a taxpayer overpaid taxes to the\n\nIowa Department of Revenue and Finance. Hagge, 504 N.W.2d at 452.\n\nThe City contends the district court erred, however, in this case in failing\n\nto apply section 19(2) of the Restatement allowing the court to consider\n\nwhether, under the circumstances of a particular case, a restitutionary\n\nremedy should be denied on the ground it would “disrupt orderly fiscal\n\nadministration or result in severe public hardship.” Restatement (Third)\n\nof Restitution § 19(2), at 259. Subject to constitutional limitations, the\n\nrule stated in section 19(2) authorizes the court to limit relief to the\n\nclaimant to avoid either adverse governmental consequence.             Id. § 19\n\ncmt. b, at 260. The City directs us specifically to illustration 17:\n\n      City assesses a property tax on a nondiscriminatory basis.\n      The tax is subsequently determined to be improperly\n      authorized and void. In response to Taxpayers’ suit against\n      City to recover the tax collected from them, City\n      demonstrates that the revenues illegally collected were spent\n      exclusively on ordinary municipal services benefitting\n      Taxpayers among other residents. Under the circumstances,\n      the court may find that neither City nor its residents have\n      been unjustly enriched at Taxpayers’ expense.\n\nId. § 19 cmt. f, illus. 17, at 267.\n\n      This court rejected an equity-based argument opposing a tax\n\nrefund in Hagge. In that case, the State urged a refund should be denied\n\nbecause such relief would impose an onerous fiscal burden.                 We\n\nconcluded, however, that “equity cannot override the clear commands of\n\nthe Due Process Clause.” Hagge, 504 N.W.2d at 452. As in Hagge, we\n\nare not convinced that a properly structured refund in this case will\n\ncreate an onerous fiscal burden on the City or create such disruption\n\f                                            34\n\nand instability as to give rise to countervailing public interests weighing\n\nagainst a refund.\n\n        Undaunted by our rejection of an equitable argument in Hagge, the\n\nCity offers up other equity-based reasons for denying a refund of the\n\nexcessive franchise fees.       Among these reasons are the notion that\n\nrestitution of the excess fees should not be ordered when the excess fees\n\nwere paid by a broad-based group and the plaintiff class would\n\nessentially recover from itself, and the equitable principle that no refund\n\nwill be ordered when the improper tax was collected from a broad\n\nconstituency and the funds were used for the general benefit of a similar\n\npublic constituency.      We conclude the district court correctly declined\n\nthese equity-based entreaties to forego altogether a refund remedy in this\n\ncase.   This conclusion is strongly influenced by the fact that the City\n\ncontinued and increased its collection of the franchise fees after being\n\nput on notice of the claim in this litigation that the fees exceeded the\n\namount authorized by law.             Under these circumstances, equitable\n\nprinciples will not shield the City from a refund. 14\n\n\n        14We note that although the general assembly ratified the City’s collection\n\nof electric and gas franchise fees in excess of the cost of regulating the utilities,\nthe legislature declined to retroactively authorize the excessive fees although it\nclearly knew how. In 2007, the general assembly enacted similar legislation\nratifying the imposition of franchise fees for cable television services. See Iowa\nCode § 477A.7(5) (Supp. 2007); Zaber v. City of Dubuque, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">634</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 637\n(Iowa 2010). The general assembly explicitly provided that the ratification was\nretroactive. Iowa Code § 477A.7(5); Zaber, 789 N.W.2d at 637. However, in this\ninstance, the legislature decided not to enact a retroactive ratification of\nfranchise fees, but instead made the ratification prospective only. In fact, an\nearly draft of the bill contained a retroactive provision, but that portion was\nstricken in a vote on the floor of the House. See Senate Amendment 3328 to\nS.F. 478, 83 G.A., 1st Sess. (Iowa 2009) (providing in § 202 that any amount of\nelectric or gas franchise fees previously assessed that exceeds the city’s cost of\nregulating the franchise is “declared to be authorized and legally assessed by\nand paid to the city”); Journal of the House, Saturday, April 25, 2009, at pages\n2072–2075 (motion by Oldson, offering amendment H–1780, which, among\nother things, struck the ratification language then found in § 221); </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span>\n\f                                          <span class=\"page\">35</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n      The City next contends that if a refund is to be required, it should\n\nbe limited to those class members who can show they would have paid\n\nless if the City had raised the same amount of revenue through property\n\ntaxes. We disagree. We cannot assume the City would have chosen to\n\nincrease real estate taxes by an equivalent amount if the excessive\n\nfranchise fees had not been conceived and collected. In the last analysis,\n\nthe determination of what would have occurred had the excessive\n\nfranchise fees not been collected would require speculation in which the\n\ncourt will not engage. We conclude the most fair remedy in this case is\n\nthe refund which will, to the extent possible, refund to members of the\n\nplaintiff class the excess fees extracted from them and restore the parties\n\nto the status quo ante. We also note the City has available to it the full\n\nrange of legal tax and fee options, budgetary measures, and spending\n\npolicy choices to cover the refund and its ongoing future expenses.\n\n      Comment f to section 19 makes clear that while “[s]ignificant\n\ndisruption and hardship are grounds to limit restitution . . . the mere\n\nfact that relief will be expensive is not.”            Restatement (Third) of\n\nRestitution § 19 cmt. f, at 266.       It further notes that a restitutionary\n\nremedy may be fashioned in a way that minimizes the disruption to the\n\ntaxing authority, “such as by allowing refunds in the form of credits\n\nagainst future assessments.” Id. § 19 cmt. f, at 267. Our disposition of\n\nthis appeal will allow the district court to structure the refund in a way\n\nthat balances the respective interests of the City and the members of the\n\nplaintiff class.\n\n________________________\nActs ch. 179 (amending Iowa Code ch. 364 regarding franchise fees without\nprovision for retroactive ratification of franchise fees).      Such retroactive\nratification has been approved by this court. Zaber, 789 N.W.2d at 656. Thus,\nthe legislature also declined to shield the City from the financial impact of this\nlitigation.\n\f                                      36\n\n      E.   Should the District Court Have Divided the Class Into\n\nSubclasses for the Remaining Proceedings? The City argues that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in not dividing the class into\n\nsubclasses for remedial purposes.    Specifically, the City contends that\n\nwhile the class members interests may be sufficiently alike for purposes\n\nof the resolution of the legal issue in this case, they have significantly\n\ndifferent interests and preferences with regard to the determination of an\n\nappropriate remedy.      These different interests, the City contends,\n\nrequires the division of the class into subclasses.    The district court\n\nconcluded the conflict perceived by the City was speculative and declined\n\nto divide the class.\n\n      The City contends that as a remedial plan is put together, someone\n\nmust represent the interests of those class members that have an\n\ninterest in minimizing the amount of the refund. For example, the City\n\ncontends that the implementation of a remedy must be preceded by an\n\ninitial determination of whether or not potential class members must\n\nsubmit a claim. The City also contends decisions must be made with\n\nregard to the types of notice and information that are to be included with\n\nany refund checks or claim forms because these should vary depending\n\non whether the class member favors or opposes the collection of\n\nfranchise fees as a source of revenue for the City. The City favors the\n\ncreation of subclasses because it harbors doubts that Kragnes “will\n\nvigorously pursue the positions on these issues that are of greatest\n\nadvantage to those class members who benefit from revenue generation\n\nthrough the franchise fee.”\n\n      Kragnes contends that to the extent that no conflict exists\n\nwarranting the decertification of the class, no conflict exists warranting\n\nthe creation of subclasses. She notes she is a property owner and thus a\n\f                                       37\n\nmember of the group the City contends would likely favor the generation\n\nof revenue through franchise fees rather than real estate taxes. However,\n\nclearly she does not favor the refund outcome the City predicts for her as\n\na property owner.\n\n      We conclude the City’s arguments for the creation of subclasses\n\nare speculative on this record. We affirm the district court’s certification\n\nof the class. As administration of this action proceeds on remand, the\n\ndistrict court shall exercise its discretion in ruling on motions, if any,\n\nrequesting the establishment of subclasses. Iowa R. Civ. P. 1.262(3)(c).\n\n      F. Did the District Court Correctly Decline to Order the City\n\nto Amend its Franchise Ordinances?           Kragnes asserts the district\n\ncourt erred in holding amendments of Iowa Code sections 384.3A and\n\n364.2 do not require the City to amend its franchise fee ordinances.\n\nKragnes contends the City should be enjoined from collecting franchise\n\nfees pursuant to the ordinances in effect at the time of this lawsuit until\n\nthe City enacts a new ordinance in compliance with sections 384.3A and\n\n364.2, which became effective May 26, 2009.\n\n      A franchise fee assessed by a city may be based upon a\n      percentage of gross revenues generated from sales of the\n      franchisee within the city not to exceed five percent, without\n      regard to the city’s cost of inspecting, supervising, and\n      otherwise regulating the franchise. Franchise fees collected\n      pursuant to an ordinance in effect on May 26, 2009, shall be\n      deposited in the city’s general fund and such fees collected\n      in excess of the amounts necessary to inspect, supervise,\n      and otherwise regulate the franchise may be used by the city\n      for any other purpose authorized by law. Franchise fees\n      collected pursuant to an ordinance that is adopted or\n      amended on or after May 26, 2009, to increase the\n      percentage rate at which franchise fees are assessed shall be\n      credited to the franchise fee account within the city’s general\n      fund and used pursuant to section 384.3A. If a city franchise\n      fee is assessed to customers of a franchise, the fee shall not\n      be assessed to the city as a customer. Before a city adopts or\n      amends a franchise fee rate ordinance or franchise\n      ordinance to increase the percentage rate at which franchise\n\f                                        38\n      fees are assessed, a revenue purpose statement shall be\n      prepared specifying the purpose or purposes for which the\n      revenue collected from the increased rate will be expended. If\n      property tax relief is listed as a purpose, the revenue\n      purpose statement shall also include information regarding\n      the amount of the property tax relief to be provided with\n      revenue collected from the increased rate. The revenue\n      purpose statement shall be published as provided in section\n      362.3.\n\nIowa Code § 364.2(4)(f) (Supp. 2009).\n\n      The City’s ordinances currently in effect authorize the City to\n\ncollect franchise fees of 5%. However, Kragnes asserts the effect of this\n\nlawsuit is “to lower the allowed percentage rate of franchise fee under the\n\nCity ordinances to the costs of regulation, which is less than 5%.”\n\nAccording to Kragnes, if the City wishes to collect a 5% franchise fee, it\n\nmust enact a new ordinance “to increase the percentage rate at which\n\nfranchise fees are collected” and comply with the notice and revenue\n\nstatement requirements of section 364.2(4)(f) as well as the spending\n\nlimitations of section 384.3A for ordinances enacted after May 26, 2009.\n\n      The City contends the plain language of section 362.2(4)(f) allows it\n\nto continue to collect a 5% franchise fee pursuant to its ordinances\n\nwhich were in effect on May 26, 2009.        The City points out that the\n\nstatute explicitly addresses how funds collected pursuant to ordinances\n\nin effect on May 26, 2009, may be spent, clearly evidencing an intent to\n\n“grandfather in” existing ordinances. The statute further distinguishes\n\nbetween existing ordinances and ordinances enacted or amended after\n\nMay 26, 2009, and requires cities seeking to amend or enact ordinances\n\nafter May 2009 to comply with certain requirements.\n\n      We are not persuaded by Kragnes’s argument that the effect of this\n\nlawsuit and our decision in Kragnes I is to rewrite the City’s franchise fee\n\nordinance. Our decisions simply render the ordinance unenforceable for\n\nthe designated time frame in excess of the costs to maintain and regulate\n\f                                         39\n\nthe franchise.   We agree that the plain language of section 364.2(4)(f)\n\ngrandfathers in franchise fee ordinances in effect on May 26, 2009, and\n\nauthorizes the collection of up to a 5% franchise fee pursuant to those\n\nexisting ordinances.    The district court correctly declined Kragnes’s\n\ninvitation to order the City to adopt a new franchise fee ordinance.\n\n      IV. Conclusion.\n\n      We conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\ncertifying and denying the City’s motions to decertify the class. We also\n\nconclude the members of the plaintiff class have no due process right to\n\nopt out of the class and the failure of the rules of civil procedure to allow\n\nthem to do so is not unconstitutional.\n\n      After our de novo review of the record, we conclude certain\n\namounts allocated or not allocated by the district court as proper\n\ncomponents of the franchise fees should be modified.        Specifically, we\n\nconclude the City should be able to include the lost value of trees due to\n\ntrimming and removal to accommodate electrical lines in the amount of\n\n$622,981 each year for the electric utility franchise. We also conclude\n\nthe City shall not, based on this record, recoup any amount for\n\nunpredictable, acute costs. We affirm in all other respects the district\n\ncourt’s determination of the allowable amount of franchise fees. For ease\n\nof reference, the franchise fees allowed are as follows.\n\n                           Gas Utility               Electric Utility\n Degradation Costs         $35,030.00/year           $37,373.00/year\n Construction Costs        $1,314,563.00/year        $1,314,563.00/year\n Operating Costs           $107,824.00/year          $107,824.00/year\n Disruption Costs          $2,038.00/year            $843.00/year\n Franchise Fee Study       $14,591.00/year           $14,591.00/year\n Lost Tree Value           $0.00/year                $622,981.00/year\n Acute Costs               $0.00/year                $0.00/year\n Total                     $1,474,046.00/year        $2,098,175.00/year\n\f                                        40\n\n      We further conclude the district court properly ordered a refund of\n\nfees in excess of the totals itemized above.    We remand for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion, for findings as to the amounts\n\nto be distributed to the members of the class, and for a determination of\n\nthe appropriate restitutionary arrangement by which such amounts shall\n\nbe paid.   And, finally, we conclude the district court correctly denied\n\nKragnes’s request for an injunction preventing the City from collecting\n\nfranchise fees pursuant to the ordinances in effect on May 26, 2009.\n\n      AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED AND REMANDED.\n\n      All justices concur except Cady, C.J., who dissents and Waterman\n\nand Mansfield, JJ., who take no part.\n\f                                          41\n\n                                    #09–1473, Kragnes v. City of Des Moines\n\n\nCADY, Chief Justice (dissenting).\n\n      I respectfully dissent.     A basic and fundamental conflict exists\n\nbetween the members of the class.           This conflict is inimical to the\n\nfundamental purpose of class actions and, under the law, does not\n\npermit Kragnes to pursue her claim as a class action. I would hold the\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to decertify the class.\n\n      Several requirements must be met before our law permits class\n\ncertification.    One basic prerequisite is the class representative must\n\n“fairly and adequately” protect the interest of the class. Iowa R. Civ. P.\n\n1.262(2)(c).     This requirement relates to the associated rule that the\n\nclaim of the class representative be typical of that of the other class\n\nmembers. When a conflict exists between class members that relates to\n\nthe issues and is fundamental to the case, class certification is improper.\n\nValley Drug Co. v. Geneva Pharm., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76384\"><a href=\"/opinion/76384/valley-drug-v-geneva-pharmaceuticals/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1189 (11th Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n      The fundamental conflict in this case can be traced to the\n\nfundamental economic reality of the relationship between a city and its\n\npeople.   A city is its people, and a government is established by the\n\npeople to govern and provide public services and protection for the\n\nbenefit of the people.      In turn, the people provide revenue to the\n\ngovernment so it can operate to carry out its vital public mission. Thus,\n\nthe public mission pursued by government is, one way or the other, paid\n\nby the people.\n\n      In this case, the City of Des Moines sought to raise additional\n\nrevenue for the purpose of providing more public services in the form of\n\nadditional police and fire protection, enhanced public library access, and\n\f                                         42\n\nneeded repairs to deteriorating neighborhoods.     A city is authorized to\n\nraise revenue for such purposes. However, the particular means utilized\n\nby the City to raise the revenue was ultimately found in this case to be\n\ncontrary to the law, but not until the revenue had been collected and\n\nspent on the needed services that have been enjoyed by the public.\n\n       The representative plaintiff brought this lawsuit not only to force\n\nthe City to utilize a lawful means to collect its needed revenue, but also\n\nto obtain a judgment on behalf of all people who paid the fee equal to the\n\ntotal amount of the revenue that had been collected through the illegal\n\nfee.   Class certification allowed her to lump together all residents who\n\nhad paid the illegal tax to elevate the amount of the claim into a\n\nsubstantial judgment. The judgment is so large that the City will now\n\nneed to raise additional revenue or reduce City services to refund the\n\nimproper fee to all the residents who paid it. This inevitable result is not\n\nspeculative.   It is logic.   It is also economic reality based on sound\n\neconomic principle. To pay the judgment to the class, the City will need\n\nto use existing revenue belonging to the class, tax the class, or cut\n\nservices provided to the class. These consequences necessarily divide the\n\nclass and render its members antagonistic. There is little utility in suing\n\nyourself, especially when the associated attorney fees and litigation\n\nexpenses of suing yourself will run into the millions of dollars.      Most\n\npeople    would   be    unwilling   to   pursue   litigation   under   such\n\ncircumstances.\n\n       Accordingly, this case could not present a more basic conflict\n\nbetween a representative plaintiff and those members of the class who\n\nwould not want to force city government to find additional revenue to pay\n\nthe judgment that will inevitably adversely affect most members of the\n\nclass. In other words, the lawsuit is a microcosm of the larger tension in\n\f                                         43\n\nsociety between those who focus on immediate gratification and those\n\nwho seek to make decisions today with future consequences in mind.\n\nThis case forces the latter to join in the approach of the former. In this\n\ncase, the remedy seeks an immediate perceived benefit at a future cost\n\nthat makes the benefit an illusion. This sleight of hand is found at the\n\nheart of the case and presents a most basic conflict that pits the\n\nrepresentative plaintiff, who advocates for a refund, against those class\n\nmembers who understand the futility of a refund and would advocate\n\nagainst it. It is simply unfair for our class action law to be used as a\n\nvehicle to grow a judgment into an amount that will force the City to take\n\naction adverse to the class. A plaintiff who pursues such a goal cannot\n\npossibly represent the interest of the remaining class members.\n\n      This type of inherent conflict in a class is inconsistent with the use\n\nof class action and is not permitted by our law. An analogous case that\n\nbest illustrates this point is Ihrke v. Northern States Power Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"303215\"><a href=\"/opinion/303215/robert-j-ihrke-and-mary-e-ihrke-v-northern-states-power-company-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">566</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir.), vacated as moot, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">34</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">72</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1972). Like this case, Ihrke involved an action brought by a utility\n\ncustomer on behalf of all utility customers. 459 F.2d at 567. The legal\n\nclaim alleged the regulations governing the termination of utility service\n\nwere unconstitutional because customers had been deprived of adequate\n\nprior notice and a fair and impartial hearing prior to the termination of\n\nutility services.   Id.   The court found the class was inherently\n\nantagonistic because not all customers would be in support of a\n\npretermination hearing.    Id. at 572.    Instead, some customers would\n\n“likely . . . feel” that the additional expense of providing a termination\n\nhearing would “conceivably result in a rate increase to all customers.”\n\nId. at 572–73. As with the utility customers in Ihrke, many Des Moines\n\ntaxpayers would be reluctant for government to make expenditures when\n\f                                         44\n\nthey realize those expenditures come from their pocket, one way or the\n\nother.\n\n         Other courts have expressed a slightly different principle that a\n\nclass action cannot be maintained when people in the class would\n\noppose the claim or the remedy sought. In Mayfield v. Dalton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"738573\"><a href=\"/opinion/738573/john-c-mayfield-iii-individually-and-in-behalf-of-all-others-similarly/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1423</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1424 (9th Cir. 1997), two members of the Marine Corp. sought to\n\ncertify a class consisting of all members of the armed forces to challenge\n\nthe constitutionality of a Department of Defense requirement that all\n\nsoldiers provide a DNA sample for future analysis. The court found the\n\nclass to be antagonistic because there were “undoubtedly” people in the\n\nclass who would not oppose the DNA repository and who would want the\n\nrequirement enforced. Mayfield, 109 F.3d at 1427. In this case, there\n\nare undoubtedly people in the class who do not oppose the illegal fee\n\nused to enhance City operations.\n\n         Antagonism also exists in a class when the class consists of people\n\nwho utilize limited resources from a common pool, and named members\n\nof the class seek a remedy that will result in a shift of these limited\n\nresources. See Miller v. Univ. of Cincinnati, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 290 (S.D.\n\nOhio 2006) (finding an inherent conflict precluding class certification\n\nwhen female members of a university rowing team claimed the university\n\nwas violating Title IX and sought to establish a class consisting of all\n\nfemale participants in university athletic programs because the remedy\n\nof compliance with Title IX would not be amenable to all class members\n\nbecause compliance would likely only be achieved by shifting resources\n\nfrom one sport to another); see also Cherokee Nation of Okla. v. United\n\nStates, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 364–65 (E.D. Okla. 2001) (finding named\n\nplaintiffs’ interests were antagonistic because the agency would be\n\nrequired to reimburse money from limited appropriations in order to\n\f                                       45\n\nmake the required refund).      There are undoubtedly many people in\n\nDes Moines who would oppose a rather insignificant individual refund\n\nthat will only result in a substantial reallocation of resources or\n\nadditional taxation.\n\n      The conflict in this case is as fundamental as the legal principles\n\nthat demand the class to be decertified. Class actions are institutions of\n\nrepresentation, not opposition. They are institutions of social value and\n\npublic good, not personal gain.     The class needs to have a sense of\n\nmission so that all interests are represented. See Hansberry v. Lee, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103379\"><a href=\"/opinion/103379/hansberry-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103379\"><a href=\"/opinion/103379/hansberry-v-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 28 (1940) (holding plaintiff\n\nseeking to enforce an agreement cannot represent class members who do\n\nnot want it enforced); see also 7A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &\n\nMary Kay Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1768, at 389 (3d ed.\n\n2005).   This case is as far from a class action as a case could be.     A\n\nsingle plaintiff should not be permitted to drag nearly an entire\n\ncommunity into a lawsuit that seeks a remedy akin to suing yourself.\n\n      Kragnes certainly had a right to challenge the government action.\n\nShe had a right to turn to the courts to force the City to use the proper\n\nchannels to raise city revenue.   She was free as well to seek her own\n\nrefund. At times, the pursuit of principle alone might be worth the cost,\n\nbut a class action nevertheless requires the pursuit to be shared by the\n\nclass. When public monies or public sacrifice will be used to pay for a\n\npublic interest lawsuit, the representative class requirement for class\n\ncertification ensures that the public actually supports the effort.\n\nConsidering the marginal utility of the remedy sought, considering the\n\nsubsequent legislative adoption of the challenged fee, considering the\n\npublic benefit provided by the challenged government action, and\n\nconsidering the substantial public expense of litigation, it is doubtful\n\f                                         46\n\nmany class members would share in Kragnes’s enthusiasm for her\n\nlawsuit. One of the benefits of a class action is that it allows a plaintiff to\n\npursue a claim by giving an attorney a financial incentive to provide\n\nrepresentation.   It also allows the court to dispose of a multiplicity of\n\nidentical individual claims in an economical manner.            In this case,\n\nhowever, there was no evidence that similar claims were filed or even the\n\nfear of a multitude of similar claims. Moreover, while it is important to\n\nprovide a financial incentive for legal representation in meritorious\n\nlitigation, it should not, in the end, become the only benefit of a class\n\naction.\n\f</pre>",
