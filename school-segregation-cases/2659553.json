(Gov. Code, § 6250 et seq.)1 The documents at issue reflect the results of a\n\n\"Leadership Assessment Program\" conducted at the District's expense by the Rady\n\nSchool of Management at the University of California at San Diego. In response to\n\ninewsource's PRA request, the District declined to provide the documents on the grounds\n\nthey were exempt from disclosure. The trial court agreed and denied inewsource's\n\npetition for writ of mandate compelling disclosure.\n\n       Inewsource petitions this court for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to\n\nvacate its order, grant the petition, and compel disclosure. Inewsource contends the\n\nexemptions cited by the trial court, for personnel files (§ 6254, subd. (c)) and the PRA's\n\n\"catch-all\" provision (§ 6255, subd. (a)), are inapplicable. We agree in part, and therefore\n\ngrant the petition in part, as we will explain.\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Inewsource is a nonprofit organization based in San Diego, California, and\n\nengaged in investigative journalism. Inewsource publishes its content on the Internet and\n\nthrough its partnership with KPBS, a local public radio and television station. Among\n\ninewsource's subjects have been the management, operations, and finances of the District.\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise\nspecified.\n                                                  2\n\fInewsource has published dozens of articles, Internet posts, and other items about the\n\nDistrict.\n\n       Created by the California Legislature in 1975, the District is a public entity that\n\ndevelops and operates mass transit services in the northern portion of San Diego County.\n\nThese services include the COASTER commuter rail, the SPRINTER light rail, the\n\nBREEZE fixed-route bus system, the FLEX on-demand system, and the LIFT paratransit\n\nservice. The District is supervised by a nine-member board of directors consisting of\n\nelected officials from eight cities in its service area and from San Diego County.\n\n       In December 2013, 13 District senior management staff participated in a\n\n\"Leadership Assessment Program\" (Program) at the Rady School of Management at the\n\nUniversity of California at San Diego. The participants attended the Program at the\n\nDistrict's expense. The scope of work for the Program described it in part as follows: \"A\n\nstructured leadership assessment experience offers an opportunity to demonstrate skills\n\nand capabilities in a challenging environment and to receive feedback on that\n\nperformance. . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . By providing specific, actionable evaluations and\n\nfeedback, developmental activities can be targeted to skills that will make the greatest\n\ndifference in the success of both the individual and the organization.\"\n\n       The scope of work touts benefits of the Program for both the participating\n\nindividuals and their organization. For individuals, the Program provides \"a foundation\n\nfor development planning,\" including (1) \"[c]omprehensive, integrated feedback\" from\n\nthe Program, (2) \"[a] summary of results and recommendations for ongoing\n\ndevelopment,\" and (3) \"[a] comprehensive 360-degree feedback summary of how others\n\n                                               3\n\fperceive the participant's skills and abilities.\" For the organization, the Program provides\n\n\"a solid foundation for individual development and succession planning efforts\" through\n\n(1) \"[a] report on each participant detailing their strengths and development needs,\" (2)\n\n\"[a]n evaluation of each participant on each of the organization's key competencies,\" and\n\n(3) \"[a] talent management summary that shows where leadership strengths and\n\ndevelopment needs are greatest within a team of participants.\"2\n\n       The latter three items appear to comprise the documents at issue in this proceeding\n\n(hereinafter, the Rady documents). The participant reports are tailored to each individual\n\nand provide specific, personalized written feedback and evaluations along each of the\n\ncategories (or \"competencies\") assessed. These categories include general managerial\n\nskill sets and more practical organizational competencies. The participant evaluation\n\ncontains a table that provides a single rating in each category for each participant, along\n\nwith the participant's name. (The participant evaluation is the first page of the Rady\n\ndocuments as submitted to this court.) The talent management summary contains a table\n\nthat lists only the categories, not the participants, and shows how the organization as a\n\nwhole fared in each category. Although the talent management summary is composed of\n\nthe ratings of the individual participants, the ratings are reordered within each category\n\nsuch that an individual participant's ratings across each category cannot be reconstructed\n\nfrom the summary. No participant names are listed in the talent management summary.\n\n\n\n\n2     The scope of work also notes that the Program achieves \"[a] balance between\nbusiness acumen and leadership characteristics, competencies and attributes.\"\n                                             4\n\f(The talent management summary is the second page of the Rady documents as\n\nsubmitted to this court.)3\n\n       The District's human resources manager, Karen Tucholski, told participants that\n\nthe results of the Program would be confidential. Tucholski said the results \"were for\n\nprofessional development purposes only and would be part of each employee's personnel\n\nfile accessible only by authorized [District] personnel such as Human Resources or the\n\nemployee's supervisor.\"\n\n       A year later, Brad Racino, an investigative reporter for inewsource, received\n\ninformation that District employees had participated in the Program. He filed a PRA\n\nrequest for \"[a]ny and all studies or reports compiled by the Rady School of Management\n\nconcerning [the District] in electronic format.\" Two days later, the District denied\n\nRacino's request on the grounds the requested documents were exempt as personnel files\n\nunder section 6254, subdivision (c).\n\n       Inewsource filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court seeking an order\n\ncompelling disclosure of the Rady documents and other relief. The District opposed. In\n\naddition to the personnel records exemption, the District argued the Rady documents\n\nwere exempt from disclosure under the PRA's \"catch-all\" exemption in section 6255,\n\nsubdivision (a).\n\n\n\n\n3     Even if the documents described in the scope of work do not correspond exactly to\nthe Rady documents at issue here, we find the names used in the scope of work useful\nand will use them to refer to the Rady documents that have been submitted to us as we\nhave described them.\n                                             5\n\f       After examining the Rady documents in camera, the trial court denied\n\ninewsource's petition. The court found that both exemptions urged by the District\n\napplied: \"Having reviewed the records, the Court first finds that the Rady documents are\n\n'personnel, medical, or similar files, . . .' Accordingly, the Court balances the privacy\n\ninterests of the parties subject [to] these documents against the public interest in\n\ndisclosure. The Court finds the balance weighs in favor of non-disclosure. Here, the\n\nrecords would not contribute to the public's understanding of government and would not\n\nshed light on what 'the government has been up to.' [¶] The Rady documents are not\n\ndocuments reflecting how [the District] conducts its business. Rather, the records\n\nrepresent an assessment of the individual's strengths and weaknesses in various tested\n\nareas and any recommendations relative thereto. Having reviewed these records, the\n\nCourt finds them to be akin to performance evaluations and any public interest in the\n\nrecords would be minimal at best. [¶] . . . [¶] The Court further finds that the public\n\ninterest in disclosure of these documents is outweighed by the public interest in\n\nnondisclosure. [(§ 6255, subd. (a).)] Assuming a public interest exists, the Court finds\n\nthat . . . disclosure of these documents would have [a] detrimental effect on the\n\nmanagement employees at [the District] by creating unhealthy comparisons and potential\n\nembarrassment between management employees and their subordinate employees.\"\n\n       Inewsource petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the superior court\n\nto vacate its order, grant the petition, and compel disclosure of the Rady documents. We\n\nrequested and received a sealed copy of the documents at issue, which we have reviewed.\n\nWe issued an order to show cause and will now grant the petition in part.\n\n                                              6\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n\n                                              I\n\n       As an initial matter, we must consider inewsource's request for judicial notice,\n\nwhich includes requests inewsource made to the trial court (but for which the trial court\n\nissued no ruling) and requests to this court in the first instance.4 Evidence Code section\n\n459, governing requests for judicial notice in this court, provides in part as follows: \"The\n\nreviewing court shall take judicial notice of: (1) each matter properly noticed by the trial\n\ncourt; and (2) each matter that the trial court was required to notice under [Evidence\n\nCode] Section 451 or 453. The reviewing court may take judicial notice of any matter\n\nspecified in [Evidence Code] Section 452.\" (Evid. Code, § 459, subd. (a); see Lockley v.\n\nLaw Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 875, 881.)\n\nIf a matter is properly subject to judicial notice, \"[e]xclusionary rules of evidence do not\n\napply except for [Evidence Code] Section 352 and the rules of privilege.\" (Evid. Code,\n\n§ 454, subd. (b)(2).)\n\n       Inewsource's first request for judicial notice in the trial court covered four news\n\narticles published by inewsource (and in some cases KPBS as well) concerning alleged\n\nincompetence and malfeasance at the District and one memorandum issued by the\n\nCalifornia Department of Industrial Relations discussing regulatory requirements related\n\nto personnel records. The fact that news articles have been published may be judicially\n\n\n\n4      Prior to the issuance of our order to show cause in this matter, inewsource\nsubmitted an application for judicial notice. Because inewsource's motion for judicial\nnotice supersedes the application, we deny the application as moot.\n                                              7\n\fnoticed under Evidence Code section 452, subdivisions (g) and (h). (Ragland v. U.S.\n\nBank National Assn. (2012) 209 Cal.App.4th 182, 193 (Ragland).) However, a court\n\nmay not take judicial notice of the truth of the matters stated therein. (Id. at pp. 193-194.)\n\nSimilarly, official government records may be judicially noticed under Evidence Code\n\nsection 452, subdivision (c), but the truth of the matters stated therein may not.\n\n(Ragland, supra, 209 Cal.App.4th at p. 193 [\"Although the audit report is a government\n\ndocument, we may not judicially notice the truth of its contents.\"].) We further find that\n\nthese matters have at least some relevance to the issues before the court. Upon the proper\n\nrequest of a party, the trial court was required to judicially notice the existence of the\n\nnews articles and the state memorandum. (Evid. Code, § 453.) We are therefore required\n\nto do so as well. (Evid. Code, § 459, subd. (a).)\n\n       Inewsource's second request for judicial notice in the trial court covered more than\n\n30 documents. The existence of the news stories and Internet Web pages referenced in\n\nthe request will be judicially noticed for the reasons we have already stated.5 (Evid.\n\nCode, §§ 452, subds. (g) & (h); 453, 459, subd. (a); see Ragland, supra, 209 Cal.App.4th\n\nat p. 193.) Similarly, the existence of the District correspondence, District e-mails, the\n\nDistrict's annual report, a third-party audit commissioned by the District, and other\n\nDistrict documents referenced in the request will be judicially noticed. (Evid. Code,\n\n\n\n5       We will not take judicial notice of the Wikipedia page entitled \"No bid contract\"\non the grounds the trial court was not required to judicially notice it because it had no\nrelevance to the disposition of inewsource's petition. (People v. McKinzie (2012) 54\nCal.4th 1302, 1326 [\" 'Although a court may judicially notice a variety of matters\n[citation], only relevant material may be noticed.' \"].)\n                                              8\n\f§§ 452, subds. (c), (g) & (h); 453, 459, subd. (a); see Landstar Global Logistics, Inc. v.\n\nRobinson & Robinson, Inc. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 378, 388, fn. 4; Ragland, supra, 209\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 193.) The referenced portions of the Public Contract Code, sections\n\n100 through 102, are subject to mandatory judicial notice. (Evid. Code, §§ 451, subd.\n\n(a); 459, subd. (a).) Again, we find that these matters have at least some relevance to the\n\nissues before the court. We will not take judicial notice of the existence or contents of\n\nthe inewsource correspondence referenced in the request because they are not judicially\n\nnoticeable as a fact or proposition in common knowledge or not reasonably subject to\n\ndispute. (See Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (g) & (h).) We also will not take judicial notice\n\nof District documents and correspondence filed in inewsource's exhibit appendix to its\n\ntrial court writ petition. Those documents are already part of the record before this court,\n\nand judicial notice is unnecessary. Any objections made in the trial court have not been\n\nadequately urged on appeal and supported by reasoned argument and authority. They are\n\ntherefore waived. (See Cahill v. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th\n\n939, 956.)\n\n       Inewsource's request for judicial notice in this court covers the District's business\n\ncase justification for the Program, other District documents and correspondence, an\n\nInternet Web page published by the California Department of Human Resources, two\n\nCalifornia Regional Water Quality Board orders, portions of a Federal Transit\n\nAdministration review of the District, and various inewsource news articles and Internet\n\nWeb pages. Inewsource contends judicial notice of these documents is warranted under\n\nEvidence Code section 452. Inewsource did not seek judicial notice of these documents\n\n                                              9\n\fin the trial court, claiming without explanation that \"page constraints\" prevented it from\n\ndoing so. To the extent these documents are already part of the record, e.g., in\n\ninewsource's exhibit appendix, judicial notice is unnecessary as we have explained. As to\n\ndocuments not already part of the record, we decline to take judicial notice of these\n\ndocuments in these proceedings because inewsource did not request judicial notice in the\n\ntrial court. (Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. (1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 444, fn.\n\n3; Safeco Ins. Co. of America v. Superior Court (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 814, 834, fn. 14.)\n\n                                              II\n\n       We now turn to the merits of inewsource's petition. \"The PRA and the California\n\nConstitution provide the public with a right of access to government information. As [the\n\nSupreme Court] has explained: 'Openness in government is essential to the functioning\n\nof a democracy. \"Implicit in the democratic process is the notion that government should\n\nbe accountable for its actions. In order to verify accountability, individuals must have\n\naccess to government files. Such access permits checks against the arbitrary exercise of\n\nofficial power and secrecy in the political process.\" [Citation.]' [Citation.] In adopting\n\nthe PRA, the Legislature declared that 'access to information concerning the conduct of\n\nthe people's business is a fundamental and necessary right of every person in this state.'\n\n(§ 6250.) 'As the result of an initiative adopted by the voters in 2004, this principle is\n\nnow enshrined in the state Constitution . . . .' [Citation.] The California Constitution,\n\narticle I, section 3, subdivision (b)(1) provides: 'The people have the right of access to\n\ninformation concerning the conduct of the people's business, and therefore, the meetings\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fof public bodies and the writings of public officials and agencies shall be open to public\n\nscrutiny.' \" (Sierra Club v. Superior Court (2013) 57 Cal.4th 157, 164.)\n\n       The PRA \"was passed for the explicit purpose of 'increasing freedom of\n\ninformation' by giving the public 'access to information in possession of public agencies'\n\n[citation]. Maximum disclosure of the conduct of governmental operations was to be\n\npromoted by the [PRA].\" (CBS, Inc. v. Block (1986) 42 Cal.3d 646, 651-652.) \"In\n\ngeneral . . . all public records are subject to disclosure unless the Legislature has\n\nexpressly provided to the contrary.\" (Los Angeles Unified School Dist. v. Superior Court\n\n(2014) 228 Cal.App.4th 222, 238 (LAUSD).)\n\n       \"The Legislature has been 'mindful of the right of individuals to privacy.'\n\n(§ 6250.) Set forth in the [PRA] are numerous exceptions to the requirement of public\n\ndisclosure, many of which are designed to protect individual privacy. (See § 6254.) In\n\naddition, a catchall exception applies if 'on the facts of the particular case the public\n\ninterest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served\n\nby disclosure of the record.' (§ 6255, subd. (a).) Unless one of the exceptions stated in\n\nthe [PRA] applies, the public is entitled to access to 'any writing containing information\n\nrelating to the conduct of the public's business prepared, owned, used, or retained by any\n\nstate or local agency.' (§ 6252, subd. (e); see § 6253, subd. (a).)\" (International\n\nFederation of Professional & Technical Engineers, Local 21, AFL–CIO v. Superior\n\nCourt (2007) 42 Cal.4th 319, 329 (International Federation), fn. omitted.)\n\n       \"In 2004, California's voters passed an initiative measure that added to the state\n\nConstitution a provision directing the courts to broadly construe statutes that grant public\n\n                                              11\n\faccess to government information and to narrowly construe statutes that limit such\n\naccess. (Cal. Const. art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(2).) That provision, however, does not affect the\n\nconstruction of any statute 'to the extent . . . it protects [the] right to privacy . . . .' (Cal.\n\nConst. art. I, § 3, subd. (b)(3).)\" (Long Beach Police Officers Assn. v. City of Long Beach\n\n(2014) 59 Cal.4th 59, 68.)\n\n       \"Interpretation of the [PRA] and its application to undisputed facts present\n\nquestions of law subject to de novo appellate review. [Citation.] And when it comes to\n\nbalancing various interests under the [PRA], while we accept the trial court's express and\n\nimplied factual determinations if supported by the record, 'we undertake the weighing\n\nprocess anew.\" (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 237.) \"An agency opposing\n\ndisclosure bears the burden of proving that an exemption applies.\" (Id. at p. 239.)\n\n                                                 III\n\n       The District first asserts that the Rady documents are part of the participants'\n\npersonnel files and are therefore exempt under section 6254, subdivision (c).6 That\n\nstatute exempts from disclosure \"[p]ersonnel, medical, or similar files, the disclosure of\n\n\n\n6      The District also makes the following threshold argument: \"[The District] has\nalways maintained that the Rady documents are not public records[;] they are private\npersonnel records and exempt from disclosure under Government Code section 6254\nsubdivision (c).\" The District appears to misunderstand the PRA. Personnel records\nexempt from disclosure are public records; otherwise they would need no exemption.\n(§§ 6252, subd. (e); 6254.) In any event, the District offers no reasoned argument or\nauthority for the proposition that the Rady documents are not public records. Based on\nour review, we conclude they are public records within the meaning of the PRA.\n(§ 6252; see San Gabriel Tribune v. Superior Court (1983) 143 Cal.App.3d 762, 774\n(San Gabriel Tribune).)\n\n                                                 12\n\fwhich would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.\" (§ 6254, subd.\n\n(c).)\n\n        Relying on analogous federal law under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA),\n\nthis court has applied a three-step analysis to evaluate an argument based on this\n\nexemption: \"As a threshold matter, the court must determine whether the records sought\n\nconstitute a personnel file, a medical file, or other similar file. If so, the court must\n\ndetermine whether disclosure of the information would 'compromise substantial privacy\n\ninterests; if privacy interests in given information are de minimus disclosure would not\n\namount to a \"clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy\" [citation], in light of\n\nFOIA's broad policy favoring disclosure.' [Citation.] Lastly, the court must determine\n\nwhether the potential harm to privacy interests from disclosure outweighs the public\n\ninterest in disclosure.\" (Versaci v. Superior Court (2005) 127 Cal.App.4th 805, 818\n\n(Versaci); see BRV, Inc. v. Superior Court (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 742, 755 (BRV).)7\n\n        To qualify as personnel or similar files, documents \"need not contain intimate\n\ndetails or highly personal information. They may simply be government records\n\ncontaining 'information which applies to a particular individual.' \" (LAUSD, supra, 228\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 239.) Two types of records in the Rady documents, the participant\n\n\n7      Inewsource contends Versaci is not good law because it relies on analogous cases\ninterpreting FOIA and it cites a case (Teamsters Local 856 v. Priceless, LLC (2003) 112\nCal.App.4th 1500), the conclusion of which the Supreme Court later disagreed with (see\nInternational Federation, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 336). We disagree. Cases interpreting\nFOIA can inform California courts' interpretation of the PRA in many contexts, even if\nthe two statutory schemes differ in certain ways. (See Williams v. Superior Court (1993)\n5 Cal.4th 337, 352.) Versaci's citation to Teamsters Local 856 v. Priceless, LLC also\ndoes not undermine the analysis or conclusions in Versaci on which we rely.\n                                              13\n\freports and participant evaluations, appear to be personnel or similar files. They contain\n\ninformation specific to individual participants, and the competency evaluations in those\n\nrecords reflect information that is traditionally contained in personnel files (e.g.,\n\nperformance reviews). (See ibid.; Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 819; see also\n\nMilner v. Department of Navy (2011) 562 U.S. 562 [\" '[T]he common and congressional\n\nmeaning of . . . \"personnel file\" ' is the file 'showing, for example, where [an employee]\n\nwas born, the names of his parents, where he has lived from time to time, his . . . school\n\nrecords, results of examinations, [and] evaluations of his work performance.' \"].) The\n\ntalent management summary presents a closer question. The information in that record\n\nreflects individual, albeit anonymous, information and evaluations. For purposes of our\n\ndiscussion, we will accept the District's contention that the talent management summary,\n\ntoo, is a personnel or similar file.\n\n       Next we evaluate the privacy interests implicated by the Rady documents.\n\n(Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 818.) \"Public employees have a legally protected\n\ninterest in their personnel files.\" (BRV, supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at p. 756.) The strength\n\nof that interest, however, will vary depending on the information at issue. Again, we find\n\nit useful to distinguish the participant reports and participant evaluation, on one hand,\n\nfrom the talent management summary, on the other.\n\n       The participant reports and participant evaluation reflect individualized\n\nassessments of each participant. In the participant reports, these assessments include\n\nwritten narratives describing the participant's personality traits, work ethic, and similar\n\nqualities. In the participant evaluation, the assessments are distilled into a rating for each\n\n                                              14\n\fassessed category. Based on this content, we conclude that disclosure of the participant\n\nreports and participant evaluation in the Rady documents \"would 'compromise substantial\n\nprivacy interests.' \" (Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 820 [disclosure of an\n\nemployee's \"personal performance goals\"].) \"[T]he 'disclosure of negative comments or\n\ninformation about an employee on these subjects . . . could be quite embarrassing and\n\npainful to the employee. While many of the comments and much of the information are\n\nfavorable or neutral, [the relevant exemption] was designed to protect individuals from a\n\nwide range of embarrassing disclosures, not just the disclosure of derogatory information.\n\nIndeed, the disclosure of favorable information could place the employee in a very\n\nembarrassing position with other, possibly jealous, employees.' \" (Ibid.)\n\n       The talent management summary presents no similar danger of embarrassment or\n\npain to individual employees. While the talent management summary provides\n\ninformation about the participants as a whole (e.g., whether most participants performed\n\nwell in a particular category), the information cannot be linked to any individual\n\nparticipant. Nor does the talent management summary disclose whether any individual\n\nparticipant did well in one category and worse in another category; the ratings within\n\neach category are reordered from best to worst. The privacy interest in such collective\n\nassessments, while perhaps not de minimus, is nonetheless severely attenuated.\n\n       Our final step is balancing the privacy interests implicated by the Rady documents\n\nagainst any public interest in their disclosure. We \"must determine whether the potential\n\nharm to privacy interests from disclosure outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\"\n\n(Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 818.) Fundamentally, the strength of the public\n\n                                            15\n\finterest depends on \" 'the extent to which disclosure of the requested item of information\n\nwill shed light on the public agency's performance of its duty.' \" (Id. at p. 820.) \"While,\n\nas a threshold matter, the records must pertain to the conduct of the people's business, '\n\n\"[t]he weight of that interest is proportionate to the gravity of the governmental tasks\n\nsought to be illuminated and the directness with which the disclosure will serve to\n\nilluminate.\" ' \" (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 242; see Connell v. Superior Court\n\n(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 601, 616.)\n\n       As an initial matter, we note that the Program—and therefore the Rady\n\ndocuments—were procured with District funds. The public therefore has an interest in\n\nknowing what was purchased with those funds, whether the Program was worth what the\n\nDistrict spent, and whether the Program provided utility to the District. (See\n\nInternational Federation, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 333 [finding a \"strong public interest in\n\nknowing how the government spends its money\"].) The public also has an interest in\n\nknowing how the District identifies professional development opportunities and evaluates\n\nits senior staff, which were in part purposes of the Program. The Rady documents would\n\nplainly shed light on the District's activities in these ways.\n\n       The Rady documents also shed light on the District's ability to perform its primary\n\nduty: developing and operating mass transit systems in San Diego County. \"[P]ublic\n\naccess makes it possible for members of the public ' \"to expose corruption, incompetence,\n\ninefficiency, prejudice, and favoritism.\" ' \" (International Federation, supra, 42 Cal.4th\n\nat p. 333.) The Program was designed to assess the competence of the District's senior\n\nmanagers in various categories (including \"the organization's key competencies \") and\n\n                                              16\n\fidentify development opportunities. The Rady documents reflect the results of that\n\nassessment, including whether the individual participants performed well on the\n\nProgram's various measures of managerial competency. While the Program focused on\n\nthe competence of individual managers, the District's ability to perform its duty depends\n\non the abilities of the individuals within the District's organization to act competently.\n\n(See BRV, supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at p. 757 [\"Without doubt, the public has a significant\n\ninterest in the professional competence and conduct of a school district superintendent\n\nand high school principal.\"].) The Rady documents are therefore relevant to an important\n\npublic interest.\n\n       Although the Rady documents are somewhat abstracted from the specific details\n\nof the participants' everyday work, as the District repeatedly points out, the Rady\n\ndocuments nonetheless provide valuable insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the\n\nparticipating managers in their senior roles at the District—and the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the management team as a whole. Indeed, those are two of the main\n\npurposes of the Program as set out in its scope of work.8\n\n\n\n8       Contrary to inewsource's contention, the Rady documents do not involve an\ninquiry into instances of District wrongdoing, well-founded or otherwise. Instead, as we\nhave discussed, they represent the evaluation of the participating managers in various\ngeneral categories of managerial competency. Although the Rady documents may have\nsome relevance to inewsource's allegations of wrongdoing or malfeasance, because they\nrelate generally to the ability of the participating mangers to perform in their positions,\nthere is no heightened public interest based on that tenuous connection. The standard for\ndisclosure articulated by American Federation of State etc. Employees v. Regents of the\nUniversity of California (1978) 80 Cal.App.3d 913 is therefore inapplicable. \"[That] case\nprovides that where complaints of a public employee's wrongdoing and resulting\ndisciplinary investigation reveal allegations of a substantial nature, as distinct from\n                                             17\n\f       The participant evaluation and talent management summary, by presenting the\n\nratings of the participant group as a whole, bear most directly on the District's\n\ncompetence to perform its public duties. (See LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 243\n\n[\"There can be little doubt that a public interest exists in 'teacher AGT scores' [i.e.,\n\nteaching achievement metrics] as a whole.\"].) The additional information in the\n\nparticipant reports, however, is only indirectly relevant to the operations of the District.\n\nMuch of the information in the participant reports is tailored to the individual traits and\n\npersonalities of the participants. While the public has some interest in knowing and\n\nevaluating the traits and personalities of senior managers at a public agency, based on our\n\nreview most of the information in the participant reports would be primarily useful only\n\nto the individual participants. The public's ability to understand more about the District\n\nbased on this additional information would be low.\n\n       Balancing the public and private interests, we conclude that the participant reports\n\nand participant evaluation fall within the PRA's personnel records exception. (See\n\n§ 6254, subd. (c).) These documents reflect the ratings and assessments of each\n\nparticipant, identified by name, which engenders a strong privacy interest in their\n\nnondisclosure. They are akin to performance evaluations, which implicate substantial\n\n\n\n\nbaseless or trivial, and there is reasonable cause to believe the complaint is well founded,\npublic employee privacy must give way to the public's right to know.\" (Bakersfield City\nSchool Dist. v. Superior Court (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 1041, 1046.) The circumstances\nhere are readily distinguishable. (See LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 253 [\"That is\na far cry from the instant case, where there is no specific incident to investigate, just the\nongoing (albeit important) work of teachers doing their jobs.\"].)\n                                              18\n\fprivacy interests.9 As to these documents, the strong interest in protecting the privacy of\n\nthe individual participants outweighs the public interest in uncovering potential\n\nincompetence. (See Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 822 [holding that a public\n\nemployee's \"privacy interest in her entire evaluation process including her personal\n\nperformance goals outweighs the public's minimal interest in the matter\"].)\n\n       Inewsource points out that a public official generally has \"a significantly reduced\n\nexpectation of privacy in matters of his public employment.\" (BRV, supra, 143\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 758.) While that principle is correct as a general matter, there are\n\nspecific instances in which a public official's privacy interests will outweigh the public\n\ninterest in disclosure. (See, e.g., Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 822.) \"[E]ven\n\ngovernment employees have privacy rights and ' \"on certain occasions, the public's right\n\nto disclosure must yield to the privacy rights of governmental agents.\" ' [Citation.]\n\n'[O]ne does not lose his right to privacy upon accepting public employment . . . .' \"\n\n(LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 241, fn. 13.) Contrary to inewsource's claim, even\n\nrecords related to public business may be withheld under an applicable exemption; that is\n\nthe purpose of the exemptions. If a record is purely personal and unrelated to public\n\n\n\n\n9      The Brown Act, for example, \"expressly authorizes a public agency to meet in\nclosed session regarding the consideration of 'the appointment, employment, evaluation\nof performance, discipline, or dismissal of a public employee.' (Gov. Code, § 54957,\nsubd. (b)(1).)\" (Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 821; see International Federation,\nsupra, 42 Cal.4th at pp. 333-334.) \"The 'underlying purposes of the \"personnel\nexception\" are to protect the employee from public embarrassment and to permit free and\ncandid discussions of personnel matters by a local governmental body.' \" (Versaci,\nsupra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 821.)\n                                             19\n\fbusiness, it is not subject to the PRA at all. (See § 6252, subd. (e); see also San Gabriel\n\nTribune, supra, 143 Cal.App.3d at p. 774.)10\n\n       Inewsource proposes, as an alternative, that the names of the participating\n\nindividuals be redacted from the Rady documents to mitigate any privacy concerns. (See\n\nCBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 653 [\"The fact that parts of a requested\n\ndocument fall within the terms of an exemption does not justify withholding the entire\n\ndocument.\"].) We disagree. Given the specificity with which the participant reports and,\n\nto some extent, the participant evaluation discuss the competencies, traits, and\n\npersonalities of the participating managers, there is a substantial risk that the participating\n\nmanagers could be identified and linked to their individual ratings and reports. Redacting\n\nthe names of the individual managers would therefore have little effect on the privacy\n\nrights implicated by these documents.\n\n\n\n10      Inewsource also relies on an opinion of the Attorney General concerning the\ndisclosure of application and personnel files of nautical pilots. (53 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.\n136 (1970).) In that opinion the Attorney General noted, as we do here, that portions of a\npersonnel file may be sufficiently confidential to warrant exemption under the PRA: \"As\nthe information bears more remotely on the question of qualifications or performance,\nand as it by its personal nature becomes more likely to be regarded as intrusive or\nembarrassing by its disclosure, the probability of its confidential nature increases.\" (53\nOps.Cal.Atty.Gen, supra, at pp. 146-147.) The Attorney General therefore advised that\n\"section 6254[, subdivision ](c) preserves the confidentiality of only a limited portion of\nthe material found in a personnel file. For this reason, it is appropriate to segregate the\nconfidential matters from the remainder of such a file.\" (53 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen., supra, at\npp. 147-148.) The Attorney General did not advise disclosing the entirety of any\npersonnel file, as inewsource implies. Moreover, any analogy between the personnel\nfiles at issue in the Attorney General's opinion and the Rady documents is imperfect\nbecause the pilots were not employees of the Board of Pilot Commissioners. (See id. at\np. 144.) Their personnel files therefore appear to have contained information that would\nnot be comparable to the Rady documents.\n                                              20\n\f       As to the talent management summary, however, the absence of personally\n\nidentifying information tips the balance in favor of disclosure. As we have explained, the\n\nprivacy interest implicated by this record is significantly attenuated. Although it appears\n\nprobable the participating employees were told that this record, too, would be kept\n\nconfidential, the promise of confidentiality is not determinative in weighing the public\n\nand private interests. (See BRV, supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at pp. 748-749, 759; Versaci,\n\nsupra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 821; San Gabriel Tribune, supra, 143 Cal.App.3d at p. 774.)\n\nThe ratings contained in the talent management summary cannot be matched to any\n\nindividual participant. The ratings do provide significant information, however, that\n\nbears on the competency of the District's participating senior managers across various\n\ncategories (including \"the organization's key competencies\"). The public interest\n\ntherefore remains strong. (See LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 243; BRV, supra,\n\n143 Cal.App.4th at p. 757.) Because disclosure of the talent management summary\n\nwould not \"constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\" we conclude it is not\n\nexempt from disclosure under section 6254, subdivision (c).\n\n                                            IV\n\n       The District also contends the \"catch-all\" exemption in section 6255 of the PRA\n\napplies to the Rady documents. Under that exemption, an agency may withhold a public\n\nrecord from disclosure by showing \"that on the facts of the particular case the public\n\ninterest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served\n\nby disclosure of the record.\" (§ 6255, subd. (a).) \"Records 'found to be nonexempt under\n\nsection 6254 . . . can still be withheld under section 6255.' \" (LAUSD, supra, 228\n\n                                            21\n\fCal.App.4th at p. 254.) However, because we have concluded that a portion of the Rady\n\ndocuments, the participant reports and the participant evaluation, are exempt under\n\nsection 6254, subdivision (c), we need not consider whether they would additionally be\n\nexempt under section 6255. (See ibid.) Our analysis under the \"catch-all\" exemption\n\nwill therefore be limited to the talent management summary.\n\n       \"The catch-all exemption 'contemplates a case-by-case balancing process, with the\n\nburden of proof on the proponent of nondisclosure to demonstrate a clear overbalance on\n\nthe side of confidentiality.' [Citation.] Where the public interest in disclosure of the\n\nrecords is not outweighed by the public interest in nondisclosure, courts will direct the\n\ngovernment to disclose the requested information. [Citation.] Conversely, when the\n\npublic interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure, refusal\n\nto release records will be upheld.\" (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 239-240.)\n\n\"Under section 6255, the court balances the public interest in disclosure against the\n\npublic interest in nondisclosure.\" (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 240.) We have\n\nalready considered the public interest in the disclosure of the talent management\n\nsummary in the previous part. We will therefore turn to the public interest in\n\nnondisclosure.\n\n       The District asserts that \"releasing the Rady documents would be detrimental to\n\nthe functioning of [the District] and its ability to carry out its duties to the public.\"\n\nRelying on LAUSD, the District claims disclosure would negatively affect management\n\nemployees at the District by generating \"unhealthy comparisons among\" the employees,\n\nleading to \"discord in the workplace.\" (See LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 250-\n\n                                               22\n\f251.) In LAUSD, however, the government had already released information that was at\n\nleast as detailed as the talent management summary, including anonymous ratings of each\n\nteacher. (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 247.) The concerns articulated in\n\nLAUSD related to the disclosure of the identities of the public employees at issue, which\n\nis not at issue in the talent management summary. (See id. at p. 245.)\n\n       The District's concerns may have some validity with respect to the participant\n\nreports and the participant evaluations, in which the participants and their corresponding\n\nratings are identified. As to the talent management summary, however, we find the\n\nDistrict's concerns to be largely unfounded because no individual participants are\n\nidentified. While the talent management summary reflects how the 13 participants were\n\nrated in each category, the ratings cannot be linked to any individual participant. In the\n\nabsence of any specific evidence to the contrary (and the District provides none), we\n\nbelieve any \"unhealthy comparisons\" or \"discord in the workplace\" generated by the\n\ndisclosure of the talent management summary would be minimal. While some\n\nsubordinate employees may notice the ratings of their superiors as a group, we believe\n\nthe subordinates likely already understand their superiors' strengths and weaknesses in far\n\nmore detail than the talent management summary provides. And, while some participants\n\nin the Program may experience embarrassment at the prospect of being included in a\n\ngroup with a given set of scores, the public interest in avoiding such embarrassment is\n\nalso minimal.\n\n       \"Courts must be alert to contentions by government entities that exaggerate the\n\ninterest in nondisclosure, lest they be used as a pretext for keeping information secret for\n\n                                             23\n\fimproper reasons, such as to avoid embarrassment over mistakes, incompetence, or\n\nwrongdoing. After all, to some extent any request for disclosure of public records will\n\nplace a burden on government. Both the voters and their elected officials have\n\nestablished the general policy that this burden is well worth bearing in order to keep\n\ndemocracy vital. If the catchall provision of the [PRA] becomes a loophole used to\n\nimproperly keep public records from the people, the important purposes of the [PRA]\n\nwould be undermined.\" (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 250.)\n\n       Balancing the strong public interest in disclosure of the talent management\n\nsummary against the minimal public interest in its nondisclosure, we conclude the\n\nDistrict has not shown the public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public\n\ninterest in disclosure. (See § 6255, subd. (a).) \" 'Since there is a strong public interest in\n\ndisclosure, the balance must tip in favor of access' to the information.\" (Sacramento\n\nCounty Employees' Retirement System v. Superior Court (2011) 195 Cal.App.4th 440,\n\n472.) The \"catch-all\" exemption under section 6255 does not apply to the talent\n\nmanagement summary.11\n\n\n\n\n11     Our conclusion that the talent management summary must be disclosed under the\nPRA reinforces our determination that the participant reports and participant evaluation\nshould not be disclosed. While the information contained in each is not exactly the same,\nthe bulk of the information that would allow the public to assess the competency of the\nDistrict's senior managers (at least according to the Program) is set forth in the talent\nmanagement summary. (See LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 242 [\"Where a\nrequester has an alternative, less intrusive, means of obtaining the information sought, the\npublic interest in disclosure is minimal.\"].)\n                                              24\n\f                                       DISPOSITION\n\n       Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate its\n\norder denying inewsource's petition and to enter a new order granting inewsource's\n\npetition in part as to the talent management summary, which is reflected on the second\n\npage of the Rady documents as submitted to this court. Inewsource's request for attorney\n\nfees is denied without prejudice to inewsource's ability to seek attorney fees, including\n\nfor this proceeding, in the superior court.

(Gov. Code, § 6250 et seq.)1 The documents at issue reflect the results of a\n\n\"Leadership Assessment Program\" conducted at the District's expense by the Rady\n\nSchool of Management at the University of California at San Diego. In response to\n\ninewsource's PRA request, the District declined to provide the documents on the grounds\n\nthey were exempt from disclosure. The trial court agreed and denied inewsource's\n\npetition for writ of mandate compelling disclosure.\n\n       Inewsource petitions this court for a writ of mandate directing the trial court to\n\nvacate its order, grant the petition, and compel disclosure. Inewsource contends the\n\nexemptions cited by the trial court, for personnel files (§ 6254, subd. (c)) and the PRA's\n\n\"catch-all\" provision (§ 6255, subd. (a)), are inapplicable. We agree in part, and therefore\n\ngrant the petition in part, as we will explain.\n\n                   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n       Inewsource is a nonprofit organization based in San Diego, California, and\n\nengaged in investigative journalism. Inewsource publishes its content on the Internet and\n\nthrough its partnership with KPBS, a local public radio and television station. Among\n\ninewsource's subjects have been the management, operations, and finances of the District.\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Government Code unless otherwise\nspecified.\n                                                  2\n\fInewsource has published dozens of articles, Internet posts, and other items about the\n\nDistrict.\n\n       Created by the California Legislature in 1975, the District is a public entity that\n\ndevelops and operates mass transit services in the northern portion of San Diego County.\n\nThese services include the COASTER commuter rail, the SPRINTER light rail, the\n\nBREEZE fixed-route bus system, the FLEX on-demand system, and the LIFT paratransit\n\nservice. The District is supervised by a nine-member board of directors consisting of\n\nelected officials from eight cities in its service area and from San Diego County.\n\n       In December 2013, 13 District senior management staff participated in a\n\n\"Leadership Assessment Program\" (Program) at the Rady School of Management at the\n\nUniversity of California at San Diego. The participants attended the Program at the\n\nDistrict's expense. The scope of work for the Program described it in part as follows: \"A\n\nstructured leadership assessment experience offers an opportunity to demonstrate skills\n\nand capabilities in a challenging environment and to receive feedback on that\n\nperformance. . . . [¶] . . . [¶] . . . By providing specific, actionable evaluations and\n\nfeedback, developmental activities can be targeted to skills that will make the greatest\n\ndifference in the success of both the individual and the organization.\"\n\n       The scope of work touts benefits of the Program for both the participating\n\nindividuals and their organization. For individuals, the Program provides \"a foundation\n\nfor development planning,\" including (1) \"[c]omprehensive, integrated feedback\" from\n\nthe Program, (2) \"[a] summary of results and recommendations for ongoing\n\ndevelopment,\" and (3) \"[a] comprehensive 360-degree feedback summary of how others\n\n                                               3\n\fperceive the participant's skills and abilities.\" For the organization, the Program provides\n\n\"a solid foundation for individual development and succession planning efforts\" through\n\n(1) \"[a] report on each participant detailing their strengths and development needs,\" (2)\n\n\"[a]n evaluation of each participant on each of the organization's key competencies,\" and\n\n(3) \"[a] talent management summary that shows where leadership strengths and\n\ndevelopment needs are greatest within a team of participants.\"2\n\n       The latter three items appear to comprise the documents at issue in this proceeding\n\n(hereinafter, the Rady documents). The participant reports are tailored to each individual\n\nand provide specific, personalized written feedback and evaluations along each of the\n\ncategories (or \"competencies\") assessed. These categories include general managerial\n\nskill sets and more practical organizational competencies. The participant evaluation\n\ncontains a table that provides a single rating in each category for each participant, along\n\nwith the participant's name. (The participant evaluation is the first page of the Rady\n\ndocuments as submitted to this court.) The talent management summary contains a table\n\nthat lists only the categories, not the participants, and shows how the organization as a\n\nwhole fared in each category. Although the talent management summary is composed of\n\nthe ratings of the individual participants, the ratings are reordered within each category\n\nsuch that an individual participant's ratings across each category cannot be reconstructed\n\nfrom the summary. No participant names are listed in the talent management summary.\n\n\n\n\n2     The scope of work also notes that the Program achieves \"[a] balance between\nbusiness acumen and leadership characteristics, competencies and attributes.\"\n                                             4\n\f(The talent management summary is the second page of the Rady documents as\n\nsubmitted to this court.)3\n\n       The District's human resources manager, Karen Tucholski, told participants that\n\nthe results of the Program would be confidential. Tucholski said the results \"were for\n\nprofessional development purposes only and would be part of each employee's personnel\n\nfile accessible only by authorized [District] personnel such as Human Resources or the\n\nemployee's supervisor.\"\n\n       A year later, Brad Racino, an investigative reporter for inewsource, received\n\ninformation that District employees had participated in the Program. He filed a PRA\n\nrequest for \"[a]ny and all studies or reports compiled by the Rady School of Management\n\nconcerning [the District] in electronic format.\" Two days later, the District denied\n\nRacino's request on the grounds the requested documents were exempt as personnel files\n\nunder section 6254, subdivision (c).\n\n       Inewsource filed a petition for writ of mandate in the trial court seeking an order\n\ncompelling disclosure of the Rady documents and other relief. The District opposed. In\n\naddition to the personnel records exemption, the District argued the Rady documents\n\nwere exempt from disclosure under the PRA's \"catch-all\" exemption in section 6255,\n\nsubdivision (a).\n\n\n\n\n3     Even if the documents described in the scope of work do not correspond exactly to\nthe Rady documents at issue here, we find the names used in the scope of work useful\nand will use them to refer to the Rady documents that have been submitted to us as we\nhave described them.\n                                             5\n\f       After examining the Rady documents in camera, the trial court denied\n\ninewsource's petition. The court found that both exemptions urged by the District\n\napplied: \"Having reviewed the records, the Court first finds that the Rady documents are\n\n'personnel, medical, or similar files, . . .' Accordingly, the Court balances the privacy\n\ninterests of the parties subject [to] these documents against the public interest in\n\ndisclosure. The Court finds the balance weighs in favor of non-disclosure. Here, the\n\nrecords would not contribute to the public's understanding of government and would not\n\nshed light on what 'the government has been up to.' [¶] The Rady documents are not\n\ndocuments reflecting how [the District] conducts its business. Rather, the records\n\nrepresent an assessment of the individual's strengths and weaknesses in various tested\n\nareas and any recommendations relative thereto. Having reviewed these records, the\n\nCourt finds them to be akin to performance evaluations and any public interest in the\n\nrecords would be minimal at best. [¶] . . . [¶] The Court further finds that the public\n\ninterest in disclosure of these documents is outweighed by the public interest in\n\nnondisclosure. [(§ 6255, subd. (a).)] Assuming a public interest exists, the Court finds\n\nthat . . . disclosure of these documents would have [a] detrimental effect on the\n\nmanagement employees at [the District] by creating unhealthy comparisons and potential\n\nembarrassment between management employees and their subordinate employees.\"\n\n       Inewsource petitioned this court for a writ of mandate directing the superior court\n\nto vacate its order, grant the petition, and compel disclosure of the Rady documents. We\n\nrequested and received a sealed copy of the documents at issue, which we have reviewed.\n\nWe issued an order to show cause and will now grant the petition in part.\n\n                                              6\n\f                                       DISCUSSION\n\n                                              I\n\n       As an initial matter, we must consider inewsource's request for judicial notice,\n\nwhich includes requests inewsource made to the trial court (but for which the trial court\n\nissued no ruling) and requests to this court in the first instance.4 Evidence Code section\n\n459, governing requests for judicial notice in this court, provides in part as follows: \"The\n\nreviewing court shall take judicial notice of: (1) each matter properly noticed by the trial\n\ncourt; and (2) each matter that the trial court was required to notice under [Evidence\n\nCode] Section 451 or 453. The reviewing court may take judicial notice of any matter\n\nspecified in [Evidence Code] Section 452.\" (Evid. Code, § 459, subd. (a); see Lockley v.\n\nLaw Office of Cantrell, Green, Pekich, Cruz & McCort (2001) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">875</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 881.)\n\nIf a matter is properly subject to judicial notice, \"[e]xclusionary rules of evidence do not\n\napply except for [Evidence Code] Section 352 and the rules of privilege.\" (Evid. Code,\n\n§ 454, subd. (b)(2).)\n\n       Inewsource's first request for judicial notice in the trial court covered four news\n\narticles published by inewsource (and in some cases KPBS as well) concerning alleged\n\nincompetence and malfeasance at the District and one memorandum issued by the\n\nCalifornia Department of Industrial Relations discussing regulatory requirements related\n\nto personnel records. The fact that news articles have been published may be judicially\n\n\n\n4      Prior to the issuance of our order to show cause in this matter, inewsource\nsubmitted an application for judicial notice. Because inewsource's motion for judicial\nnotice supersedes the application, we deny the application as moot.\n                                              7\n\fnoticed under Evidence Code section 452, subdivisions (g) and (h). (Ragland v. U.S.\n\nBank National Assn. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 193 (Ragland).) However, a court\n\nmay not take judicial notice of the truth of the matters stated therein. (Id. at pp. 193-194.)\n\nSimilarly, official government records may be judicially noticed under Evidence Code\n\nsection 452, subdivision (c), but the truth of the matters stated therein may not.\n\n(Ragland, supra, 209 Cal.App.4th at p. 193 [\"Although the audit report is a government\n\ndocument, we may not judicially notice the truth of its contents.\"].) We further find that\n\nthese matters have at least some relevance to the issues before the court. Upon the proper\n\nrequest of a party, the trial court was required to judicially notice the existence of the\n\nnews articles and the state memorandum. (Evid. Code, § 453.) We are therefore required\n\nto do so as well. (Evid. Code, § 459, subd. (a).)\n\n       Inewsource's second request for judicial notice in the trial court covered more than\n\n30 documents. The existence of the news stories and Internet Web pages referenced in\n\nthe request will be judicially noticed for the reasons we have already stated.5 (Evid.\n\nCode, §§ 452, subds. (g) & (h); 453, 459, subd. (a); see Ragland, supra, 209 Cal.App.4th\n\nat p. 193.) Similarly, the existence of the District correspondence, District e-mails, the\n\nDistrict's annual report, a third-party audit commissioned by the District, and other\n\nDistrict documents referenced in the request will be judicially noticed. (Evid. Code,\n\n\n\n5       We will not take judicial notice of the Wikipedia page entitled \"No bid contract\"\non the grounds the trial court was not required to judicially notice it because it had no\nrelevance to the disposition of inewsource's petition.

The referenced portions of the Public Contract Code, sections\n\n100 through 102, are subject to mandatory judicial notice. (Evid. Code, §§ 451, subd.\n\n(a); 459, subd. (a).) Again, we find that these matters have at least some relevance to the\n\nissues before the court. We will not take judicial notice of the existence or contents of\n\nthe inewsource correspondence referenced in the request because they are not judicially\n\nnoticeable as a fact or proposition in common knowledge or not reasonably subject to\n\ndispute. (See Evid. Code, § 452, subds. (g) & (h).) We also will not take judicial notice\n\nof District documents and correspondence filed in inewsource's exhibit appendix to its\n\ntrial court writ petition. Those documents are already part of the record before this court,\n\nand judicial notice is unnecessary. Any objections made in the trial court have not been\n\nadequately urged on appeal and supported by reasoned argument and authority. They are\n\ntherefore waived. (See Cahill v. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">939</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 956.)\n\n       Inewsource's request for judicial notice in this court covers the District's business\n\ncase justification for the Program, other District documents and correspondence, an\n\nInternet Web page published by the California Department of Human Resources, two\n\nCalifornia Regional Water Quality Board orders, portions of a Federal Transit\n\nAdministration review of the District, and various inewsource news articles and Internet\n\nWeb pages. Inewsource contends judicial notice of these documents is warranted under\n\nEvidence Code section 452. Inewsource did not seek judicial notice of these documents\n\n                                              9\n\fin the trial court, claiming without explanation that \"page constraints\" prevented it from\n\ndoing so. To the extent these documents are already part of the record, e.g., in\n\ninewsource's exhibit appendix, judicial notice is unnecessary as we have explained. As to\n\ndocuments not already part of the record, we decline to take judicial notice of these\n\ndocuments in these proceedings because inewsource did not request judicial notice in the\n\ntrial court.

They contain\n\ninformation specific to individual participants, and the competency evaluations in those\n\nrecords reflect information that is traditionally contained in personnel files (e.g.,\n\nperformance reviews). (See ibid.; Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 819; see also\n\nMilner v. Department of Navy (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">562</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> [\" '[T]he common and congressional\n\nmeaning of . . . \"personnel file\" ' is the file 'showing, for example, where [an employee]\n\nwas born, the names of his parents, where he has lived from time to time, his . . . school\n\nrecords, results of examinations, [and] evaluations of his work performance.' \"].) The\n\ntalent management summary presents a closer question. The information in that record\n\nreflects individual, albeit anonymous, information and evaluations. For purposes of our\n\ndiscussion, we will accept the District's contention that the talent management summary,\n\ntoo, is a personnel or similar file.\n\n       Next we evaluate the privacy interests implicated by the Rady documents.\n\n(Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 818.) \"Public employees have a legally protected\n\ninterest in their personnel files.\" (BRV, supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at p. 756.) The strength\n\nof that interest, however, will vary depending on the information at issue. Again, we find\n\nit useful to distinguish the participant reports and participant evaluation, on one hand,\n\nfrom the talent management summary, on the other.\n\n       The participant reports and participant evaluation reflect individualized\n\nassessments of each participant. In the participant reports, these assessments include\n\nwritten narratives describing the participant's personality traits, work ethic, and similar\n\nqualities. In the participant evaluation, the assessments are distilled into a rating for each\n\n                                              14\n\fassessed category. Based on this content, we conclude that disclosure of the participant\n\nreports and participant evaluation in the Rady documents \"would 'compromise substantial\n\nprivacy interests.' \" (Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 820 [disclosure of an\n\nemployee's \"personal performance goals\"].) \"[T]he 'disclosure of negative comments or\n\ninformation about an employee on these subjects . . . could be quite embarrassing and\n\npainful to the employee. While many of the comments and much of the information are\n\nfavorable or neutral, [the relevant exemption] was designed to protect individuals from a\n\nwide range of embarrassing disclosures, not just the disclosure of derogatory information.\n\nIndeed, the disclosure of favorable information could place the employee in a very\n\nembarrassing position with other, possibly jealous, employees.' \" (Ibid.)\n\n       The talent management summary presents no similar danger of embarrassment or\n\npain to individual employees. While the talent management summary provides\n\ninformation about the participants as a whole (e.g., whether most participants performed\n\nwell in a particular category), the information cannot be linked to any individual\n\nparticipant. Nor does the talent management summary disclose whether any individual\n\nparticipant did well in one category and worse in another category; the ratings within\n\neach category are reordered from best to worst. The privacy interest in such collective\n\nassessments, while perhaps not de minimus, is nonetheless severely attenuated.\n\n       Our final step is balancing the privacy interests implicated by the Rady documents\n\nagainst any public interest in their disclosure. We \"must determine whether the potential\n\nharm to privacy interests from disclosure outweighs the public interest in disclosure.\"\n\n(Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 818.) Fundamentally, the strength of the public\n\n                                            15\n\finterest depends on \" 'the extent to which disclosure of the requested item of information\n\nwill shed light on the public agency's performance of its duty.' \" (Id. at p. 820.) \"While,\n\nas a threshold matter, the records must pertain to the conduct of the people's business, '\n\n\"[t]he weight of that interest is proportionate to the gravity of the governmental tasks\n\nsought to be illuminated and the directness with which the disclosure will serve to\n\nilluminate.\" ' \" (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 242; see Connell v. Superior Court\n\n(1997) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2251458\"><a href=\"/opinion/2251458/connell-v-superior-court-of-sacramento-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The public therefore has an interest in\n\nknowing what was purchased with those funds, whether the Program was worth what the\n\nDistrict spent, and whether the Program provided utility to the District. (See\n\nInternational Federation, supra, 42 Cal.4th at p. 333 [finding a \"strong public interest in\n\nknowing how the government spends its money\"].) The public also has an interest in\n\nknowing how the District identifies professional development opportunities and evaluates\n\nits senior staff, which were in part purposes of the Program. The Rady documents would\n\nplainly shed light on the District's activities in these ways.\n\n       The Rady documents also shed light on the District's ability to perform its primary\n\nduty: developing and operating mass transit systems in San Diego County. \"[P]ublic\n\naccess makes it possible for members of the public ' \"to expose corruption, incompetence,\n\ninefficiency, prejudice, and favoritism.\" ' \" (International Federation, supra, 42 Cal.4th\n\nat p. 333.) The Program was designed to assess the competence of the District's senior\n\nmanagers in various categories (including \"the organization's key competencies \") and\n\n                                              16\n\fidentify development opportunities. The Rady documents reflect the results of that\n\nassessment, including whether the individual participants performed well on the\n\nProgram's various measures of managerial competency. While the Program focused on\n\nthe competence of individual managers, the District's ability to perform its duty depends\n\non the abilities of the individuals within the District's organization to act competently.\n\n(See BRV, supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at p. 757 [\"Without doubt, the public has a significant\n\ninterest in the professional competence and conduct of a school district superintendent\n\nand high school principal.\"].) The Rady documents are therefore relevant to an important\n\npublic interest.\n\n       Although the Rady documents are somewhat abstracted from the specific details\n\nof the participants' everyday work, as the District repeatedly points out, the Rady\n\ndocuments nonetheless provide valuable insight into the strengths and weaknesses of the\n\nparticipating managers in their senior roles at the District—and the strengths and\n\nweaknesses of the management team as a whole. Indeed, those are two of the main\n\npurposes of the Program as set out in its scope of work.8\n\n\n\n8       Contrary to inewsource's contention, the Rady documents do not involve an\ninquiry into instances of District wrongdoing, well-founded or otherwise. Instead, as we\nhave discussed, they represent the evaluation of the participating managers in various\ngeneral categories of managerial competency. Although the Rady documents may have\nsome relevance to inewsource's allegations of wrongdoing or malfeasance, because they\nrelate generally to the ability of the participating mangers to perform in their positions,\nthere is no heightened public interest based on that tenuous connection. The standard for\ndisclosure articulated by American Federation of State etc. Employees v. Regents of the\nUniversity of California (1978) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">913</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> is therefore inapplicable. \"[That] case\nprovides that where complaints of a public employee's wrongdoing and resulting\ndisciplinary investigation reveal allegations of a substantial nature, as distinct from\n                                             17\n\f       The participant evaluation and talent management summary, by presenting the\n\nratings of the participant group as a whole, bear most directly on the District's\n\ncompetence to perform its public duties. (See LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 243\n\n[\"There can be little doubt that a public interest exists in 'teacher AGT scores' [i.e.,\n\nteaching achievement metrics] as a whole.\"].) The additional information in the\n\nparticipant reports, however, is only indirectly relevant to the operations of the District.\n\nMuch of the information in the participant reports is tailored to the individual traits and\n\npersonalities of the participants. While the public has some interest in knowing and\n\nevaluating the traits and personalities of senior managers at a public agency, based on our\n\nreview most of the information in the participant reports would be primarily useful only\n\nto the individual participants. The public's ability to understand more about the District\n\nbased on this additional information would be low.\n\n       Balancing the public and private interests, we conclude that the participant reports\n\nand participant evaluation fall within the PRA's personnel records exception. (See\n\n§ 6254, subd. (c).) These documents reflect the ratings and assessments of each\n\nparticipant, identified by name, which engenders a strong privacy interest in their\n\nnondisclosure. They are akin to performance evaluations, which implicate substantial\n\n\n\n\nbaseless or trivial, and there is reasonable cause to believe the complaint is well founded,\npublic employee privacy must give way to the public's right to know.\" (Bakersfield City\nSchool Dist. v. Superior Court (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2299322\"><a href=\"/opinion/2299322/bakersfield-school-dist-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1041</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1046.) The circumstances\nhere are readily distinguishable. (See LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 253 [\"That is\na far cry from the instant case, where there is no specific incident to investigate, just the\nongoing (albeit important) work of teachers doing their jobs.\"].)\n                                              18\n\fprivacy interests.9 As to these documents, the strong interest in protecting the privacy of\n\nthe individual participants outweighs the public interest in uncovering potential\n\nincompetence. (See Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 822 [holding that a public\n\nemployee's \"privacy interest in her entire evaluation process including her personal\n\nperformance goals outweighs the public's minimal interest in the matter\"].)\n\n       Inewsource points out that a public official generally has \"a significantly reduced\n\nexpectation of privacy in matters of his public employment.\" (BRV, supra, 143\n\nCal.App.4th at p. 758.) While that principle is correct as a general matter, there are\n\nspecific instances in which a public official's privacy interests will outweigh the public\n\ninterest in disclosure. (See, e.g., Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 822.) \"[E]ven\n\ngovernment employees have privacy rights and ' \"on certain occasions, the public's right\n\nto disclosure must yield to the privacy rights of governmental agents.\" ' [Citation.]\n\n'[O]ne does not lose his right to privacy upon accepting public employment . . . .' \"\n\n(LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 241, fn. 13.) Contrary to inewsource's claim, even\n\nrecords related to public business may be withheld under an applicable exemption; that is\n\nthe purpose of the exemptions. If a record is purely personal and unrelated to public\n\n\n\n\n9      The Brown Act, for example, \"expressly authorizes a public agency to meet in\nclosed session regarding the consideration of 'the appointment, employment, evaluation\nof performance, discipline, or dismissal of a public employee.' (Gov. Code, § 54957,\nsubd. (b)(1).)\" (Versaci, supra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 821; see International Federation,\nsupra, 42 Cal.4th at pp. 333-334.) \"The 'underlying purposes of the \"personnel\nexception\" are to protect the employee from public embarrassment and to permit free and\ncandid discussions of personnel matters by a local governmental body.' \" (Versaci,\nsupra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 821.)\n                                             19\n\fbusiness, it is not subject to the PRA at all. (See § 6252, subd. (e); see also San Gabriel\n\nTribune, supra, 143 Cal.App.3d at p. 774.)10\n\n       Inewsource proposes, as an alternative, that the names of the participating\n\nindividuals be redacted from the Rady documents to mitigate any privacy concerns. (See\n\nCBS, Inc. v. Block, supra, 42 Cal.3d at p. 653 [\"The fact that parts of a requested\n\ndocument fall within the terms of an exemption does not justify withholding the entire\n\ndocument.\"].) We disagree. Given the specificity with which the participant reports and,\n\nto some extent, the participant evaluation discuss the competencies, traits, and\n\npersonalities of the participating managers, there is a substantial risk that the participating\n\nmanagers could be identified and linked to their individual ratings and reports. Redacting\n\nthe names of the individual managers would therefore have little effect on the privacy\n\nrights implicated by these documents.\n\n\n\n10      Inewsource also relies on an opinion of the Attorney General concerning the\ndisclosure of application and personnel files of nautical pilots. (53 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen.\n136 (1970).) In that opinion the Attorney General noted, as we do here, that portions of a\npersonnel file may be sufficiently confidential to warrant exemption under the PRA: \"As\nthe information bears more remotely on the question of qualifications or performance,\nand as it by its personal nature becomes more likely to be regarded as intrusive or\nembarrassing by its disclosure, the probability of its confidential nature increases.\" (53\nOps.Cal.Atty.Gen, supra, at pp. 146-147.) The Attorney General therefore advised that\n\"section 6254[, subdivision ](c) preserves the confidentiality of only a limited portion of\nthe material found in a personnel file. For this reason, it is appropriate to segregate the\nconfidential matters from the remainder of such a file.\" (53 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen., supra, at\npp. 147-148.) The Attorney General did not advise disclosing the entirety of any\npersonnel file, as inewsource implies. Moreover, any analogy between the personnel\nfiles at issue in the Attorney General's opinion and the Rady documents is imperfect\nbecause the pilots were not employees of the Board of Pilot Commissioners. (See id. at\np. 144.) Their personnel files therefore appear to have contained information that would\nnot be comparable to the Rady documents.\n                                              20\n\f       As to the talent management summary, however, the absence of personally\n\nidentifying information tips the balance in favor of disclosure. As we have explained, the\n\nprivacy interest implicated by this record is significantly attenuated. Although it appears\n\nprobable the participating employees were told that this record, too, would be kept\n\nconfidential, the promise of confidentiality is not determinative in weighing the public\n\nand private interests. (See BRV, supra, 143 Cal.App.4th at pp. 748-749, 759; Versaci,\n\nsupra, 127 Cal.App.4th at p. 821; San Gabriel Tribune, supra, 143 Cal.App.3d at p. 774.)\n\nThe ratings contained in the talent management summary cannot be matched to any\n\nindividual participant. The ratings do provide significant information, however, that\n\nbears on the competency of the District's participating senior managers across various\n\ncategories (including \"the organization's key competencies\"). The public interest\n\ntherefore remains strong. (See LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 243; BRV, supra,\n\n143 Cal.App.4th at p. 757.) Because disclosure of the talent management summary\n\nwould not \"constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,\" we conclude it is not\n\nexempt from disclosure under section 6254, subdivision (c).\n\n                                            IV\n\n       The District also contends the \"catch-all\" exemption in section 6255 of the PRA\n\napplies to the Rady documents. Under that exemption, an agency may withhold a public\n\nrecord from disclosure by showing \"that on the facts of the particular case the public\n\ninterest served by not disclosing the record clearly outweighs the public interest served\n\nby disclosure of the record.\" (§ 6255, subd. (a).) \"Records 'found to be nonexempt under\n\nsection 6254 . . . can still be withheld under section 6255.' \" (LAUSD, supra, 228\n\n                                            21\n\fCal.App.4th at p. 254.) However, because we have concluded that a portion of the Rady\n\ndocuments, the participant reports and the participant evaluation, are exempt under\n\nsection 6254, subdivision (c), we need not consider whether they would additionally be\n\nexempt under section 6255. (See ibid.) Our analysis under the \"catch-all\" exemption\n\nwill therefore be limited to the talent management summary.\n\n       \"The catch-all exemption 'contemplates a case-by-case balancing process, with the\n\nburden of proof on the proponent of nondisclosure to demonstrate a clear overbalance on\n\nthe side of confidentiality.' [Citation.] Where the public interest in disclosure of the\n\nrecords is not outweighed by the public interest in nondisclosure, courts will direct the\n\ngovernment to disclose the requested information. [Citation.] Conversely, when the\n\npublic interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public interest in disclosure, refusal\n\nto release records will be upheld.\" (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 239-240.)\n\n\"Under section 6255, the court balances the public interest in disclosure against the\n\npublic interest in nondisclosure.\" (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 240.) We have\n\nalready considered the public interest in the disclosure of the talent management\n\nsummary in the previous part. We will therefore turn to the public interest in\n\nnondisclosure.\n\n       The District asserts that \"releasing the Rady documents would be detrimental to\n\nthe functioning of [the District] and its ability to carry out its duties to the public.\"\n\nRelying on LAUSD, the District claims disclosure would negatively affect management\n\nemployees at the District by generating \"unhealthy comparisons among\" the employees,\n\nleading to \"discord in the workplace.\" (See LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at pp. 250-\n\n                                               22\n\f251.) In LAUSD, however, the government had already released information that was at\n\nleast as detailed as the talent management summary, including anonymous ratings of each\n\nteacher. (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 247.) The concerns articulated in\n\nLAUSD related to the disclosure of the identities of the public employees at issue, which\n\nis not at issue in the talent management summary. (See id. at p. 245.)\n\n       The District's concerns may have some validity with respect to the participant\n\nreports and the participant evaluations, in which the participants and their corresponding\n\nratings are identified. As to the talent management summary, however, we find the\n\nDistrict's concerns to be largely unfounded because no individual participants are\n\nidentified. While the talent management summary reflects how the 13 participants were\n\nrated in each category, the ratings cannot be linked to any individual participant. In the\n\nabsence of any specific evidence to the contrary (and the District provides none), we\n\nbelieve any \"unhealthy comparisons\" or \"discord in the workplace\" generated by the\n\ndisclosure of the talent management summary would be minimal. While some\n\nsubordinate employees may notice the ratings of their superiors as a group, we believe\n\nthe subordinates likely already understand their superiors' strengths and weaknesses in far\n\nmore detail than the talent management summary provides. And, while some participants\n\nin the Program may experience embarrassment at the prospect of being included in a\n\ngroup with a given set of scores, the public interest in avoiding such embarrassment is\n\nalso minimal.\n\n       \"Courts must be alert to contentions by government entities that exaggerate the\n\ninterest in nondisclosure, lest they be used as a pretext for keeping information secret for\n\n                                             23\n\fimproper reasons, such as to avoid embarrassment over mistakes, incompetence, or\n\nwrongdoing. After all, to some extent any request for disclosure of public records will\n\nplace a burden on government. Both the voters and their elected officials have\n\nestablished the general policy that this burden is well worth bearing in order to keep\n\ndemocracy vital. If the catchall provision of the [PRA] becomes a loophole used to\n\nimproperly keep public records from the people, the important purposes of the [PRA]\n\nwould be undermined.\" (LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 250.)\n\n       Balancing the strong public interest in disclosure of the talent management\n\nsummary against the minimal public interest in its nondisclosure, we conclude the\n\nDistrict has not shown the public interest in nondisclosure clearly outweighs the public\n\ninterest in disclosure. (See § 6255, subd. (a).) \" 'Since there is a strong public interest in\n\ndisclosure, the balance must tip in favor of access' to the information.\" (Sacramento\n\nCounty Employees' Retirement System v. Superior Court (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">440</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n472.) The \"catch-all\" exemption under section 6255 does not apply to the talent\n\nmanagement summary.11\n\n\n\n\n11     Our conclusion that the talent management summary must be disclosed under the\nPRA reinforces our determination that the participant reports and participant evaluation\nshould not be disclosed. While the information contained in each is not exactly the same,\nthe bulk of the information that would allow the public to assess the competency of the\nDistrict's senior managers (at least according to the Program) is set forth in the talent\nmanagement summary. (See LAUSD, supra, 228 Cal.App.4th at p. 242 [\"Where a\nrequester has an alternative, less intrusive, means of obtaining the information sought, the\npublic interest in disclosure is minimal.\"].)\n                                              24\n\f                                       DISPOSITION\n\n       Let a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing the superior court to vacate its\n\norder denying inewsource's petition and to enter a new order granting inewsource's\n\npetition in part as to the talent management summary, which is reflected on the second\n\npage of the Rady documents as submitted to this court.
