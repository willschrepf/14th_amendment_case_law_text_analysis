Canales,\r\nhosted a daily radio show called “Buenos Dias El Salvador.”  In 2006, Villatoro\r\noffered to broadcast advertisements on the radio show for an El Salvadoran\r\nfestival organized by the Funeses.  A dispute arose when Villatoro and the\r\nFuneses could not agree on the rate for these advertisements.  Villatoro\r\nsubsequently told the Funeses he would organize an El Salvadoran festival to be\r\nheld on the same day as the Funeses’ festival.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The Funeses filed assumed name certificates with the\r\ncounty clerk’s office for “Festival Guanaco,” “Buenos Dias El Salvador,” and\r\n“Festival Salvadoreno.”  The Funeses also hired an attorney, who sent a\r\ncease-and-desist letter to Villatoro.  In the letter, the Funeses advised\r\nVillatoro that they had filed assumed name certificates for “three trade names;”\r\ndemanded that Villatoro refrain from using these registered names; and\r\nthreatened to sue Villatoro if he failed to comply with the Funeses’ demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro and Canales filed separate but identical\r\nsuits against the Funeses on July 28, 2006.  They sought a declaration that the\r\nnames registered by the Funeses were trade names belonging to Villatoro and\r\nCanales; they also alleged claims for libel and tortious interference with\r\nprospective and existing contractual relations.  The Funeses filed a general\r\ndenial and a counterclaim for sanctions on September 8, 2006.  The trial court\r\nsent notices of intent to dismiss for want of prosecution on December 3, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro and Canales each filed motions to retain on\r\nJanuary 14, 2009.  Villatoro and Canales filed a motion to consolidate the two\r\nsuits on January 23, 2009 and asked the trial court to transfer Villatoro’s\r\nsuit from the 434th District Court to the 400th District Court.  The trial\r\ncourt granted the motion to consolidate on January 23, 2009. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro and Canales filed their second amended\r\npetition on April 20, 2009.  They alleged claims for libel, tortious interference\r\nwith prospective and existing contractual relations, and business\r\ndisparagement; they also sought a declaration that the names registered by the\r\nFuneses were in fact trade names belonging to Villatoro and Canales.  The\r\nFuneses filed a supplemental counterclaim on May 11, 2009, seeking a\r\ndeclaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting Villatoro and Canales from\r\nusing the Funeses’ registered names.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">A three-day jury trial was held on October 20, 2009. \r\nThe Funeses and Villatoro were present at trial; Canales was not present but\r\nwas represented by the same attorneys who represented Villatoro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\" align=\"center\"><b>Background</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro moved from El Salvador to the United States\r\nin 2001; he was employed by a computer company called Comtech Systems as a\r\ntechnology manager and store manager.  In January 2004, Villatoro started\r\nhosting a one-hour Spanish-language radio show about computers called “El Mundo\r\nde los Computadoras.”  The radio show aired Sundays on Houston’s 920 AM station. \r\nComtech paid the radio station for the show’s airtime and sold advertising to\r\npay for the airtime.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">A few months later in March 2004, Villatoro began\r\nhosting two hours on the radio on Sundays.  One hour was devoted to computer\r\ntips, and one hour was devoted to a radio show Villatoro called “Buenos Dias,\r\nEl Salvador.”  Because of a lack of interest in the computer show, Villatoro started\r\ndevoting the two-hour airtime entirely to hosting the “Buenos Dias, El Salvador”\r\nradio show.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span> \r\nCanales co-hosted the show.  Villatoro continued working for Comtech, which continued\r\npaying for the show’s airtime and selling advertising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro and Canales began publishing a magazine\r\ncalled “Buenos Dias, El Salvador La Revista”<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span>\r\nin February 2006.  Villatoro launched the magazine to promote the radio show\r\nand to “help the customers that was [sic] advertising on the show, so they can\r\n[sic] have an extra advertising. . . .  Basically, it was all the people that\r\nwas [sic] advertising on the radio, they were getting it as a package with the\r\nmagazine.”  The magazine issues admitted into evidence contained editorials,\r\narticles relating to El Salvador and its culture, and advertising for different\r\nbusinesses including the radio show.  Villatoro sold subscriptions to the\r\nmagazine in order to cover the cost; he claimed to have circulated the magazine\r\nin all Central American businesses in Harris County and six other counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In May 2006, the radio station’s owner approached\r\nVillatoro to host a daily two-hour morning show Monday through Friday.  After a\r\nmonth, the show expanded to a three-hour daily show from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.  The\r\nshow reached fifteen to twenty thousand listeners in nine counties,<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[3]</span></span></span>\r\nand it was also streamed live over the Internet in El Salvador.  Villatoro\r\ncontinued to publish the magazine and work for Comtech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In July 2006, Villatoro offered to broadcast advertisements\r\non the radio show for an El Salvadoran festival organized by the Funeses.  Villatoro\r\ntestified that he met the Funeses in 2004 at one of their restaurants and had once\r\nbefore advertised their festival in 2005.  Villatoro testified that Mauricio\r\nFunes told him in July 2006 to start broadcasting advertisements for the\r\nfestival on the radio show.  According to Villatoro, Ursula Funes told\r\nVillatoro after the advertisements began to run that she could only pay $300 for\r\nthe advertising because the Funeses had already spent their money advertising\r\non another radio show on the same radio station.  Villatoro refused to accept\r\n$300 and contended that the advertising he already had provided was worth\r\n$1,500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The Funeses and Villatoro offered conflicting\r\ntestimony about how the advertising dispute ensued.  Mauricio testified that\r\nVillatoro asked him if he would like to advertise on Villatoro’s radio show. \r\nMauricio testified that he did not know that Villatoro had a show and asked\r\nVillatoro to submit a proposal.  Mauricio testified that Villatoro brought a\r\nproposal to one of the Funeses’ restaurants around July 10, 2006, but the\r\nFuneses rejected Villatoro’s proposal because they preferred advertising their\r\nfestival on a different radio show with a well-known radio host.  Mauricio\r\nstated that he offered to spend $600 advertising with Villatoro instead of $2,000\r\nVillatoro had proposed.  According to Mauricio, Villatoro became upset and\r\nleft.  Mauricio testified that Villatoro later called him to tell him that he\r\nwould also organize an El Salvadoran festival on the same day the Funeses had\r\nscheduled their festival to prove that his show was popular with the El\r\nSalvadoran community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The Funeses introduced Villatoro’s alleged proposal\r\ninto evidence as Defendants’ Exhibit Two.  The advertising proposal was entitled,\r\n“Tony Villatoro y su Show;” nothing on the proposal referred to the radio show\r\n“Buenos Dias, El Salvador.”  The proposal listed different advertising packages\r\nas an “inauguration promotion” during the month of May.  Mauricio testified\r\nthat Villatoro told him Villatoro “just started a show.”  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro denied presenting the proposal to the\r\nFuneses in July 2006.  He testified that Defendants’ Exhibit Two was a proposal\r\nhe created in 2008 for the Funeses after he changed the name of the radio show\r\nfrom “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” to “El Show de la Tony Villatoro and Junior\r\nCanales.”  Villatoro claimed that the Funeses asked for an advertising quote in\r\n2008 through an unnamed individual, and that he created the proposal in\r\nresponse to that request.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">When the Funeses and Villatoro could not resolve\r\ntheir advertising dispute, the Funeses filed assumed name certificates with the\r\nHarris County Clerk’s Office on July 17, 2006 for “Buenos Dias El Salvador,”\r\n“Festival Guanaco,” and “Festival Salvadoreno.”  The Funeses testified that they\r\nfelt threatened by Villatoro’s announcement that he would also organize an El\r\nSalvadoran festival.  Although the Funeses’ annual festival is called “El\r\nPupusaton,” the Funeses testified that they used El Salvadoran “slogans” such\r\nas “Good morning, El Salvador” and “Guanaco, welcome” during their festivals\r\nand wanted to ensure that these “slogans” were protected.  The Funeses sent a\r\ncease-and-desist letter to Villatoro on July 24, 2006, advising Villatoro that\r\nthey had filed assumed name certificates for “three trade names,” demanding\r\nthat Villatoro refrain from using these registered names, and threatening to\r\nsue Villatoro if he failed to comply with their demands.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro testified that he changed the name of his\r\nshow “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” to “Tony Villatoro Show”<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span>\r\nafter receiving the Funeses’ cease-and-desist letter “to prevent a future\r\nproblem.”  He acknowledged scheduling his El Salvadoran festival named\r\n“Festival Guanaco” on August 13, 2006 — the same day the Funeses scheduled\r\ntheir festival “El Pupusaton.”  Villatoro claimed that he started organizing his\r\nFestival Guanaco in June 2006; started advertising for his festival in July;\r\nand pre-paid a band from El Salvador to perform at his festival on July 13,\r\n2006.  The Funeses held their festival “El Pupusaton” in the Nassau Bay area and\r\nVillatoro held his festival in the Sharpstown area on August 13, 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro testified that he encountered many\r\ndifficulties after changing the name of the radio show in July 2006.  He stated\r\nthat “the Salvadoran community was mad at [him] because they said [he] was not\r\nproud of being a Salvadoran,” causing loss of advertising business.  Villatoro\r\ntestified that “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” had a value in the radio business\r\nbecause he had promoted the name for a long time; the name of the show was a\r\nmore generic name that “got a lot more coverage.”  He testified that, after\r\nchanging the name of the show, he lost at least $20,000 in 2006 and $40,000 in\r\n2007.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro also stopped publishing the magazine\r\nbecause it was tied to the “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” radio show.  According to\r\nVillatoro, after the name change, people looked at the magazine as a business that\r\nwas different from the radio show and the magazine lost its value.  Villatoro\r\nalso testified that he encountered difficulty selling advertising because the\r\nFuneses told the community that the names “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” and\r\n“Festival Guanaco” belonged to the Funeses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The radio show started making a profit again in 2008. \r\nVillatoro created a marketing agency in July 2008 called TV Promotion and\r\nMarketing that handled all advertising for the radio show; Comtech no longer handled\r\nthe advertising or paid the radio station for airtime.  Villatoro testified\r\nthat he made a profit through his company TV Promotion and Marketing in 2008\r\nbecause he no longer worked for Comtech.  Villatoro organized his second El\r\nSalvadoran festival, called “Festival Guanaco 2009,” on April 19, 2009, and\r\nmade a $5,000 profit.  After calling the radio show “El Show de la Tony\r\nVillatoro and Junior Canales” for almost three years, Villatoro changed the\r\nname of the radio show to “Los Hijos de la Madrugada” in July 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">At the conclusion of Villatoro’s case, the Funeses\r\nmoved for directed verdict against Villatoro and Canales.  The trial court\r\ngranted the Funeses’ motion only as to Canales.  After both parties rested, the\r\ntrial court granted Villatoro’s motion for directed verdict against the Funeses\r\non their claims.  Villatoro and the Funeses stipulated that “Buenos Dias, El\r\nSalvador” and “Festival Guanaco” are trade names; this stipulation is reflected\r\nin the jury charge.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The jury returned a verdict finding that (1) the\r\ntrade names “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” and “Festival Guanaco” belong to\r\nVillatoro and do not belong to the Funeses; (2) the Funeses intentionally\r\ninterfered with Villatoro’s “existing or prospective contractual or business\r\nrelations;” and (3) Villatoro lost profits in the amount of $10,000 as a result\r\nof the Funeses’ interference.  The jury also awarded $22,000 in trial\r\nattorney’s fees and $3,000 for post-judgment attorney’s fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The trial court signed a final judgment on October\r\n30, 2009.  The Funeses filed (1) a combined motion for judgment notwithstanding\r\nthe verdict and for new trial; (2) objections and exceptions to the final\r\njudgment; and (3) a motion to segregate attorney’s fees on November 20, 2009. \r\nVillatoro responded to the Funeses’ motions and objections on November 23,\r\n2009.  The trial court denied the Funeses’ requests and signed orders denying\r\nthe Funeses’ motions and objections on November 23, 2009.  The Funeses timely\r\nfiled their notice of appeal on November 30, 2009.  Villatoro timely filed his\r\nnotice of appeal on January 28, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\" align=\"center\"><b>Analysis</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>I.<span>                  \r\n</span></b><b>Sufficiency of the Evidence </b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The Funeses challenge the sufficiency of the evidence\r\nto support the jury’s findings in their first four issues on appeal.  In their\r\nfirst and second issues, the Funeses contend the evidence is legally and\r\nfactually insufficient to support the jury’s finding that the trade names\r\n“Buenos Dias, El Salvador” and “Festival Guanaco” belong to Villatoro.  In\r\ntheir third issue, the Funeses argue the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding that they intentionally interfered\r\nwith Villatoro’s existing or prospective contracts or business relations.  In\r\ntheir fourth issue, the Funeses assert the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support the jury’s lost profits finding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>A.</b>        <b>Standard\r\nof Review</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Legal insufficiency challenges may be sustained only\r\nwhen the record discloses one of the following situations: (a) a complete\r\nabsence of evidence of a vital fact; (b) the court is barred by rules of law or\r\nof evidence from giving weight to the only evidence offered to prove a vital\r\nfact; (c) the evidence offered to prove a vital fact is no more than a mere\r\nscintilla; or (d) the evidence establishes conclusively the opposite of the\r\nvital fact. <i>City of Keller v. Wilson</i>, 168 S.W.3d 802, 810 (Tex. 2005) (citing\r\nRobert W. Calvert<span>, </span><i>“No\r\nEvidence” and “Insufficient Evidence” Points of Error</i>, 38 Tex. L. Rev. 361,\r\n362–63 (1960)).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We must consider evidence in the light most favorable\r\nto the verdict and indulge every reasonable inference that would support it.  <i>Id</i>.\r\nat 822.  If the evidence allows only one inference, neither jurors nor the\r\nreviewing court may disregard that evidence.  <i>Id</i>. “The traditional scope\r\nof review does not disregard contrary evidence in every no evidence review if\r\nthere is no favorable evidence (situation (a) above), or if contrary evidence\r\nrenders supporting evidence incompetent (situation (b) above) or conclusively\r\nestablishes the opposite (situation (d) above).”  <i>Id</i>. at 810–11.  If the\r\nevidence at trial would enable reasonable and fair-minded people to differ in\r\ntheir conclusions, then jurors must be allowed to do so.  <i>Id</i>. at 822.  Accordingly,\r\nthe ultimate test for legal sufficiency always must focus on whether the\r\nevidence would enable reasonable and fair-minded jurors to reach the verdict\r\nunder review.  <i>Id</i>. at 827.  Legal sufficiency review in the proper light\r\nmust credit favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could do so, and must\r\ndisregard contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not do so.  <i>Id</i>.\r\n The reviewing court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the trier of\r\nfact if the evidence falls within this zone of reasonable disagreement.  <i>Id</i>.\r\nat 822.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In reviewing factual sufficiency, we must consider\r\nand weigh all the evidence. <i>Golden Eagle Archery, Inc. v. Jackson</i>, 116\r\nS.W.3d 757, 761 (Tex. 2003).  We can set aside a verdict only if the evidence\r\nis so weak or if the finding is so against the great weight and preponderance\r\nof the evidence that it is clearly wrong and manifestly unjust. <i>Id</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>B.</b>        <b>“Buenos\r\nDias, El Salvador”</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>            </b>In their\r\nfirst issue, the Funeses contend that the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding that the trade name ‘“Buenos Dias El\r\nSalvador’ is a protectable trade name of Villatoro’s radio show.”  First, the\r\nFuneses argue that the title of a radio show is not a trade name but a service\r\nmark.  In that regard, the Funeses ask this court to determine whether “Buenos\r\nDias, El Salvador” is a trade name despite the parties’ trial stipulation to that\r\neffect.  Second, the Funeses argue that there is insufficient evidence to support\r\nthe jury’s finding that the trade name “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” belongs to\r\nVillatoro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We reject the Funeses’ contention that this court\r\nshould determine whether “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” is a trade name despite the\r\nparties’ trial stipulation to that effect.  In the charge, the jury was\r\ninstructed as follows: “The parties have stipulated that Festival Guanaco and\r\nBuenos Dias El Salvador are trade names.”  No party objected to this\r\ninstruction.  Absent an objection, the parties are bound by the statements of\r\nlaw contained in the submitted jury charge, even if the statements of law are\r\nerroneous.  <i>See L &amp; F Distribs. v. Cruz</i>, 941 S.W.2d 274, 279 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Corpus Christi 1996, writ denied) (“When the charge misinforms the jury about\r\nthe substantive law, the parties must either object to the improper submission\r\nor accept the wording . . . as submitted.”)<i> </i>(citing <i>Allen v.

Zapata Trading Int’l, Inc.</i>,\r\n841 S.W.2d 45, 48 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1992, no writ).  “Evidence\r\nsuch as amount and manner of advertising, volume of sales, and length and\r\nmanner of use may constitute circumstantial evidence relevant to the issue of\r\nsecondary meaning.”  <i>Id</i>.  “These factors combined may prove secondary\r\nmeaning; together they can establish the necessary link in the minds of\r\nconsumers between product and source.”  <i>Id</i>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The evidence here shows that Villatoro co-hosted the\r\nradio show “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” with Canales for about 26 months before\r\nchanging the show’s name in response to the Funeses’ July 24, 2006\r\ncease-and-desist letter.  In January 2004, Villatoro started hosting an hourly\r\ncomputer-themed radio show for his employer Comtech on Sundays in Spanish.  In\r\nMarch or April 2004, Villatoro started hosting the “Buenos Dias, El Salvador”\r\nradio show for another hour following the computer-themed radio show.  Sometime\r\nbefore May 2006, the radio show “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” expanded to two\r\nhours on Sundays because of a lack of interest in the computer-themed show.  In\r\nMay 2006, the radio show changed to a daily two-hour and, a month later, to a daily\r\nthree-hour weekday morning show.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Hosting a one or two-hour radio show under the name\r\n“Buenos Dias, El Salvador” once a week for 23 months, and then a daily\r\nthree-hour show for three months, may qualify as evidence of length of use; it\r\ndoes not qualify as extensive use of the name “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” so as\r\nto support secondary meaning.<i>  See id</i>. (evidence of long and extensive\r\nuse of a name has been held sufficient to prove a trade name has acquired\r\nsecondary meaning) (citing <i>Douglas v. Walker</i>, 707 S.W.2d 733, 734 (Tex.\r\nApp.—Beaumont 1986, no writ)).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Even if this evidence did reach the level of\r\nextensive use, evidence of other supporting factors is missing.  Villatoro testified\r\nthat the Hispanic community is his audience; he testified that fifteen to\r\ntwenty thousand people listened to his show daily in eight counties and parts\r\nof Louisiana, and that the show is also streamed live via the internet in El\r\nSalvador.  However, Villatoro did not present any evidence regarding his\r\nlistenership during the 23 months he was hosting his two-hour show on Sundays. \r\nVillatoro also did not present any data regarding how many potential listeners\r\nlive in the very large and mostly densely populated area the radio show can be\r\nheard so as to show the volume and reach of his show. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro testified that he and Canales started\r\npublishing the magazine “Buenos Dias, El Salvador La Revista” in February 2006\r\nto offer their radio show advertisers additional advertising in the magazine\r\nand to promote their show.  Villatoro introduced several issues of the magazine\r\ncontaining advertisements for different Hispanic businesses and events and for the\r\nradio show.  The magazine issues containing advertisements for the radio show\r\nwere dated September 2006, October 2006, January 2007, February 2007, and March\r\n2007 — months after Villatoro claimed he had stopped using “Buenos Dias, El\r\nSalvador” as the name of the radio show.  The only magazine issue dated March\r\n2006 — and prior to the radio show’s name change — did not contain any\r\nadvertisement for the radio show.  Villatoro presented no other evidence of radio\r\nshow advertisements for the relevant time period during which he hosted the\r\nshow under the name “Buenos Dias, El Salvador.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro and Canales started publishing the magazine\r\nin February 2006; in his answers to interrogatories, Villatoro stated that the\r\ncombined gross sales for the radio show and the magazine were $20,000 in 2004;\r\n$35,000 in 2005; and $50,000 in 2006.  An advertisement proposal introduced\r\ninto evidence reflected that the charge for weekly advertisements on the radio\r\nshow ranged from $350 to $825.  Villatoro did not present any evidence\r\nregarding the number of advertisers who advertised on his show or the volume of\r\nadvertising. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Additionally, Villatoro’s testimony demonstrates that\r\nhe did not necessarily want listeners to associate the radio show with his\r\nperson:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Q.  Okay. As far as who’s on the show, who’s the person\r\nbehind the mic, obviously, you don’t have the golden mic of Rush Limbaugh, but\r\nyou’ve got a mic there, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">A.  Yes, sir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Q.  When its “Buenos Dias EI Salvador,” is there as much a\r\ntie-in to who the person is behind the mic as there is when it’s something\r\nthat’s tied to a name like Rush Limbaugh or Sean Hannity, or something like\r\nthat in the morning versus, you know, it’s the morning show?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">A.  It’s different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\" align=\"center\">*                                  *                                  *</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Q.  If you know, from your own experience, when you have a\r\nname that is generic like “Buenos Dias EI Salvador,” is that easier for you to have\r\nsubstitute hosts than it is when it’s tied directly to your name?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">A.  Yes.  With the name as “Buenos Dias EI Salvador,” you’ve\r\ngot a lot more coverage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Q.  Okay.  Is it easier to get substitutes?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">A.  Yes, sir.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Q.  When it’s the Tony Villatoro Show, who do they expect\r\nto hear?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">A.  Just myself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">To support his assertion that there is sufficient\r\nevidence to support the jury’s finding that the trade name “Buenos Dias, El\r\nSalvador” belongs to him, Villatoro argues that “[i]t is undisputed that [he]\r\nand Canales published a magazine with the name Buenos Dias El Salvador, which\r\nhad a multi-county circulation. And it is undisputed that the radio show,\r\nBuenos Dias El Salvador, began in about March of 2004.”  The fact that the\r\nradio show “began in about March 2004” does not establish that the show\r\nacquired a secondary meaning.  Also, the fact that the magazine “had a\r\nmulti-city circulation” does not by itself establish that the radio show\r\nacquired a secondary meaning.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\nthe verdict, we cannot conclude that the evidence supports a finding that in\r\nfact a substantial number of present or prospective radio show listeners\r\nunderstand the designation Buenos Dias, El Salvador, when used in connection\r\nwith the radio show, not in its primary lexicographical sense, but as having\r\nsecondary meaning.  Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is legally\r\nsufficient evidence that the designation acquired a secondary meaning or\r\nspecial significance to support the jury’s finding that the name of the radio\r\nshow “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” is Villatoro’s trade name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We sustain the Funeses’ first issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>C.</b>        <b>“Festival\r\nGuanaco”</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In their second issue, the Funeses argue that (1)\r\n“Festival Guanaco” cannot be a trade name because it is a generic description\r\nof an event which is not protectable as a trade name; and (2) assuming\r\n“Festival Guanaco” can be a trade name, there is insufficient evidence to\r\nsupport the jury’s finding that it is Villatoro’s trade name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We reject the Funeses’ argument that “Festival\r\nGuanaco” cannot be a trade name in this case.  The charge instructed the jury\r\nas follows: “The parties have stipulated that Festival Guanaco and Buenos Dias\r\nEl Salvador are trade names.”  No party objected to this instruction.  As we\r\nhave stated in issue one, absent an objection, the parties are bound by the\r\nstatements of law contained in the submitted jury charge, even if the\r\nstatements of law are erroneous.  <i>See L &amp; F Distribs.</i>, 941 S.W.2d at\r\n279 (“When the charge misinforms the jury about the substantive law, the\r\nparties must either object to the improper submission or accept the wording . .\r\n. as submitted.”)<i> </i>(citing <i>Allen</i>, 380 S.W.2d at 608-09); <i>see\r\nalso Hirschfeld Steel Co.</i>, 201 S.W.3d at 283.  Because the Funeses and\r\nVillatoro did not object to a jury instruction that “Festival Guanaco” is a\r\ntrade name, they are now bound by the statement contained in the jury charge.  <i>See\r\nL &amp; F Distribs.</i>, 941 S.W.2d at 279; <i>see also Hirschfeld Steel Co.</i>,\r\n201 S.W.3d at 283.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We agree with the Funeses that legally insufficient\r\nevidence supports the jury’s finding that the trade name “Festival Guanaco”\r\nbelongs to Villatoro because the record contains no evidence of secondary\r\nmeaning and thus no evidence of special significance.  Jury Question 3 stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that\r\nFestival Guanaco is a trade name of any of the following persons?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">A “trade name” is any designation\r\nwhich (a) is adopted and used by a person to denominate goods which he markets\r\nor services which he renders or a business which he conducts, or has come to be\r\nso used by others, and (b) through its association with such goods, services or\r\nbusiness, has acquired a special significance as the name thereof.

Code Ann. § 37.003(a) (Vernon 2008).\r\n The UDJA’s purpose is “to settle and to afford relief from uncertainty and\r\ninsecurity with respect to rights, status, and other legal relations; and it is\r\nto be liberally construed and administered.”  <i>Id</i>. § 37.002(b).  The\r\nenumerations in sections 37.004 and 37.005 do not limit or restrict the\r\nexercise of the general powers conferred in this section in any proceeding in\r\nwhich declaratory relief is sought and a judgment or decree will terminate the\r\ncontroversy or remove an uncertainty.  <i>Id</i>. § 37.003(c).  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In any proceeding under this chapter, the court may “award\r\ncosts and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are equitable and just.”  <i>Id</i>.\r\n§ 37.009.  A party cannot use the UDJA to settle disputes already pending\r\nbefore the court.  <i>BHP Petroleum Co. v. Millard</i>, 800 S.W.2d 838, 841\r\n(Tex. 1990) (orig. proceeding).  Nor can a party use the UDJA to obtain otherwise\r\nimpermissible attorney’s fees.  <i>MBM Fin. Corp. v. Woodlands Operating Co.</i>,\r\n292 S.W.3d 660, 669 (Tex. 2009).  It is an abuse of discretion to award\r\nattorney’s fees under the UDJA when the statute is relied upon solely as a vehicle\r\nto recover attorney’s fees.  <i>City</i> <i>of Houston v. Texan Land &amp;\r\nCattle Co.</i>, 138 S.W.3d 382, 392 (Tex.

Plaintiffs are well-known in the Latin community and\r\nenjoy an excellent reputation therein.  Plaintiffs have business relations,\r\ncontracts and prospective contracts in that community and in the Anglo\r\ncommunity.  Defendants negligently published statements that were defamatory\r\nconcerning the plaintiffs.  These statements were false and many were made with\r\nactual malice.  These false statements tend to injure plaintiffs’ reputation so\r\nas to lower the plaintiffs in the estimation of the community or to deter third\r\npersons from associating or dealing with the plaintiffs, and/or they tend to\r\nexpose plaintiffs to public hatred, contempt, ridicule, or financial injury,\r\nand/or to impeach plaintiffs’ honesty, integrity, or virtue.  These statements\r\nalso affect plaintiffs injuriously in their office, profession, or occupation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">6. Through their false and defamatory statements,\r\nDefendants have interfered with ongoing and prospective contractual relations\r\nthat Plaintiffs have and enjoy.  Defendants have also caused confusion in the\r\nLatin community by claiming to own trade names that belong to or are associated\r\nwith Plaintiffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">7. Defendants have also attempted to appropriate unto\r\nthemselves trade names that are associated with and belong to Plaintiffs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\"><b>First Cause of Action - Libel</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">8. Plaintiffs sue defendants, jointly and severally, for\r\nthe damage to their reputation caused by their defamatory statements.  This\r\ndefamation was done with malice, entitling Plaintiffs to have and recover\r\npunitive damages, for which they now also sue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\"><b>Second Cause of Action - Tortious Interference</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">9. In the alternative, but without waiving the foregoing,\r\ndefendants have tortiously interfered with Plaintiffs’ existing and prospective\r\ncontractual relations. Plaintiffs had existing and prospective contracts,\r\ndefendants were aware of same and intentionally interfered with same and\r\nthereby caused Plaintiff damage, for which they now sue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">10. This tortious interference was committed with malice, entitling\r\nPlaintiffs to have and recover punitive damages, in an amount to be set by the\r\ntrier of fact, for which they now sue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\"><b>Third Cause of Action - Declaratory Judgment</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">11. In the alternative, but without waiving the foregoing,\r\nPlaintiffs sue defendants for a declaratory judgment that they, in fact, own\r\nthe trade names and common law trademarks that defendants now claim to have\r\nregistered or to own.  Pursuant to the declaratory judgment act, Plaintiffs sue\r\nfor reasonable attorney’s fees for having to bring this declaratory judgment\r\naction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Nothing in Villatoro’s\r\npleadings supports the Funeses’ contentions that Villatoro’s declaratory\r\njudgment claims are duplicative of his tortious interference claim or   predicated\r\non the fact that “the Funeses filed assumed name certificates for ‘Buenos Dias,\r\nEl Salvador’ and ‘Festival Guanaco’ when they had no right to do so because the\r\nphrases were pre-existing trade names of Canales and Villatoro.”  These\r\npleadings do not support a contention that liability on the tort claims\r\ndepended in part “on the existence and ownership of the alleged trade names.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Further, the Funeses themselves sought a declaratory\r\njudgment that they owned the trade names “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” and\r\n“Festival Guanaco.”  The trial court’s final judgment contains a declaration\r\nthat the Funeses have no interest in the two trade names “and that any assumed\r\nname certificates filed by” the Funeses for the two trade names are void; the\r\nFuneses do not challenge that declaration on appeal.  Accordingly, we reject\r\nthe Funeses’ argument that Villatoro brought a declaratory judgment claim\r\n“solely for the purpose of obtaining attorney’s fees.”  We conclude that\r\nrecovery of attorney’s fees is permissible under § 37.009 in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Next, we address the Funeses’ assertion that\r\n“reversal of the awards of declaratory relief to Villatoro necessarily requires\r\nreversal of the awards of attorneys’ fees.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">As we have stated above, the UDJA permits the trial\r\ncourt to “award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are\r\nequitable and just.”  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009.  The award\r\nof attorney’s fees and costs in a declaratory judgment action is within the\r\ntrial court’s discretion and is not dependent upon a finding that a party\r\nsubstantially prevailed.  <i>Chase Home Fin, L.L.C. v. Cal West. Reconveyance\r\nCorp.</i>, 309 S.W.3d 619, 634 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.)\r\n(citing <i>Barshop v. Medina</i>, 925 S.W.2d 618, 637-38 (Tex. 1996)).  Because\r\nour disposition of this case on appeal substantially affects the trial court’s\r\njudgment, remand is warranted so that the trial court can address what attorney’s\r\nfees, if any, should be awarded to Villatoro under the UDJA.  <i>Id</i>.  As\r\nstated above, Villatoro obtained declaratory judgment that was not challenged\r\non appeal and has not been disturbed.  Because our disposition on appeal does\r\nnot leave Villatoro entirely without relief, a reversal and rendition regarding\r\nattorney’s fees is not proper.  <i>See</i> <i>City of Houston v. Harris Cnty.\r\nOutdoor Adver. Ass’n</i>, 732 S.W.2d 42, 56 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1987,\r\nno writ) (stating that it is an abuse of discretion to award attorney’s fees to\r\na party who is not entitled to declaratory relief).</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We remand the issue of whether to award attorney’s\r\nfees under the UDJA to Villatoro and the reasonable and necessary amount of any\r\nsuch attorney’s fees, if awarded, to the trial court for further proceedings.  We\r\nresolve the Funeses’ sixth issue in their favor to this extent.  Because of our\r\ndisposition of this issue, it is unnecessary to address the Funeses’ remaining arguments\r\nrelating to attorney’s fees in issues six and seven. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>IV.      Villatoro’s\r\nCross-Point</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In his sole cross-point, Villatoro argues that there\r\nis no evidence to support “the jury’s refusal to award any attorney’s fees” for\r\nsuccessful appeals.  Villatoro argues that his expert witness, David Carp,\r\nprovided direct and unequivocal evidence “for attorney’s fees for a successful\r\nappeal,” and that the Funeses did not present any evidence to controvert Carp’s\r\ntestimony.  Villatoro contends that, “[a]lthough it could have rationally\r\nconcluded that, in light of the amount involved and the results to be obtained,\r\na reasonable fee award was less than the full amount sought, no evidence\r\nsupported the jury’s refusal to award any attorney’s fees.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">A no evidence point is preserved through one of the\r\nfollowing: (1) a motion for instructed verdict; (2) a motion for judgment\r\nnotwithstanding the verdict; (3) an objection to the submission of the issue to\r\nthe jury; (4) a motion to disregard the jury’s answer to a vital fact issue; or\r\n(5) a motion for new trial.  <i>T.O. Stanley Boot Co., Inc. v. Bank of El Paso</i>,\r\n847 S.W.2d 218, 220 (Tex. 1992).  Villatoro did not file any motion challenging\r\nthe jury’s finding on appellate attorney’s fees.  Nor did he attempt to\r\nchallenge the sufficiency of the jury’s finding in his response to the Funeses’\r\npost-trial motions.  Therefore, we do not address Villatoro’s no evidence\r\nchallenge to the jury’s finding on appellate attorney’s fees.  <i>See id</i>.; <i>Graves\r\nv.

Canales,\r\nhosted a daily radio show called “Buenos Dias El Salvador.”  In 2006, Villatoro\r\noffered to broadcast advertisements on the radio show for an El Salvadoran\r\nfestival organized by the Funeses.  A dispute arose when Villatoro and the\r\nFuneses could not agree on the rate for these advertisements.  Villatoro\r\nsubsequently told the Funeses he would organize an El Salvadoran festival to be\r\nheld on the same day as the Funeses’ festival.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The Funeses filed assumed name certificates with the\r\ncounty clerk’s office for “Festival Guanaco,” “Buenos Dias El Salvador,” and\r\n“Festival Salvadoreno.”  The Funeses also hired an attorney, who sent a\r\ncease-and-desist letter to Villatoro.  In the letter, the Funeses advised\r\nVillatoro that they had filed assumed name certificates for “three trade names;”\r\ndemanded that Villatoro refrain from using these registered names; and\r\nthreatened to sue Villatoro if he failed to comply with the Funeses’ demands.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro and Canales filed separate but identical\r\nsuits against the Funeses on July 28, 2006.  They sought a declaration that the\r\nnames registered by the Funeses were trade names belonging to Villatoro and\r\nCanales; they also alleged claims for libel and tortious interference with\r\nprospective and existing contractual relations.  The Funeses filed a general\r\ndenial and a counterclaim for sanctions on September 8, 2006.  The trial court\r\nsent notices of intent to dismiss for want of prosecution on December 3, 2008.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro and Canales each filed motions to retain on\r\nJanuary 14, 2009.  Villatoro and Canales filed a motion to consolidate the two\r\nsuits on January 23, 2009 and asked the trial court to transfer Villatoro’s\r\nsuit from the 434th District Court to the 400th District Court.  The trial\r\ncourt granted the motion to consolidate on January 23, 2009. </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro and Canales filed their second amended\r\npetition on April 20, 2009.  They alleged claims for libel, tortious interference\r\nwith prospective and existing contractual relations, and business\r\ndisparagement; they also sought a declaration that the names registered by the\r\nFuneses were in fact trade names belonging to Villatoro and Canales.  The\r\nFuneses filed a supplemental counterclaim on May 11, 2009, seeking a\r\ndeclaratory judgment and an injunction prohibiting Villatoro and Canales from\r\nusing the Funeses’ registered names.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">A three-day jury trial was held on October 20, 2009. \r\nThe Funeses and Villatoro were present at trial; Canales was not present but\r\nwas represented by the same attorneys who represented Villatoro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\" align=\"center\"><b>Background</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro moved from El Salvador to the United States\r\nin 2001; he was employed by a computer company called Comtech Systems as a\r\ntechnology manager and store manager.  In January 2004, Villatoro started\r\nhosting a one-hour Spanish-language radio show about computers called “El Mundo\r\nde los Computadoras.”  The radio show aired Sundays on Houston’s 920 AM station. \r\nComtech paid the radio station for the show’s airtime and sold advertising to\r\npay for the airtime.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">A few months later in March 2004, Villatoro began\r\nhosting two hours on the radio on Sundays.  One hour was devoted to computer\r\ntips, and one hour was devoted to a radio show Villatoro called “Buenos Dias,\r\nEl Salvador.”  Because of a lack of interest in the computer show, Villatoro started\r\ndevoting the two-hour airtime entirely to hosting the “Buenos Dias, El Salvador”\r\nradio show.<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[1]</span></span></span> \r\nCanales co-hosted the show.  Villatoro continued working for Comtech, which continued\r\npaying for the show’s airtime and selling advertising.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro and Canales began publishing a magazine\r\ncalled “Buenos Dias, El Salvador La Revista”<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[2]</span></span></span>\r\nin February 2006.  Villatoro launched the magazine to promote the radio show\r\nand to “help the customers that was [sic] advertising on the show, so they can\r\n[sic] have an extra advertising. . . .  Basically, it was all the people that\r\nwas [sic] advertising on the radio, they were getting it as a package with the\r\nmagazine.”  The magazine issues admitted into evidence contained editorials,\r\narticles relating to El Salvador and its culture, and advertising for different\r\nbusinesses including the radio show.  Villatoro sold subscriptions to the\r\nmagazine in order to cover the cost; he claimed to have circulated the magazine\r\nin all Central American businesses in Harris County and six other counties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In May 2006, the radio station’s owner approached\r\nVillatoro to host a daily two-hour morning show Monday through Friday.  After a\r\nmonth, the show expanded to a three-hour daily show from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.  The\r\nshow reached fifteen to twenty thousand listeners in nine counties,<span

the magazine and work for Comtech.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In July 2006, Villatoro offered to broadcast advertisements\r\non the radio show for an El Salvadoran festival organized by the Funeses.  Villatoro\r\ntestified that he met the Funeses in 2004 at one of their restaurants and had once\r\nbefore advertised their festival in 2005.  Villatoro testified that Mauricio\r\nFunes told him in July 2006 to start broadcasting advertisements for the\r\nfestival on the radio show.  According to Villatoro, Ursula Funes told\r\nVillatoro after the advertisements began to run that she could only pay $300 for\r\nthe advertising because the Funeses had already spent their money advertising\r\non another radio show on the same radio station.  Villatoro refused to accept\r\n$300 and contended that the advertising he already had provided was worth\r\n$1,500.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The Funeses and Villatoro offered conflicting\r\ntestimony about how the advertising dispute ensued.  Mauricio testified that\r\nVillatoro asked him if he would like to advertise on Villatoro’s radio show. \r\nMauricio testified that he did not know that Villatoro had a show and asked\r\nVillatoro to submit a proposal.  Mauricio testified that Villatoro brought a\r\nproposal to one of the Funeses’ restaurants around July 10, 2006, but the\r\nFuneses rejected Villatoro’s proposal because they preferred advertising their\r\nfestival on a different radio show with a well-known radio host.  Mauricio\r\nstated that he offered to spend $600 advertising with Villatoro instead of $2,000\r\nVillatoro had proposed.  According to Mauricio, Villatoro became upset and\r\nleft.  Mauricio testified that Villatoro later called him to tell him that he\r\nwould also organize an El Salvadoran festival on the same day the Funeses had\r\nscheduled their festival to prove that his show was popular with the El\r\nSalvadoran community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The Funeses introduced Villatoro’s alleged proposal\r\ninto evidence as Defendants’ Exhibit Two.  The advertising proposal was entitled,\r\n“Tony Villatoro y su Show;” nothing on the proposal referred to the radio show\r\n“Buenos Dias, El Salvador.”  The proposal listed different advertising packages\r\nas an “inauguration promotion” during the month of May.  Mauricio testified\r\nthat Villatoro told him Villatoro “just started a show.”  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro denied presenting the proposal to the\r\nFuneses in July 2006.  He testified that Defendants’ Exhibit Two was a proposal\r\nhe created in 2008 for the Funeses after he changed the name of the radio show\r\nfrom “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” to “El Show de la Tony Villatoro and Junior\r\nCanales.”  Villatoro claimed that the Funeses asked for an advertising quote in\r\n2008 through an unnamed individual, and that he created the proposal in\r\nresponse to that request.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">When the Funeses and Villatoro could not resolve\r\ntheir advertising dispute, the Funeses filed assumed name certificates with the\r\nHarris County Clerk’s Office on July 17, 2006 for “Buenos Dias El Salvador,”\r\n“Festival Guanaco,” and “Festival Salvadoreno.”  The Funeses testified that they\r\nfelt threatened by Villatoro’s announcement that he would also organize an El\r\nSalvadoran festival.  Although the Funeses’ annual festival is called “El\r\nPupusaton,” the Funeses testified that they used El Salvadoran “slogans” such\r\nas “Good morning, El Salvador” and “Guanaco, welcome” during their festivals\r\nand wanted to ensure that these “slogans” were protected.  The Funeses sent a\r\ncease-and-desist letter to Villatoro on July 24, 2006, advising Villatoro that\r\nthey had filed assumed name certificates for “three trade names,” demanding\r\nthat Villatoro refrain from using these registered names, and threatening to\r\nsue Villatoro if he failed to comply with their demands.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro testified that he changed the name of his\r\nshow “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” to “Tony Villatoro Show”<span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span class=\"MsoFootnoteReference\"><span>[4]</span></span></span>\r\nafter receiving the Funeses’ cease-and-desist letter “to prevent a future\r\nproblem.”  He acknowledged scheduling his El Salvadoran festival named\r\n“Festival Guanaco” on August 13, 2006 — the same day the Funeses scheduled\r\ntheir festival “El Pupusaton.”  Villatoro claimed that he started organizing his\r\nFestival Guanaco in June 2006; started advertising for his festival in July;\r\nand pre-paid a band from El Salvador to perform at his festival on July 13,\r\n2006.  The Funeses held their festival “El Pupusaton” in the Nassau Bay area and\r\nVillatoro held his festival in the Sharpstown area on August 13, 2006.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro testified that he encountered many\r\ndifficulties after changing the name of the radio show in July 2006.  He stated\r\nthat “the Salvadoran community was mad at [him] because they said [he] was not\r\nproud of being a Salvadoran,” causing loss of advertising business.  Villatoro\r\ntestified that “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” had a value in the radio business\r\nbecause he had promoted the name for a long time; the name of the show was a\r\nmore generic name that “got a lot more coverage.”  He testified that, after\r\nchanging the name of the show, he lost at least $20,000 in 2006 and $40,000 in\r\n2007.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Villatoro also stopped publishing the magazine\r\nbecause it was tied to the “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” radio show.  According to\r\nVillatoro, after the name change, people looked at the magazine as a business that\r\nwas different from the radio show and the magazine lost its value.  Villatoro\r\nalso testified that he encountered difficulty selling advertising because the\r\nFuneses told the community that the names “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” and\r\n“Festival Guanaco” belonged to the Funeses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The radio show started making a profit again in 2008. \r\nVillatoro created a marketing agency in July 2008 called TV Promotion and\r\nMarketing that handled all advertising for the radio show; Comtech no longer handled\r\nthe advertising or paid the radio station for airtime.  Villatoro testified\r\nthat he made a profit through his company TV Promotion and Marketing in 2008\r\nbecause he no longer worked for Comtech.  Villatoro organized his second El\r\nSalvadoran festival, called “Festival Guanaco 2009,” on April 19, 2009, and\r\nmade a $5,000 profit.  After calling the radio show “El Show de la Tony\r\nVillatoro and Junior Canales” for almost three years, Villatoro changed the\r\nname of the radio show to “Los Hijos de la Madrugada” in July 2009.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">At the conclusion of Villatoro’s case, the Funeses\r\nmoved for directed verdict against Villatoro and Canales.  The trial court\r\ngranted the Funeses’ motion only as to Canales.  After both parties rested, the\r\ntrial court granted Villatoro’s motion for directed verdict against the Funeses\r\non their claims.  Villatoro and the Funeses stipulated that “Buenos Dias, El\r\nSalvador” and “Festival Guanaco” are trade names; this stipulation is reflected\r\nin the jury charge.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The jury returned a verdict finding that (1) the\r\ntrade names “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” and “Festival Guanaco” belong to\r\nVillatoro and do not belong to the Funeses; (2) the Funeses intentionally\r\ninterfered with Villatoro’s “existing or prospective contractual or business\r\nrelations;” and (3) Villatoro lost profits in the amount of $10,000 as a result\r\nof the Funeses’ interference.  The jury also awarded $22,000 in trial\r\nattorney’s fees and $3,000 for post-judgment attorney’s fees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">The trial court signed a final judgment on October\r\n30, 2009.  The Funeses filed (1) a combined motion for judgment notwithstanding\r\nthe verdict and for new trial; (2) objections and exceptions to the final\r\njudgment; and (3) a motion to segregate attorney’s fees on November 20, 2009. \r\nVillatoro responded to the Funeses’ motions and objections on November 23,\r\n2009.  The trial court denied the Funeses’ requests and signed orders denying\r\nthe Funeses’ motions and objections on November 23, 2009.  The Funeses timely\r\nfiled their notice of appeal on November 30, 2009.  Villatoro timely filed his\r\nnotice of appeal on January 28, 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\" align=\"center\"><b>Analysis</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p

support the jury’s finding that the trade names\r\n“Buenos Dias, El Salvador” and “Festival Guanaco” belong to Villatoro.  In\r\ntheir third issue, the Funeses argue the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support the jury’s finding that they intentionally interfered\r\nwith Villatoro’s existing or prospective contracts or business relations.  In\r\ntheir fourth issue, the

And it is undisputed that the radio show,\r\nBuenos Dias El Salvador, began in about March of 2004.”  The fact that the\r\nradio show “began in about March 2004” does not establish that the show\r\nacquired a secondary meaning.  Also, the fact that the magazine “had a\r\nmulti-city circulation” does not by itself establish that the radio show\r\nacquired a secondary meaning.  </p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\r\nthe verdict, we cannot conclude that the evidence supports a finding that in\r\nfact a substantial number of present or prospective radio show listeners\r\nunderstand the designation Buenos Dias, El Salvador, when used in connection\r\nwith the radio show, not in its primary lexicographical sense, but as having\r\nsecondary meaning.  Therefore, we cannot conclude that there is legally\r\nsufficient evidence that the designation acquired a secondary meaning or\r\nspecial significance to support the jury’s finding that the name of the radio\r\nshow “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” is Villatoro’s trade name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We sustain the Funeses’ first issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\"><b>C.</b>        <b>“Festival\r\nGuanaco”</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">In their second issue, the Funeses argue that (1)\r\n“Festival Guanaco” cannot be a trade name because it is a generic description\r\nof an event which is not protectable as a trade name; and (2) assuming\r\n“Festival Guanaco” can be a trade name, there is insufficient evidence to\r\nsupport the jury’s finding that it is Villatoro’s trade name.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We reject the Funeses’ argument that “Festival\r\nGuanaco” cannot be a trade name in this case.  The charge instructed the jury\r\nas follows: “The parties have stipulated that Festival Guanaco and Buenos Dias\r\nEl Salvador are trade names.”  No party objected to this instruction.  As we\r\nhave stated in issue one, absent an objection, the parties are bound by the\r\nstatements of law contained in the submitted jury charge, even if the\r\nstatements of law are erroneous.  <i>See L &amp; F Distribs.</i>, 941 S.W.2d at\r\n279 (“When the charge misinforms the jury about the substantive law, the\r\nparties must either object to the improper submission or accept the wording . .\r\n. as submitted.”)<i> </i>(citing <i>Allen</i>, 380 S.W.2d at 608-09); <i>see\r\nalso Hirschfeld Steel Co.</i>, 201 S.W.3d at 283.  Because the Funeses and\r\nVillatoro did not object to a jury instruction that “Festival Guanaco” is a\r\ntrade name, they are now bound by the statement contained in the jury charge.  <i>See\r\nL &amp; F Distribs.</i>, 941 S.W.2d at 279; <i>see also Hirschfeld Steel Co.</i>,\r\n201 S.W.3d at 283.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">We agree with the Funeses that legally insufficient\r\nevidence supports the jury’s finding that the trade name “Festival Guanaco”\r\nbelongs to Villatoro because the record contains no evidence of secondary\r\nmeaning and thus no evidence of special significance.  Jury Question 3 stated:</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">Do you find from a preponderance of the evidence that\r\nFestival Guanaco is a trade name of any of the following persons?</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"BlockQuote\">A “trade name” is any designation\r\nwhich (a) is adopted and used by a person to denominate goods which he markets\r\nor services which he renders or a business which he conducts, or has come to be\r\nso used by others, and (b) through its association with such goods, services or\r\nbusiness, has acquired a special significance as the name thereof.

In the alternative, but without waiving the foregoing,\r\nPlaintiffs sue defendants for a declaratory judgment that they, in fact, own\r\nthe trade names and common law trademarks that defendants now claim to have\r\nregistered or to own.  Pursuant to the declaratory judgment act, Plaintiffs sue\r\nfor reasonable attorney’s fees for having to bring this declaratory judgment\r\naction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Nothing in Villatoro’s\r\npleadings supports the Funeses’ contentions that Villatoro’s declaratory\r\njudgment claims are duplicative of his tortious interference claim or   predicated\r\non the fact that “the Funeses filed assumed name certificates for ‘Buenos Dias,\r\nEl Salvador’ and ‘Festival Guanaco’ when they had no right to do so because the\r\nphrases were pre-existing trade names of Canales and Villatoro.”  These\r\npleadings do not support a contention that liability on the tort claims\r\ndepended in part “on the existence and ownership of the alleged trade names.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Further, the Funeses themselves sought a declaratory\r\njudgment that they owned the trade names “Buenos Dias, El Salvador” and\r\n“Festival Guanaco.”  The trial court’s final judgment contains a declaration\r\nthat the Funeses have no interest in the two trade names “and that any assumed\r\nname certificates filed by” the Funeses for the two trade names are void; the\r\nFuneses do not challenge that declaration on appeal.  Accordingly, we reject\r\nthe Funeses’ argument that Villatoro brought a declaratory judgment claim\r\n“solely for the purpose of obtaining attorney’s fees.”  We conclude that\r\nrecovery of attorney’s fees is permissible under § 37.009 in this case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">Next, we address the Funeses’ assertion that\r\n“reversal of the awards of declaratory relief to Villatoro necessarily requires\r\nreversal of the awards of attorneys’ fees.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"OpinionParagraph\">As we have stated above, the UDJA permits the trial\r\ncourt to “award costs and reasonable and necessary attorney’s fees as are\r\nequitable and just.”  Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. § 37.009.  The award\r\nof attorney’s fees and costs in a declaratory judgment action is within the\r\ntrial court’s discretion and is not dependent upon a finding that a party\r\nsubstantially prevailed.  <i>Chase Home Fin, L.L.C. v.
