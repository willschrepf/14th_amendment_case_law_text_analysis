The notice proposed the construction of a hog farm with 3,384 animal\n\nunits. In April 2014, at the request of Marshall County, the Department held a public\n\ninformational meeting regarding the proposed hog farm. In October 2014, the Department\n\ndetermined the proposed hog farm \"more likely than not\" met the requirements of the Livestock\n\nManagement Facilities Act (Livestock Act or Act) (510 ILCS 77/1 to 999 (West 2014)). In\n\nFebruary 2015, plaintiff, Save Our Sandy, filed a petition for certiorari, seeking review of the\n\nDepartment's decision. The Department and VMC filed separate motions to dismiss pursuant to\n\fsection 2-619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West\n\n2014)). The trial court granted the motions to dismiss, finding plaintiff did not have standing to\n\nseek review of the Department's decision because plaintiff was not a party of record in the\n\nadministrative proceedings.\n\n¶2             Plaintiff appeals, arguing standing requires only some injury to a legally\n\ncognizable interest, a standard which plaintiff has met. Specifically, plaintiff argues it need not\n\nbe a party of record in the administrative proceedings to assert standing. Alternatively, plaintiff\n\nargues some of its members were parties of record to the administrative proceeding and therefore\n\nhave standing. We disagree.\n\n¶3                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶4             In February 2014, VMC filed a \"Notice of Intent to Construct\" with the\n\nDepartment. The notice proposed the construction of a hog farm with 3,384 animal units in\n\nMarshall County. The application also contained the names and addresses of residents who were\n\nwithin the setback limits contained within the Livestock Act. In April 2014, at the request of\n\nMarshall County, the Department held a public informational meeting regarding the proposed\n\nhog farm. Some members of Save Our Sandy testified and presented written evidence at the\n\ninformational meeting.\n\n¶5             In October 2014, the Department determined the proposed hog farm \"more likely\n\nthan not\" met the requirements of the Livestock Act (510 ILCS 77/12.1(a) (West 2014)). In\n\nNovember 2014, plaintiff filed a petition for reconsideration, asking the Department to\n\nreconsider its approval of VMC's notice of intent to construct. In January 2015, the Department\n\ndenied the petition, finding plaintiff, as a nonparty, did not have standing to seek stay or\n\nreconsideration under the applicable administrative regulations.\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f¶6              In February 2015, plaintiff, Save Our Sandy, filed a petition for certiorari,\n\nseeking review of the Department's determination the proposed hog farm \"more likely than not\"\n\nmet the provisions of the Livestock Act. The Department and VMC filed separate motions to\n\ndismiss pursuant to section 2-619(a)(9) of the Code (735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West 2014)),\n\narguing plaintiff did not have standing to seek administrative review. In July 2015, the trial court\n\ngranted the motions to dismiss.\n\n¶7              This appeal followed.\n\n¶8                                          II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶9              Plaintiff appeals, arguing the trial court erred in granting the motions to dismiss.\n\nDefendants argue plaintiff does not have standing to seek review because it was not a party to the\n\nadministrative proceeding. Plaintiff contends the \"party\" requirement is limited to review under\n\nthe Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3-101 to 3-113 (West 2014)). Plaintiff argues it\n\nhas suffered an injury to a legally cognizable interest and nothing more is required to show\n\nstanding for a petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\n¶ 10            \"A common law writ of certiorari is a general method for obtaining circuit court\n\nreview of administrative actions when the act conferring power on the agency does not expressly\n\nadopt the Administrative Review Law and provides for no other form of review.\" Hanrahan v.\n\nWilliams, 174 Ill. 2d 268, 272, 673 N.E.2d 251, 253 (1996). The Livestock Act neither adopts\n\nthe procedures set forth in the Administrative Review Law nor limits review; therefore judicial\n\nreview may be obtained by a writ of certiorari. 510 ILCS 77/1 to 999 (West 2014). See Helping\n\nOthers Maintain Environmental Standards v. Bos, 406 Ill. App. 3d 669, 681, 941 N.E.2d 347,\n\n360 (2010) (hereinafter Helping Others).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    -3-\n\f¶ 11            \"Under Illinois law, a lack of standing is an affirmative defense, and thus the\n\ndefendants bear the burden to plead and prove a lack of standing.\" Sierra Club v. Office of\n\nMines & Minerals, 2015 IL App (4th) 140405, ¶ 22, 29 N.E.3d 1068. Accordingly, VMC and\n\nthe Department raised the standing issue in their respective motions to dismiss under section\n\n2-619(a)(9) of the Code (735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West 2014)). With a section 2-619 motion to\n\ndismiss, we view all well-pleaded facts, together with reasonable inferences drawn from the\n\nfacts, as true. Sierra Club, 2015 IL App (4th) 140405, ¶ 23, 29 N.E.3d 1068. We interpret all\n\nthe pleadings and supporting documents in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.\n\nOur review of a section 2-619 motion to dismiss is de novo. Id.\n\n¶ 12            We first consider the provisions of the Livestock Act and the relevant\n\nadministrative regulations.\n\n¶ 13                        A. The Livestock Management Facilities Act\n\n¶ 14            The Livestock Act governs the procedures and standards for Department\n\noversight of the construction of livestock production facilities. 510 ILCS 77/1 to 999 (West\n\n2014). The purpose of the Act is to ensure Illinois maintains an economically viable livestock\n\nindustry while also protecting the environment. 510 ILCS 77/5(b) (West 2014). The Act\n\nrequires an owner or operator to file a \"notice of intent to construct\" a livestock facility with the\n\nDepartment prior to construction. 510 ILCS 77/11(a) (West 2014). When the Department\n\nreceives a notice of intent to construct a facility such as the one at issue in this case (i.e., a\n\nfacility with more than 1,000 animal units), the Department must send the notice to the\n\nappropriate county board and publish public notice in a newspaper within the county. 510 ILCS\n\n77/12(a) (West 2014).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f¶ 15           The county board may request an \"informational meeting\" at its discretion, or the\n\ncounty board can be compelled to request one when petitioned to do so by 75 or more county\n\nresidents. 510 ILCS 77/12(a) (West 2014). The Act requires notice to the public of the\n\ninformational meeting. Following the informational meeting, the county board must submit \"an\n\nadvisory, non-binding recommendation\" as to whether the livestock facility meets the sitting\n\ncriteria. 510 ILCS 77/12(b) (West 2014). The relevant administrative regulation requires the\n\nDepartment to allow members of the public to ask questions and present oral or written\n\ncomments concerning the proposed livestock facility. 8 Ill. Adm. Code 900.405(d) (2003).\n\nFollowing the informational meeting, receipt of the county board's recommendation, and any\n\nfurther information necessary, the Department issues a final determination as to whether the\n\nproposed livestock facility \"more likely than not\" meets the requirements of the Livestock Act.\n\n510 ILCS 77/12.1(a) (West 2014). The relevant administrative regulation provides the procedure\n\nfor stay or reconsideration of any final determination \"shall be as provided for in the\n\nDepartment's administrative rules.\" 8 Ill. Adm. Code 900.407(f) (2003). In turn, the germane\n\nregulation governing petitions for reconsideration provides, \"[t]he respondent in any contested\n\ncase may request reconsideration.\" 8 Ill. Adm. Code 1.114 (1992).\n\n¶ 16           The Livestock Act also prescribes setbacks, which, in pertinent part, dictate the\n\ndistance a livestock facility must be from (1) a populated area, and (2) an occupied residence.\n\n510 ILCS 77/35(c)(4) (West 2014). Populated area is defined as \"any area where at least 10\n\ninhabited non-farm residences are located or where at least 50 persons frequent a common place\n\nof assembly or a non-farm business at least once per week.\" 510 ILCS 77/10.60 (West 2014).\n\n¶ 17           One resident lived within the \"occupied residence\" setback distance of 1,760 feet,\n\nand he waived the setback distance. Some members of Save Our Sandy lived within the\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f\"populated area\" setback distance. Plaintiff contends this \"populated area\" setback gave them\n\nthe right to notice of construction and, therefore, made them parties to the administrative\n\nproceedings. We address this argument below.\n\n¶ 18                                       B. Standing\n\n¶ 19           Plaintiff asserts it need not have been a party to the administrative proceedings in\n\norder to have standing to seek administrative review in the circuit court. According to plaintiff,\n\nthe \"party\" requirement comes solely from the Administrative Review Law, which is\n\ninapplicable to proceedings under the Livestock Act.\n\n¶ 20           Plaintiff relies on Greer v. Illinois Housing Development Authority, 122 Ill. 2d\n\n462, 492-93, 524 N.E.2d 561, 574-75 (1988), in support of its argument that common-law\n\nstanding requires only some injury in fact to a legally cognizable interest. Greer involved the\n\nIllinois Housing Development Act (Housing Act), which, among other things, created the Illinois\n\nHousing Development Authority (Authority). Id. at 477, 524 N.E.2d at 567. The Housing Act\n\nwas created in response to public-housing programs which \"segregate[d] poor people in large,\n\nghetto-like high-rises, which inevitably became focal points for crime, delinquency, illegitimacy,\n\nand disease.\" Id. at 472, 524 N.E.2d at 565. The purpose of the Housing Act was to eliminate\n\nthese \"slums\" by providing assistance for low and moderate income housing. Id. at 477, 524\n\nN.E.2d at 567. The Authority was charged with ensuring this housing would be available to\n\npersons of varied economic means to eliminate the large concentrations of poor people in large,\n\nghetto-like high-rises. Id. at 474, 524 N.E.2d at 566.\n\n¶ 21           In Greer, the Authority approved funding for the development of 48 housing\n\nunits, all of which would be available for rental only to very low income families. Id. at 481,\n\n524 N.E.2d at 569-70. The plaintiffs, property owners near the approved housing development,\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\fbrought suit, arguing they suffered injury in the form of diminution of property values due to the\n\nAuthority's violation of its statutory duty to promote economic heterogeneity. Id. at 485-86, 524\n\nN.E.2d at 571-72. The Authority, in part, asserted the plaintiffs did not have standing because\n\nthey could not show (1) injury in fact, or (2) that their interest was within the zone of interests\n\nthe Housing Act arguably sought to protect. Id. at 487, 524 N.E.2d at 572. The plaintiffs argued\n\nthe \"zone of interests\" test was not a requirement for standing under Illinois law. Id. at 487-88.\n\n¶ 22            Thus, the Greer court addressed the question of whether to adopt the \"zone-of-\n\ninterests\" test used by federal courts in determining whether a plaintiff had standing to challenge\n\nadministrative action. Id. at 491-92, 524 N.E.2d at 574. The Greer court determined the zone-\n\nof-interests test added nothing to the doctrine of standing under Illinois law. Id.\n\n¶ 23            The Greer court held \"that standing in Illinois requires only some injury in fact to\n\na legally cognizable interest.\" Id. at 492, 524 N.E.2d at 574-75. That injury, \"whether actual or\n\nthreatened [citation], must be: (1) distinct and palpable [citation]; (2) fairly traceable to the\n\ndefendant's actions [citation]; and (3) substantially likely to be prevented or redressed by the\n\ngrant of the requested relief [citations].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. at 492-93, 524\n\nN.E.2d at 575. The court went on to note there must be an actual controversy between adverse\n\nparties such that declaratory relief would actually affect the plaintiff's claim, status, or right. Id.\n\nat 493, 524 N.E.2d at 575. Finally, the court found a diminution in property values was a legally\n\ncognizable interest and held the plaintiffs had standing. Id.\n\n¶ 24            In our view, Greer definitively stated the \"zone of interests\" test was not used in\n\nstanding analysis under Illinois law. Greer did not address the question presented to this court—\n\nwhether, under the common law, a plaintiff must be a party to an administrative action to have\n\nstanding to seek administrative review of that action.\n\n\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f¶ 25           Defendants argue it is well settled in Illinois that anyone seeking administrative\n\nreview must have been party to the administrative proceedings. In support, the Department cites\n\nonly cases in which the court reviewed administrative action under the Administrative Review\n\nLaw. See, e.g., Sierra Club, 2015 IL App (4th) 140405, ¶ 24, 29 N.E.3d 1068; Kemp-Golden v.\n\nDepartment of Children & Family Services, 281 Ill. App. 3d 869, 873, 667 N.E.2d 688, 691\n\n(1996). VMC cites People ex rel. Solon v. Lower, 254 Ill. 306, 313, 98 N.E. 557, 559 (1912), for\n\nthe proposition \"that to entitle one to sue out a writ of certiorari he must have been a party to the\n\nproceeding of which he seeks review and must have an interest in the proceeding that is direct\n\nand immediate.\" For the same proposition, VMC also cites People ex rel. Leach v. County of\n\nVermilion County, 210 Ill. 209, 71 N.E. 368 (1904).\n\n¶ 26           Both defendants rely on Helping Others, 406 Ill. App. 3d 669, 941 N.E.2d 347.\n\nIn Helping Others, the Second District addressed whether a citizens group opposed to the\n\nconstruction of a hog facility had standing to appeal the Department's determination that the hog\n\nfarm \"more likely than not\" met the requirements of the Livestock Act. Id. at 672, 941 N.E.2d at\n\n352. The Second District held nothing in the Livestock Act granted the plaintiffs status as a\n\nparty of record. Id. at 682, 941 N.E.2d at 360-61. The plaintiffs argued, as they do in the instant\n\ncase, that the \"part[y] of record\" requirement was restricted to the Administrative Review Law.\n\nId. at 682, 941 N.E.2d at 361. The Second District disagreed because common-law methods of\n\nadministrative review did not grant courts greater authority than when statutory methods apply.\n\nId.\n\n¶ 27           As in the instant case, the Helping Others plaintiffs asserted they had standing\n\nunder Greer. Id. at 682, 941 N.E.2d at 361. The Second District court distinguished Greer on\n\nthe basis of the nature of the action. In the Second District's view, Greer involved a\n\n\n\n                                                -8-\n\f\"nonadjudicatory administrative decision,\" while the Helping Others action was a \"quasi-judicial\n\ndecision as to whether a party has satisfied specific statutory factors.\" (Internal quotation marks\n\nomitted.) Id. at 683, 941 N.E.2d at 361. The Helping Others court held Greer did nothing to\n\nchange the general requirement that a party seeking administrative review must have been a\n\nparty of record to the administrative proceeding. Id. (citing Williams v. Department of Labor, 76\n\nIll. 2d 72, 389 N.E.2d 1177 (1979)).\n\n¶ 28           Plaintiff contends the only other decision to consider the Helping Others standing\n\ndecision rejected it. See CBS Outdoor, Inc. v. Department of Transportation, 2012 IL App (1st)\n\n111387, 970 N.E.2d 509. This is a disingenuous characterization of CBS Outdoor. First, the\n\nCBS Outdoor court found the issue of standing had been forfeited. Id. ¶ 24. However, the court\n\ndid find the plaintiff had standing and considered the merits of the appeal. Id. ¶ 25. In CBS\n\nOutdoor, the plaintiff and one of the defendants, Diehl, had an agreement whereby the plaintiff\n\ncould keep a billboard on Diehl's property until September 26, 2009. Id. ¶ 2. On June 26, 2009,\n\nDiehl applied for a permit from the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) for the\n\nbillboard. Id. ¶ 3. That permit was ultimately denied. The plaintiff then filed an application for\n\na permit for a billboard on a different piece of property owned by Diehl a short distance away.\n\nThereafter, Diehl \"amended\" his original application. Id. ¶ 15. The plaintiff submitted a\n\nmemorandum to IDOT arguing Diehl's amendment was untimely. Id. ¶ 16. IDOT thereafter\n\ngranted Diehl's permit and denied the plaintiff's permit because there was an existing permit for a\n\nbillboard within a certain distance. That \"existing permit\" was Diehl's untimely amended\n\napplication. Id. ¶ 18.\n\n¶ 29           Although the plaintiff in CBS Outdoor was not technically a \"party\" to Diehl's\n\napplication for a permit, the facts make clear the plaintiff and Diehl stood in a position adverse to\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\feach other and IDOT's actions affected the plaintiff's legal rights and interests. Unlike the instant\n\ncase, the plaintiff was involved in administrative proceedings before IDOT and IDOT's actions\n\non Diehl's applications adversely affected the legal rights and interests of the plaintiff related to\n\nthe IDOT's authority. The CBS Outdoor court never even mentioned the Second District's\n\nstanding decision in Helping Others. We hardly find it accurate to suggest the CBS Outdoor\n\ncourt roundly rejected that decision. Moreover, we find the nature of the interest asserted by the\n\nplaintiff in CBS Outdoor substantially different from the nature of the interest asserted in the\n\ninstant case and in Helping Others.\n\n¶ 30           In this case, plaintiff asserts diminution of property values as its \"injury\" to a\n\n\"legally cognizable interest.\" While we agree that is indeed an injury, we think this position\n\nignores some pertinent principles of the standing doctrine.\n\n¶ 31           The standing doctrine ensures only those parties with a real interest in the\n\noutcome of a controversy raise issues for review. Sierra Club, 2015 IL App (4th) 140405, ¶ 22,\n\n29 N.E.3d 1068. \"The gravamen of standing is a real interest in the outcome of the controversy,\"\n\n(Stevens v. McGuireWoods LLP, 2015 IL 118652, ¶ 23, 43 N.E.3d 923), and that interest must be\n\nmore than mere concern about the outcome. Underground Contractors Ass'n v. City of Chicago,\n\n66 Ill. 2d 371, 376, 362 N.E.2d 298, 301 (1977). \"The case must, therefore, present a concrete\n\ndispute admitting of an immediate and definitive determination of the parties' rights, the\n\nresolution of which will aid in the termination of the controversy or some part thereof.\" Id. at\n\n375, 362 N.E.2d at 300. That dispute must \"touch the legal relations of parties who stand in a\n\nposition adverse to one another.\" Id. at 376, 362 N.E.2d at 301. Standing is a component of\n\njusticiability and must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Ferguson v. Patton, 2013 IL 112488,\n\n¶ 22, 985 N.E.2d 1000.\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f¶ 32           In the instant case, at the administrative proceeding, plaintiff was given the\n\nopportunity to present testimony and evidence regarding the Livestock Act siting criteria.\n\nHowever, nothing about that proceeding \"touched the legal relations\" between VMC and\n\nplaintiff. That proceeding was an informational meeting, designed to allow members of the\n\ncommunity to (1) ask questions of the owner or operator of the proposed livestock facility, (2)\n\nask questions of the Department, and (3) present testimony or evidence relevant to the Livestock\n\nAct criteria. Nothing in the Livestock Act gave the Department the power to adjudicate or\n\notherwise make a determination regarding plaintiff's legal rights or property interests. Unlike the\n\nplaintiff in CBS Outdoor, the Department in this case had no authority to take any action that\n\ndirectly affected plaintiff's asserted legal interests. We find the attenuation here to be sufficient\n\nto deprive plaintiff of standing.\n\n¶ 33           This does not necessarily mean that, for the purposes of standing in the context of\n\nadministrative review not governed by the Administrative Review Law, the aggrieved party must\n\nbe a party of record to the administrative proceeding. However, in this case, more is needed.\n\nThe Department must have some sort of authority, granted by statute, to take action which would\n\ndirectly affect the asserted interest. For example, our standing determination in this case might\n\nwell have been different if plaintiff's property were within an applicable setback over which the\n\nDepartment had statutory authority to take action pursuant to a request for a setback decrease.\n\n510 ILCS 77/35(f) (West 2014). However, the members of Save Our Sandy who do live within\n\nthe \"populated area\" setback unfortunately cannot assert this as a basis for standing. The\n\n\"populated area\" setback is only applicable when there is actually a populated area. The area at\n\nissue here clearly does not meet the qualifications of a populated area. The Livestock Act\n\ndefines \"populated area\" as \"any area where at least 10 inhabited non-farm residences are located\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\for where at least 50 persons frequent a common place of assembly or a non-farm business at\n\nleast once per week.\" 510 ILCS 77/10.60 (West 2014). The record shows the area at issue has\n\nneither 10 inhabited non-farm residences, nor a common place of assembly or non-farm business\n\nwhich 50 persons frequent on a weekly basis. Accordingly, the populated area setback is\n\ninapplicable.\n\n¶ 34            This position is supported by the cases VMC cites from the early twentieth\n\ncentury, Solon, 254 Ill. 306, 98 N.E. 557, and Leach, 210 Ill. 209, 71 N.E. 368. Both cases\n\ninvolved writs of certiorari governed by common-law standing requirements and both required a\n\nplaintiff to \"have been a party to the proceeding of which he seeks review and must have an\n\ninterest in the proceeding that is direct and immediate.\" Solon, 254 Ill. at 313, 98 N.E. at 559.\n\nSee Leach, 210 Ill. at 212, 71 N.E. at 369. This seems to indicate that, at the common law,\n\ncertiorari included party status as a requirement for standing. Because no recent court has\n\ndirectly addressed whether the common law requires party status, we find these citations\n\npersuasive. (The court in Helping Others simply assumed standing required party status and\n\nrelied on cases which applied the Administrative Review Law, therefore we do not find the\n\nanalysis to be sufficiently on point.) However, as indicated above, we do not find the common\n\nlaw necessarily requires a person be a party of record to the administrative proceedings. Again,\n\nmatters of justiciability and standing must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Ferguson, 2013\n\nIL 112488, ¶ 22, 985 N.E.2d 1000. Accordingly, in this case, we conclude plaintiff has not\n\nshown a sufficient interest, such that there exists a \"concrete dispute admitting of an immediate\n\nand definitive determination of the parties' rights, the resolution of which will aid in the\n\ntermination of the controversy or some part thereof,\" to assert standing to seek reconsideration of\n\nthe Department's determination VMC's notice of intent to construct \"more likely than not\" met\n\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\fthe Livestock Act's requirements. Underground Contractors Ass'n, 66 Ill. 2d at 375, 362 N.E.2d\n\nat 300.\n\n¶ 35                                  III. CONCLUSION\n\n¶ 36          For the reasons stated, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n\n¶ 37          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                              - 13 -\n\f¶ 38           JUSTICE POPE, specially concurring:\n\n¶ 39           While I agree we are bound by the law cited in the majority decision to deny\n\nplaintiff's standing, I write separately to highlight a very real problem with legislation like that at\n\nissue here. Under the Livestock Act, if VMC were denied a permit, it would have the right to\n\nseek administrative review of that decision. However, if the permit is granted to VMC\n\nerroneously, only a person within the occupied residence setback area of 1,760 feet would have\n\nthe right to object. No one else could do so, even if their property or health would be negatively\n\nimpacted. Instead, the Illinois Attorney General's position is such people would have the right to\n\nbring a nuisance action after the facility was constructed or an anticipatory nuisance action to\n\nseek redress for any injuries they might suffer.\n\n¶ 40           Our supreme court noted in Board of Education of Roxana Community School\n\nDistrict No. 1 v. Pollution Control Board, 2013 IL 115473, ¶ 25, 998 N.E.2d 1256, 1263:\n\n                       \"We recognize, of course, that legitimate concerns may\n\n               arise when the only parties permitted to participate in the\n\n               regulatory process are regulators and the companies they regulate.\n\n               That, however, is a matter for the General Assembly. The\n\n               responsibility for the wisdom of legislation rests with the\n\n               legislature, and courts may not rewrite statutes to make them\n\n               consistent with the court's idea of orderliness and public policy.\n\n               [Citation.]\"\n\n¶ 41        Disagree though I may with the legislation, nevertheless, I am bound to follow the\n\nlaw.

The notice proposed the construction of a hog farm with 3,384 animal\n\nunits. In April 2014, at the request of Marshall County, the Department held a public\n\ninformational meeting regarding the proposed hog farm. In October 2014, the Department\n\ndetermined the proposed hog farm \"more likely than not\" met the requirements of the Livestock\n\nManagement Facilities Act (Livestock Act or Act) (510 ILCS 77/1 to 999 (West 2014)). In\n\nFebruary 2015, plaintiff, Save Our Sandy, filed a petition for certiorari, seeking review of the\n\nDepartment's decision. The Department and VMC filed separate motions to dismiss pursuant to\n\fsection 2-619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West\n\n2014)). The trial court granted the motions to dismiss, finding plaintiff did not have standing to\n\nseek review of the Department's decision because plaintiff was not a party of record in the\n\nadministrative proceedings.\n\n¶2             Plaintiff appeals, arguing standing requires only some injury to a legally\n\ncognizable interest, a standard which plaintiff has met. Specifically, plaintiff argues it need not\n\nbe a party of record in the administrative proceedings to assert standing. Alternatively, plaintiff\n\nargues some of its members were parties of record to the administrative proceeding and therefore\n\nhave standing. We disagree.\n\n¶3                                      I. BACKGROUND\n\n¶4             In February 2014, VMC filed a \"Notice of Intent to Construct\" with the\n\nDepartment. The notice proposed the construction of a hog farm with 3,384 animal units in\n\nMarshall County. The application also contained the names and addresses of residents who were\n\nwithin the setback limits contained within the Livestock Act. In April 2014, at the request of\n\nMarshall County, the Department held a public informational meeting regarding the proposed\n\nhog farm. Some members of Save Our Sandy testified and presented written evidence at the\n\ninformational meeting.\n\n¶5             In October 2014, the Department determined the proposed hog farm \"more likely\n\nthan not\" met the requirements of the Livestock Act (510 ILCS 77/12.1(a) (West 2014)). In\n\nNovember 2014, plaintiff filed a petition for reconsideration, asking the Department to\n\nreconsider its approval of VMC's notice of intent to construct. In January 2015, the Department\n\ndenied the petition, finding plaintiff, as a nonparty, did not have standing to seek stay or\n\nreconsideration under the applicable administrative regulations.\n\n\n\n                                                -2-\n\f¶6              In February 2015, plaintiff, Save Our Sandy, filed a petition for certiorari,\n\nseeking review of the Department's determination the proposed hog farm \"more likely than not\"\n\nmet the provisions of the Livestock Act. The Department and VMC filed separate motions to\n\ndismiss pursuant to section 2-619(a)(9) of the Code (735 ILCS 5/2-619(a)(9) (West 2014)),\n\narguing plaintiff did not have standing to seek administrative review. In July 2015, the trial court\n\ngranted the motions to dismiss.\n\n¶7              This appeal followed.\n\n¶8                                          II. ANALYSIS\n\n¶9              Plaintiff appeals, arguing the trial court erred in granting the motions to dismiss.\n\nDefendants argue plaintiff does not have standing to seek review because it was not a party to the\n\nadministrative proceeding. Plaintiff contends the \"party\" requirement is limited to review under\n\nthe Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3-101 to 3-113 (West 2014)). Plaintiff argues it\n\nhas suffered an injury to a legally cognizable interest and nothing more is required to show\n\nstanding for a petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\n¶ 10            \"A common law writ of certiorari is a general method for obtaining circuit court\n\nreview of administrative actions when the act conferring power on the agency does not expressly\n\nadopt the Administrative Review Law and provides for no other form of review.\" Hanrahan v.\n\nWilliams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2148929\"><a href=\"/opinion/2148929/hanrahan-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">268</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 272, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2148929\"><a href=\"/opinion/2148929/hanrahan-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">673</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 253 (1996).

We interpret all\n\nthe pleadings and supporting documents in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.\n\nOur review of a section 2-619 motion to dismiss is de novo. Id.\n\n¶ 12            We first consider the provisions of the Livestock Act and the relevant\n\nadministrative regulations.\n\n¶ 13                        A. The Livestock Management Facilities Act\n\n¶ 14            The Livestock Act governs the procedures and standards for Department\n\noversight of the construction of livestock production facilities. 510 ILCS 77/1 to 999 (West\n\n2014). The purpose of the Act is to ensure Illinois maintains an economically viable livestock\n\nindustry while also protecting the environment. 510 ILCS 77/5(b) (West 2014). The Act\n\nrequires an owner or operator to file a \"notice of intent to construct\" a livestock facility with the\n\nDepartment prior to construction. 510 ILCS 77/11(a) (West 2014). When the Department\n\nreceives a notice of intent to construct a facility such as the one at issue in this case (i.e., a\n\nfacility with more than 1,000 animal units), the Department must send the notice to the\n\nappropriate county board and publish public notice in a newspaper within the county. 510 ILCS\n\n77/12(a) (West 2014).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  -4-\n\f¶ 15           The county board may request an \"informational meeting\" at its discretion, or the\n\ncounty board can be compelled to request one when petitioned to do so by 75 or more county\n\nresidents. 510 ILCS 77/12(a) (West 2014). The Act requires notice to the public of the\n\ninformational meeting. Following the informational meeting, the county board must submit \"an\n\nadvisory, non-binding recommendation\" as to whether the livestock facility meets the sitting\n\ncriteria. 510 ILCS 77/12(b) (West 2014). The relevant administrative regulation requires the\n\nDepartment to allow members of the public to ask questions and present oral or written\n\ncomments concerning the proposed livestock facility. 8 Ill. Adm. Code 900.405(d) (2003).\n\nFollowing the informational meeting, receipt of the county board's recommendation, and any\n\nfurther information necessary, the Department issues a final determination as to whether the\n\nproposed livestock facility \"more likely than not\" meets the requirements of the Livestock Act.\n\n510 ILCS 77/12.1(a) (West 2014). The relevant administrative regulation provides the procedure\n\nfor stay or reconsideration of any final determination \"shall be as provided for in the\n\nDepartment's administrative rules.\" 8 Ill. Adm. Code 900.407(f) (2003). In turn, the germane\n\nregulation governing petitions for reconsideration provides, \"[t]he respondent in any contested\n\ncase may request reconsideration.\" 8 Ill. Adm. Code 1.114 (1992).\n\n¶ 16           The Livestock Act also prescribes setbacks, which, in pertinent part, dictate the\n\ndistance a livestock facility must be from (1) a populated area, and (2) an occupied residence.\n\n510 ILCS 77/35(c)(4) (West 2014). Populated area is defined as \"any area where at least 10\n\ninhabited non-farm residences are located or where at least 50 persons frequent a common place\n\nof assembly or a non-farm business at least once per week.\" 510 ILCS 77/10.60 (West 2014).\n\n¶ 17           One resident lived within the \"occupied residence\" setback distance of 1,760 feet,\n\nand he waived the setback distance. Some members of Save Our Sandy lived within the\n\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\f\"populated area\" setback distance. Plaintiff contends this \"populated area\" setback gave them\n\nthe right to notice of construction and, therefore, made them parties to the administrative\n\nproceedings. We address this argument below.\n\n¶ 18                                       B. Standing\n\n¶ 19           Plaintiff asserts it need not have been a party to the administrative proceedings in\n\norder to have standing to seek administrative review in the circuit court. According to plaintiff,\n\nthe \"party\" requirement comes solely from the Administrative Review Law, which is\n\ninapplicable to proceedings under the Livestock Act.\n\n¶ 20           Plaintiff relies on Greer v. Illinois Housing Development Authority, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2063659\"><a href=\"/opinion/2063659/greer-v-ill-housing-dev-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">462</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492-93, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2063659\"><a href=\"/opinion/2063659/greer-v-ill-housing-dev-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574-75 (1988), in support of its argument that common-law\n\nstanding requires only some injury in fact to a legally cognizable interest. Greer involved the\n\nIllinois Housing Development Act (Housing Act), which, among other things, created the Illinois\n\nHousing Development Authority (Authority). Id. at 477, 524 N.E.2d at 567. The Housing Act\n\nwas created in response to public-housing programs which \"segregate[d] poor people in large,\n\nghetto-like high-rises, which inevitably became focal points for crime, delinquency, illegitimacy,\n\nand disease.\" Id. at 472, 524 N.E.2d at 565. The purpose of the Housing Act was to eliminate\n\nthese \"slums\" by providing assistance for low and moderate income housing. Id. at 477, 524\n\nN.E.2d at 567. The Authority was charged with ensuring this housing would be available to\n\npersons of varied economic means to eliminate the large concentrations of poor people in large,\n\nghetto-like high-rises. Id. at 474, 524 N.E.2d at 566.\n\n¶ 21           In Greer, the Authority approved funding for the development of 48 housing\n\nunits, all of which would be available for rental only to very low income families. Id. at 481,\n\n524 N.E.2d at 569-70. The plaintiffs, property owners near the approved housing development,\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\fbrought suit, arguing they suffered injury in the form of diminution of property values due to the\n\nAuthority's violation of its statutory duty to promote economic heterogeneity. Id. at 485-86, 524\n\nN.E.2d at 571-72. The Authority, in part, asserted the plaintiffs did not have standing because\n\nthey could not show (1) injury in fact, or (2) that their interest was within the zone of interests\n\nthe Housing Act arguably sought to protect. Id. at 487, 524 N.E.2d at 572. The plaintiffs argued\n\nthe \"zone of interests\" test was not a requirement for standing under Illinois law. Id. at 487-88.\n\n¶ 22            Thus, the Greer court addressed the question of whether to adopt the \"zone-of-\n\ninterests\" test used by federal courts in determining whether a plaintiff had standing to challenge\n\nadministrative action. Id. at 491-92, 524 N.E.2d at 574. The Greer court determined the zone-\n\nof-interests test added nothing to the doctrine of standing under Illinois law. Id.\n\n¶ 23            The Greer court held \"that standing in Illinois requires only some injury in fact to\n\na legally cognizable interest.\" Id. at 492, 524 N.E.2d at 574-75. That injury, \"whether actual or\n\nthreatened [citation], must be: (1) distinct and palpable [citation]; (2) fairly traceable to the\n\ndefendant's actions [citation]; and (3) substantially likely to be prevented or redressed by the\n\ngrant of the requested relief [citations].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id. at 492-93, 524\n\nN.E.2d at 575. The court went on to note there must be an actual controversy between adverse\n\nparties such that declaratory relief would actually affect the plaintiff's claim, status, or right. Id.\n\nat 493, 524 N.E.2d at 575. Finally, the court found a diminution in property values was a legally\n\ncognizable interest and held the plaintiffs had standing. Id.\n\n¶ 24            In our view, Greer definitively stated the \"zone of interests\" test was not used in\n\nstanding analysis under Illinois law. Greer did not address the question presented to this court—\n\nwhether, under the common law, a plaintiff must be a party to an administrative action to have\n\nstanding to seek administrative review of that action.\n\n\n\n                                                  -7-\n\f¶ 25           Defendants argue it is well settled in Illinois that anyone seeking administrative\n\nreview must have been party to the administrative proceedings. In support, the Department cites\n\nonly cases in which the court reviewed administrative action under the Administrative Review\n\nLaw.

See CBS Outdoor, Inc. v.

This is a disingenuous characterization of CBS Outdoor. First, the\n\nCBS Outdoor court found the issue of standing had been forfeited. Id. ¶ 24. However, the court\n\ndid find the plaintiff had standing and considered the merits of the appeal. Id. ¶ 25. In CBS\n\nOutdoor, the plaintiff and one of the defendants, Diehl, had an agreement whereby the plaintiff\n\ncould keep a billboard on Diehl's property until September 26, 2009. Id. ¶ 2. On June 26, 2009,\n\nDiehl applied for a permit from the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) for the\n\nbillboard. Id. ¶ 3. That permit was ultimately denied. The plaintiff then filed an application for\n\na permit for a billboard on a different piece of property owned by Diehl a short distance away.\n\nThereafter, Diehl \"amended\" his original application. Id. ¶ 15. The plaintiff submitted a\n\nmemorandum to IDOT arguing Diehl's amendment was untimely. Id. ¶ 16. IDOT thereafter\n\ngranted Diehl's permit and denied the plaintiff's permit because there was an existing permit for a\n\nbillboard within a certain distance. That \"existing permit\" was Diehl's untimely amended\n\napplication. Id. ¶ 18.\n\n¶ 29           Although the plaintiff in CBS Outdoor was not technically a \"party\" to Diehl's\n\napplication for a permit, the facts make clear the plaintiff and Diehl stood in a position adverse to\n\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\feach other and IDOT's actions affected the plaintiff's legal rights and interests. Unlike the instant\n\ncase, the plaintiff was involved in administrative proceedings before IDOT and IDOT's actions\n\non Diehl's applications adversely affected the legal rights and interests of the plaintiff related to\n\nthe IDOT's authority. The CBS Outdoor court never even mentioned the Second District's\n\nstanding decision in Helping Others. We hardly find it accurate to suggest the CBS Outdoor\n\ncourt roundly rejected that decision. Moreover, we find the nature of the interest asserted by the\n\nplaintiff in CBS Outdoor substantially different from the nature of the interest asserted in the\n\ninstant case and in Helping Others.\n\n¶ 30           In this case, plaintiff asserts diminution of property values as its \"injury\" to a\n\n\"legally cognizable interest.\" While we agree that is indeed an injury, we think this position\n\nignores some pertinent principles of the standing doctrine.\n\n¶ 31           The standing doctrine ensures only those parties with a real interest in the\n\noutcome of a controversy raise issues for review.

That dispute must \"touch the legal relations of parties who stand in a\n\nposition adverse to one another.\" Id. at 376, 362 N.E.2d at 301. Standing is a component of\n\njusticiability and must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Ferguson v. Patton, 2013 IL 112488,\n\n¶ 22, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n\n\n\n                                                - 10 -\n\f¶ 32           In the instant case, at the administrative proceeding, plaintiff was given the\n\nopportunity to present testimony and evidence regarding the Livestock Act siting criteria.\n\nHowever, nothing about that proceeding \"touched the legal relations\" between VMC and\n\nplaintiff. That proceeding was an informational meeting, designed to allow members of the\n\ncommunity to (1) ask questions of the owner or operator of the proposed livestock facility, (2)\n\nask questions of the Department, and (3) present testimony or evidence relevant to the Livestock\n\nAct criteria. Nothing in the Livestock Act gave the Department the power to adjudicate or\n\notherwise make a determination regarding plaintiff's legal rights or property interests. Unlike the\n\nplaintiff in CBS Outdoor, the Department in this case had no authority to take any action that\n\ndirectly affected plaintiff's asserted legal interests. We find the attenuation here to be sufficient\n\nto deprive plaintiff of standing.\n\n¶ 33           This does not necessarily mean that, for the purposes of standing in the context of\n\nadministrative review not governed by the Administrative Review Law, the aggrieved party must\n\nbe a party of record to the administrative proceeding. However, in this case, more is needed.\n\nThe Department must have some sort of authority, granted by statute, to take action which would\n\ndirectly affect the asserted interest. For example, our standing determination in this case might\n\nwell have been different if plaintiff's property were within an applicable setback over which the\n\nDepartment had statutory authority to take action pursuant to a request for a setback decrease.\n\n510 ILCS 77/35(f) (West 2014). However, the members of Save Our Sandy who do live within\n\nthe \"populated area\" setback unfortunately cannot assert this as a basis for standing. The\n\n\"populated area\" setback is only applicable when there is actually a populated area. The area at\n\nissue here clearly does not meet the qualifications of a populated area. The Livestock Act\n\ndefines \"populated area\" as \"any area where at least 10 inhabited non-farm residences are located\n\n\n\n                                                - 11 -\n\for where at least 50 persons frequent a common place of assembly or a non-farm business at\n\nleast once per week.\" 510 ILCS 77/10.60 (West 2014). The record shows the area at issue has\n\nneither 10 inhabited non-farm residences, nor a common place of assembly or non-farm business\n\nwhich 50 persons frequent on a weekly basis. Accordingly, the populated area setback is\n\ninapplicable.\n\n¶ 34            This position is supported by the cases VMC cites from the early twentieth\n\ncentury, Solon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">557</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and Leach, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">210</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">368</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Both cases\n\ninvolved writs of certiorari governed by common-law standing requirements and both required a\n\nplaintiff to \"have been a party to the proceeding of which he seeks review and must have an\n\ninterest in the proceeding that is direct and immediate.\" Solon, 254 Ill. at 313, 98 N.E. at 559.\n\nSee Leach, 210 Ill. at 212, 71 N.E. at 369. This seems to indicate that, at the common law,\n\ncertiorari included party status as a requirement for standing. Because no recent court has\n\ndirectly addressed whether the common law requires party status, we find these citations\n\npersuasive. (The court in Helping Others simply assumed standing required party status and\n\nrelied on cases which applied the Administrative Review Law, therefore we do not find the\n\nanalysis to be sufficiently on point.) However, as indicated above, we do not find the common\n\nlaw necessarily requires a person be a party of record to the administrative proceedings. Again,\n\nmatters of justiciability and standing must be decided on a case-by-case basis. Ferguson, 2013\n\nIL 112488, ¶ 22, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Accordingly, in this case, we conclude plaintiff has not\n\nshown a sufficient interest, such that there exists a \"concrete dispute admitting of an immediate\n\nand definitive determination of the parties' rights, the resolution of which will aid in the\n\ntermination of the controversy or some part thereof,\" to assert standing to seek reconsideration of\n\nthe Department's determination VMC's notice of intent to construct \"more likely than not\" met\n\n\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\fthe Livestock Act's requirements.

Under the Livestock Act, if VMC were denied a permit, it would have the right to\n\nseek administrative review of that decision. However, if the permit is granted to VMC\n\nerroneously, only a person within the occupied residence setback area of 1,760 feet would have\n\nthe right to object. No one else could do so, even if their property or health would be negatively\n\nimpacted. Instead, the Illinois Attorney General's position is such people would have the right to\n\nbring a nuisance action after the facility was constructed or an anticipatory nuisance action to\n\nseek redress for any injuries they might suffer.\n\n¶ 40           Our supreme court noted in Board of Education of Roxana Community School\n\nDistrict No. 1 v.
