No.\n                                                                   SCCVCV1301013)\n         v.\n\nCOUNTY OF SISKIYOU et al.,\n\n                  Defendants and Respondents.\n\n\n\n\n         Appellant Thomas P. Guarino (Guarino) appeals from an order of the superior\ncourt granting an “anti-SLAPP” (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) motion\nto strike his First Amended Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section\n425.16, undesignated section references are to the Code of Civil Procedure. The motion\nwas filed by defendants County of Siskiyou (County), individual members of the Board\nof Supervisors Marcia Armstrong, Grace Bennett, Michael Kobseff, Ed Valenzuela, and\n\n\n                                                          1\n\fJim Cook (the Board), as well as County Administrator, Tom Odom (collectively,\ndefendants). Guarino also appeals the trial court’s order sustaining demurrers without\nleave to amend that were filed on behalf of the County, the Board, and Odom.\n       Because we affirm the order granting the Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16\nmotion, we need not decide whether the trial court erred in sustaining defendants’\ndemurrers.\n\n                               FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n       A.     The Allegations of the Complaint\n\n       Guarino’s complaint alleges the following:\n       Guarino was appointed as Siskiyou County’s County Counsel for a term of four\nyears, beginning November 2, 2008.\n       The County began an investigation into Guarino’s actions in 2011 in response to a\ncomplaint by Guarino’s subordinate, Paula Baca. The County retained an outside law\nfirm (Cota Cole LLP) to conduct the investigation, the legality of which was questioned\nby Guarino. This law firm also investigated Guarino’s claim that Baca had violated her\nduty of loyalty to the County Counsel’s office.\n       The investigation into Baca’s activities resulted in a written report in November\n2011 “which entirely exonerated [Guarino] and informed him that it was provided ‘for\nthe purpose of closing the above-referenced matter. Nothing in the investigation\nmay or will be used for any disciplinary purpose and therefore, the investigation\nreport, as indicated, will remain a confidential document.’ ” (Original emphasis.)\n       In December 2011, Guarino was appointed to a second term as county counsel to\ncommence in November 2012. At the time of his reappointment he accepted concessions\nto his salary and healthcare benefits to go into effect for the remainder of his first term.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f          In February 2012, Baca resigned and filed a government tort claim claiming\nconstructive termination. Thereafter, in March 2012, Guarino became a party to a joint\nrepresentation agreement with Cota Cole LLP.\n          Baca filed a lawsuit in federal court on August 6, 2012, naming the Board, County\nAdministrators, David Prentice of Cota Cole LLP, and various individuals, including\nGuarino. The next day, the County Clerk issued Guarino a certificate of appointment for\nhis second term and administered the oath of office.\n          Guarino further alleges the Board met illegally in closed session on August 16,\n2012, to conduct an employment review of him, and, as a result, issued a letter “ordering\n[Guarino] . . . to vacate the premises” as well as authorizing him “to retain counsel to\nrepresent him in the Baca matter at the County’s expense.” This action violated\nGovernment Code section 27641 because he was being removed as County Counsel\nwithout a section 27641 evidentiary hearing.\n          A subsequent investigation followed, which resulted in a September 7, 2012,\nreport that also exonerated Guarino, while at the same time recommending the\nprivatization of the County Counsel’s Office.\n          Guarino’s efforts to obtain counsel to represent him in the Baca matter were\nthwarted because the County refused to execute the fee agreement with his chosen\ncounsel, John Lawrence, beginning as early as August 17, 2012, and continuing up until\nthe time of his resignation.\n          On September 17, Prentice wrote Lawrence, suggesting Guarino should resign\nbecause of a conflict of interest. On September 18, 2012, the Board voted illegally to\nrescind Guarino’s appointment to a second term. The next day Prentice e-mailed\nLawrence to request a meeting on October 3. On October 3, Prentice asked Guarino to\nresign.\n          On October 4, Lawrence e-mailed Prentice complaining that he still did not have\nan executed fee agreement to represent Guarino in the Baca matter. Prentice and\n\n                                               3\n\fCalifornia State Association of Counties insurance adjuster Mark Stone “made it clear by\ntheir actions and conversations that no contract for [Guarino’s] defense attorney would be\nprovided until he resigned. Attorney Prentice indicated he was working at the Board’s\ndirection in refusing to allow Lawrence to be formally retained [as Guarino’s counsel]\nuntil [Guarino] resigned.”\n         On October 19, 2012, County Administrative Officer Tom Odom filed a 10 count\naccusation against Guarino with the County Clerk pursuant to Government Code section\n27641.\n         We note at this point that section 27641 of the Government Code provides in\nrelevant part:\n         “The county counsel shall serve for four years from the time of his appointment\nand until his successor is appointed, subject to the following: [¶] . . . [¶] \n         “(b) He may be removed at any time by the board of supervisors for neglect of\nduty, malfeasance or misconduct in office, or other good cause shown, upon written\naccusation to be filed with the board of supervisors, by a person not a member of the\nboard, and heard by the board and sustained by a three-fifths vote of the board. When an\naccusation has been so filed with the board, the board may direct the district attorney to\ninvestigate and present the accusation or may employ private counsel for that purpose.\nAll testimony before the board shall be under oath or affirmation administered by the\nboard. The board is hereby vested with the power to compel the attendance of witnesses\nand the production of books, papers and testimony and shall make such processes\navailable to the accused. A copy of the accusation shall be personally served upon the\naccused and he shall be given not less than 10 days’ time in which to file a written answer\nto the accusation. If, after hearing, it appears to the satisfaction of the board that the\naccusation has been substantiated, the board shall so notify the accused by mail. Such\nnotice shall specifically state the findings and judgment of the board, and the board shall\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fthereupon forthwith remove the accused from office and shall immediately appoint his\nsuccessor.”\n       Guarino’s complaint went on to allege:\n       Odom’s accusation was based upon conduct previously investigated and for which\nGuarino had been told there would be “no disciplinary action” and “that the investigation\nwas not for the purpose of removal from office.”\n       The Board took this action in order to force Guarino’s resignation because the\naccusation would cover many of the same issues as the Baca litigation for which he was\nstill unrepresented. Having an actual hearing on the information would have been futile\nbecause “the decision had already been made to remove [Guarino] by at least as early as\nSeptember 11, 2012, and is further demonstrated by the Board’s action of September 18,\n2012, in illegally rescinding [Guarino’s] appointment to a second term.”\n       Odom’s accusation was set for hearing on November 13, 2012, with Guarino’s\nresponse being due on November 2. Guarino “filed an answer” to the accusation on\nNovember 2 with the County Clerk and requested a continuance to February 4, 2013, to\nretain counsel. Guarino resigned the same day due to intolerable working conditions\nintentionally created by each named defendant. Thereafter, Lawrence was retained to\nrepresent Guarino. In January 2013, Guarino filed a timely Government Tort Claim.\n\n       B.     The Anti-SLAPP Motion\n\n       In pertinent part, the County, the Board, and Odom moved collectively to strike\nthe entirety of Guarino’s complaint against them on the basis that it was “filed primarily\nto chill Defendants’ valid exercise of their Constitutional rights of freedom of speech in\nconnection with statements made during and . . . connected to official proceedings\nauthorized by law and in connection with [a] public interest.” Defendants argued the\ncourt should look at the “allegedly wrongful and injury-producing conduct that provides\nthe foundation for the claim to determine whether section 415.16 applies” (citing Hylton\n\n\n                                             5\n\fv. Frank E. Rogozienski, Inc. (2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 1264, 1272; emphasis omitted) and\nthat the complained of conduct implicated all four classes of protected speech recognized\nby section 425.16 subdivision (e), which they identified as:\n              “● written or oral statements made before a judicial\n              proceeding authorized by law. (subd. (e)(1));\n              “● written or oral statements made in connection with an\n              issue under consideration by an official proceeding authorized\n              by law, (subd. (e)(2));\n              “● written or oral statements made in a public forum in\n              connection with an issue of public interest, (subd. (e)(3)); or\n              “● any other conduct in furtherance of the constitutional\n              right of free speech in connection with a public issue, (subd.\n              (e)(4)). (Code Civ. Proc., § 425.16, subd. (e).)”\n       Defendants argued that the complained of conduct set forth in Guarino’s\ncomplaint was protected by the litigation privilege found in Civil Code section 47(b), and\nthus were entitled to the benefits of section 425.16. (Citing, e.g., Briggs v. Eden Council\nfor Hope and Opportunity (1999) 19 Cal.4th 1106; Garamendi v. Golden Eagle Ins. Co.\n(2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 452, 478 [investigatory activities entitled to Civil Code section\n47(b) protection]; Frisk v. Merrihew (1974) 42 Cal.App.3d 319, 324 [board meetings as\nofficial proceedings authorized by law entitled to protection].) Regarding the merits,\ndefendants argued in pertinent part that Guarino could not show a probability of\nprevailing because there was no contract and their actions were entitled to immunity.\n       In support of their motion, the defendants requested judicial notice of certain\nmaterials, including the County’s February 20, 2013, response to Guarino’s government\ntort claim, which stated that Guarino’s complaints were in response to actions taken in an\ninvestigation of personnel matters and that Guarino was segregated “in order to maintain\nthe integrity of the investigation.” These materials also showed that the Baca suit was\n\n                                             6\n\fsettled in March 2013. They further included findings of fact by an administrative law\njudge who rejected Guarino’s claim he had been constructively discharged and had no\nalternative but to resign. The administrative law judge did not believe Guarino’s\ntestimony noting “the articulated reasons [for his constructive discharge claim] are\ncontradictory and inherently improbable.”\n       Defendants also submitted by way of declaration copies of the August 16, 2012,\nletter placing Guarino on paid administrative leave, the notice of accusation setting the\nhearing and responsive deadlines, the October 19, 2012, accusation, and the November 6,\n2012, letter accepting Guarino’s resignation and taking the accusation hearing off\ncalendar.\n       In response, Guarino made multiple arguments, including an argument that\ndefendants had not shown their action arose from protected activity, relying heavily on\nMcConnell v. Innovative Artists Talent and Literary Agency, Inc. (2009) 175 Cal.App.4th\n169 (McConnell). He also argued their actions were illegal and premised on a\nfundamental misunderstanding of the County’s powers relative to County Counsel.\n       In reply, defendants argued that they satisfied the first prong of the anti-SLAPP\nanalysis because the personnel investigation was not illegal, the accusation was not\ndeficient and was mooted by Guarino’s resignation, and the complained of conduct also\nfell within section 425.16 subdivision (e)(4) regardless of the status of the investigations.\nOn the merits, they argued that Guarino could not establish a contract, the rescission of\nappointment was legally permissible, and they were immune from liability. Defendants\nalso submitted objections to evidence offered by Guarino in opposition to the Anti-\nSLAPP motion.\n       The superior court held a hearing on the Anti-SLAPP motion and demurrers on\nMay 21, 2014, wherein it received argument on both motions. The trial judge stated on\nthe record that he had carefully reviewed the papers associated with the motions and\ninvited the parties to address any “high points” the parties wished to make. After hearing\n\n                                              7\n\fargument and the submission of the matter by the parties, the court signed a previously\nprepared order, finding that the arguments of the parties had not changed the court’s\noriginal analysis of the merits of the motions. The court further ruled on defendants’\nevidentiary objections even though it expressly found that “if I had allowed everything in,\nit wouldn’t change my decision.”\n       In its order on the motions, the court granted all requests for judicial notice and\ngranted the anti-SLAPP motions “as to all defendants and all causes of action.” It also\ngranted the demurrers without leave to amend on the basis that Guarino had failed to state\nfacts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and for uncertainty. In so doing, it\nrecognized the anti-SLAPP order mooted the demurrers, but reached the issue because of\nthe possibility of appellate review of the anti-SLAPP ruling.\n       Guarino filed a notice of appeal from the order granting the County’s anti-SLAPP\nmotion and sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend. Because we do not reach\nthe ruling on the demurrers, we need not decide whether, in the interests of justice, we\nshould deem the order sustaining the demurrers -which is not appealable - as\nincorporating a judgment of dismissal. (See Johnson v. Ralphs Grocery Co. (2012)\n204 Cal.App.4th 1097, 1101, fn. 3.)\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\n                                               I\n\n                                  The Anti-SLAPP Motion\n\n       A.     The Causes of Action At Issue on This Appeal\n\n       Guarino’s First Amended Complaint sets forth 19 causes of action. On appeal he\nchallenges the trial court’s ruling only on the First, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth,\nNinth, Tenth, and Twelfth causes of action. Thus, for purposes of appeal, he has\nabandoned any challenge to the court’s ruling on the Second, Seventh, Eleventh, and the\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fThirteenth through Nineteenth causes of action. We need address those causes of action\nno further.\n          Regarding the Third, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth and Twelfth causes of\naction, Guarino, citing the “primary difficulty in addressing each cause of action” other\nthan those addressed in his opening brief, and this court’s de novo review, incorporates\nthe points and authorities he presented on these motions to the trial court. An “appellant\nmay not simply incorporate by reference arguments made in papers filed in the trial court,\nrather than briefing them on appeal. (Garrick Development Co. v. Hayward Unified\nSchool Dist. (1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 320, 334.)” (Keyes v. Bowen (2010) 189 Cal.App.4th\n647, 656.) The challenges to these causes of action are forfeited.\n          There remain then, Guarino’s arguments relating to the First and Fourth causes of\naction.\n\n          B.    General Principles\n\n          Section 425.16 provides a mechanism to combat “a disturbing increase in lawsuits\nbrought primarily to chill the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of\nspeech and petition for the redress of grievances.” (§ 425.15, subd. (a).) “A cause of\naction against a person arising from any act of that person in furtherance of the person’s\nright of petition or free speech under the United States Constitution or the California\nConstitution in connection with a public issue shall be subject to a special motion to\nstrike, unless the court determines that the plaintiff has established that there is a\nprobability that the plaintiff will prevail on the claim.” (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(1).)\n          “[W]e evaluate an anti-SLAPP motion using a two-step process. (Navellier v.\nSletten (2002) 29 Cal.4th 82, 88.) Under the first step, the defendant must show\n[Guarino’s] cause of action arose from the defendant’s protected activity. If defendant\nsatisfies the first step, we take the second step, which is to determine whether the plaintiff\n\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fhas made a prima facie showing of success on the merits. (Id. at pp. 88–89.)” (Baughn v.\nDepartment of Forestry & Fire Protection (2016) 246 Cal.App.4th 328, 334.)\n       “Review of an order granting or denying a motion to strike under section 425.16 is\nde novo. [Citation.] We consider ‘the pleadings, and supporting and opposing affidavits\n. . . upon which the liability or defense is based.’ (§ 425.16, subd. (b)(2).) However, we\nneither ‘weigh credibility [nor] compare the weight of the evidence. Rather, [we] accept\nas true the evidence favorable to the plaintiff [citation] and evaluate the defendant’s\nevidence only to determine if it has defeated that submitted by the plaintiff as a matter of\nlaw.’ (HMS Capital, Inc. v. Lawyers Title Co. (2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 204, 212.)”\n(Soukup v. Law Offices of Herbert Hafif (2006) 39 Cal.4th 260, 269, fn. 3.)\n       While Guarino correctly notes that we review the trial court’s grant of the anti-\nSLAPP motion de novo, this does not relieve him of his duty to present reasoned\nargument in support of his claim that the anti-SLAPP motion should not have been\ngranted. (See Soukup, 39 Cal.4th at p. 294, fn. 20; Allen v. City of Sacramento (2015)\n234 Cal.App.4th 41, 52; Cal. Rules of Court, rule 8.204(a)(1)(B)-(C).)\n\n       C.     The First Cause of Action\n\n       Guarino’s First Cause of Action is styled “Breach of Employment Contract” and it\nalleges that defendants breached “an employment contract” (that “contract,” according to\nGuarino, is the appointment letter he received from the County) by preventing him “from\nperforming his duties.”\n       The “Appointment Agreement” to which his complaint refers is set forth in\nExhibit A to Guarino’s complaint. It is a letter from the Siskiyou County Administrator\ncongratulating him on his appointment as County Counsel outlining the terms of\nemployment and other benefits of the position.\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       As to this cause of action, Guarino argues only that defendants did not show that\nthe activities about which Guarino complains arose from protected activity. His\nargument is unpersuasive.\n       The anti-SLAPP statute identifies four different categories of protected conduct\nfalling within an “ ‘act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech[.]’ ”\n(§ 425.16, subd. (e).)\n       To arise from protected conduct, the County’s actions underlying Guarino’s\nclaims must themselves “have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free\nspeech.” (See Gallanis-Politis v. Medina (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 600, 610 [citing City of\nCotati v. Cashman (2002) 29 Cal.4th 69, 78].) The County’s actions may be in\nfurtherance of the right to petition even if the right does not belong to the County. (See\nVergos v. McNeal (2007) 146 Cal.App.4th 1387, 1399 (Vergos) [actions taken by\nuniversity manager to investigate and decide claim of sexual harassment brought by\nuniversity employee were privileged conduct under anti-SLAPP statute].) While County\nactions that are illegal as a matter of law may not support application of the anti-SLAPP\nstatute, mere allegations of illegality do not prevent its application. (See City of\nMontebello v. Vasquez (2016) 1 Cal.5th 409, 424 [factual and legal disputes inappropriate\nfor resolution in phase 1]; Hansen v. Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation (2008)\n171 Cal.App.4th 1537, 1545 (Hansen).)\n       In 2011 and 2012, the County received complaints from Guarino’s subordinate\nBaca that he had created a hostile workplace environment and had been harassing her.\nThe County investigated these claims over Guarino’s objections to that investigation.\nBaca ultimately filed a lawsuit concerning these claims in August 2012 naming, among\nothers, the County and Guarino, which lawsuit was not settled until March 2013. It\nappears that Guarino’s hostile conduct may not have been limited to Baca, but may also\nhave included other subordinates and staff.\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       The County had a legal duty to investigate complaints of Guarino’s misconduct\nand take remedial action to prevent further harassment. (See Gov. Code, § 12940, subds.\n(j)(1) [requiring the employer “take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from\noccurring” and must take “immediate and appropriate corrective action”], (k) [unlawful\nfor employer “to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and\nharassment from occurring”].)\n       We reject Guarino’s argument that the removal procedure found in Government\nCode section 27641 precludes the County from investigating claims of his wrongdoing\nthrough something less than a formal accusation under that statute. Guarino offers no\nauthority for that argument and, indeed, pursuant to Government Code section 25303, a\ncounty has an obligation to supervise county officers and is invested with the authority to\ninvestigate alleged improprieties. (See Steiner v. Darby (1948) 88 Cal.App.2d 481, 494.)\n       The internal investigation into wrongdoing by Guarino, which ultimately led to the\nfiling of an accusation against him pursuant to Government Code section 27641 was an\nofficial proceeding authorized by law and thus any statements made before or in\nconnection with that investigation arose from protected activity. (See, e.g., Hansen,\nsupra, 171 Cal.App.4th at p. 1544; Vergos, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at p. 1399; Code Civ.\nProc., § 425.16, subd. (e)(1)-(2).)\n       As noted, Guarino relies in large part on the court’s holding in McConnell. We\ndisagree that McConnell prevents anti-SLAPP treatment here as that case is factually\ndistinguishable. The McConnell court refused to apply the anti-SLAPP statute to claims\nthat arose out of the temporary modification of job duties done in an effort to keep clients\nand not focused on establishing the validity of claims pending in a lawsuit between the\nparties. (McConnell, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at pp. 177-178.) Notably, the McConnell\nletter modifying job duties failed to mention the lawsuit, any need to investigate, any\nalleged misconduct by the people whose job duties were being modified, or other\nmention of potential claims or resolution. (Id. at p. 178.) Here, in contrast, the actions\n\n                                             12\n\fcomplained of are inseparable from the complaints regarding Guarino’s conduct as\nCounty Counsel, the County’s investigation into that conduct, and the defense of the\nBaca action complaining of that conduct. (See, e.g., Gallanis-Politis v. Medina, supra,\n152 Cal.App.4th at p. 612 [striking retaliation claim based upon investigation and report\nmade at request of counsel in response to litigation discovery requests]; Hansen, supra,\n171 Cal.App.4th at p. 1544 [internal investigation by state government law enforcement\nagency is an official proceeding authorized by law]; Vergos, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1399.)\n        Further, Guarino’s attempt to impose liability on Board members for their votes\nrelated to this investigation and Odom’s involvement with those proceedings also fail\nbecause individual actions happening in the course of protected activity under section\n425.16 subdivision (e)(1) (board members’ votes) as well as in connection with an issue\nunder consideration by the board under section 425.16 subdivision (e)(2) are entitled to\nprotection. (See City of Montebello v. Vasquez, supra, 1 Cal.5th at pp. 422-423, 425-\n427.)\n        Thus, we hold that defendants’ actions that are the centerpiece of Guarino’s\nlawsuit arose from defendants’ protected activities within the meaning of section 425.16.\n        As noted earlier, once the court concludes that a plaintiff’s action against\ndefendants arises from protected activity, a plaintiff then must show that there is a\nprobability that plaintiff will prevail on the merits of plaintiff’s claim. On this issue,\nGuarino argues in this court only that the trial court erred in dismissing his First Cause of\nAction for Breach of Contract because he had an employment contract with the county.\nFor the reasons set forth, post, we reject that claim, too.\n        Guarino’s challenge to the trial court’s ruling on the First Cause of Action fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       D.     The Fourth Cause of Action\n\n       In the Fourth Cause of Action, Guarino alleges a “Breach of Employment Contract\nfor Constructive Discharge” pleading that the defendants breached his “employment\ncontract,” again, the appointment letter attached as an exhibit to his complaint, by\nsubjecting him to a constructive discharge.\n       As noted, once the County made the threshold showing that Guarino’s causes of\naction arose from protected conduct, the burden shifted to Guarino to show a probability\nof prevailing on the merits at trial. (Navellier v. Sletten, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 88.) This\nrequired Guarino to show his complaint for breach of contract was legally sufficient and\n“supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if\nthe evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.” (Wilson v. Parker, Covert &\nChidester (2002) 28 Cal.4th 811, 821.) In determining whether Guarino has met this\nburden, the court will “not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of\n[the] competing evidence” and will sustain the granting of the anti-SLAPP only if the\nCounty’s evidence defeats Guarino’s claim as a matter of law. (Ibid.; italics omitted.)\n       To establish a breach of contract, plaintiff must plead and provide admissible\nevidence showing: (1) that plaintiff and the County entered into a contract; (2) that\nplaintiff did everything the contract required him to do; (3) that the County had certain\nobligations under the contract; (4) that the County failed to do what the contract required;\n(5) that plaintiff was harmed; and (6) that the County’s breach of that contract was a\nsubstantial factor in causing that harm. (CACI No. 300.)\n       Guarino’s breach of contract claim does not survive the first required element of\nhis cause of action.\n       Guarino was an officer of the County, whose appointment was authorized by the\nCalifornia Constitution and Government Code. (See Ogle v. Eckel (1942) 49 Cal.App.2d\n599, 602 [county counsel is county officer]; Cal. Const. Art. XI, § 1(b) [“The Legislature\n\n\n\n                                              14\n\for the governing body may provide for other officers whose compensation shall be\nprescribed by the governing body”]; Cal. Const. Art. XI, § 4(c) & (e) [County charter to\nprovide for “other officers, their election or appointment, compensation, terms and\nremoval” as well as the “powers and duties of . . . all other county officers . . . and for the\nmanner of filling all vacancies occurring therein”]; Gov. Code, § 27640 [authorizing\nappointment of county counsel by the board]; Gov. Code, § 27641 [setting term of\nappointment at four years and creating methodology for removal from office].)\n       “ . . . [I]t is well settled in California that public employment is not held by\ncontract but by statute . . . . Nor is any vested contractual right conferred on the public\nemployee because he occupies a civil service position since it is equally well settled that\n‘[t]he terms and conditions of civil service employment are fixed by statute and not by\ncontract.’ [Citations.] Indeed, ‘[the] statutory provisions controlling the terms and\nconditions of civil service employment cannot be circumvented by purported contracts in\nconflict therewith.’ ” (Miller v. State of California (1977) 18 Cal.3d 808, 813-814; Hill v.\nCity of Long Beach (1995) 33 Cal.App.4th 1684, 1690; see, Kemmerer v. County of\nFresno (1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1426, 1432.)\n       “The public employee, thus, can have no vested contractual right in the terms of\nhis or her employment, such terms being subject to change by the proper statutory\nauthority.” (Hinchliffe v. City of San Diego (1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 722, 725.)\n       This well-settled law is the rock upon which Guarino’s breach of contract claim\nfounders. He cannot show that he had a probability of prevailing on his breach of\ncontract claim when, on this record, we cannot identify a contract with the county.\n       We recognize that the “ ‘often quoted language that public employment is not held\nby contract’ has limited force where, . . . the parties are legally authorized to enter (and\nhave in fact entered) into bilateral contracts to govern the employment relationship.\n[Citations.]” (Retired Employees Assn. of Orange County, Inc. v. County of Orange\n(2011) 52 Cal.4th 1171, 1182.) But Guarino makes no showing of such a contract here,\n\n                                              15\n\frelying solely for his claims on his appointment letter as the County Counsel which is\ninsufficient to support contract claims. (See Coyne v. Rennie (1893) 97 Cal. 590, 593\n[“mere appointment or election of a municipal officer [here, chief of police,] for a\nspecified time and salary creates no contractual relation”]; Humbert v. Castro Valley\nCounty Fire Protection Dist. (1963) 214 Cal.App.2d 1, 13 [fire captain as public officer\nunable to maintain action for breach of contract].)\n       Guarino’s employment being afforded by statute and/or ordinance only, his\ncontract claim must necessarily fail.\n\n                                             II\n\n                                        The Demurrers\n\n       Having concluded that the trial court did not err in granting defendants’ motion\nbrought pursuant to section 425.16, we need not decide whether the trial court erred in\nsustaining defendants’ demurrer to the complaint.\n\n                                        DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.

Guarino (Guarino) appeals from an order of the superior\ncourt granting an “anti-SLAPP” (Strategic Lawsuits Against Public Participation) motion\nto strike his First Amended Complaint pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section\n425.16, undesignated section references are to the Code of Civil Procedure. The motion\nwas filed by defendants County of Siskiyou (County), individual members of the Board\nof Supervisors Marcia Armstrong, Grace Bennett, Michael Kobseff, Ed Valenzuela, and\n\n\n                                                          1\n\fJim Cook (the Board), as well as County Administrator, Tom Odom (collectively,\ndefendants). Guarino also appeals the trial court’s order sustaining demurrers without\nleave to amend that were filed on behalf of the County, the Board, and Odom.\n       Because we affirm the order granting the Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16\nmotion, we need not decide whether the trial court erred in sustaining defendants’\ndemurrers.\n\n                               FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS\n\n       A.     The Allegations of the Complaint\n\n       Guarino’s complaint alleges the following:\n       Guarino was appointed as Siskiyou County’s County Counsel for a term of four\nyears, beginning November 2, 2008.\n       The County began an investigation into Guarino’s actions in 2011 in response to a\ncomplaint by Guarino’s subordinate, Paula Baca. The County retained an outside law\nfirm (Cota Cole LLP) to conduct the investigation, the legality of which was questioned\nby Guarino. This law firm also investigated Guarino’s claim that Baca had violated her\nduty of loyalty to the County Counsel’s office.\n       The investigation into Baca’s activities resulted in a written report in November\n2011 “which entirely exonerated [Guarino] and informed him that it was provided ‘for\nthe purpose of closing the above-referenced matter. Nothing in the investigation\nmay or will be used for any disciplinary purpose and therefore, the investigation\nreport, as indicated, will remain a confidential document.’ ” (Original emphasis.)\n       In December 2011, Guarino was appointed to a second term as county counsel to\ncommence in November 2012. At the time of his reappointment he accepted concessions\nto his salary and healthcare benefits to go into effect for the remainder of his first term.\n\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\f          In February 2012, Baca resigned and filed a government tort claim claiming\nconstructive termination. Thereafter, in March 2012, Guarino became a party to a joint\nrepresentation agreement with Cota Cole LLP.\n          Baca filed a lawsuit in federal court on August 6, 2012, naming the Board, County\nAdministrators, David Prentice of Cota Cole LLP, and various individuals, including\nGuarino. The next day, the County Clerk issued Guarino a certificate of appointment for\nhis second term and administered the oath of office.\n          Guarino further alleges the Board met illegally in closed session on August 16,\n2012, to conduct an employment review of him, and, as a result, issued a letter “ordering\n[Guarino] . . . to vacate the premises” as well as authorizing him “to retain counsel to\nrepresent him in the Baca matter at the County’s expense.” This action violated\nGovernment Code section 27641 because he was being removed as County Counsel\nwithout a section 27641 evidentiary hearing.\n          A subsequent investigation followed, which resulted in a September 7, 2012,\nreport that also exonerated Guarino, while at the same time recommending the\nprivatization of the County Counsel’s Office.\n          Guarino’s efforts to obtain counsel to represent him in the Baca matter were\nthwarted because the County refused to execute the fee agreement with his chosen\ncounsel, John Lawrence, beginning as early as August 17, 2012, and continuing up until\nthe time of his resignation.\n          On September 17, Prentice wrote Lawrence, suggesting Guarino should resign\nbecause of a conflict of interest. On September 18, 2012, the Board voted illegally to\nrescind Guarino’s appointment to a second term. The next day Prentice e-mailed\nLawrence to request a meeting on October 3. On October 3, Prentice asked Guarino to\nresign.\n          On October 4, Lawrence e-mailed Prentice complaining that he still did not have\nan executed fee agreement to represent Guarino in the Baca matter. Prentice and\n\n                                               3\n\fCalifornia State Association of Counties insurance adjuster Mark Stone “made it clear by\ntheir actions and conversations that no contract for [Guarino’s] defense attorney would be\nprovided until he resigned. Attorney Prentice indicated he was working at the Board’s\ndirection in refusing to allow Lawrence to be formally retained [as Guarino’s counsel]\nuntil [Guarino] resigned.”\n         On October 19, 2012, County Administrative Officer Tom Odom filed a 10 count\naccusation against Guarino with the County Clerk pursuant to Government Code section\n27641.\n         We note at this point that section 27641 of the Government Code provides in\nrelevant part:\n         “The county counsel shall serve for four years from the time of his appointment\nand until his successor is appointed, subject to the following: [¶] . . . [¶] \n         “(b) He may be removed at any time by the board of supervisors for neglect of\nduty, malfeasance or misconduct in office, or other good cause shown, upon written\naccusation to be filed with the board of supervisors, by a person not a member of the\nboard, and heard by the board and sustained by a three-fifths vote of the board. When an\naccusation has been so filed with the board, the board may direct the district attorney to\ninvestigate and present the accusation or may employ private counsel for that purpose.\nAll testimony before the board shall be under oath or affirmation administered by the\nboard. The board is hereby vested with the power to compel the attendance of witnesses\nand the production of books, papers and testimony and shall make such processes\navailable to the accused. A copy of the accusation shall be personally served upon the\naccused and he shall be given not less than 10 days’ time in which to file a written answer\nto the accusation. If, after hearing, it appears to the satisfaction of the board that the\naccusation has been substantiated, the board shall so notify the accused by mail. Such\nnotice shall specifically state the findings and judgment of the board, and the board shall\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\fthereupon forthwith remove the accused from office and shall immediately appoint his\nsuccessor.”\n       Guarino’s complaint went on to allege:\n       Odom’s accusation was based upon conduct previously investigated and for which\nGuarino had been told there would be “no disciplinary action” and “that the investigation\nwas not for the purpose of removal from office.”\n       The Board took this action in order to force Guarino’s resignation because the\naccusation would cover many of the same issues as the Baca litigation for which he was\nstill unrepresented. Having an actual hearing on the information would have been futile\nbecause “the decision had already been made to remove [Guarino] by at least as early as\nSeptember 11, 2012, and is further demonstrated by the Board’s action of September 18,\n2012, in illegally rescinding [Guarino’s] appointment to a second term.”\n       Odom’s accusation was set for hearing on November 13, 2012, with Guarino’s\nresponse being due on November 2. Guarino “filed an answer” to the accusation on\nNovember 2 with the County Clerk and requested a continuance to February 4, 2013, to\nretain counsel. Guarino resigned the same day due to intolerable working conditions\nintentionally created by each named defendant. Thereafter, Lawrence was retained to\nrepresent Guarino. In January 2013, Guarino filed a timely Government Tort Claim.\n\n       B.     The Anti-SLAPP Motion\n\n       In pertinent part, the County, the Board, and Odom moved collectively to strike\nthe entirety of Guarino’s complaint against them on the basis that it was “filed primarily\nto chill Defendants’ valid exercise of their Constitutional rights of freedom of speech in\nconnection with statements made during and . . . connected to official proceedings\nauthorized by law and in connection with [a] public interest.” Defendants argued the\ncourt should look at the “allegedly wrongful and injury-producing conduct that provides\nthe foundation for the claim to determine whether section 415.16 applies” (citing Hylton\n\n\n                                             5\n\fv.

(subd. (e)(1));\n              “● written or oral statements made in connection with an\n              issue under consideration by an official proceeding authorized\n              by law, (subd. (e)(2));\n              “● written or oral statements made in a public forum in\n              connection with an issue of public interest, (subd.

Proc., § 425.16, subd. (e).)”\n       Defendants argued that the complained of conduct set forth in Guarino’s\ncomplaint was protected by the litigation privilege found in Civil Code section 47(b), and\nthus were entitled to the benefits of section 425.16. (Citing, e.g., Briggs v.

Regarding the merits,\ndefendants argued in pertinent part that Guarino could not show a probability of\nprevailing because there was no contract and their actions were entitled to immunity.\n       In support of their motion, the defendants requested judicial notice of certain\nmaterials, including the County’s February 20, 2013, response to Guarino’s government\ntort claim, which stated that Guarino’s complaints were in response to actions taken in an\ninvestigation of personnel matters and that Guarino was segregated “in order to maintain\nthe integrity of the investigation.” These materials also showed that the Baca suit was\n\n                                             6\n\fsettled in March 2013. They further included findings of fact by an administrative law\njudge who rejected Guarino’s claim he had been constructively discharged and had no\nalternative but to resign. The administrative law judge did not believe Guarino’s\ntestimony noting “the articulated reasons [for his constructive discharge claim] are\ncontradictory and inherently improbable.”\n       Defendants also submitted by way of declaration copies of the August 16, 2012,\nletter placing Guarino on paid administrative leave, the notice of accusation setting the\nhearing and responsive deadlines, the October 19, 2012, accusation, and the November 6,\n2012, letter accepting Guarino’s resignation and taking the accusation hearing off\ncalendar.\n       In response, Guarino made multiple arguments, including an argument that\ndefendants had not shown their action arose from protected activity, relying heavily on\nMcConnell v. Innovative Artists Talent and Literary Agency, Inc. (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">169</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (McConnell). He also argued their actions were illegal and premised on a\nfundamental misunderstanding of the County’s powers relative to County Counsel.\n       In reply, defendants argued that they satisfied the first prong of the anti-SLAPP\nanalysis because the personnel investigation was not illegal, the accusation was not\ndeficient and was mooted by Guarino’s resignation, and the complained of conduct also\nfell within section 425.16 subdivision (e)(4) regardless of the status of the investigations.\nOn the merits, they argued that Guarino could not establish a contract, the rescission of\nappointment was legally permissible, and they were immune from liability. Defendants\nalso submitted objections to evidence offered by Guarino in opposition to the Anti-\nSLAPP motion.\n       The superior court held a hearing on the Anti-SLAPP motion and demurrers on\nMay 21, 2014, wherein it received argument on both motions. The trial judge stated on\nthe record that he had carefully reviewed the papers associated with the motions and\ninvited the parties to address any “high points” the parties wished to make. After hearing\n\n                                              7\n\fargument and the submission of the matter by the parties, the court signed a previously\nprepared order, finding that the arguments of the parties had not changed the court’s\noriginal analysis of the merits of the motions. The court further ruled on defendants’\nevidentiary objections even though it expressly found that “if I had allowed everything in,\nit wouldn’t change my decision.”\n       In its order on the motions, the court granted all requests for judicial notice and\ngranted the anti-SLAPP motions “as to all defendants and all causes of action.” It also\ngranted the demurrers without leave to amend on the basis that Guarino had failed to state\nfacts sufficient to constitute a cause of action and for uncertainty. In so doing, it\nrecognized the anti-SLAPP order mooted the demurrers, but reached the issue because of\nthe possibility of appellate review of the anti-SLAPP ruling.\n       Guarino filed a notice of appeal from the order granting the County’s anti-SLAPP\nmotion and sustaining the demurrers without leave to amend. Because we do not reach\nthe ruling on the demurrers, we need not decide whether, in the interests of justice, we\nshould deem the order sustaining the demurrers -which is not appealable - as\nincorporating a judgment of dismissal.

(See Soukup, 39 Cal.4th at p. 294, fn. 20; Allen v. City of Sacramento (2015)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

The First Cause of Action\n\n       Guarino’s First Cause of Action is styled “Breach of Employment Contract” and it\nalleges that defendants breached “an employment contract” (that “contract,” according to\nGuarino, is the appointment letter he received from the County) by preventing him “from\nperforming his duties.”\n       The “Appointment Agreement” to which his complaint refers is set forth in\nExhibit A to Guarino’s complaint. It is a letter from the Siskiyou County Administrator\ncongratulating him on his appointment as County Counsel outlining the terms of\nemployment and other benefits of the position.\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f       As to this cause of action, Guarino argues only that defendants did not show that\nthe activities about which Guarino complains arose from protected activity. His\nargument is unpersuasive.\n       The anti-SLAPP statute identifies four different categories of protected conduct\nfalling within an “ ‘act in furtherance of a person’s right of petition or free speech[.]’ ”\n(§ 425.16, subd. (e).)\n       To arise from protected conduct, the County’s actions underlying Guarino’s\nclaims must themselves “have been an act in furtherance of the right of petition or free\nspeech.” (See Gallanis-Politis v. Medina (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

(See City of\nMontebello v. Vasquez (2016) 1 Cal.5th 409, 424 [factual and legal disputes inappropriate\nfor resolution in phase 1]; Hansen v.

It\nappears that Guarino’s hostile conduct may not have been limited to Baca, but may also\nhave included other subordinates and staff.\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       The County had a legal duty to investigate complaints of Guarino’s misconduct\nand take remedial action to prevent further harassment. (See Gov. Code, § 12940, subds.\n(j)(1) [requiring the employer “take all reasonable steps to prevent harassment from\noccurring” and must take “immediate and appropriate corrective action”], (k) [unlawful\nfor employer “to fail to take all reasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and\nharassment from occurring”].)\n       We reject Guarino’s argument that the removal procedure found in Government\nCode section 27641 precludes the County from investigating claims of his wrongdoing\nthrough something less than a formal accusation under that statute. Guarino offers no\nauthority for that argument and, indeed, pursuant to Government Code section 25303, a\ncounty has an obligation to supervise county officers and is invested with the authority to\ninvestigate alleged improprieties. (See Steiner v. Darby (1948) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 494.)\n       The internal investigation into wrongdoing by Guarino, which ultimately led to the\nfiling of an accusation against him pursuant to Government Code section 27641 was an\nofficial proceeding authorized by law and thus any statements made before or in\nconnection with that investigation arose from protected activity. (See, e.g., Hansen,\nsupra, 171 Cal.App.4th at p. 1544; Vergos, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at p. 1399; Code Civ.\nProc., § 425.16, subd. (e)(1)-(2).)\n       As noted, Guarino relies in large part on the court’s holding in McConnell. We\ndisagree that McConnell prevents anti-SLAPP treatment here as that case is factually\ndistinguishable. The McConnell court refused to apply the anti-SLAPP statute to claims\nthat arose out of the temporary modification of job duties done in an effort to keep clients\nand not focused on establishing the validity of claims pending in a lawsuit between the\nparties. (McConnell, supra, 175 Cal.App.4th at pp. 177-178.) Notably, the McConnell\nletter modifying job duties failed to mention the lawsuit, any need to investigate, any\nalleged misconduct by the people whose job duties were being modified, or other\nmention of potential claims or resolution. (Id. at p. 178.) Here, in contrast, the actions\n\n                                             12\n\fcomplained of are inseparable from the complaints regarding Guarino’s conduct as\nCounty Counsel, the County’s investigation into that conduct, and the defense of the\nBaca action complaining of that conduct. (See, e.g., Gallanis-Politis v. Medina, supra,\n152 Cal.App.4th at p. 612 [striking retaliation claim based upon investigation and report\nmade at request of counsel in response to litigation discovery requests]; Hansen, supra,\n171 Cal.App.4th at p. 1544 [internal investigation by state government law enforcement\nagency is an official proceeding authorized by law]; Vergos, supra, 146 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1399.)\n        Further, Guarino’s attempt to impose liability on Board members for their votes\nrelated to this investigation and Odom’s involvement with those proceedings also fail\nbecause individual actions happening in the course of protected activity under section\n425.16 subdivision (e)(1) (board members’ votes) as well as in connection with an issue\nunder consideration by the board under section 425.16 subdivision (e)(2) are entitled to\nprotection. (See City of Montebello v. Vasquez, supra, 1 Cal.5th at pp. 422-423, 425-\n427.)\n        Thus, we hold that defendants’ actions that are the centerpiece of Guarino’s\nlawsuit arose from defendants’ protected activities within the meaning of section 425.16.\n        As noted earlier, once the court concludes that a plaintiff’s action against\ndefendants arises from protected activity, a plaintiff then must show that there is a\nprobability that plaintiff will prevail on the merits of plaintiff’s claim. On this issue,\nGuarino argues in this court only that the trial court erred in dismissing his First Cause of\nAction for Breach of Contract because he had an employment contract with the county.\nFor the reasons set forth, post, we reject that claim, too.\n        Guarino’s challenge to the trial court’s ruling on the First Cause of Action fails.\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       D.     The Fourth Cause of Action\n\n       In the Fourth Cause of Action, Guarino alleges a “Breach of Employment Contract\nfor Constructive Discharge” pleading that the defendants breached his “employment\ncontract,” again, the appointment letter attached as an exhibit to his complaint, by\nsubjecting him to a constructive discharge.\n       As noted, once the County made the threshold showing that Guarino’s causes of\naction arose from protected conduct, the burden shifted to Guarino to show a probability\nof prevailing on the merits at trial. (Navellier v. Sletten, supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 88.) This\nrequired Guarino to show his complaint for breach of contract was legally sufficient and\n“supported by a sufficient prima facie showing of facts to sustain a favorable judgment if\nthe evidence submitted by the plaintiff is credited.” (Wilson v. Parker, Covert &\nChidester (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2588234\"><a href=\"/opinion/2588234/wilson-v-parker-covert-chidester/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 821.) In determining whether Guarino has met this\nburden, the court will “not weigh the credibility or comparative probative strength of\n[the] competing evidence” and will sustain the granting of the anti-SLAPP only if the\nCounty’s evidence defeats Guarino’s claim as a matter of law. (Ibid.; italics omitted.)\n       To establish a breach of contract, plaintiff must plead and provide admissible\nevidence showing: (1) that plaintiff and the County entered into a contract; (2) that\nplaintiff did everything the contract required him to do; (3) that the County had certain\nobligations under the contract; (4) that the County failed to do what the contract required;\n(5) that plaintiff was harmed; and (6) that the County’s breach of that contract was a\nsubstantial factor in causing that harm. (CACI No. 300.)\n       Guarino’s breach of contract claim does not survive the first required element of\nhis cause of action.\n       Guarino was an officer of the County, whose appointment was authorized by the\nCalifornia Constitution and Government Code.
