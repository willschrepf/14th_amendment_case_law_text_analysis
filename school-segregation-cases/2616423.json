If such an\ninmate meets the criteria enumerated in Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), he\nor she will be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.1 (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (f); People v. Yearwood (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 168.)\n       After the Act went into effect, Randy Lynn Payne (defendant), an inmate serving a\nterm of 25 years to life following conviction of a felony that was not violent (as defined\nby § 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition to\nhave his sentence recalled and to be resentenced. Following a hearing, the trial court\nfound defendant “present[ed] an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if released.”\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we hold the People have the burden of\nproving, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts on which a finding that resentencing a\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety reasonably can be\nbased. Those facts are reviewed for substantial evidence. We further hold, however, that\nthe preponderance of the evidence standard does not apply to the trial court’s\ndetermination regarding dangerousness, nor does section 1170.126, subdivision (f), create\na presumption of resentencing. The ultimate decision — whether resentencing an inmate\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety — instead lies within the\nsound discretion of the trial court. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we\nconclude recently enacted section 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f). Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       On February 10, 1996, defendant was observed stealing several cases of motor oil\nfrom a convenience store/gas station in Merced.2 He subsequently led a California\nHighway Patrol officer in a pursuit on Highway 99. Defendant drove at speeds well over\n100 miles per hour, sometimes traveling partly on the center divider and other times\ntraveling on the shoulder. His driving forced other vehicles to move out of his way to\navoid collision. As defendant approached the Livingston city limits, he drove onto the\nshoulder to pass vehicles stopped at a red traffic light. Defendant lost control of the car,\nflipped over, and struck a power pole. The car had been stolen.\n       On August 12, 1996, a jury convicted defendant of two felonies: evading arrest\nwhile operating a motor vehicle (Veh. Code, § 2800.2) and petty theft with prior theft\nconvictions (§§ 488, 666).3 Defendant was found to have three prior serious or violent\nfelony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law. On April 22, 1997, he\nwas sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.\n       On or about December 21, 2012, defendant filed a petition under\nsection 1170.126. He represented he was statutorily eligible for such relief, and argued\nhe should be resentenced to a second strike term of 48 months in prison and be released\nfrom custody.\n       The People opposed the petition. They pointed to defendant’s 14-year-long record\nof criminal convictions, which included three strike convictions (one for robbery and two\nfor residential burglary); the high risk of danger to others posed by his commitment\noffense; and defendant’s admission, to the probation officer, that he had a drug problem.\n\n2      The facts of defendant’s commitment conviction are derived from our opinion in\nPeople v. Payne (May 26, 1998, F026894) [nonpub. opn.], of which we have taken\njudicial notice by separate order.\n3     The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a count charging defendant with\nunlawful taking of a motor vehicle. (Veh. Code, § 10851.)\n\n\n\n                                               3.\n\fThe People asserted defendant’s conduct in prison had been poor, as he had violated\nprison disciplinary rules on a number of occasions. The People argued that, even after\nparticipating in Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous programs over the\nyears, defendant incurred disciplinary write-ups for “narcotic diversion” — diverting\nmorphine medication he was to swallow — and possession of alcohol, most recently in\n2013. The People further argued that, if defendant were released, he would face\ndifficulty earning sufficient income by lawful means, as his prison records revealed his\nlack of marketable trade skills and lack of education. Based on the foregoing, the People\nasserted the trial court should find resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety.\n       The petition was heard on August 5, 2013.4 The court considered its own files in\nthe matter, as well as defendant’s records — his “central file” — from the California\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).\n       Information in defendant’s CDCR records included the probation officer’s report\nfor defendant’s commitment offenses. It showed defendant, who was born in 1963, had\nan adult criminal conviction record dating back to 1982. Between 1982 and 1996, he\nincurred nine misdemeanor convictions for crimes that included burglary, petty theft with\na prior conviction, and carrying a concealed weapon on his person; and seven cases in\nwhich he was convicted of one or more felonies that included multiple burglaries and\nrobbery.5 Defendant told the probation officer he dropped out of high school; started\n\n\n4      Because the judge who imposed defendant’s third strike term was retired, the\nmatter was heard by a different judge. (See § 1170.126, subd. (j).)\n5      The robbery conviction arose out of an incident in which defendant apparently\nbelieved he was reclaiming a bicycle stolen from him. Defendant and the victim argued\nover ownership of the bicycle. Defendant said he was going back to his truck to get\nsomething. When he returned, he had a plastic bag in his hand that appeared to contain a\nhandgun. The victim handed over the bicycle, which defendant placed in his truck and\ndrove away. Defendant, who was on parole from the California Rehabilitation Center,\n\n\n                                            4.\n\fusing PCP when he was 12 years old and then moved on to cocaine, heroin, LSD,\nmethamphetamine, and marijuana; and injected a mixture of cocaine and heroin as his\n“drug of choice.” He considered himself dependent on drugs, and had been dependent in\nthe past. Defendant also stated he drank three-fifths of a gallon of whiskey a week, and\ndrank wine and beer. CDCR reception center information showed defendant had a\nhistory of heart and kidney disease and that he claimed work experience in a walnut\nprocessing plant, laying train tracks, and field work.\n       Defendant’s CDCR records contained several rules violation reports. In 1998, he\nwas found guilty of possession of United States currency. In 1999, he was placed into\nadministrative segregation pending investigation into allegations of narcotics trafficking\nin the prison’s general population. In 2004, he was found guilty of mutual combat. He\nadmitted punching the other inmate who, defendant said, was only defending himself.\nDefendant characterized the inmate as “a homeboy” who was irritating him. Staff had to\nuse pepper spray and a baton strike to break up the fight. In 2006, a hypodermic syringe\nwith a needle was found in the cell defendant shared with another inmate. Defendant\nadmitted it was his, and said he found it in the garbage after a building search. In 2008,\ndefendant was found guilty of possession of tobacco. In 2010, defendant was found\nguilty of circumventing medical procedures by diverting medication. Defendant\nacknowledged he was required to place his medication into his mouth, swallow it, and\nthen allow the nurse to determine he had done so. In 2012, a random search of a cell\nassigned to defendant and another inmate revealed a garbage bag full of inmate-\nmanufactured alcohol (“‘pruno’”). Defendant stated the pruno was his. At the hearing,\nhe pled guilty to possession of inmate-manufactured alcohol and stated, “‘It wasn’t mine,\nbut I took it.’” The most recent rules violation report, dated January 1, 2013, was, again,\n\n\npled no contest pursuant to People v. West (1970) 3 Cal.3d 595 in exchange for dismissal\nof a five-year enhancement.\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\ffor circumventing medical procedures by diverting medication. Defendant stood in the\npill line for his “‘as needed’” morphine dose, placed the pill in his mouth and drank his\nwater, but did not swallow the pill. Defendant was written up multiple times for failing\nto report or being late to class or to his work assignment, being out of bounds, not being\nin his cell during inmate count, violating grooming and cell regulations, and smoking (a\nviolation of state law).\n       Defendant’s most recent annual review, dated October 31, 2012, showed him in\n“Close B” custody. His placement score was 19, the mandatory minimum for a prisoner\nwith a life sentence. His records contained numerous good reports from his prison work\nsupervisors. They also contained verification of his participation in Narcotics\nAnonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, and a victims’ awareness program over various\nperiods of time.6 He also received a certificate of proficiency as a sewing machine\noperator.\n       Defendant’s central file contained a therapeutic progress report, dated May 23,\n2013, by Dr. Mathews, a clinical psychologist at the prison.7 Mathews related defendant\nhad been able to make “some true and substantial progress” in the four years she had\nbeen treating him, and had deepened his commitment to “making something better of\nhimself.” She found he was not as “materially- driven” as in the past, and although he\nhad struggled with substance abuse issues, he had managed to successfully face them and\nwas engaged in an ongoing dialogue with her about them. She believed defendant had\n\n6      In February 2004, defendant was presented certificates of attendance attesting to\nhis regular attendance of 25 months in Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics\nAnonymous.\n7       Defendant’s file also contained voluminous interdisciplinary progress notes that\nwere listed as “Confidential Client/Patient Information.” Although the court considered\nMathews’s written notes and live testimony, it sustained a claim of privilege with respect\nto the confidential records and did not consider them in reaching its decision. We neither\nsummarize nor consider the confidential information.\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f“attained a maturity that has allowed him to no longer be the reactive, angry young man\nhe once was.” She believed he was now capable of delaying gratification. She opined he\nwould make a good candidate for resentencing under the Act.\n       Mathews testified at the hearing. She had been defendant’s primary treating\nmental health clinician since the spring of 2009. She concurred with defendant’s\nprevious clinician’s diagnoses that defendant had a “mood disorder not otherwise\nspecified” and polysubstance abuse in institutional remission.8 Although defendant was\nprescribed various medications in the past, he had taken no psychotropic medications\nsince Mathews had been treating him. Defendant’s drug addiction involved multiple\nsubstances and reportedly dated from the age of about 10 to 11 years old. Mathews was\naware defendant was prescribed morphine while on her caseload. She was concerned\nwith morphine use because she believed it contributes to depression.\n       Mathews related she and defendant had long conversations about “his short fuse”\nand “his tendency to personalize things.” She thought defendant had done “really well”\ndeveloping the capacity to look at what was truly being said so as not to personalize\ncomments. The major change Mathews saw in defendant was his ability to delay\ngratification. She found he did not have to have “some of the material comfort … he\nused to want and actively hustle to get” before he was incarcerated. Asked by defense\ncounsel if she thought the court should have concerns regarding defendant’s substance\nabuse if released, Mathews responded: “I think the Court would be wise to concern\n[itself] with whether or not he would have a stable environment. I think [defendant] is\nactually capable with very, very small amounts of money of getting back onto his feet\nbecause of his abilities and discussions with me about his interest and ideas and education\n\n\n8      A diagnosis of mood disorder is not a major mental illness. It means people have\nfluctuating capacity to cope, moodiness, depression, anxiety, and sometimes difficulty\nsleeping.\n\n\n\n                                            7.\n\fand real estate. [¶] But … I don’t feel good about him going out and not having a\nstructure. My concern would be his just, kind of, floating out there and feeling\noverwhelmed by society after 17 years of incarceration.” Mathews thought a sober living\nenvironment would be very important, and had discussed the possibility with defendant\nwho seemed receptive to the idea. Mathews was of the opinion that anyone who had ever\nhad a problem with substance abuse continued to have a problem, and she saw defendant\nas continuing to struggle in that respect.\n       Defendant testified at the hearing. He admitted having a longstanding drug\nproblem, but denied possessing or consuming any medication not prescribed for him\nduring the 17 years he had most recently been in prison, even though he could have\nobtained illicit drugs had he wanted to. Defendant was prescribed morphine from 2008\nto 2013 because of spinal problems. He explained he did not immediately swallow his\nmedication in the January 2013 incident, because his neck was swollen that morning.\nThe nurse who reported him in 2010 and 2013 was a temporary nurse; defendant took his\nmedication three times a day and never had a problem with the regular staff nurses. He\ndenied the pruno was his; he took the blame because the inmate to whom it belonged had\na parole hearing coming up. The syringe found in 2006 belonged to his cellmate, who\nwas scheduled to go home in three days.\n       Defendant testified he would never again use drugs, because it had cost him too\nmuch. Although he would not have a problem if he were released, he would be willing to\ngo into transitional housing. He had a means of support because he had won a civil\njudgment. He also had family in the Modesto area. He planned to get involved with his\nbrother in buying, fixing up, and reselling foreclosed homes, and he also planned to do\nvolunteer work.\n       The prosecutor argued that, based on the totality of the circumstances (defendant’s\nprior criminal history, the circumstances of his commitment offense, his disciplinary\nrecord, and the fact he was still struggling with substance abuse), defendant remained a\n\n                                             8.\n\fdanger to public safety. Defense counsel pointed to defendant’s explanation for some of\nthe disciplinary violations, and noted he had no write-ups for hiding or selling pills, and\nonly one assaultive-type incident. She argued he was focused on the future and had\nparticipated in drug and alcohol programs as best he could, and argued nothing had been\npresented to show he would be a risk of danger should he be released.\n       The court took the matter under submission. On August 20, 2013, the court stated\nit had spent a significant amount of time reviewing the case file and records and\nconsidering the testimony presented. Based on “all of those things,” it found “there is a\nrisk of dangerousness” with which it was “not comfortable.” It denied the petition for the\nreasons set out in its written ruling. That ruling read, in pertinent part:\n\n               “The court places the burden of persuasion on the prosecution. That\n       is, the state must convince the court, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n       that to resentence a defendant as a ‘second strike offender’ would present\n       an unreasonable risk of danger to the public. Unless the court finds the\n       defendant presents such a danger, he or she shall be resentenced. The\n       drafters of Penal Code section 1170.126 have given the court guidance on\n       pertinent factors to consider. [¶] … [¶]\n\n              “The district attorney focuses on the nature of defendant’s prior\n       criminal history, the facts and circumstances surrounding the life\n       commitment offense, the defendant’s disciplinary record while\n       incarcerated, and his life - long substance abuse problems. The\n       prosecution’s position is that, when taken together, these factors\n       demonstrate that resentencing [defendant] would pose an unreasonable risk\n       of danger to public safety. In response, the defense called Dr. Mathews .…\n\n              “The court finds Dr. Mathews[’s] opinions regarding [defendant] to\n       be unhelpful to [defendant]. The court notes that Dr. Mathews candidly\n       admits that [defendant’s] substance abuse is in institutional remission, and\n       should concern the court. She further opined that [defendant] continues to\n       have a substance abuse problem. Perhaps most importantly, Dr. Mathews\n       diagnoses [defendant] with a mood disorder (NOS) that leaves [defendant]\n       with a ‘fluctuating ability to cope’. This, combined with his ongoing\n       substance abuse problems, greatly concerns the court.\n\n            “To the extent that Dr. Mathews characterizes [defendant’s]\n       commitment offense as relatively minor, the court strongly disagrees. A\n\n                                              9.\n\f       jury convicted [defendant] of felony evading .… As cited by the\n       prosecutor, [defendant] has ‘proved himself to be a threat to public safety\n       and security’. His criminal career has been long and extensive. His prior\n       serious felony convictions were residential burglaries. The court finds that\n       those offenses do involve a high risk of physical danger, as did the evading\n       offense. His record of rehabilitation while incarcerated is sparse. Indeed,\n       he continues to receive disciplinary write - ups as recently as this year. The\n       court further places little weight on [defendant’s] explanation that he ‘took\n       the fall’ for a fellow inmate on at least two occasions. [Defendant]\n       admitted that he lied to prison authorities to achieve his goals, and the court\n       has little doubt he would be dishonest here in an attempt to win his\n       freedom.\n\n              “When taken together, the foregoing facts lead the court to find that\n       the District Attorney has, by a preponderance of the evidence, met his\n       burden of proof and persuasion. The court is convinced that [defendant]\n       would present an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if released.”\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n                             The Applicable Legal Principles\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126.9 (People v. Superior Court (Martinez) (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 979,\n989.) If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\n\n\n9      “An inmate is eligible for resentencing if: [¶] (1) The inmate is serving an\nindeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 for a conviction of a\nfelony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c)\nof Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7.

In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate’s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate’s] disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (Id., subd.

A TRIAL COURT’S ULTIMATE DETERMINATION REGARDING DANGEROUSNESS LIES\n          WITHIN ITS DISCRETION; ITS RULING, THEREFORE, IS REVIEWED FOR ABUSE OF\n          DISCRETION.\n\n          Defendant argues the trial court’s decision regarding dangerousness should be\nreviewed for substantial evidence.10 We disagree. The plain language of subdivisions (f)\nand (g) of section 1170.126 calls for an exercise of the sentencing court’s discretion.\n“‘Discretion is the power to make the decision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]”\n(People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 375.) “Where, as here, a discretionary power\nis statutorily vested in the trial court, its exercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed\non appeal except on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary,\ncapricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice.\n\n\n10      The substantial evidence test applies to an appellate court’s review of findings\nmade under the preponderance of the evidence standard. (People v. Wong (2010) 186\nCal.App.4th 1433, 1444.) Under that test, the appellate court reviews the record in the\nlight most favorable to the challenged finding, to determine whether it discloses evidence\nthat is reasonable, credible, and of solid value such that a reasonable trier of fact could\nmake the finding by a preponderance of the evidence. The appellate court “resolve[s] all\nconflicts in the evidence and questions of credibility in favor of the [finding], and …\nindulge[s] every reasonable inference the [trier of fact] could draw from the evidence.\n[Citation.]” (Ibid.)\n\n\n\n                                              11.\n\f[Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Rodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125; see\nPeople v.

We,\ntherefore, review that determination for abuse of discretion. Of course, if there is no\nevidence in the record to support the decision, the decision constitutes an abuse of\ndiscretion. (See In re Robert L. (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1066.)\n\n     B.   THE BURDEN OF PROOF BY PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE APPLIES TO PROOF\n          OF THE FACTS, NOT TO THE TRIAL COURT’S ULTIMATE DETERMINATION.\n\n          Defendant asserts a trial court cannot deny resentencing due to dangerousness\nunless the People have proved dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. The People\ncontend their burden is preponderance of the evidence.11\n\n                 “The standard of proof, the United States Supreme Court has said,\n          ‘serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the\n          relative importance attached to the ultimate decision.’ [Citation.] At one\n          end of the spectrum is the ‘preponderance of the evidence’ standard, which\n          apportions the risk of error among litigants in roughly equal fashion.\n          [Citation.] At the other end of the spectrum is the ‘beyond a reasonable\n          doubt’ standard applied in criminal cases, in which ‘our society imposes\n          almost the entire risk of error upon itself.’ [Citation.] Between those two\n          standards is the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.\n          [Citation.] These three standards are codified in California’s Evidence\n          Code. Section 115 of that code states: ‘The burden of proof may require a\n          party to … establish the existence or nonexistence of a fact by a\n          preponderance of the evidence, by clear and convincing proof, or by proof\n          beyond a reasonable doubt. [¶] Except as otherwise provided by law, the\n\n11    The parties have assumed whatever burden exists is on the People. Case law\nsupports that assumption. (E.g., People v. Flores (2014) 227 Cal.App.4th 1070, 1075-\n1076; People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1301, fn. 25\n(Kaulick).) The trial court here expressly placed the burden on the prosecution.\n\n\n\n                                                12.\n\f       burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.’\n       (Italics added.)\n\n             “If the Legislature has not established a standard of proof, a court\n       must determine the appropriate standard by considering all aspects of the\n       law. [Citation.] No standard of proof is specified in section [1170.126] .…\n\n               “‘The standard of proof that is required in a given instance has been\n       said to reflect “… the degree of confidence our society thinks [the\n       factfinder] should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a\n       particular type of adjudication.” … The standard of proof may therefore\n       vary, depending upon the gravity of the consequences that would result\n       from an erroneous determination of the issue involved.’ [Citations.]”\n       (People v. Arriaga (2014) 58 Cal.4th 950, 961-962.)\n       “In enacting section 1170.126 as part of Proposition 36, the issue before the voters\nwas not whether a defendant could or should be punished more harshly for a particular\naspect of his or her offense, but whether, having already been found to warrant an\nindeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender, he or she should now be eligible for\na lesser term.” (People v. Osuna (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1036.) Although voters\ncould have permitted automatic resentencing, under any and all circumstances, of those\neligible therefor, they did not do so. This demonstrates a recognition of two highly\nplausible scenarios: (1) Some inmates sentenced to indeterminate terms under the\noriginal version of the three strikes law for crimes not defined as serious or violent\nfelonies may have started out not posing any greater risk of danger than recidivists who\nwill now be sentenced to determinate terms as second strike offenders under the\nprospective provisions of the Act, but have become violent or otherwise dangerous while\nimprisoned, or (2) Enough time might have passed since some inmates committed their\ncriminal offenses so that those offenses no longer make such inmates dangerous, but\nother factors do. Because of the severe consequences to society that may result if a\ndangerous inmate is resentenced as a second strike offender and released to the\ncommunity upon completion of his or her term with little or no supervision (see, e.g.,\n§ 3451) and without undergoing any suitability assessment (see, e.g., In re Lawrence\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1181, 1204), we believe it appropriate to apportion the risk of error in\nroughly equal fashion.\n       Division Three of the Second District Court of Appeal has stated that, where a\ncourt’s discretion under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is concerned, the People bear\nthe burden of proving “dangerousness” by a preponderance of the evidence. (Kaulick,\nsupra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1305 & fn. 25; see Evid. Code, § 115.) That court\ndetermined this is so because “dangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence\nimposed when a defendant is resentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a\nhurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all.” (Kaulick,\nsupra, at p. 1303.) Kaulick explained:\n\n              “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly\n       situated to him, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life\n       term to which he was originally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him\n       with an opportunity to be resentenced to a lesser term, unless certain facts\n       are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the third strike sentence\n       based on the facts established at the time he was originally sentenced. As\n       such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in\n       his favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e.,\n       dangerousness), and such factor need not be established by proof beyond a\n       reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Ibid.)\n\n       In People v. Blakely (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1059-1062 (Blakely), we\nrejected the claim an inmate seeking resentencing pursuant to section 1170.126 had a\nSixth Amendment right to a jury determination, beyond a reasonable doubt, on the\nquestion of conduct constituting a disqualifying factor. We concluded that Apprendi v.\nNew Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466 (Apprendi) and its progeny (e.g., Alleyne v. United\nStates (2013) 570 U.S. ___ [133 S.Ct. 2151]; Cunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S.\n270 (Cunningham); Blakely v. Washington (2004) 542 U.S. 296) “do not apply to a\ndetermination of eligibility for resentencing under the Act.” (Blakely, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at p. 1060.) We also relied heavily on Kaulick.\n\n\n\n                                            14.\n\f       In rejecting application of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, Kaulick\ndiscussed the United States Supreme Court’s conclusion in Dillon v. United States (2010)\n560 U.S. 817, 828 (Dillon), that “a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to have essential\nfacts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward\nsentence modifications due to intervening laws.” 12 (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1304.) Kaulick found Dillon’s language applicable. Since the retrospective part of the\nAct is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate and\nprovides for a proceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward, any\nfacts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth\nAmendment issues. Thus, there is no constitutional requirement that the facts be\nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, at pp. 1304-1305.)\n       Although in Blakely, we applied Kaulick’s analysis to the initial determination of\neligibility for resentencing under the Act (Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061), it\napplies equally to the issue whether resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. A denial of an inmate’s petition does not\nincrease the penalty to which that inmate is already subject, but instead removes the\ninmate from the scope of an act of lenity on the part of the electorate to which he or she is\nnot constitutionally entitled. (Blakely, supra, at p. 1062.) That the denial is based on a\ndetermination of dangerousness does not change that conclusion.\n       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\n\n12     Pepper v. United States (2011) 562 U.S. 476 [131 S.Ct. 1229] does not undermine\nDillon’s or Kaulick’s reliance thereon. Unlike Dillon, Pepper involved a plenary\nresentencing after the defendant’s sentence had been set aside on appeal. (Pepper, supra,\n562 U.S. at p. ___ [131 S.Ct. at p. 1236].)\n\n\n\n                                             15.\n\fand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself.13 Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation.\n        Accordingly, we hold preponderance of the evidence is the applicable standard of\nproof, regardless whether we analyze the issue as one of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence\nor due process. (See People v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1076.)14\n        This does not, however, mean the trial court must apply that standard in making its\nultimate determination whether to resentence a petitioner, or we must review that\ndetermination for substantial evidence. Nor does it mean evidence of dangerousness\nmust preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation for resentencing to be denied.\n        The language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) expressly provides the petitioner\nshall be resentenced unless the court, in its discretion, makes a determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger. The statute does not say the\npetitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing would pose such a\nrisk.\n\n13      As noted, ante, we have previously discussed Kaulick in the context of the initial\ndetermination whether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under the Act. (Blakely,\nsupra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1058, 1060-1061; People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1033, 1039-1040.) Nothing we say here should be taken as disagreement with or\nmodification of those opinions. We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act and a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n14     We recognize that in the case of people who are involuntarily committed as\nnarcotics addicts or for analogous reasons, the California Supreme Court has found the\nappropriate standard of proof to be beyond a reasonable doubt. (See, e.g., People v.\nThomas (1977) 19 Cal.3d 630, 637-638.) Defendant received the protections of that\nstandard of proof (and the right to a jury trial) at the time he was found to have suffered\nhis prior strike convictions, however. (People v. Nguyen (2009) 46 Cal.4th 1007, 1015;\nPeople v. Towers (2007) 150 Cal.App.4th 1273, 1277.)\n\n\n\n                                              16.\n\f       Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126, we\nconclude the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,\nfacts from which a determination resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made. The reasons a trial court finds\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence\nshowing dangerousness versus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s\ndiscretion. The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts\nestablished by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of\ndanger by a preponderance of the evidence. (See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1065-1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence\nstandards].)\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme.15 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to\nCunningham, “three terms of imprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses.\nThe trial court’s discretion in selecting among [those] options [was] limited by\nsection 1170, subdivision (b), which direct[ed] that ‘the court shall order imposition of\nthe middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the\ncrime.’” (People v. Black (2007) 41 Cal.4th 799, 808, fn. omitted.) Trial courts had\n“broad discretion” to impose the lower or upper term instead of the middle term of\nimprisonment (People v. Scott (1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 349), and generally were required by\nthe statutes and sentencing rules to state reasons for their discretionary sentencing choices\n(ibid.). Such reasons had to be “supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the\n\n15     The determination of the appropriate penalty in a capital case “‘is “essentially\nmoral and normative …, and therefore … there is no burden of proof or burden of\npersuasion. [Citation.]” [Citation.]’ [Citations.]” (People v. McKinzie (2012) 54\nCal.4th 1302, 1362.)\n\n\n\n                                            17.\n\frecord” and reasonably related to the particular sentencing determination. (Ibid.; see\nformer Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.420(b).) Even after the DSL was reformed and\namended in response to Cunningham, so as to eliminate judicial factfinding in selection\nof the appropriate term when three possible prison terms are specified by statute,\nestablishment of facts by a preponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect\nto certain discretionary sentencing decisions. (See In re Coley (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524,\n557-558.)16\n       In People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 850-851, the California Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making its discretionary sentencing choices post-Cunningham, “the\ntrial court need only ‘state [its] reasons’ [citation]; it is not required to identify\naggravating and mitigating factors, apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, or\nspecify the ‘ultimate facts’ that ‘justify[] the term selected.’ [Citations.] Rather, the\ncourt must ‘state in simple language the primary factor or factors that support the exercise\nof discretion.’ [Citation.]” (Italics added.)\n       The trial court’s ultimate determination when considering a petition for\nresentencing under section 1170.126 is analogous to an evaluation of the relative weight\nof mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Such an evaluation “is not equivalent to a\nfactual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) It follows, then,\nthat the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, in that it\nneed not find resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not, pose an\n\n\n16      After Cunningham concluded the DSL violated a defendant’s Sixth Amendment\nright to a jury trial (Cunningham, supra, 549 U.S. at p. 281), the Legislature amended\nsection 1170 so that now “(1) the middle term is no longer the presumptive term absent\naggravating or mitigating facts found by the trial judge; and (2) a trial judge has the\ndiscretion to impose an upper, middle or lower term based on reasons he or she states.”\n(People v. Wilson (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 988, 992.) Subdivision (b) of section 1170\nstates the court “shall select the term which, in the court’s discretion, best serves the\ninterests of justice.”\n\n\n\n                                                18.\n\funreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “‘more likely than not’”].)\n       To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its\nfinding will be upheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within\n“the bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered. [Citations.]” (People\nv. Giminez (1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 72.) The facts or evidence upon which the court’s\nfinding of unreasonable risk is based must be proven by the People by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, however, and are themselves subject to our review for substantial\nevidence.17 If a factor (for example, that the petitioner recently committed a battery, is\nviolent due to repeated instances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a\npreponderance of the evidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk.\n(See People v. Cluff (2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998 [trial court abuses its discretion\nwhen factual findings critical to decision find no support in record]; cf. People v. Read\n(1990) 221 Cal.App.3d 685, 689-691 [where trial court erroneously determined defendant\nwas statutorily ineligible for probation, reviewing court was required to determine\nwhether trial court gave sufficient other reasons, supported by facts of case, for probation\ndenial].)\n\n\n\n\n17     We agree with defendant that “substantial evidence,” not the significantly more\ndeferential “some evidence” standard applicable to review of executive branch decisions\nin parole cases (see In re Rosenkrantz (2002) 29 Cal.4th 616, 658, 665), is the appropriate\nappellate standard.\n\n\n\n                                               19.\n\f   C.   SECTION 1170.126 DOES NOT ESTABLISH OR CONTAIN A PRESUMPTION A\n        PETITIONER’S SENTENCE BE REDUCED.\n\n        Defendant argues a section 1170.126 resentencing “is the converse of a Romero\nhearing and establishes a presumption that the life term be reduced to a second strike\nsentence.” (Some capitalization & underscoring omitted.)\n        In People v. Superior Court (Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 (Romero), the\nCalifornia Supreme Court held that trial courts retain discretion to strike, in furtherance\nof justice under section 1385, subdivision (a), prior felony conviction allegations in cases\nbrought under the three strikes law. (Romero, supra, at pp. 529-530.) The court\nsubsequently clarified, however, that in deciding whether to do so, “the court in question\nmust consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies\nand prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background,\ncharacter, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the scheme’s spirit, in\nwhole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been\nconvicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.” (People v. Williams, supra, 17\nCal.4th at p. 161.)\n        Because the three strikes law was intended to restrict trial courts’ discretion in\nsentencing repeat offenders, the state high court determined there were “stringent\nstandards” sentencing courts must follow in order to find a defendant should be treated as\nfalling outside the three strikes scheme. (People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at\np. 377.) The court explained:\n\n               “[T]he three strikes law not only establishes a sentencing norm, it\n        carefully circumscribes the trial court’s power to depart from this norm and\n        requires the court to explicitly justify its decision to do so. In doing so, the\n        law creates a strong presumption that any sentence that conforms to these\n        sentencing norms is both rational and proper.\n\n               “In light of this presumption, a trial court will only abuse its\n        discretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited\n        circumstances. For example, an abuse of discretion occurs where the trial\n        court was not ‘aware of its discretion’ to dismiss [citation], or where the\n\n\n                                              20.\n\f       court considered impermissible factors in declining to dismiss [citation].\n       Moreover, ‘the sentencing norms [established by the Three Strikes law\n       may, as a matter of law,] produce[] an “arbitrary, capricious or patently\n       absurd” result’ under the specific facts of a particular case. [Citation.]\n\n              “But ‘[i]t is not enough to show that reasonable people might\n       disagree about whether to strike one or more’ prior conviction allegations.\n       [Citation.] … Because the circumstances must be ‘extraordinary … by\n       which a career criminal can be deemed to fall outside the spirit of the very\n       scheme within which he squarely falls once he commits a strike as part of a\n       long and continuous criminal record, the continuation of which the law was\n       meant to attack’ [citation], the circumstances where no reasonable people\n       could disagree that the criminal falls outside the spirit of the three strikes\n       scheme must be even more extraordinary.” (People v. Carmony, supra, 33\n       Cal.4th at p. 378.)\n       As we explained in Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1054, “The purpose of\nthe three strikes law has been variously stated as being ‘“to ensure longer prison\nsentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been\npreviously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses”’ [citation] and ‘to\npromote the state’s compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in punishing\nrecidivism’ [citation]. Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].” Because\npublic safety remains a key purpose of the law under the Act, we reject defendant’s\nassertion that a section 1170.126 proceeding is the converse of a Romero determination,\nso that any refusal to resentence an eligible inmate must be subjected to the same\nrigorous scrutiny as the granting of a Romero motion.18\n\n\n\n\n18     Because a trial court can deny resentencing under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), only upon a finding of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, a trial\ncourt would abuse its discretion, as in a Romero situation, by refusing to resentence a\npetitioner because of antipathy toward the Act or a personal belief a particular defendant\ndeserved an indeterminate term for reasons other than dangerousness. (See People v.\nWilliams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at pp. 159, 161.)\n\n\n\n                                             21.\n\f       Relying on People v. Guinn (1994) 28 Cal.App.4th 1130, 1141-1142, 1145 and its\nprogeny (e.g., People v. Murray (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 277, 282; People v. Ybarra\n(2008) 166 Cal.App.4th 1069, 1089), all of which deal with section 190.5,\nsubdivision (b),19 defendant contends the “shall”/“unless” formulation employed in\nsubdivision (f) of section 1170.126 “establishes a mandatory presumption of reduction of\n… [a] sentence, subject only to a limited exception for extraordinary cases of current\ndangerousness.” (Some capitalization & underscoring omitted.)\n       The California Supreme Court recently disapproved the cases relied on by\ndefendant. (People v. Gutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1354, 1370, 1387.) Leaving aside\nconstitutional questions raised by establishing a presumption in favor of life without\nparole for juveniles after the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in Miller v. Alabama\n(2012) 567 U.S. ___ [132 S.Ct. 2455], the state high court’s review of the text of\nsection 190.5, subdivision (b) led it to conclude the syntax is ambiguous concerning any\npresumption. The court stated: “It is not unreasonable to read this text … to mean that a\ncourt ‘shall’ impose life without parole unless ‘at the discretion of the court’ a sentence\nof 25 years to life appears more appropriate. [Citation.] But it is equally reasonable to\nread the text to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties in the exercise of its\ndiscretion, with no presumption in favor of one or the other. The latter reading accords\nwith common usage. For example, if a teacher informed her students that ‘you must take\na final exam or, at your discretion, write a term paper,’ it would be reasonable for the\nstudents to believe they were equally free to pursue either option. The text of\n\n\n19     Section 190.5, subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part: “The penalty for a\ndefendant found guilty of murder in the first degree, in any case in which one or more\nspecial circumstances … has been found to be true …, who was 16 years of age or older\nand under the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the crime, shall be\nconfinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole or, at the\ndiscretion of the court, 25 years to life.”\n\n\n\n                                             22.\n\fsection 190.5[, subdivision ](b) does not clearly indicate whether the statute was intended\nto make life without parole the presumptive sentence.” (People v. Gutierrez, supra, 58\nCal.4th at p. 1371.)\n       The same example can be applied to the syntax of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). Thus, we do not agree with defendant that resentencing to a second strike\nterm “is the ‘generally mandatory’ disposition, subject only to ‘circumscribed’ discretion\nto retain” the indeterminate third strike term. A court considering whether to resentence\nan eligible petitioner under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) has circumscribed discretion\nin the sense it can only refuse to resentence if it finds that to do so would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety on the facts of the particular case before it.\nThis does not mean, however, its discretion is circumscribed in the sense it can only find\ndangerousness in extraordinary cases. To the contrary, it can do so in any case in which\nsuch a finding is rational under the totality of the circumstances.\n       Such a conclusion comports with the plain language of the statute. Moreover, a\nconclusion resentencing to a second strike term is a generally mandatory presumption\nfrom which courts can depart only in extraordinary cases, as defendant asserts, would run\ndirectly contrary to the intent of the voters in passing the Act. (See People v. Gutierrez,\nsupra, 58 Cal.4th at pp. 1371-1372 [examining legislative history and voter intent in\nattempt to resolve statutory ambiguity].) As we stated in People v. Osuna, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at page 1036, “‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’\n[citation].” Thus, although one purpose of the Act was to save taxpayer dollars (People\nv. Osuna, supra, at p. 1037), “[i]t is clear the electorate’s intent was not to throw open the\nprison doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or\nviolent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or\nno risk to the public.” (Id. at p. 1038, second italics added.) Had voters intended to\npermit retention of an indeterminate term only in extraordinary cases, they would have\nsaid so in subdivision (f) of section 1170.126, rather than employing language that\n\n                                             23.\n\faffords courts broad discretion to find dangerousness. They also would not have afforded\nthe trial court the power to consider any evidence it determined to be relevant to the issue\nas they did in subdivision (g)(3) of the statute.20\n\n     D.   THE FOCUS IN A SECTION 1170.126, SUBDIVISION (F) ANALYSIS, IS ON WHETHER\n          PETITIONER CURRENTLY POSES AN UNREASONABLE RISK OF DANGER TO PUBLIC\n          SAFETY.\n\n          Defendant contends the trial court “must articulate a rational nexus” between the\nfactors considered in its decision and current dangerousness “as with parole denials.”\n(Some capitalization & underscoring omitted.)\n          In discussing the “some evidence” standard applicable in parole cases, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court has stated: “This standard is unquestionably deferential, but\ncertainly is not toothless, and ‘due consideration’ of the specified factors requires more\nthan rote recitation of the relevant factors with no reasoning establishing a rational nexus\nbetween those factors and the necessary basis for the ultimate decision — the\ndetermination of current dangerousness.” (In re Lawrence, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1210.)\n\n\n20      Defendant points to an article written by two of the authors of the Act, in which\nthey assert the intent of Proposition 36 is that inmates will be entitled to resentencing in\nall but the rarest cases involving true risk to public safety. Assuming this material is\nproperly before us, it does not help defendant, because it finds no support in either the\nlanguage of section 1170.126 itself or in the ballot materials related to Proposition 36.\nFor instance, although the “ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 36” stated the\nmeasure had been “carefully crafted … so that truly dangerous criminals” would receive\nno benefits from the Act (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) argument\nin favor of Prop. 36, p. 52), it did not suggest dangerousness would properly be found\nonly in rare cases. Thus, the authors’ intent is not a reliable indicator of what voters\nintended. (See People v. Garcia (2002) 28 Cal.4th 1166, 1175-1176, fn. 5; California\nTeachers Assn. v. San Diego Community College Dist. (1981) 28 Cal.3d 692, 699-701;\nCarleson v. Superior Court (1972) 27 Cal.App.3d 1, 9, fn. 11; see also People v. Rizo\n(2000) 22 Cal.4th 681, 685.) Rather, the statutory language and ballot materials suggest\nvoters intended resentencing would be denied in any case in which it would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and they entrusted to their local judges the\ndiscretion to make that determination.\n\n\n\n                                              24.\n\f       Although we decline to decide how and to what extent parole cases inform the\ndecision whether to resentence a petitioner under the Act or our review of such a\ndecision, we do agree with defendant that the proper focus is on whether the petitioner\ncurrently poses an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (Cf. In re Shaputis\n(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1241, 1254; In re Lawrence, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1214.) We also\nagree a trial court may properly deny resentencing under the Act based solely on\nimmutable facts such as a petitioner’s criminal history “only if those facts support the\nultimate conclusion that an inmate continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public\nsafety. [Citation.]” (In re Lawrence, supra, at p. 1221.) “[T]he relevant inquiry is\nwhether [a petitioner’s prior criminal and/or disciplinary history], when considered in\nlight of other facts in the record, are such that they continue to be predictive of current\ndangerousness many years [later]. This inquiry is … an individualized one, and cannot\nbe undertaken simply by examining the circumstances of [the petitioner’s criminal\nhistory] in isolation, without consideration of the passage of time or the attendant changes\nin the inmate’s psychological or mental attitude. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (In re\nShaputis, supra, 44 Cal.4th at pp. 1254-1255.)\n                                              II\n                                 The Trial Court’s Ruling\n       Applying the foregoing principles, we conclude defendant has not borne his\nburden on appeal of establishing the trial court’s ruling exceeds the bounds of reason.\nAlthough appellant counsels us to remember that, if he were sentenced today for the same\ncommitment offenses he could not be sentenced to a life term as a third strike offender,\nwe note the same would be true of any prisoner eligible for resentencing under\nsection 1170.126. Defendant also argues voters have determined prisoners like him do\nnot pose an unreasonable risk of danger. If that were so, voters would not have given\ntrial courts discretion to decide what evidence is relevant to such a determination, or to\nmake such determination. We find those arguments unpersuasive.\n\n                                             25.\n\f       Here, the trial court clearly was aware it was required to find defendant currently\nposed an unreasonable risk to public safety. As the court stated in its written ruling,\n“Unless the court finds the defendant presents such a danger, he or she shall be\nresentenced.” (Italics added & omitted.)\n       Additionally, the trial court’s ruling conveyed reasoning which established a nexus\nbetween the evidence before it and current dangerousness. Defendant appears to contend\nan express statement of reasons supporting a finding of dangerousness is required, but\nsection 1170.126 — in contrast to section 1385, subdivision (a) — contains no such\nrequirement. The trial court’s ruling here was more than adequate for meaningful\nappellate review, and “the application of reasoned analysis” is apparent from its ruling.\n(In re Young (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 288, 306.) Moreover, the court did not merely rely\non long-ago crimes, although defendant’s criminal record certainly figured into its\ndetermination.\n       Defendant complains the trial court discounted or ignored any evidence favorable\nto him, such as the remoteness of his criminal offenses, his classification score, his health\nand age, and Mathews’s assessment. These matters were all before the court, however,\nand the court expressly stated it had reviewed the case file and records and considered the\ntestimony, and that its determination was “[b]ased on all of those things.” Although it\nmay not have expressly mentioned each piece of evidence individually, this does not\nmean it failed to consider all the evidence. In the absence of any showing to the contrary,\nwe presume it did so. (Evid. Code, § 664; see Denham v. Superior Court (1970) 2 Cal.3d\n557, 564; cf. People v. Sparks (1968) 262 Cal.App.2d 597, 600-601.) That defendant\ndoes not agree with the conclusion the court reached, or the weight or lack of weight it\naccorded to the various facts before it, does not mean the trial court erred.\n       Defendant argues the trial court erroneously framed the pertinent issue as an\ninquiry into the risk of recidivism in general, when it should have been looking at the\nlikelihood of future violence. The court did not err. Section 1170.126, subdivision (f)\n\n                                             26.\n\fdoes not say a petitioner shall be resentenced unless the court determines resentencing the\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of violence; rather, it speaks in terms of\ndanger to public safety.21 That a crime (or criminal) can constitute a danger to public\nsafety without being violent is too obvious to dispute (see, e.g., People v. Hughes (2002)\n27 Cal.4th 287, 355; People v. Villalobos (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 310, 317) and is\nrecognized both by the three strikes law’s inclusion as a strike, by reference to\nsection 1192.7, subdivision (c)’s definition of a “serious felony,” any first degree\nburglary, furnishing certain drugs to a minor, and grand theft involving a firearm (§§ 667,\nsubd. (d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1), 1192.7, subd. (c)(18), (24) & (26)), and by\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2)’s disqualification from eligibility for resentencing\npersons convicted of certain narcotics offenses (see §§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(i), 1170.12,\nsubd. (c)(2)(C)(i)). Although the ballot materials concerning Proposition 36 focused on\nviolent criminals, section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an exercise of the public\npower of the people of the State of California for the protection of the health, safety, and\nwelfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be liberally construed to\neffectuate those purposes.” (Italics omitted.) To condition resentencing denials upon the\nlikelihood of future violence would run contrary to the language of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f) and voters’ intent, and would not effectuate the purposes of the Act.\n       Finally, defendant contends that, in light of the Act’s express purpose of “a more\nrational and cost-effective allocation of the crippling expenses of California’s prison\n\n\n21      Words and phrases used in the Penal Code “must be construed according to the\ncontext and the approved usage of the language .…” (§ 7, subd. 16.) In interpreting a\nballot initiative, we afford the words used their ordinary and usual meaning. (People v.\nPark (2013) 56 Cal.4th 782, 796.) “[S]afety” has been variously defined as “the\ncondition of being safe: freedom from exposure to danger: exemption from hurt, injury or\nloss” (Webster’s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1986) p. 1998) and “[t]he condition of being\nsafe; freedom from danger, risk, or injury” (American Heritage Dict. (2d college ed.\n1982) p. 1084).\n\n\n\n                                             27.\n\fsystem,” trial courts are required to weigh fiscal considerations in deciding resentencing\npetitions, something the trial court here did not do. In our view, the notion that the cost\nof continued incarceration has some bearing on whether resentencing a particular inmate\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety is a non sequitur. Although\nsaving money is a goal of the Act, it does not override the primary purpose of the three\nstrikes law and the Act as a whole — the protection of public safety. (See People v.\nOsuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1036-1038.) The trial court was not required to\ntake the cost of continued imprisonment into account or undertake the equivalent of a\ncost-benefit analysis in determining whether resentencing defendant would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety; the Act already did so, and the electorate has\ndetermined keeping criminals who pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\nbehind bars for their full three strikes sentence is more important than saving money.\n                                             III*\n                             Section 1170.18, Subdivision (c)\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\npetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n\n                                              28.\n\fdiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)22\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision at\nissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n\n\n22    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n\n                                                29.\n\f              “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.23\n\n\n23     We solicited supplemental briefing concerning Proposition 47. Among the\nquestions we asked counsel to answer were whether defendant met the criteria for\nresentencing under section 1170.18 and, if so, whether we needed to determine the\napplicability, if any, of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to resentencing proceedings\nunder section 1170.126. We are satisfied it is appropriate for us to reach the issue of\napplicability regardless of whether defendant might obtain resentencing under\nProposition 47.\n        It appears that a number of inmates will be eligible to seek resentencing under\nboth the Act and Proposition 47. Such an inmate need not wait to file a petition under\nProposition 47 until the trial court’s ruling on the inmate’s petition under the Act is final.\nA trial court is not divested of jurisdiction over a Proposition 47 petition by the fact a\npetition under the Act is pending, whether in a trial court or a Court of Appeal, with\nrespect to the same inmate. (Cf. People v. Mayfield (1993) 5 Cal.4th 220, 222-227;\nPeople v. Johnson (1992) 3 Cal.4th 1183, 1256-1257; People v. Alanis (2008) 158\nCal.App.4th 1467, 1472-1473.) While the general rule is that “an appeal from an order in\na criminal case removes the subject matter of that order from the jurisdiction of the trial\ncourt [citations]” (Anderson v. Superior Court (1967) 66 Cal.2d 863, 865), the subject\nmatter of a ruling on a petition under the Act is legally independent from a petition under\nProposition 47 (see People v. Superior Court (Gregory) (2005) 129 Cal.App.4th 324,\n332).\n       In light of the differences between the two proceedings — for instance, an inmate\nresentenced under Proposition 47 is generally subject to one year of parole (§§ 1170.18,\nsubd. (d), 3000.08), while an inmate resentenced under the Act is subject to up to three\nyears of postrelease community supervision (§ 3451; People v. Tubbs (2014) 230\nCal.App.4th 578, 585-586, petn. for review pending, petn. filed Nov. 12, 2014; People v.\nEspinoza (2014) 226 Cal.App.4th 635, 637-638) — we express no opinion concerning\nwhether the granting of a Proposition 47 petition would render moot resentencing\nproceedings, whether in a trial court or on appeal, under the Act. Nothing we say should\n\n\n                                             30.\n\f       “‘In interpreting a voter initiative …, we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] ‘“The fundamental purpose of statutory\nconstruction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of\nthe law. [Citations.]”’ [Citation.]” (People v. Superior Court (Cervantes) (2014) 225\nCal.App.4th 1007, 1014.) Thus, in the case of a provision adopted by the voters, “their\nintent governs. [Citations.]” (People v. Jones (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142, 1146.)\n       To determine intent, “‘we look first to the words themselves. [Citations.]’”\n(People v. Superior Court (Cervantes), supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1014.) We give the\nstatute’s words “‘a plain and commonsense meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however,\nconsider the statutory language “in isolation.” [Citation.] Rather, we look to “the entire\nsubstance of the statute … in order to determine the scope and purpose of the\nprovision .… [Citation.]” [Citation.] That is, we construe the words in question “‘in\ncontext, keeping in mind the nature and obvious purpose of the statute .…’ [Citation.]”\n[Citation.] We must harmonize “the various parts of a statutory enactment … by\nconsidering the particular clause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a\nwhole.” [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v. Acosta (2002) 29 Cal.4th 105, 112.) We\n“accord[] significance, if possible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the\nlegislative purpose.

On its face, “[a]s used throughout this Code,” as\n\n\nbe read as expressing any opinion concerning defendant’s eligibility to seek, or the\nappropriate result should he seek, resentencing under Proposition 47.\n\n\n\n                                            31.\n\femployed in section 1170.18, subdivision (c), clearly and unambiguously refers to the\nPenal Code, not merely section 1170.18 or the other provisions contained in\nProposition 47.

Vasquez (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th 763, 766.)\n       This does not mean, however, that the definition contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) must inexorably be read into section 1170.126, subdivision (f).

(2002) 29 Cal.4th 600, 606), or would “frustrate[] the manifest\npurposes of the legislation as a whole .…” (People v. Williams (1992) 10 Cal.App.4th\n1389, 1393.) “To this extent, therefore, intent prevails over the letter of the law and the\nletter will be read in accordance with the spirit of the enactment.

Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at\npp. 1034-1035.)\n       Proposition 47 and the Act address related, but not identical, subjects. As we\nexplain, reading them together, and considering section 1170.18, subdivision (c) in the\ncontext of the statutory framework as a whole (see People v. Acosta, supra, 29 Cal.4th at\np. 112; Lakin v. Watkins Associated Industries (1993) 6 Cal.4th 644, 658-659; In re\nCindy B. (1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 771, 781), we conclude its literal meaning does not\ncomport with the purpose of the Act, and applying it to resentencing proceedings under\nthe Act would frustrate, rather than promote, that purpose and the intent of the electorate\nin enacting both initiative measures (see People v. Disibio (1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1,\n5).\n       As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes\nlaw. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:\n\n               “Under the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for\n       their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the\n       commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the\n       imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘… to deter repeat offenders and, at\n       some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n\n                                             33.\n\f       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 823-\n       824.)24\n       A few months before the November 6, 2012, election, the California Supreme\nCourt observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is\nthat the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when … a\ndefendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies]\nis convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of\nany offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\n\n24      The foregoing applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added\nsection 1170.12 to the Penal Code. The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’” (See Historical\nand Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen. Code (2004 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 239.)\n\n\n\n                                            34.\n\fto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, as we previously observed, uncodified section 7 of the Act\nprovides: “This act is an exercise of the public power of the people of the State of\nCalifornia for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of\nCalifornia, and shall be liberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012), supra, text of proposed law, p. 110,\noriginal italics omitted, italics added.) As we explained in People v. Osuna, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at page 1036, “Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\n\n                                             35.\n\fmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\nshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.)\nProposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property\noffenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for\nan offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5,\nsubd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\nSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super\nstrike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to\nsection 290, subdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the Official Title and Summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47\nwould “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses[,\ni.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\nunreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nsupra, official title and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do,\nthe Legislative Analyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders\nconvicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. This measure also\nallows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for\nreduced sentences.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra,\n\n                                              36.\n\fanalysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the\nresentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained:\n\n               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes[, i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen\n       property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply\n       to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In\n       addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a\n       felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\n       felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who\n       has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\n       p. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47 spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47,\np. 38.) The Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47 reiterated these themes, and\nnever suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act.\n(See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\nasserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that\nmany of them had prior convictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and\nhome burglary” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to\nargument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), there is no suggestion the early release provisions\n\n\n\n                                            37.\n\fwould extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The\nsame is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the Argument Against\nProposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 Jolts Landscape of California Justice System (Nov. 5,\n2014) Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-\nproposition47-20141106-story.html> [as of Dec. 17, 2014].) Looking at the information\nconveyed to voters, however, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is\nof no import. (Cf. People v. Garcia, supra, 28 Cal.4th at pp. 1175-1176, fn. 5; People v.\nBradley (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 64, 83; Kaufman & Broad Communities, Inc. v.\nPerformance Plastering, Inc. (2005) 133 Cal.App.4th 26, 30.)\n       We are also mindful “it has long been settled that ‘[t]he enacting body is deemed\nto be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is\nenacted’ [citation], ‘and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof’ [citation].\n‘This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]”\n(People v. Superior Court (Cervantes), supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1015; accord, In re\nLance W. (1985) 37 Cal.3d 873, 890, fn. 11.) Thus, we presume voters were aware\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition. (People v. Garcia (2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 763,\n\n                                             38.\n\f769-770, petn. for review pending, petn. filed Nov. 18, 2014; People v. Flores, supra,\n227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075.) Because nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47\nwas it called to voters’ attention the definition of the phrase contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) would apply to resentencing proceedings under the Act, we simply cannot\nconclude voters intended Proposition 47 to alter the Act in that respect. Voters are not\nasked or presumed to be able to discern all potential effects of a proposed initiative\nmeasure; this is why they are provided with voter information guides containing not only\nthe actual text of such a measure, but also a neutral explanation and analysis by the\nLegislative Analyst and arguments in support of and in opposition to the measure. As we\nhave already observed, none of those materials so much as hinted that Proposition 47\ncould have the slightest effect on resentencing under the Act. (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena\nUnified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of\nenactment included information bill would add definition of particular term to Public\nContract Code].)25\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code. We cannot do so. The only resentencing\nmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\n\n25     For the same reasons, we reject any suggestion the definition contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) was intended to clarify the true meaning of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). (Cf. Re-Open Rambla, Inc. v. Board of Supervisors (1995) 39\nCal.App.4th 1499, 1511; In re Connie M. (1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 1225, 1238.)\n\n\n\n                                             39.\n\fwhose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for\nresentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.\n       We recognize “[i]t is an established rule of statutory construction … that when\nstatutes are in pari materia similar phrases appearing in each should be given like\nmeanings. [Citations.]” (People v. Caudillo (1978) 21 Cal.3d 562, 585, overruled on\nanother ground in People v. Martinez (1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 229, 237, fn. 6 &\ndisapproved on another ground in People v. Escobar (1992) 3 Cal.4th 740, 749-751 &\nfn. 5; see Robbins v. Omnibus R. Co. (1867) 32 Cal. 472, 474.) We question whether\nProposition 47 and the Act are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same\nsubject; relating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict. (9th ed. 2009) p. 862), and the\ntwo measures (albeit with some overlap) address different levels of offenses and\noffenders. In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\nprobable legislative intent” (Stone v. Superior Court (1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 521, fn. 10);\nthey are “mere guides and will not be applied so as to defeat the underlying legislative\nintent otherwise determined [citation]” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v. Fair Employment & Housing\nCom., supra, 43 Cal.3d at p. 1391).\n       The Act was intended to reform the three strikes law while keeping intact that\nscheme’s core commitment to public safety. Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v. Foley (2006) 39 Cal.4th 794, 813) —\nconstraining that discretion so that all but the worst felony offenders are released\nmanifestly does not, nor does it comport with voters’ intent in enacting either measure.\n       Accordingly, Proposition 47 has no effect on defendant’s petition for resentencing\nunder the Act. Defendant is not entitled to a remand so the trial court can redetermine\n\n                                             40.\n\fdefendant’s entitlement to resentencing under the Act utilizing the definition of\n“‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c).26\n                                     DISPOSITION\n       The judgment is affirmed.\n                                                                 _____________________\n                                                                           DETJEN, J.\nI CONCUR:\n\n\n _____________________\n LEVY, Acting P.J.\n\n\n\n\n26     Recently, the Third District Court of Appeal held section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c)’s definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” does not\napply retroactively to defendants whose petitions for resentencing under the Act were\ndecided before the effective date of Proposition 47. (People v. Chaney (Dec. 1, 2014,\nC073949) ___ Cal.App.4th ___, ___-___ [2014 D.A.R. 15934, 15935-15936].) Chaney\ndid not decide whether Proposition 47’s definition applies prospectively to such petitions.\n(Chaney, supra, at p. ___, fn. 3 [2014 D.A.R. 15934, 15936, fn. 3].) Were we to\nconclude section 1170.18, subdivision (c) modifies section 1170.126, subdivision (f), we\nwould agree with Chaney that it does not do so retroactively. We believe, however, that\na finding of nonretroactivity inexorably leads to the possibility of prospective-only\napplication, and that prospective-only application of Proposition 47’s definition to\nresentencing petitions under the Act would raise serious, perhaps insurmountable, equal\nprotection issues. “Mindful of the serious constitutional questions that might arise were\nwe to accept a literal construction of the statutory language, and of our obligation\nwherever possible both to carry out the intent of the electorate and to construe statutes so\nas to preserve their constitutionality [citations]” (People v. Skinner (1985) 39 Cal.3d 765,\n769), we rest our holding on the reasoning set out in our opinion, ante.\n\n\n\n                                            41.\n\fPEÑA, J.,\n       I concur in the judgment and the majority opinion with the exception of part III. I\nagree defendant may not take advantage of Proposition 47’s1 newly enacted definition of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as provided in Penal Code section\n1170.18, subdivision (c) (1170.18(c)). I do so not because there is any ambiguity in the\nlanguage used in section 1170.18(c) or the notion that the statute does not mean what it\nsays, i.e., that the new definition applies “throughout this Code.” Rather, in my view,\nthere is no indication the electorate, in enacting section 1170.18(c), intended it to apply\nretroactively to resentencing determinations under Proposition 36, the Three Strikes\nReform Act of 2012 (the Act).\nI.     After November 4, 2014, the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” in\n       Section 1170.18(c) applies throughout the Penal Code\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, long past the time of defendant’s resentencing hearing.\nUnless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant. This is the only inquiry we must make to\nresolve the issue of whether the definition in section 1170.18(c) applies to defendant.\nHowever, the majority has opted to determine whether the new definition applies to any\nresentencing provisions under the Act, past, present, or future. I respectfully disagree\nwith the majority’s analysis and conclusion on this broader issue.\n\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014)).\n\f               “‘When construing a statute, we must “ascertain the intent of the\n       Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.”’ [Citations.] ‘[W]e\n       begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary\n       meaning.’ [Citation.] ‘If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous,\n       then we need go no further.’ [Citation.] If, however, the language supports\n       more than one reasonable construction, we may consider ‘a variety of\n       extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to\n       be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous\n       administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is\n       a part.’ [Citation.] Using these extrinsic aids, we ‘select the construction\n       that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with\n       a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute,\n       and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.’\n       [Citation.]” (People v. Sinohui (2002) 28 Cal.4th 205, 211-212.)\n       Where the statutory language is so clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nstatutory construction or to resort to legislative materials or other outside sources.\n(Quarterman v. Kefauver (1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371.) Absent ambiguity, it is\npresumed the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure, and\nthe courts may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to a presumed intent not\napparent in its language. (People v. ex rel. Lungren v. Superior Court (1996) 14 Cal.4th\n294, 301.)\n       In determining whether the words enacted here are unambiguous, we do not write\non a blank slate. For example, in Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) 119\nCal.App.4th 1241, 1255, the court stated there “is nothing ambiguous about the phrase\n‘as used in this code.’” It held the definition of “Emergency, as used in this code”\napplied to the entire Public Contract Code, and it was not limited to a particular chapter,\narticle, or division of that code. Also, in People v. Bucchierre (1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153,\n166, the court held: “The words ‘as in this code provided’ (Penal Code, § 182) refer to\nthe Penal Code.”\n       In a similar vein, the court in People v. Leal (2004) 33 Cal.4th 999, 1007-1008,\napplied the plain meaning rule as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f               “The statutory language of the provision defining ‘duress’ in each of\n       the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of ‘duress’ in\n       both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n       this section, “duress” means ….’ (§§ 261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This\n       clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of\n       ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.\n\n              “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n       into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n       sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n       its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n       incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n       well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n       observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n       the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n       “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n       rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n       immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n       meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n       lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n               “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n       providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n       has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n       “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n       construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n       meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n       is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n       compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n       analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n       “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n       ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n       to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n       [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While\nacknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory\nconstruction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually\nenacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority’s\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fview of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so\nthat it now states: “As used in this section only, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’ means ….” The majority does so without providing a compelling reason to do so\nand without showing the plain language used has a “‘meaning [that] is “‘repugnant to the\ngeneral purview of the act.’”’” (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1008.) Because\nthe Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or contradictory to the\nAct, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the general purview of\nProposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority on this part of\nthe opinion.\nII.    Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant’s resentencing under the\n       Act\n       I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the\ndefinition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant\nunder the Act.\n       I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that “[n]o\npart of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent.\nWhen the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,” section 3 provides the\ndefault rule. (People v. Brown (2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319.) Proposition 47 is silent on\nthe question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The\nanalysis of Proposition 47 by the legislative analyst and the arguments for and against\nProposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that\nsection 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no\nclearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4.\n\f       Defendant cites In re Estrada (1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 to argue retroactive\napplication.\n       In Estrada, the court stated:\n\n       “When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it\n       has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe\n       and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission\n       of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must\n       have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now\n       deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\n       constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter\n       punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its\n       passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not\n       final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to\n       conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a\n       conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.” (In re\n       Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       One may argue that under the Estrada case, unless there is a “savings clause”\nproviding for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to\napply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute’s effective date. (In\nre Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the Estrada case has\nbeen revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In People v. Brown, supra, 54\nCal.4th at page 324 the court stated: “Estrada is today properly understood, not as\nweakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal\nCode] section 3, but rather as informing the rule’s application in a specific context by\narticulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment\nfor a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.” “The\nholding in Estrada was founded on the premise that ‘“[a] legislative mitigation of the\npenalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or\nthe different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.”’”\n(Id. at p. 325.) In Brown, the court did not apply the Estrada rule because “a statute\nincreasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not\n\n\n                                             5.\n\frepresent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular\ncriminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.”\n(People v. Brown, supra, at p. 325.)\n       Similarly here, Estrada does not control because applying the definition of\n“unreasonable risk to public safety” in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under\nthe Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime. Instead, the downward\nmodification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current\noffense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender,\nincluding criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and “[a]ny\nother evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n       For this reason also, defendant’s argument his equal protection rights would be\nviolated if he is denied retroactive application is unavailing. In light of the unlimited\nfactors related to individual offenders that inform the exercise of discretion, no two\nindividual offenders may be said to be similarly situated for purposes of resentencing\nunder the Act. Unlike In re Kapperman (1974) 11 Cal.3d 542, upon which defendant\nrelies, Proposition 47’s new definition does not automatically confer a benefit such as\ncredit for time served prior to commencement of their prison sentence to some prisoners\nand not others based solely on their commitment date.\n       Nor is this case similar to Village of Willowbrook v. Olech (2000) 528 U.S. 562\nalso relied upon by defendant. There, the plaintiff (Olech) alleged she was intentionally\ntreated differently from others similarly situated and that there was no rational basis for\nthe difference in treatment. Specifically, the defendant (Village) had intentionally\ndemanded a 33-foot easement as a condition of connecting her property to the municipal\nwater supply where the Village required only a 15-foot easement from other similarly\nsituated property owners. After a three-month delay, Village relented and agreed to\n\n                                              6.\n\fprovide water service with only a 15-foot easement. Olech also alleged Village was\nactually motivated by ill will resulting from Olech’s prior filing of an unrelated and\nunsuccessful lawsuit against Village. The high court held that apart from the Village’s\nsubjective motivation, the fact the Village required a 33-foot easement from Olech as a\ncondition for connecting her property while it required only a 15-foot easement from the\nother similarly situated property owners sufficiently stated a claim for relief under\ntraditional equal protection analysis. (Id. at pp. 563-565.) Here, defendant has not shown\nhe is similarly situated to others to whom the new definition has applied or may apply,\nnor has he established that he has been treated differently as a result of some arbitrary\ndiscrimination.\n       Because section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct\nstandard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant.2 Since defendant has\nfailed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the\njudgment.\n\n                                                          ___________________________\n                                                                              PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n2Recently  in People v.

If such an\ninmate meets the criteria enumerated in Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), he\nor she will be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.1 (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (f); People v. Yearwood (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 168.)\n       After the Act went into effect, Randy Lynn Payne (defendant), an inmate serving a\nterm of 25 years to life following conviction of a felony that was not violent (as defined\nby § 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by § 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition to\nhave his sentence recalled and to be resentenced. Following a hearing, the trial court\nfound defendant “present[ed] an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if released.”\n       In the published portion of this opinion, we hold the People have the burden of\nproving, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts on which a finding that resentencing a\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety reasonably can be\nbased. Those facts are reviewed for substantial evidence. We further hold, however, that\nthe preponderance of the evidence standard does not apply to the trial court’s\ndetermination regarding dangerousness, nor does section 1170.126, subdivision (f), create\na presumption of resentencing. The ultimate decision — whether resentencing an inmate\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety — instead lies within the\nsound discretion of the trial court. In the unpublished portion of the opinion, we\nconclude recently enacted section 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f). Finding no abuse of discretion, we affirm.\n\n\n1      Further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise stated.\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f                       FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n       On February 10, 1996, defendant was observed stealing several cases of motor oil\nfrom a convenience store/gas station in Merced.2 He subsequently led a California\nHighway Patrol officer in a pursuit on Highway 99. Defendant drove at speeds well over\n100 miles per hour, sometimes traveling partly on the center divider and other times\ntraveling on the shoulder. His driving forced other vehicles to move out of his way to\navoid collision. As defendant approached the Livingston city limits, he drove onto the\nshoulder to pass vehicles stopped at a red traffic light. Defendant lost control of the car,\nflipped over, and struck a power pole. The car had been stolen.\n       On August 12, 1996, a jury convicted defendant of two felonies: evading arrest\nwhile operating a motor vehicle (Veh. Code, § 2800.2) and petty theft with prior theft\nconvictions (§§ 488, 666).3 Defendant was found to have three prior serious or violent\nfelony convictions within the meaning of the three strikes law. On April 22, 1997, he\nwas sentenced to 25 years to life in prison.\n       On or about December 21, 2012, defendant filed a petition under\nsection 1170.126. He represented he was statutorily eligible for such relief, and argued\nhe should be resentenced to a second strike term of 48 months in prison and be released\nfrom custody.\n       The People opposed the petition. They pointed to defendant’s 14-year-long record\nof criminal convictions, which included three strike convictions (one for robbery and two\nfor residential burglary); the high risk of danger to others posed by his commitment\noffense; and defendant’s admission, to the probation officer, that he had a drug problem.\n\n2      The facts of defendant’s commitment conviction are derived from our opinion in\nPeople v. Payne (May 26, 1998, F026894) [nonpub. opn.], of which we have taken\njudicial notice by separate order.\n3     The jury was unable to reach a verdict on a count charging defendant with\nunlawful taking of a motor vehicle. (Veh. Code, § 10851.)\n\n\n\n                                               3.\n\fThe People asserted defendant’s conduct in prison had been poor, as he had violated\nprison disciplinary rules on a number of occasions. The People argued that, even after\nparticipating in Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous programs over the\nyears, defendant incurred disciplinary write-ups for “narcotic diversion” — diverting\nmorphine medication he was to swallow — and possession of alcohol, most recently in\n2013. The People further argued that, if defendant were released, he would face\ndifficulty earning sufficient income by lawful means, as his prison records revealed his\nlack of marketable trade skills and lack of education. Based on the foregoing, the People\nasserted the trial court should find resentencing defendant would pose an unreasonable\nrisk of danger to public safety.\n       The petition was heard on August 5, 2013.4 The court considered its own files in\nthe matter, as well as defendant’s records — his “central file” — from the California\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR).\n       Information in defendant’s CDCR records included the probation officer’s report\nfor defendant’s commitment offenses. It showed defendant, who was born in 1963, had\nan adult criminal conviction record dating back to 1982. Between 1982 and 1996, he\nincurred nine misdemeanor convictions for crimes that included burglary, petty theft with\na prior conviction, and carrying a concealed weapon on his person; and seven cases in\nwhich he was convicted of one or more felonies that included multiple burglaries and\nrobbery.5 Defendant told the probation officer he dropped out of high school; started\n\n\n4      Because the judge who imposed defendant’s third strike term was retired, the\nmatter was heard by a different judge. (See § 1170.126, subd. (j).)\n5      The robbery conviction arose out of an incident in which defendant apparently\nbelieved he was reclaiming a bicycle stolen from him. Defendant and the victim argued\nover ownership of the bicycle. Defendant said he was going back to his truck to get\nsomething. When he returned, he had a plastic bag in his hand that appeared to contain a\nhandgun. The victim handed over the bicycle, which defendant placed in his truck and\ndrove away. Defendant, who was on parole from the California Rehabilitation Center,\n\n\n                                            4.\n\fusing PCP when he was 12 years old and then moved on to cocaine, heroin, LSD,\nmethamphetamine, and marijuana; and injected a mixture of cocaine and heroin as his\n“drug of choice.” He considered himself dependent on drugs, and had been dependent in\nthe past. Defendant also stated he drank three-fifths of a gallon of whiskey a week, and\ndrank wine and beer. CDCR reception center information showed defendant had a\nhistory of heart and kidney disease and that he claimed work experience in a walnut\nprocessing plant, laying train tracks, and field work.\n       Defendant’s CDCR records contained several rules violation reports. In 1998, he\nwas found guilty of possession of United States currency. In 1999, he was placed into\nadministrative segregation pending investigation into allegations of narcotics trafficking\nin the prison’s general population. In 2004, he was found guilty of mutual combat. He\nadmitted punching the other inmate who, defendant said, was only defending himself.\nDefendant characterized the inmate as “a homeboy” who was irritating him. Staff had to\nuse pepper spray and a baton strike to break up the fight. In 2006, a hypodermic syringe\nwith a needle was found in the cell defendant shared with another inmate. Defendant\nadmitted it was his, and said he found it in the garbage after a building search. In 2008,\ndefendant was found guilty of possession of tobacco. In 2010, defendant was found\nguilty of circumventing medical procedures by diverting medication. Defendant\nacknowledged he was required to place his medication into his mouth, swallow it, and\nthen allow the nurse to determine he had done so. In 2012, a random search of a cell\nassigned to defendant and another inmate revealed a garbage bag full of inmate-\nmanufactured alcohol (“‘pruno’”). Defendant stated the pruno was his. At the hearing,\nhe pled guilty to possession of inmate-manufactured alcohol and stated, “‘It wasn’t mine,\nbut I took it.’” The most recent rules violation report, dated January 1, 2013, was, again,\n\n\npled no contest pursuant to People v. West (1970) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1174273\"><a href=\"/opinion/1174273/people-v-west/\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">595</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> in exchange for dismissal\nof a five-year enhancement.\n\n\n\n                                             5.\n\ffor circumventing medical procedures by diverting medication. Defendant stood in the\npill line for his “‘as needed’” morphine dose, placed the pill in his mouth and drank his\nwater, but did not swallow the pill. Defendant was written up multiple times for failing\nto report or being late to class or to his work assignment, being out of bounds, not being\nin his cell during inmate count, violating grooming and cell regulations, and smoking (a\nviolation of state law).\n       Defendant’s most recent annual review, dated October 31, 2012, showed him in\n“Close B” custody. His placement score was 19, the mandatory minimum for a prisoner\nwith a life sentence. His records contained numerous good reports from his prison work\nsupervisors. They also contained verification of his participation in Narcotics\nAnonymous, Alcoholics Anonymous, and a victims’ awareness program over various\nperiods of time.6 He also received a certificate of proficiency as a sewing machine\noperator.\n       Defendant’s central file contained a therapeutic progress report, dated May 23,\n2013, by Dr. Mathews, a clinical psychologist at the prison.7 Mathews related defendant\nhad been able to make “some true and substantial progress” in the four years she had\nbeen treating him, and had deepened his commitment to “making something better of\nhimself.” She found he was not as “materially- driven” as in the past, and although he\nhad struggled with substance abuse issues, he had managed to successfully face them and\nwas engaged in an ongoing dialogue with her about them. She believed defendant had\n\n6      In February 2004, defendant was presented certificates of attendance attesting to\nhis regular attendance of 25 months in Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics\nAnonymous.\n7       Defendant’s file also contained voluminous interdisciplinary progress notes that\nwere listed as “Confidential Client/Patient Information.” Although the court considered\nMathews’s written notes and live testimony, it sustained a claim of privilege with respect\nto the confidential records and did not consider them in reaching its decision. We neither\nsummarize nor consider the confidential information.\n\n\n\n                                             6.\n\f“attained a maturity that has allowed him to no longer be the reactive, angry young man\nhe once was.” She believed he was now capable of delaying gratification. She opined he\nwould make a good candidate for resentencing under the Act.\n       Mathews testified at the hearing. She had been defendant’s primary treating\nmental health clinician since the spring of 2009. She concurred with defendant’s\nprevious clinician’s diagnoses that defendant had a “mood disorder not otherwise\nspecified” and polysubstance abuse in institutional remission.8 Although defendant was\nprescribed various medications in the past, he had taken no psychotropic medications\nsince Mathews had been treating him. Defendant’s drug addiction involved multiple\nsubstances and reportedly dated from the age of about 10 to 11 years old. Mathews was\naware defendant was prescribed morphine while on her caseload. She was concerned\nwith morphine use because she believed it contributes to depression.\n       Mathews related she and defendant had long conversations about “his short fuse”\nand “his tendency to personalize things.” She thought defendant had done “really well”\ndeveloping the capacity to look at what was truly being said so as not to personalize\ncomments. The major change Mathews saw in defendant was his ability to delay\ngratification. She found he did not have to have “some of the material comfort … he\nused to want and actively hustle to get” before he was incarcerated. Asked by defense\ncounsel if she thought the court should have concerns regarding defendant’s substance\nabuse if released, Mathews responded: “I think the Court would be wise to concern\n[itself] with whether or not he would have a stable environment. I think [defendant] is\nactually capable with very, very small amounts of money of getting back onto his feet\nbecause of his abilities and discussions with me about his interest and ideas and education\n\n\n8      A diagnosis of mood disorder is not a major mental illness. It means people have\nfluctuating capacity to cope, moodiness, depression, anxiety, and sometimes difficulty\nsleeping.\n\n\n\n                                            7.\n\fand real estate. [¶] But … I don’t feel good about him going out and not having a\nstructure. My concern would be his just, kind of, floating out there and feeling\noverwhelmed by society after 17 years of incarceration.” Mathews thought a sober living\nenvironment would be very important, and had discussed the possibility with defendant\nwho seemed receptive to the idea. Mathews was of the opinion that anyone who had ever\nhad a problem with substance abuse continued to have a problem, and she saw defendant\nas continuing to struggle in that respect.\n       Defendant testified at the hearing. He admitted having a longstanding drug\nproblem, but denied possessing or consuming any medication not prescribed for him\nduring the 17 years he had most recently been in prison, even though he could have\nobtained illicit drugs had he wanted to. Defendant was prescribed morphine from 2008\nto 2013 because of spinal problems. He explained he did not immediately swallow his\nmedication in the January 2013 incident, because his neck was swollen that morning.\nThe nurse who reported him in 2010 and 2013 was a temporary nurse; defendant took his\nmedication three times a day and never had a problem with the regular staff nurses. He\ndenied the pruno was his; he took the blame because the inmate to whom it belonged had\na parole hearing coming up. The syringe found in 2006 belonged to his cellmate, who\nwas scheduled to go home in three days.\n       Defendant testified he would never again use drugs, because it had cost him too\nmuch. Although he would not have a problem if he were released, he would be willing to\ngo into transitional housing. He had a means of support because he had won a civil\njudgment. He also had family in the Modesto area. He planned to get involved with his\nbrother in buying, fixing up, and reselling foreclosed homes, and he also planned to do\nvolunteer work.\n       The prosecutor argued that, based on the totality of the circumstances (defendant’s\nprior criminal history, the circumstances of his commitment offense, his disciplinary\nrecord, and the fact he was still struggling with substance abuse), defendant remained a\n\n                                             8.\n\fdanger to public safety. Defense counsel pointed to defendant’s explanation for some of\nthe disciplinary violations, and noted he had no write-ups for hiding or selling pills, and\nonly one assaultive-type incident. She argued he was focused on the future and had\nparticipated in drug and alcohol programs as best he could, and argued nothing had been\npresented to show he would be a risk of danger should he be released.\n       The court took the matter under submission. On August 20, 2013, the court stated\nit had spent a significant amount of time reviewing the case file and records and\nconsidering the testimony presented. Based on “all of those things,” it found “there is a\nrisk of dangerousness” with which it was “not comfortable.” It denied the petition for the\nreasons set out in its written ruling. That ruling read, in pertinent part:\n\n               “The court places the burden of persuasion on the prosecution. That\n       is, the state must convince the court, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n       that to resentence a defendant as a ‘second strike offender’ would present\n       an unreasonable risk of danger to the public. Unless the court finds the\n       defendant presents such a danger, he or she shall be resentenced. The\n       drafters of Penal Code section 1170.126 have given the court guidance on\n       pertinent factors to consider. [¶] … [¶]\n\n              “The district attorney focuses on the nature of defendant’s prior\n       criminal history, the facts and circumstances surrounding the life\n       commitment offense, the defendant’s disciplinary record while\n       incarcerated, and his life - long substance abuse problems. The\n       prosecution’s position is that, when taken together, these factors\n       demonstrate that resentencing [defendant] would pose an unreasonable risk\n       of danger to public safety. In response, the defense called Dr. Mathews .…\n\n              “The court finds Dr. Mathews[’s] opinions regarding [defendant] to\n       be unhelpful to [defendant]. The court notes that Dr. Mathews candidly\n       admits that [defendant’s] substance abuse is in institutional remission, and\n       should concern the court. She further opined that [defendant] continues to\n       have a substance abuse problem. Perhaps most importantly, Dr. Mathews\n       diagnoses [defendant] with a mood disorder (NOS) that leaves [defendant]\n       with a ‘fluctuating ability to cope’. This, combined with his ongoing\n       substance abuse problems, greatly concerns the court.\n\n            “To the extent that Dr. Mathews characterizes [defendant’s]\n       commitment offense as relatively minor, the court strongly disagrees. A\n\n                                              9.\n\f       jury convicted [defendant] of felony evading .… As cited by the\n       prosecutor, [defendant] has ‘proved himself to be a threat to public safety\n       and security’. His criminal career has been long and extensive. His prior\n       serious felony convictions were residential burglaries. The court finds that\n       those offenses do involve a high risk of physical danger, as did the evading\n       offense. His record of rehabilitation while incarcerated is sparse. Indeed,\n       he continues to receive disciplinary write - ups as recently as this year. The\n       court further places little weight on [defendant’s] explanation that he ‘took\n       the fall’ for a fellow inmate on at least two occasions. [Defendant]\n       admitted that he lied to prison authorities to achieve his goals, and the court\n       has little doubt he would be dishonest here in an attempt to win his\n       freedom.\n\n              “When taken together, the foregoing facts lead the court to find that\n       the District Attorney has, by a preponderance of the evidence, met his\n       burden of proof and persuasion. The court is convinced that [defendant]\n       would present an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety if released.”\n                                       DISCUSSION\n                                               I\n                             The Applicable Legal Principles\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126.9 (People v.

The People\ncontend their burden is preponderance of the evidence.11\n\n                 “The standard of proof, the United States Supreme Court has said,\n          ‘serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the\n          relative importance attached to the ultimate decision.’ [Citation.] At one\n          end of the spectrum is the ‘preponderance of the evidence’ standard, which\n          apportions the risk of error among litigants in roughly equal fashion.\n          [Citation.] At the other end of the spectrum is the ‘beyond a reasonable\n          doubt’ standard applied in criminal cases, in which ‘our society imposes\n          almost the entire risk of error upon itself.’ [Citation.] Between those two\n          standards is the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence.\n          [Citation.] These three standards are codified in California’s Evidence\n          Code.

Although voters\ncould have permitted automatic resentencing, under any and all circumstances, of those\neligible therefor, they did not do so. This demonstrates a recognition of two highly\nplausible scenarios: (1) Some inmates sentenced to indeterminate terms under the\noriginal version of the three strikes law for crimes not defined as serious or violent\nfelonies may have started out not posing any greater risk of danger than recidivists who\nwill now be sentenced to determinate terms as second strike offenders under the\nprospective provisions of the Act, but have become violent or otherwise dangerous while\nimprisoned, or (2) Enough time might have passed since some inmates committed their\ncriminal offenses so that those offenses no longer make such inmates dangerous, but\nother factors do. Because of the severe consequences to society that may result if a\ndangerous inmate is resentenced as a second strike offender and released to the\ncommunity upon completion of his or her term with little or no supervision (see, e.g.,\n§ 3451) and without undergoing any suitability assessment (see, e.g., In re Lawrence\n\n\n                                             13.\n\f(2008) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1181</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1204), we believe it appropriate to apportion the risk of error in\nroughly equal fashion.\n       Division Three of the Second District Court of Appeal has stated that, where a\ncourt’s discretion under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) is concerned, the People bear\nthe burden of proving “dangerousness” by a preponderance of the evidence. (Kaulick,\nsupra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1305 & fn. 25; see Evid. Code, § 115.) That court\ndetermined this is so because “dangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence\nimposed when a defendant is resentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a\nhurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all.” (Kaulick,\nsupra, at p. 1303.) Kaulick explained:\n\n              “The maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly\n       situated to him, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life\n       term to which he was originally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him\n       with an opportunity to be resentenced to a lesser term, unless certain facts\n       are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the third strike sentence\n       based on the facts established at the time he was originally sentenced. As\n       such, a court’s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in\n       his favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e.,\n       dangerousness), and such factor need not be established by proof beyond a\n       reasonable doubt to a jury.” (Ibid.)\n\n       In People v.

United States (2010)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148795\"><a href=\"/opinion/148795/dillon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828 (Dillon), that “a defendant’s Sixth Amendment right to have essential\nfacts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward\nsentence modifications due to intervening laws.” 12 (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1304.) Kaulick found Dillon’s language applicable. Since the retrospective part of the\nAct is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate and\nprovides for a proceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward, any\nfacts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth\nAmendment issues. Thus, there is no constitutional requirement that the facts be\nestablished beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, at pp. 1304-1305.)\n       Although in Blakely, we applied Kaulick’s analysis to the initial determination of\neligibility for resentencing under the Act (Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061), it\napplies equally to the issue whether resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. A denial of an inmate’s petition does not\nincrease the penalty to which that inmate is already subject, but instead removes the\ninmate from the scope of an act of lenity on the part of the electorate to which he or she is\nnot constitutionally entitled. (Blakely, supra, at p. 1062.) That the denial is based on a\ndetermination of dangerousness does not change that conclusion.\n       Kaulick found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness”\nby a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt. (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.)\nAs a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof\n\n12     Pepper v.

Unlike Dillon, Pepper involved a plenary\nresentencing after the defendant’s sentence had been set aside on appeal. (Pepper, supra,\n562 U.S. at p. ___ [131 S.Ct. at p. 1236].)\n\n\n\n                                             15.\n\fand the trial court’s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify\nwhether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of facts\nupon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination resentencing a petitioner\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing\nthat determination itself.13 Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation.\n        Accordingly, we hold preponderance of the evidence is the applicable standard of\nproof, regardless whether we analyze the issue as one of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence\nor due process. (See People v. Flores, supra, 227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1076.)14\n        This does not, however, mean the trial court must apply that standard in making its\nultimate determination whether to resentence a petitioner, or we must review that\ndetermination for substantial evidence. Nor does it mean evidence of dangerousness\nmust preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation for resentencing to be denied.\n        The language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) expressly provides the petitioner\nshall be resentenced unless the court, in its discretion, makes a determination that\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger. The statute does not say the\npetitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing would pose such a\nrisk.\n\n13      As noted, ante, we have previously discussed Kaulick in the context of the initial\ndetermination whether an inmate is eligible for resentencing under the Act.

Nothing we say here should be taken as disagreement with or\nmodification of those opinions. We deal here with a different aspect of the retrospective\nportion of the Act and a subject not before us in our prior cases.\n14     We recognize that in the case of people who are involuntarily committed as\nnarcotics addicts or for analogous reasons, the California Supreme Court has found the\nappropriate standard of proof to be beyond a reasonable doubt.

The reasons a trial court finds\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence\nshowing dangerousness versus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court’s\ndiscretion. The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk\nof danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts\nestablished by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of\ndanger by a preponderance of the evidence. (See In re Robert L., supra, 21 Cal.App.4th\nat pp. 1065-1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence\nstandards].)\n       Such an interpretation is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing\nscheme.15 Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to\nCunningham, “three terms of imprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses.\nThe trial court’s discretion in selecting among [those] options [was] limited by\nsection 1170, subdivision (b), which direct[ed] that ‘the court shall order imposition of\nthe middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the\ncrime.’” (People v.

Trial courts had\n“broad discretion” to impose the lower or upper term instead of the middle term of\nimprisonment (People v.

(Ibid.; see\nformer Cal. Rules of Court, rule 4.420(b).) Even after the DSL was reformed and\namended in response to Cunningham, so as to eliminate judicial factfinding in selection\nof the appropriate term when three possible prison terms are specified by statute,\nestablishment of facts by a preponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect\nto certain discretionary sentencing decisions.

(See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means “‘more likely than not’”].)\n       To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is\nthe court’s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review.

(Romero, supra, at pp. 529-530.) The court\nsubsequently clarified, however, that in deciding whether to do so, “the court in question\nmust consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances of his present felonies\nand prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the particulars of his background,\ncharacter, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed outside the scheme’s spirit, in\nwhole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he had not previously been\nconvicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.” (People v. Williams, supra, 17\nCal.4th at p. 161.)\n        Because the three strikes law was intended to restrict trial courts’ discretion in\nsentencing repeat offenders, the state high court determined there were “stringent\nstandards” sentencing courts must follow in order to find a defendant should be treated as\nfalling outside the three strikes scheme. (People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at\np. 377.) The court explained:\n\n               “[T]he three strikes law not only establishes a sentencing norm, it\n        carefully circumscribes the trial court’s power to depart from this norm and\n        requires the court to explicitly justify its decision to do so. In doing so, the\n        law creates a strong presumption that any sentence that conforms to these\n        sentencing norms is both rational and proper.\n\n               “In light of this presumption, a trial court will only abuse its\n        discretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited\n        circumstances. For example, an abuse of discretion occurs where the trial\n        court was not ‘aware of its discretion’ to dismiss [citation], or where the\n\n\n                                              20.\n\f       court considered impermissible factors in declining to dismiss [citation].\n       Moreover, ‘the sentencing norms [established by the Three Strikes law\n       may, as a matter of law,] produce[] an “arbitrary, capricious or patently\n       absurd” result’ under the specific facts of a particular case. [Citation.]\n\n              “But ‘[i]t is not enough to show that reasonable people might\n       disagree about whether to strike one or more’ prior conviction allegations.\n       [Citation.] … Because the circumstances must be ‘extraordinary … by\n       which a career criminal can be deemed to fall outside the spirit of the very\n       scheme within which he squarely falls once he commits a strike as part of a\n       long and continuous criminal record, the continuation of which the law was\n       meant to attack’ [citation], the circumstances where no reasonable people\n       could disagree that the criminal falls outside the spirit of the three strikes\n       scheme must be even more extraordinary.” (People v. Carmony, supra, 33\n       Cal.4th at p. 378.)\n       As we explained in Blakely, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at page 1054, “The purpose of\nthe three strikes law has been variously stated as being ‘“to ensure longer prison\nsentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have been\npreviously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses”’ [citation] and ‘to\npromote the state’s compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in punishing\nrecidivism’ [citation]. Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].” Because\npublic safety remains a key purpose of the law under the Act, we reject defendant’s\nassertion that a section 1170.126 proceeding is the converse of a Romero determination,\nso that any refusal to resentence an eligible inmate must be subjected to the same\nrigorous scrutiny as the granting of a Romero motion.18\n\n\n\n\n18     Because a trial court can deny resentencing under section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), only upon a finding of unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, a trial\ncourt would abuse its discretion, as in a Romero situation, by refusing to resentence a\npetitioner because of antipathy toward the Act or a personal belief a particular defendant\ndeserved an indeterminate term for reasons other than dangerousness.

Leaving aside\nconstitutional questions raised by establishing a presumption in favor of life without\nparole for juveniles after the United States Supreme Court’s opinion in Miller v. Alabama\n(2012) 567 U.S. ___ [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2959737\"><a href=\"/opinion/2959737/miller-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2455</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">], the state high court’s review of the text of\nsection 190.5, subdivision (b) led it to conclude the syntax is ambiguous concerning any\npresumption. The court stated: “It is not unreasonable to read this text … to mean that a\ncourt ‘shall’ impose life without parole unless ‘at the discretion of the court’ a sentence\nof 25 years to life appears more appropriate. [Citation.] But it is equally reasonable to\nread the text to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties in the exercise of its\ndiscretion, with no presumption in favor of one or the other. The latter reading accords\nwith common usage. For example, if a teacher informed her students that ‘you must take\na final exam or, at your discretion, write a term paper,’ it would be reasonable for the\nstudents to believe they were equally free to pursue either option. The text of\n\n\n19     Section 190.5, subdivision (b) provides, in pertinent part: “The penalty for a\ndefendant found guilty of murder in the first degree, in any case in which one or more\nspecial circumstances … has been found to be true …, who was 16 years of age or older\nand under the age of 18 years at the time of the commission of the crime, shall be\nconfinement in the state prison for life without the possibility of parole or, at the\ndiscretion of the court, 25 years to life.”\n\n\n\n                                             22.\n\fsection 190.5[, subdivision ](b) does not clearly indicate whether the statute was intended\nto make life without parole the presumptive sentence.” (People v. Gutierrez, supra, 58\nCal.4th at p. 1371.)\n       The same example can be applied to the syntax of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f). Thus, we do not agree with defendant that resentencing to a second strike\nterm “is the ‘generally mandatory’ disposition, subject only to ‘circumscribed’ discretion\nto retain” the indeterminate third strike term. A court considering whether to resentence\nan eligible petitioner under section 1170.126, subdivision (f) has circumscribed discretion\nin the sense it can only refuse to resentence if it finds that to do so would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety on the facts of the particular case before it.\nThis does not mean, however, its discretion is circumscribed in the sense it can only find\ndangerousness in extraordinary cases. To the contrary, it can do so in any case in which\nsuch a finding is rational under the totality of the circumstances.\n       Such a conclusion comports with the plain language of the statute. Moreover, a\nconclusion resentencing to a second strike term is a generally mandatory presumption\nfrom which courts can depart only in extraordinary cases, as defendant asserts, would run\ndirectly contrary to the intent of the voters in passing the Act. (See People v. Gutierrez,\nsupra, 58 Cal.4th at pp. 1371-1372 [examining legislative history and voter intent in\nattempt to resolve statutory ambiguity].) As we stated in People v. Osuna, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at page 1036, “‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’\n[citation].” Thus, although one purpose of the Act was to save taxpayer dollars (People\nv. Osuna, supra, at p. 1037), “[i]t is clear the electorate’s intent was not to throw open the\nprison doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or\nviolent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or\nno risk to the public.” (Id. at p. 1038, second italics added.) Had voters intended to\npermit retention of an indeterminate term only in extraordinary cases, they would have\nsaid so in subdivision (f) of section 1170.126, rather than employing language that\n\n                                             23.\n\faffords courts broad discretion to find dangerousness. They also would not have afforded\nthe trial court the power to consider any evidence it determined to be relevant to the issue\nas they did in subdivision (g)(3) of the statute.20\n\n     D.   THE FOCUS IN A SECTION 1170.126, SUBDIVISION (F) ANALYSIS, IS ON WHETHER\n          PETITIONER CURRENTLY POSES AN UNREASONABLE RISK OF DANGER TO PUBLIC\n          SAFETY.\n\n          Defendant contends the trial court “must articulate a rational nexus” between the\nfactors considered in its decision and current dangerousness “as with parole denials.”\n(Some capitalization & underscoring omitted.)\n          In discussing the “some evidence” standard applicable in parole cases, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court has stated: “This standard is unquestionably deferential, but\ncertainly is not toothless, and ‘due consideration’ of the specified factors requires more\nthan rote recitation of the relevant factors with no reasoning establishing a rational nexus\nbetween those factors and the necessary basis for the ultimate decision — the\ndetermination of current dangerousness.” (In re Lawrence, supra, 44 Cal.4th at p. 1210.)\n\n\n20      Defendant points to an article written by two of the authors of the Act, in which\nthey assert the intent of Proposition 36 is that inmates will be entitled to resentencing in\nall but the rarest cases involving true risk to public safety. Assuming this material is\nproperly before us, it does not help defendant, because it finds no support in either the\nlanguage of section 1170.126 itself or in the ballot materials related to Proposition 36.\nFor instance, although the “ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF PROPOSITION 36” stated the\nmeasure had been “carefully crafted … so that truly dangerous criminals” would receive\nno benefits from the Act (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) argument\nin favor of Prop. 36, p. 52), it did not suggest dangerousness would properly be found\nonly in rare cases. Thus, the authors’ intent is not a reliable indicator of what voters\nintended. (See People v.

We also\nagree a trial court may properly deny resentencing under the Act based solely on\nimmutable facts such as a petitioner’s criminal history “only if those facts support the\nultimate conclusion that an inmate continues to pose an unreasonable risk to public\nsafety. [Citation.]” (In re Lawrence, supra, at p. 1221.) “[T]he relevant inquiry is\nwhether [a petitioner’s prior criminal and/or disciplinary history], when considered in\nlight of other facts in the record, are such that they continue to be predictive of current\ndangerousness many years [later].

Defendant also argues voters have determined prisoners like him do\nnot pose an unreasonable risk of danger. If that were so, voters would not have given\ntrial courts discretion to decide what evidence is relevant to such a determination, or to\nmake such determination. We find those arguments unpersuasive.\n\n                                             25.\n\f       Here, the trial court clearly was aware it was required to find defendant currently\nposed an unreasonable risk to public safety. As the court stated in its written ruling,\n“Unless the court finds the defendant presents such a danger, he or she shall be\nresentenced.” (Italics added & omitted.)\n       Additionally, the trial court’s ruling conveyed reasoning which established a nexus\nbetween the evidence before it and current dangerousness. Defendant appears to contend\nan express statement of reasons supporting a finding of dangerousness is required, but\nsection 1170.126 — in contrast to section 1385, subdivision (a) — contains no such\nrequirement. The trial court’s ruling here was more than adequate for meaningful\nappellate review, and “the application of reasoned analysis” is apparent from its ruling.\n(In re Young (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306.) Moreover, the court did not merely rely\non long-ago crimes, although defendant’s criminal record certainly figured into its\ndetermination.\n       Defendant complains the trial court discounted or ignored any evidence favorable\nto him, such as the remoteness of his criminal offenses, his classification score, his health\nand age, and Mathews’s assessment. These matters were all before the court, however,\nand the court expressly stated it had reviewed the case file and records and considered the\ntestimony, and that its determination was “[b]ased on all of those things.” Although it\nmay not have expressly mentioned each piece of evidence individually, this does not\nmean it failed to consider all the evidence. In the absence of any showing to the contrary,\nwe presume it did so. (Evid. Code, § 664; see Denham v.

That defendant\ndoes not agree with the conclusion the court reached, or the weight or lack of weight it\naccorded to the various facts before it, does not mean the trial court erred.\n       Defendant argues the trial court erroneously framed the pertinent issue as an\ninquiry into the risk of recidivism in general, when it should have been looking at the\nlikelihood of future violence. The court did not err. Section 1170.126, subdivision (f)\n\n                                             26.\n\fdoes not say a petitioner shall be resentenced unless the court determines resentencing the\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of violence; rather, it speaks in terms of\ndanger to public safety.21 That a crime (or criminal) can constitute a danger to public\nsafety without being violent is too obvious to dispute (see, e.g., People v. Hughes (2002)\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">287</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 355; People v.

(d)(1), 1170.12, subd. (b)(1), 1192.7, subd. (c)(18), (24) & (26)), and by\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (e)(2)’s disqualification from eligibility for resentencing\npersons convicted of certain narcotics offenses (see §§ 667, subd. (e)(2)(C)(i), 1170.12,\nsubd. (c)(2)(C)(i)). Although the ballot materials concerning Proposition 36 focused on\nviolent criminals, section 7 of the Act provides: “This act is an exercise of the public\npower of the people of the State of California for the protection of the health, safety, and\nwelfare of the people of the State of California, and shall be liberally construed to\neffectuate those purposes.” (Italics omitted.) To condition resentencing denials upon the\nlikelihood of future violence would run contrary to the language of section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f) and voters’ intent, and would not effectuate the purposes of the Act.\n       Finally, defendant contends that, in light of the Act’s express purpose of “a more\nrational and cost-effective allocation of the crippling expenses of California’s prison\n\n\n21      Words and phrases used in the Penal Code “must be construed according to the\ncontext and the approved usage of the language .…” (§ 7, subd. 16.) In interpreting a\nballot initiative, we afford the words used their ordinary and usual meaning. (People v.\nPark (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">56</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 796.) “[S]afety” has been variously defined as “the\ncondition of being safe: freedom from exposure to danger: exemption from hurt, injury or\nloss” (Webster’s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1986) p. 1998) and “[t]he condition of being\nsafe; freedom from danger, risk, or injury” (American Heritage Dict. (2d college ed.\n1982) p. 1084).\n\n\n\n                                             27.\n\fsystem,” trial courts are required to weigh fiscal considerations in deciding resentencing\npetitions, something the trial court here did not do. In our view, the notion that the cost\nof continued incarceration has some bearing on whether resentencing a particular inmate\nwould pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety is a non sequitur. Although\nsaving money is a goal of the Act, it does not override the primary purpose of the three\nstrikes law and the Act as a whole — the protection of public safety. (See People v.\nOsuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1036-1038.) The trial court was not required to\ntake the cost of continued imprisonment into account or undertake the equivalent of a\ncost-benefit analysis in determining whether resentencing defendant would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety; the Act already did so, and the electorate has\ndetermined keeping criminals who pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\nbehind bars for their full three strikes sentence is more important than saving money.\n                                             III*\n                             Section 1170.18, Subdivision (c)\n       On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, “the Safe Neighborhoods\nand Schools Act” (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal.\nConst., art. II, § 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 renders\nmisdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or\n“wobblers,” unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47\nalso created a new resentencing provision — section 1170.18 — by which a person\ncurrently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may\npetition for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the\noffense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (§ 1170.18, subd. (a).) A\nperson who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her\nsentence recalled and be “resentenced to a misdemeanor … unless the court, in its\n*      See footnote, ante, page 1.\n\n\n\n                                              28.\n\fdiscretion, determines that resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” (Id., subd. (b).)22\n       Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the\nofficial ballot pamphlet — and nowhere called to voters’ attention — is the provision at\nissue in the present appeal. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: “As used\nthroughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’ means an\nunreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning\nof clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\nSection 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called\n“super strike” offenses:\n\n              “(I) A ‘sexually violent offense’ as defined in subdivision (b) of\n       Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.\n\n              “(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and\n       who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section\n       288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more\n       than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual\n       penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is\n       more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.\n\n              “(III) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of\n       age, in violation of Section 288.\n\n              “(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide\n       offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.\n\n              “(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.\n\n              “(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as\n       defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.\n\n\n\n22    Proposition 47 also created a process whereby eligible persons who have already\ncompleted their sentences may have the particular conviction or convictions designated\nas misdemeanors. (§ 1170.18, subds. (f), (g).)\n\n\n\n                                                29.\n\f              “(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in\n       paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.\n\n              “(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in\n       California by life imprisonment or death.”\n       The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court’s\ndiscretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the\ndefendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new “super strike”\noffense. Defendant says it does. The People disagree. We agree with the People.23\n\n\n23     We solicited supplemental briefing concerning Proposition 47. Among the\nquestions we asked counsel to answer were whether defendant met the criteria for\nresentencing under section 1170.18 and, if so, whether we needed to determine the\napplicability, if any, of section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to resentencing proceedings\nunder section 1170.126. We are satisfied it is appropriate for us to reach the issue of\napplicability regardless of whether defendant might obtain resentencing under\nProposition 47.\n        It appears that a number of inmates will be eligible to seek resentencing under\nboth the Act and Proposition 47. Such an inmate need not wait to file a petition under\nProposition 47 until the trial court’s ruling on the inmate’s petition under the Act is final.\nA trial court is not divested of jurisdiction over a Proposition 47 petition by the fact a\npetition under the Act is pending, whether in a trial court or a Court of Appeal, with\nrespect to the same inmate.

[Citation.] The\n       primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘… to deter repeat offenders and, at\n       some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses\n       serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the\n       rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its\n       duration are based not merely on that person’s most recent offense but also\n       on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which\n       he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\n       dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will\n\n                                             33.\n\f       be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount\n       of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely\n       within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.’ [Citation.]\n\n               “By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the\n       will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\n       incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate\n       punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by\n       ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater punishment’ for second and\n       third ‘strikers.’” (People v. Cooper (1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247818\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247818/people-v-cooper/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.)\n       Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike\noffenders. Thus, one of the “Findings and Declarations” of the Act stated the Act would\n“[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public’s original understanding by requiring life\nsentences only when a defendant’s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.”\n(Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of proposed law, § 1, p. 105.)\nNowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially\n\n24      The foregoing applies equally to the three strikes initiative measure that added\nsection 1170.12 to the Penal Code. The following statement of intent preceded the text of\nthe statute in Proposition 184, which was approved by voters on November 8, 1994: “‘It\nis the intent of the People of the State of California in enacting this measure to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses.’” (See Historical\nand Statutory Notes, 50C West’s Ann. Pen. Code (2004 ed.) foll. § 1170.12, p. 239.)\n\n\n\n                                            34.\n\fto open the prison doors to existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious\ncases, as would be the result if the definition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’” contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentencing\nproceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (f). That voters did not intend such a\nresult is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory\nunder the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a\nprior conviction for a “super strike” offense (§§ 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)),\nand that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an\narray of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (e)(2)).\n       The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a\nresult of its enactment. Thus, as we previously observed, uncodified section 7 of the Act\nprovides: “This act is an exercise of the public power of the people of the State of\nCalifornia for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of\nCalifornia, and shall be liberally construed to effectuate those purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012), supra, text of proposed law, p. 110,\noriginal italics omitted, italics added.) As we explained in People v. Osuna, supra, 225\nCal.App.4th at page 1036, “Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].”\n       In contrast, Proposition 47 — while titled “the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools\nAct” — emphasized monetary savings. The “Findings and Declarations” state: “The\npeople of the State of California find and declare as follows: [¶] The people enact the\nSafe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent\nand serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to\ninvest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12\nschools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that\nsentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child\n\n                                             35.\n\fmolestation are not changed.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text\nof proposed law, § 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: “This act\nshall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,” while uncodified section 18\nstates: “This act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, text of proposed law, p. 74.)\nProposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property\noffenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a “super strike” offense or for\nan offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c).\n(Health & Saf. Code, §§ 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); §§ 459.5,\nsubd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).)\nSection 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing only those inmates whose current\noffense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a “super\nstrike” offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to\nsection 290, subdivision (c). (§ 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)\n       Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any\nindication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would\nnow be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on the Act, which dealt with\noffenders whose current convictions would still be felonies, albeit not third strikes. For\ninstance, the Official Title and Summary stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47\nwould “[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses[,\ni.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure] unless court finds\nunreasonable public safety risk.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014),\nsupra, official title and summary, p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do,\nthe Legislative Analyst stated: “This measure reduces penalties for certain offenders\nconvicted of nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. This measure also\nallows certain offenders who have been previously convicted of such crimes to apply for\nreduced sentences.” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra,\n\n                                              36.\n\fanalysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the\nresentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained:\n\n               “This measure allows offenders currently serving felony sentences\n       for the above crimes[, i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen\n       property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply\n       to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In\n       addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a\n       felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their\n       felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who\n       has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their\n       conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not\n       required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the\n       court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime.\n       Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for\n       one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.” (Id. at\n       p. 36, italics added.)\n       Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms\nsolely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The Argument in Favor of\nProposition 47 spoke in terms of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop\nwasting prison space “on petty crimes,” stop “wasting money on warehousing people in\nprisons for nonviolent petty crimes,” and stop California’s overcrowded prisons from\n“incarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.” (Voter\nInformation Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument in favor of Prop. 47,\np. 38.) The Rebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47 reiterated these themes, and\nnever suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act.\n(See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the Rebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\nasserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that\nmany of them had prior convictions “for serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and\nhome burglary” (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, rebuttal to\nargument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), there is no suggestion the early release provisions\n\n\n\n                                            37.\n\fwould extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The\nsame is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the Argument Against\nProposition 47. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014), supra, argument\nagainst Prop. 47, p. 39.)\n       In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the\ndefinition of “‘unreasonable risk of danger to public safety’” contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it appears in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), despite the former section’s preamble, “As used throughout this\nCode .…” Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.\n       We are cognizant one of the Act’s authors has taken the position Proposition 47’s\ndefinition of “unreasonable risk of danger” applies to resentencing proceedings under the\nAct. (St. John & Gerber, Prop. 47 Jolts Landscape of California Justice System (Nov. 5,\n2014) Los Angeles Times <http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-ff-pol-\nproposition47-20141106-story.html> [as of Dec. 17, 2014].) Looking at the information\nconveyed to voters, however, this clearly was not their intent and so an author’s desire is\nof no import. (Cf. People v. Garcia, supra, 28 Cal.4th at pp. 1175-1176, fn. 5; People v.\nBradley (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Thus, we presume voters were aware\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as\nnevertheless having no fixed definition.

Flores, supra,\n227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075.) Because nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47\nwas it called to voters’ attention the definition of the phrase contained in section 1170.18,\nsubdivision (c) would apply to resentencing proceedings under the Act, we simply cannot\nconclude voters intended Proposition 47 to alter the Act in that respect. Voters are not\nasked or presumed to be able to discern all potential effects of a proposed initiative\nmeasure; this is why they are provided with voter information guides containing not only\nthe actual text of such a measure, but also a neutral explanation and analysis by the\nLegislative Analyst and arguments in support of and in opposition to the measure. As we\nhave already observed, none of those materials so much as hinted that Proposition 47\ncould have the slightest effect on resentencing under the Act. (Cf. Marshall v. Pasadena\nUnified School Dist., supra, 119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of\nenactment included information bill would add definition of particular term to Public\nContract Code].)25\n       We are asked to infer an intent to extend section 1170.18, subdivision (c)’s\ndefinition to proceedings under section 1170.126 because the phrase in question only\nappears in those sections of the Penal Code. We cannot do so. The only resentencing\nmentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose\ncurrent offenses would be reduced to misdemeanors, not those who would still warrant\nsecond strike felony terms. There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety\nrisked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions\nwhose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone\n\n25     For the same reasons, we reject any suggestion the definition contained in\nsection 1170.18, subdivision (c) was intended to clarify the true meaning of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” as used in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (f).

We question whether\nProposition 47 and the Act are truly in pari materia: That phrase means “[o]n the same\nsubject; relating to the same matter” (Black’s Law Dict. (9th ed. 2009) p. 862), and the\ntwo measures (albeit with some overlap) address different levels of offenses and\noffenders. In any event, “canons of statutory construction are merely aids to ascertaining\nprobable legislative intent” (Stone v.

Allowing trial courts broad discretion to\ndetermine whether resentencing an eligible petitioner under the Act “would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f)) clearly furthers the\nAct’s purpose. Whatever the wisdom of Proposition 47’s policy of near-universal\nresentencing where misdemeanants are concerned — and “[i]t is not for us to gainsay the\nwisdom of this legislative choice” (Bernard v.

(People v. Chaney (Dec. 1, 2014,\nC073949) ___ Cal.App.4th ___, ___-___ [2014 D.A.R. 15934, 15935-15936].)

Were we to\nconclude section 1170.18, subdivision (c) modifies section 1170.126, subdivision (f), we\nwould agree with Chaney that it does not do so retroactively. We believe, however, that\na finding of nonretroactivity inexorably leads to the possibility of prospective-only\napplication, and that prospective-only application of Proposition 47’s definition to\nresentencing petitions under the Act would raise serious, perhaps insurmountable, equal\nprotection issues. “Mindful of the serious constitutional questions that might arise were\nwe to accept a literal construction of the statutory language, and of our obligation\nwherever possible both to carry out the intent of the electorate and to construe statutes so\nas to preserve their constitutionality [citations]” (People v.

I\nagree defendant may not take advantage of Proposition 47’s1 newly enacted definition of\n“unreasonable risk of danger to public safety,” as provided in Penal Code section\n1170.18, subdivision (c) (1170.18(c)). I do so not because there is any ambiguity in the\nlanguage used in section 1170.18(c) or the notion that the statute does not mean what it\nsays, i.e., that the new definition applies “throughout this Code.” Rather, in my view,\nthere is no indication the electorate, in enacting section 1170.18(c), intended it to apply\nretroactively to resentencing determinations under Proposition 36, the Three Strikes\nReform Act of 2012 (the Act).\nI.     After November 4, 2014, the definition of “unreasonable risk of danger” in\n       Section 1170.18(c) applies throughout the Penal Code\n       Section 1170.18(c) provides: “As used throughout this Code, ‘unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety’ means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a\nnew violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph\n(2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.”\n       This section and subdivision were enacted on November 4, 2014, when California\nvoters passed Proposition 47, long past the time of defendant’s resentencing hearing.\nUnless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in\nsection 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant. This is the only inquiry we must make to\nresolve the issue of whether the definition in section 1170.18(c) applies to defendant.\nHowever, the majority has opted to determine whether the new definition applies to any\nresentencing provisions under the Act, past, present, or future. I respectfully disagree\nwith the majority’s analysis and conclusion on this broader issue.\n\n\n1The Safe Neighborhood and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen.

Sinohui (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2521223\"><a href=\"/opinion/2521223/people-v-sinohui/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">205</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 211-212.)\n       Where the statutory language is so clear and unambiguous, there is no need for\nstatutory construction or to resort to legislative materials or other outside sources.\n(Quarterman v.

Absent ambiguity, it is\npresumed the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure, and\nthe courts may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to a presumed intent not\napparent in its language. (People v. ex rel. Lungren v.

For example, in Marshall v. Pasadena Unified School Dist. (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1241</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1255, the court stated there “is nothing ambiguous about the phrase\n‘as used in this code.’” It held the definition of “Emergency, as used in this code”\napplied to the entire Public Contract Code, and it was not limited to a particular chapter,\narticle, or division of that code. Also, in People v. Bucchierre (1943) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n166, the court held: “The words ‘as in this code provided’ (Penal Code, § 182) refer to\nthe Penal Code.”\n       In a similar vein, the court in People v. Leal (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2548607\"><a href=\"/opinion/2548607/people-v-leal/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1007-1008,\napplied the plain meaning rule as follows:\n\n\n\n\n                                              2.\n\f               “The statutory language of the provision defining ‘duress’ in each of\n       the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of ‘duress’ in\n       both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, ‘As used in\n       this section, “duress” means ….’ (§§ 261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This\n       clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of\n       ‘duress’ in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.\n\n              “Starting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated\n       into the rape statute a definition of ‘duress’ that already was in use for other\n       sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended\n       its 1993 amendment of the definition of ‘duress’ in the rape statute, and the\n       incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as\n       well to other sexual offenses that use the term ‘duress.’ Defendant\n       observes: ‘The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why\n       the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of\n       “duress” to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the\n       rape statutes use the phrase “force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of\n       immediate and unlawful bodily injury” but another, much more expansive\n       meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy,\n       lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.’\n\n               “But the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for\n       providing a different definition of ‘duress’ for rape and spousal rape than\n       has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. ‘When\n       “‘statutory language is … clear and unambiguous there is no need for\n       construction, and courts should not indulge in it.’” [Citations.] The plain\n       meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning\n       is “‘repugnant to the general purview of the act,’ or for some other\n       compelling reason ….” [Citations.]’ [Citation.] As we said in an\n       analogous situation: ‘It is our task to construe, not to amend, the statute.\n       “In the construction of a statute … the office of the judge is simply to\n       ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not\n       to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted ….”\n       [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or\n       give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the\n       terms used.’ [Citation.]”\n       The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While\nacknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory\nconstruction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually\nenacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority’s\n\n\n\n                                              3.\n\fview of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so\nthat it now states: “As used in this section only, ‘unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety’ means ….” The majority does so without providing a compelling reason to do so\nand without showing the plain language used has a “‘meaning [that] is “‘repugnant to the\ngeneral purview of the act.’”’” (People v. Leal, supra, 33 Cal.4th at p. 1008.) Because\nthe Act had not previously defined the phrase “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety,” the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or contradictory to the\nAct, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the general purview of\nProposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority on this part of\nthe opinion.\nII.    Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant’s resentencing under the\n       Act\n       I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the\ndefinition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant\nunder the Act.\n       I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that “[n]o\npart of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.” “Whether a statute operates\nprospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent.\nWhen the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,” section 3 provides the\ndefault rule. (People v. Brown (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 319.) Proposition 47 is silent on\nthe question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The\nanalysis of Proposition 47 by the legislative analyst and the arguments for and against\nProposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec.\n(Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that\nsection 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no\nclearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies.\n\n\n\n\n                                                4.\n\f       Defendant cites In re Estrada (1965) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421177\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421177/in-re-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> to argue retroactive\napplication.\n       In Estrada, the court stated:\n\n       “When the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it\n       has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe\n       and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission\n       of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must\n       have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now\n       deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it\n       constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter\n       punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its\n       passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not\n       final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to\n       conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a\n       conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.” (In re\n       Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)\n       One may argue that under the Estrada case, unless there is a “savings clause”\nproviding for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to\napply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute’s effective date. (In\nre Estrada, supra, 63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the Estrada case has\nbeen revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In People v. Brown, supra, 54\nCal.4th at page 324 the court stated: “Estrada is today properly understood, not as\nweakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal\nCode] section 3, but rather as informing the rule’s application in a specific context by\narticulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment\nfor a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.” “The\nholding in Estrada was founded on the premise that ‘“[a] legislative mitigation of the\npenalty for a particular crime represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or\nthe different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.”’”\n(Id. at p. 325.) In Brown, the court did not apply the Estrada rule because “a statute\nincreasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not\n\n\n                                             5.\n\frepresent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular\ncriminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.”\n(People v. Brown, supra, at p. 325.)\n       Similarly here, Estrada does not control because applying the definition of\n“unreasonable risk to public safety” in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under\nthe Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime. Instead, the downward\nmodification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current\noffense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender,\nincluding criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and “[a]ny\nother evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding\nwhether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.”\n(Pen. Code, § 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)\n       For this reason also, defendant’s argument his equal protection rights would be\nviolated if he is denied retroactive application is unavailing. In light of the unlimited\nfactors related to individual offenders that inform the exercise of discretion, no two\nindividual offenders may be said to be similarly situated for purposes of resentencing\nunder the Act. Unlike In re Kapperman (1974) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1246429\"><a href=\"/opinion/1246429/in-re-kapperman/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, upon which defendant\nrelies, Proposition 47’s new definition does not automatically confer a benefit such as\ncredit for time served prior to commencement of their prison sentence to some prisoners\nand not others based solely on their commitment date.\n       Nor is this case similar to Village of Willowbrook v. Olech (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1855348\"><a href=\"/opinion/1855348/village-of-willowbrook-v-olech/\"><span class=\"volume\">528</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">562</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\nalso relied upon by defendant. There, the plaintiff (Olech) alleged she was intentionally\ntreated differently from others similarly situated and that there was no rational basis for\nthe difference in treatment. Specifically, the defendant (Village) had intentionally\ndemanded a 33-foot easement as a condition of connecting her property to the municipal\nwater supply where the Village required only a 15-foot easement from other similarly\nsituated property owners. After a three-month delay, Village relented and agreed to\n\n                                              6.\n\fprovide water service with only a 15-foot easement. Olech also alleged Village was\nactually motivated by ill will resulting from Olech’s prior filing of an unrelated and\nunsuccessful lawsuit against Village. The high court held that apart from the Village’s\nsubjective motivation, the fact the Village required a 33-foot easement from Olech as a\ncondition for connecting her property while it required only a 15-foot easement from the\nother similarly situated property owners sufficiently stated a claim for relief under\ntraditional equal protection analysis. (Id. at pp. 563-565.) Here, defendant has not shown\nhe is similarly situated to others to whom the new definition has applied or may apply,\nnor has he established that he has been treated differently as a result of some arbitrary\ndiscrimination.\n       Because section 1170.18(c)’s definition of “unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety” does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct\nstandard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant.2 Since defendant has\nfailed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority’s affirmance of the\njudgment.\n\n                                                          ___________________________\n                                                                              PEÑA, J.\n\n\n\n\n2Recently  in People v.
