R. 47.5 the Court has determined that this opinion\nshould not be published and is not precedent except under the limited\ncircumstances set forth in 5TH CIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\fplaintiff–appellee Karen Jo Barrow (Barrow).                Smith presents three\n\narguments       against    the   judgment,     contending     that:     first,    the\n\ndistrict court erroneously applied a heightened level of scrutiny\n\nin analyzing the constitutionality of the state action at issue in\n\nthis case; second, the district court erred in deciding to award\n\nBarrow attorneys’ fees; and third, the district court erred when it\n\nruled       that   Smith’s   $30,000.00       joint   offer   of   judgment      with\n\ncodefendant Greenville Independent School District (GISD) and his\n\nlater $100,000.00 offer, both made pursuant to Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 68, were ineffective to invoke Rule 68's provision\n\nrequiring certain offerees to pay post-offer costs.\n\n       Barrow cross-appeals, arguing that the district court erred in\n\ndetermining the prevailing market rate for Barrow’s attorneys and\n\nin making downward adjustments to Barrow’s attorneys’ hours.\n\n       For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n\n                           FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW1\n\n       During the summer of 1998, Barrow was employed as a teacher by\n\nGISD, where Smith was then a superintendent.                   Barrow’s children\n\nwere       enrolled   in   the   Greenville     Christian     School,    a   private\n\nreligious school.\n\n       That summer, an assistant principal position at a middle\n\nschool became open at GISD, and Barrow applied for the job.                   In May\n\n       1\n       We have previously chronicled the facts and proceedings of this case.\nSee Barrow v. Greenville Indep. Sch. Dist. (Barrow II), 480 F.3d 377, 379–80\n(5th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, U.S. LEXIS 11047 (U.S. Oct. 1, 2007) (No. 07-\n59).\n\n                                          2\n\fof 1998, at Smith’s direction, a senior school official approached\n\nBarrow and asked whether she would move her children to the public\n\nschools so that she could be considered for the assistant principal\n\nposition.   Barrow responded that she was very much interested in\n\nbecoming an assistant principal, but she would not remove her\n\nchildren from their private religious school.\n\n     After Barrow’s name was included in the applicant pool, Smith\n\ndirected the assistant superintendent for personnel to see if\n\nBarrow would move her children to public school.    She would not,\n\nand GISD hired another person for the assistant principal position.\n\nSmith later told Barrow and her husband that he had not recommended\n\nBarrow for the position because their children attended private\n\nschool.\n\n     Barrow filed this suit in 2000 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nalleging that Smith violated her constitutional rights by refusing\n\nto consider her for the assistant principal position because Barrow\n\nwould not move her children from the private Christian school into\n\na GISD school.\n\n     Smith moved for summary judgment based on his assertion that\n\nhe was entitled to qualified immunity, permitting the court to\n\nassume for the purpose of his motion that he decided not to promote\n\nBarrow at least in part because she chose to educate her children\n\nin a private school.   The district court granted Smith’s motion,\n\nfinding him entitled to qualified immunity after concluding that\n\n\n\n                                 3\n\fthe   law    was   not   clearly   established    regarding   public   school\n\nemployees’ constitutional right to send their children to a private\n\nschool. We reversed the district court’s grant of summary judgment\n\nto Smith in this case’s first appearance before this court.            Barrow\n\nv. Greenville Indep. Sch. Dist. (Barrow I), 332 F.3d 844 (5th Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n      After this court decided Barrow I, the district court and\n\nparties agreed to refer the case for non-binding arbitration\n\nconcerning the issue of attorneys’ fees.             On July 27, 2004, the\n\ndistrict court judge presiding over the non-binding arbitration\n\nrecommended that Barrow’s fee request be denied in its entirety or,\n\nalternatively, drastically reduced.\n\n      At    trial,   Barrow   asserted     two   claims   against   Smith:    a\n\nreligious rights claim and a parental rights claim.            On March 25,\n\n2005, after a two-week trial, the jury reached its verdict.                  It\n\nrejected Barrow’s religious rights claim, but found in her favor on\n\nher parental rights claim.         The jury awarded Barrow $15,455.00 in\n\ncompensatory damages and $20,000.00 in punitive damages against\n\nSmith.      Barrow lost all claims against GISD.\n\n      Barrow and Smith both filed post-judgment motions, but the\n\ndistrict court denied all of these.              On December 20, 2005, the\n\ndistrict court awarded Barrow $631,293.00 in attorneys’ fees and\n\n$22,775.22 in expenses and taxable court costs.\n\n      Smith filed notice of appeal on January 12, 2006.                Barrow\n\n\n                                       4\n\fcross-appealed.\n\n                                    DISCUSSION\n\n                             I. Level of Scrutiny\n\n       To withstand strict scrutiny, a state must show that its\n\nchallenged action “necessarily relate[s] to a compelling state\n\ninterest.”       Kite v. Marshall, 661 F.2d 1027, 1030 (5th Cir. 1981).\n\nConversely,       the    rational    basis     test   requires    only         that   the\n\nchallenged       state     action       “rationally     promote      a     legitimate\n\ngovernmental objective.”            Id.    “A state action viewed under the\n\nrational basis banner is presumed to be valid,” and the party\n\nchallenging the state action must show that it is completely\n\narbitrary.       Id.\n\n       Smith argues on appeal that the district court erroneously\n\napplied strict scrutiny when it should have used the rational basis\n\ntest to analyze Barrow’s parental rights claim.                  Specifically, he\n\nargues that because the jury rejected Barrow’s religious rights\n\nclaim, there was no justification for applying a level of scrutiny\n\ngreater than rational basis.             Under the rational basis test, Smith\n\nasserts, the district court should have entered judgment in his\n\nfavor.    We review constitutional questions de novo. United States\n\nv. Perez-Macias, 335 F.3d 421, 425 (5th Cir. 2003).\n\n       In Barrow I, we disagreed with the district court’s conclusion\n\nthat the law on public school employees’ constitutional right to\n\nsend     their    children    to    a     private     school   was       not    clearly\n\n\n                                           5\n\festablished, and reversed the district court’s judgment.   332 F.3d\n\nat 846; see id. at 848 (stating that “the constitutional right of\n\npublic-school employees to select a private-school education for\n\ntheir children was clearly established when Smith refused to\n\nconsider Barrow for the position of assistant principal”).       In\n\nreaching our decision to reverse in Barrow I, we relied heavily on\n\ntwo of this court’s previous opinions: Brantley v. Surles (Brantley\n\nI), 718 F.2d 1354 (5th Cir. 1983), and     Fyfe v. Curlee, 902 F.2d\n\n401 (5th Cir. 1990).    See Barrow I, 332 F.3d at 847–48 (discussing\n\nBrantley I and Fyfe).\n\n     In Brantley I, the plaintiff Brantley brought suit under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 against the superintendent of education and board of\n\neducation in Montgomery County, Mississippi, alleging that they\n\nviolated her constitutional rights to direct her child’s education\n\nby firing her from her position as a public school cafeteria worker\n\n“for the sole reason that her son attended a private academy rather\n\nthan the local public school.”    718 F.2d at 1355.   Unlike in the\n\npresent case, there was no suggestion that the plaintiff’s decision\n\nto send her son to private school was based on religion; Brantley\n\nhad transferred her son from a public high school to a private,\n\nsegregated academy in hopes that he “would have a better chance of\n\nplaying varsity sports at the academy.”      Id. at 1355–56.   This\n\ncourt deemed that the decision to transfer Brantley’s son to\n\nprivate school fell under the umbrella of the Constitution’s\n\n\n                                  6\n\fguarantee of familial privacy, id. at 1359, but we recognized that,\n\n“[i]n the realm of public school employment, the court must balance\n\nthe interests of the school employee with the interest of the state\n\nin promoting efficiency in the educational services which it\n\nprovides through its school employees.”        Id.     The panel explained,\n\n“The state may legitimately interfere with the constitutionally\n\nprotected conduct of a public school employee whenever that conduct\n\nmaterially and substantially impedes the operation or effectiveness\n\nof the educational program.”        Id.   Accordingly, the judgment was\n\nreversed and the case remanded to the district court to determine,\n\nfirst,   whether   Brantley’s   son’s     enrollment    in   private   school\n\n“materially and substantially interfered with the operation or\n\neffectiveness of the educational program” at Brantley’s school.\n\nId.   The panel directed the district court to also determine\n\n“whether the protected activity played a substantial part in the\n\nboard’s discharge decision,” and that if it did, whether Brantley\n\n“would have been fired anyway for reasons completely independent of\n\nthe private school enrollment decision.”         Id.\n\n      Brantley’s case appeared before this court again in Brantley\n\nv. Surles (Brantley II), 765 F.2d 478, 479 (5th Cir. 1985) (per\n\ncuriam),   after   the   district   court   determined       on   remand   that\n\nBrantley was fired from her job for nondiscriminatory reasons.               We\n\nreversed and remanded again after concluding that the ostensible\n\nreason for Brantley’s discharge—a disrespectful remark made about\n\n\n                                     7\n\fa board of education member—could not have been the basis for her\n\ndischarge.    Id. at 481–82.   But we agreed with the district court’s\n\ndeterminations that the private school education of Brantley’s son\n\nplayed a substantial part in the board’s decision to fire Brantley,\n\nand that there was “no evidence that the enrollment of Brantley’s\n\nson in the private school materially and substantially interfered\n\nwith the operation or effectiveness of the educational program at\n\nthe public school.”      Id. at 480.      The local superintendent of\n\neducation had testified that interracial dissension might occur\n\nafter Brantley’s son withdrew to enroll in a private, segregated\n\nschool, but the superintendent’s belief was unsupported “by any\n\nobjective evidence.”     Id.\n\n     In Fyfe v. Curlee, the plaintiff Fyfe was a secretary to a\n\npublic elementary school principal when she enrolled her daughter\n\nin a private, all-white academy.          902 F.2d at 402.      Like the\n\nplaintiff in the Brantley cases, Fyfe’s reasons for selecting a\n\nprivate education for her child were unrelated to religion; she and\n\nher husband were concerned about her daughter’s experiences with\n\nanother white child at the public school and thought that her\n\ndaughter would be happier at the private academy.        Id.   Around the\n\ntime of Fyfe’s decision to enroll her daughter in private school,\n\nblack citizens began boycotting local businesses, primarily “to put\n\npressure on the school system to increase the number of black\n\nteachers     and   administrators.”       Id.      The    local   school\n\n\n                                      8\n\fsuperintendent encouraged Fyfe to resign.           Id.   When Fyfe refused,\n\nhe transferred her to a newly created, undesirable job.              Id. at\n\n402–03.    Fyfe filed suit under section 1983, alleging retaliation\n\nagainst her for exercising her constitutional right to enroll her\n\ndaughter in private school.           Id. at 402.     This court concluded\n\nthat, by transferring her to a menial position, the school district\n\nhad violated Fyfe’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.            Id. at\n\n405.    The question then became whether the record revealed that\n\nFyfe’s “protected conduct of enrolling her child in a private\n\nschool was detrimental to the effecient operation of the [] school\n\nsystem.”    Id.   We made clear that this analysis—which requires\n\nbalancing the interest of the school employee with that of the\n\nstate in promoting efficiency in educational services—“is to be\n\nconducted by the court as a matter of law, not fact,” id., and that\n\nthe defendant state shoulders the burden to show that the child’s\n\nenrollment in private school harms the public school system.              See\n\nid. at 406 (because defendant had failed to demonstrate that its\n\ninterference with the plaintiff’s parental rights was necessary for\n\nthe efficient operation of the school system, plaintiff prevailed\n\nas a matter of law).       We concluded that the state had “failed to\n\ndemonstrate that its action in reassigning Mrs. Fyfe was necessary\n\nto the smooth and efficient operation of the school system.”              Id.\n\nat 406.    We explained:\n\n       “[T]he   school     district     produced    no    evidence   of\n\n\n                                       9\n\f     substantial interference with its effectiveness as a\n     result of Mrs. Fyfe’s enrollment of her daughter in\n     private school . . . . The record is completely silent\n     on any effect Shannon Fyfe’s move to the private school\n     had on the appellee school district. This court held in\n     the second appeal in Brantley that belief alone of such\n     interference ‘unsupported by any objective evidence’ is\n     not sufficient to demonstrate material interference to\n     carry the balancing test for the school district.\n     Brantley v. Surles, 765 F.2d 478, 480 (5th Cir. 1985).”\n     Id. at 405.\n\nOur analysis was unchanged by the fact that a boycott of local\n\nbusinesses had been threatened in case a public school employee\n\nenrolled his or her child in a private, segregated school.   There\n\nwas no evidence that this possibility of a boycott was related to\n\nFyfe, or that it impeded the school system’s operation:\n\n     “No causal link was ever made in the district court\n     between the threatened school boycott and Mrs. Fyfe’s\n     action. When asked on cross-examination whether she was\n     aware that one of the demands of the boycotting group was\n     ‘that the school system not employ anybody who does now\n     or ever has had a child in a private segregated academy,’\n     the plaintiff responded that she had read about that in\n     the paper. The mere fact that this demand was made on\n     the school system however cannot be sufficient to\n     demonstrate that Mrs. Fyfe’s enrollment of her daughter\n     at a private school caused substantial and material\n     interference with the school system’s operation and\n     effectiveness.” Id. at 405.\n\n     When the instant case first appeared before a panel of this\n\ncourt in Barrow I, we relied on the Brantley and Fyfe cases for\n\ncertain principles.   For example, we stated in Barrow I that those\n\ncases clarified that “public-school employees like Barrow have a\n\nprotected right to educate their children in private school,” 332\n\nF.3d at 848, and that this public school employee right was clearly\n\n\n                                 10\n\festablished when Smith refused to consider Barrow for the assistant\n\nprincipal position.       Id.    Most important to the instant appeal, in\n\nBarrow I, we relied on the Brantley and Fyfe cases in declaring\n\nthat a “state cannot take an adverse employment action against a\n\npublic-school employee for exercising this right [to educate his or\n\nher   child   in   private      school]    unless     it    can   prove    that   the\n\nemployee’s selection of private school materially and substantially\n\naffects the state’s educational mission.”                  Id.\n\n      Because we had unequivocally declared in Barrow I the state’s\n\nburden to show Barrow’s enrollment of her children in private\n\nschool caused detriment to its educational mission, we found it\n\nunnecessary to address in the opinion from that appeal the question\n\nof the degree of scrutiny to be applied to a state’s adverse action\n\nagainst a public school employee for sending his or her child to a\n\nprivate school.     Id. at 849 n.20.           We found it to be an unnecessary\n\nanalysis because, regardless of the level of scrutiny applied, it\n\nwas   still   incumbent    on    the   defendant      to     show   that   Barrow’s\n\nselection of school for her children had an injurious effect on the\n\noperations of the public school system that employed her.                    If the\n\ndefendant failed to meet that burden, its defense would be a\n\nnonstarter.    We explained:\n\n      “[W]e express no opinion on the particular degree of\n      scrutiny a state action must undergo to withstand a\n      challenge to its constitutionality in a case like this\n      one. Instead, we simply recognize that the state cannot\n      strip its school employees of the right to choose a\n      private-school education for their children without\n\n                                          11\n\f     proving that the unfettered exercise of this right will\n     undermine a state interest.     Barrow and amici curiae\n     argue that any state action that interferes with this\n     right is subject to strict scrutiny. We need not take up\n     this question today. In the absence of objective proof\n     that Barrow’s choice of a private-school education for\n     her children will undermine a state interest the\n     district’s patronage policy fails irrespective of the\n     degree of scrutiny applied.” Id. (emphasis added).2\n\nHaving found that Barrow asserted a constitutionally protected\n\nright, and that Smith interfered with that right, Barrow would\n\nprevail if the defendants did not show that the interference was\n\nrequired for the smooth and efficient operations of the school\n\nsystem.    This was the effect of our reliance in Barrow I on\n\nBrantley and Fyfe.\n\n     Smith argues that requiring defendants in a case with facts\n\nsuch as these to show that the public school employee’s choice of\n\na private school education for their children impeded with the\n\npublic school system’s operations constitutes strict scrutiny of\n\nthe defendant school board’s actions. Smith asserts that Barrow is\n\nnot entitled     to   this   degree   of   scrutiny   without   a   religious\n\ncomponent to her claim, and Smith contends that any possibility of\n\nsuch a religious component was eradicated when the jury found that\n\nBarrow’s religious rights were not violated.\n\n\n     2\n       We likewise made clear in Barrow I that we did not need to decide\nwhether the right asserted by the plaintiff fell under the First Amendment or\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because, regardless, the\ndefendant had the burden of showing that the enrollment of Barrow’s children\nin private school impeded school operations. See 332 F.3d at 846–47\n(considering together three claims asserted by Barrow because “at bottom all\naver that Barrow, a public-school employee, has a constitutionally-protected\nright to select a private-school education for her children”).\n\n                                      12\n\f     One might argue that because the jury found that religious\n\nrights were not violated, there is no religious component in this\n\ncase.    In this case’s second appearance before this court, Barrow\n\nv. Greenville Independent School District (Barrow II), 480 F.3d 377\n\n(5th Cir. 2007), cert. denied, U.S. LEXIS 11047 (U.S. Oct. 1, 2007)\n\n(No. 07-59), Barrow unsuccessfully challenged the district court’s\n\ngrants of summary judgment in favor of GISD.      480 F.3d at 380.\n\nWhile the Barrow II opinion largely focuses on Barrow’s argument\n\nthat Smith was a policymaker and that therefore GISD was liable for\n\nhis unconstitutional conduct, see id. at 380–82, we also addressed\n\nBarrow’s contention that the district court improperly granted\n\nsummary judgment in favor of GISD on her religious discrimination\n\nclaim.   See id. at 382–83.   We agreed with the district court that\n\nBarrow had not produced sufficient evidence to show that GISD’s\n\nemployment practices result in a significant disparity between\n\nthose who are religious and those who are not.      Id. at 383.   We\n\nstated further:\n\n     “The record evidence, read in the light most favorable to\n     Barrow, supports the district court’s conclusion that\n     Smith did not recommend Barrow because her children were\n     not attending the public schools, not because her\n     children were attending a religious school. There is no\n     probative evidence that Smith’s decision had any impact\n     upon any First Amendment-protected freedom.” Id.\n\n     Assuming, then, that Barrow II removes the possibility of a\n\nreligious element to Barrow’s claims, Smith relies on several cases\n\nfor the proposition that the appropriate level of scrutiny to be\n\n\n                                  13\n\fapplied to state actions interfering with parental rights—where\n\nthere is no religious element—is rational basis.           In particular,\n\nSmith cites the United States Supreme Court’s decision in Wisconsin\n\nv. Yoder, 92 S.Ct. 1526 (1972), and two previous opinions of this\n\ncourt: Kite v. Marshall, 661 F.2d 1027 (5th Cir. 1981), and\n\nLittlefield v. Forney Independent School District, 268 F.3d 275\n\n(5th Cir. 2001).\n\n     In Kite v. Marshall, a case decided before the Brantley cases\n\nand Fyfe v. Curlee, plaintiffs challenged a regulation requiring\n\nthat any high school student who attended certain summer sports\n\ntraining camps be suspended temporarily from varsity athletic\n\neligibility.    661 F.2d at 1028.        Various reasons supported the\n\nrule: “the need to control over-zealous coaches, parents and\n\ncommunities, the achieving of a competitive balance between those\n\nwho can afford to attend summer camp and those who cannot, the\n\navoidance of various excessive pressures on students, and the\n\nabrogation of the use of camps as recruiting mechanisms.”             Id. at\n\n1030.   The district court declared the rule unconstitutional, but\n\nthis court reversed, finding that it did not violate either the due\n\nprocess   clause   or   equal   protection   clause   of   the    Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.     Id. at 1028. We determined that the rule did not\n\nimplicate any fundamental constitutional right, and that therefore\n\nthe appropriate level of scrutiny was rational basis.            Id. at 1029,\n\n1030.\n\n\n                                    14\n\f       In    Littlefield   v.   Forney     Independent     School     District,\n\nindividual students and parents of students challenged a district-\n\nwide mandatory uniform policy. 268 F.3d at 279. Specifically, the\n\nparents contended that the compulsory uniform policy violated their\n\nconstitutional right to control their children’s education in\n\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment.            Id. at 282.       The parents\n\nargued that their right to control their children’s education was\n\na fundamental right and that therefore the court should apply\n\nstrict scrutiny in analyzing the school uniform policy.                 Id. at\n\n288.       We disagreed, declining to find a “fundamental right for\n\nparents to control the clothing their children wear to public\n\nschools.”3       Id. at 289.    We analyzed the asserted parental right\n\nunder a rational-basis standard.           Id.\n\n       While both Kite and Littlefield employ a rational basis\n\nstandard to analyze state interference with parental rights, those\n\ncases      are   distinguishable   from    the   instant   case.      Kite   and\n\nLittlefield address policies relating to what goes on at the public\n\nschool: ineligibility to participate in school varsity athletics if\n\ncertain types of summer sport camps are attended, and a district-\n\nwide compulsory school uniform policy.               The defendant Smith’s\n\n\n\n       3\n        We explained:\n       “While Parents may have a fundamental right in the upbringing and\n       education of their children, this right does not cover the\n       Parents’ objection to a public school Uniform Policy. It has long\n       been recognized that parental rights are not absolute in the\n       public school context and can be subject to reasonable\n       regulation.” 268 F.3d at 291.\n\n                                      15\n\fstance toward Barrow’s decision to educate her children in private\n\nschool does not in any way relate to what occurs at a GISD-operated\n\npublic school.   Stated differently, a rule requiring public school\n\nemployees to enroll their children in public schools is simply more\n\ninvasive of parental rights and less clearly tied to the public\n\nschool’s management of its students and educational program than\n\nthe Kite and Littlefield rules addressing school varsity athletics\n\neligibility   and    school      uniforms.             Kite   and     Littlefield    are\n\ndistinguishable, and they are not controlling in this case.\n\n     Nevertheless, we acknowledge that it is possible to argue that\n\nwithout a situation akin to that in Wisconsin v. Yoder, 92 S.Ct.\n\n1526, only rational basis—and not strict scrutiny—should be applied\n\nin evaluating a state action that imposes requirements on parental\n\ndecisions regarding education.                   In Yoder, respondents had been\n\ncharged, tried, and convicted of violating the State of Wisconsin’s\n\ncompulsory school-attendance law that required parents to send\n\ntheir children      to    attend      public      or   private      school   until   the\n\nchildren reached         16   years    of   age.        92    S.Ct.   at   1529.     The\n\nrespondents, two members of the Old Order Amish religion and one\n\nmember of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church, had declined to\n\nsend their 14 and 15 year-old children to public school after they\n\ncompleted the eighth grade, and the children were not enrolled in\n\nany private school, nor did they meet any applicable exception to\n\nthe Wisconsin statute.             Id.      The United States Supreme Court\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fstated:\n\n     “[I]n order for Wisconsin to compel school attendance\n     beyond the eighth grade against a claim that such\n     attendance interferes with the practice of a legitimate\n     religious belief, it must appear either that the State\n     does not deny the free exercise of religious belief by\n     its requirement, or that there is a state interest of\n     sufficient magnitude to override the interest claiming\n     protection under the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. at 1532.\n\nThe Court found that, in the respondents’ case, enforcement of the\n\ncompulsory school-attendance law after the eighth grade “would\n\ngravely endanger if not destroy the free exercise of respondents’\n\nreligious beliefs,” and the focus of its analysis thus turned to\n\nwhether   the    state   interest   was   sufficient   to   override   the\n\nrespondents’ religious-based interest in declining to send their\n\nchildren to public school after the eighth grade.           Id. at 1535.\n\nThe Court made clear its analysis was more rigorous than the\n\nrational-basis test:        “[W]hen the interests of parenthood are\n\ncombined with a free exercise claim of the nature revealed by this\n\nrecord, more than merely a ‘reasonable relation to some purpose\n\nwithin the competency of the State’ is required to sustain the\n\nvalidity of the State’s requirement under the First Amendment.”\n\nId. at 1542.     The Court concluded that the State of Wisconsin was\n\nprecluded from forcing the respondents to send their children to\n\nformal school until the age of 16 by the First and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.     Id.   Thus, Yoder arguably supports Smith’s contention\n\nthat heightened scrutiny is appropriate only where the state action\n\nalso adversely affects free exercise of religion, which the jury\n\n\n                                    17\n\fverdict in this case makes clear is no longer at issue.\n\n      Even if we agree with Smith, however, that Yoder represents\n\nthe only possible basis for a heightened level of scrutiny in cases\n\ndealing with state interference of parental rights, it remains the\n\nschool district’s burden to show that Barrow’s decision to send her\n\nchildren to private school had a materially adverse effect on the\n\npublic school district.    This is so because Barrow I renders that\n\nthe law of the case.\n\n      Under the law of the case doctrine, “[o]nce a panel of this\n\ncourt has decided an issue of law or fact, the decision continues\n\nto govern all subsequent stages of the same case.”   Free v. Abbott\n\nLabs., Inc., 164 F.3d 270, 272 (5th Cir. 1999).   This holds true to\n\nexplicitly decided issues as well as “everything decided ‘by\n\nnecessary implication.’” In re Felt, 255 F.3d 220, 225 (5th Cir.\n\n2001) (quoting Browning v. Navarro, 887 F.2d 553, 556 (5th Cir.\n\n1989)).   The law of the case doctrine is “necessary to bring\n\nfinality to litigation.”    Free, 164 F.3d at 272.   Application of\n\nthe   doctrine   is    discretionary,   but   barring   exceptional\n\ncircumstances this court will generally decline to revisit an issue\n\npreviously decided by another panel in the same case.      Id.; see\n\nalso United States v. Slanina, 359 F.3d 356, 358 (5th Cir. 2004)\n\n(per curiam) (noting that this court follows its prior decisions\n\nwithout re-examination unless, for example, the earlier decision\n\nwas “dead wrong”).     There are no such exceptional circumstances\n\n\n                                 18\n\fwarranting our reconsideration of the panel’s decision in Barrow I.\n\n      It is true that at the time of Barrow I we were faced with a\n\nsummary judgment motion and therefore had to give Barrow the\n\nbenefit        of    the    doubt    on   her    religious     rights   claim,     while\n\nsubsequently the jury verdict and Barrow II took that claim out of\n\nconsideration.         However, it remains the law of the case that Barrow\n\nI   relied      on    the    Brantley     and    Fyfe     cases,   which—as   we   noted\n\nabove—did not have a religious element, and Barrow I expressly held\n\nthat the requirements of those cases obtained regardless of the\n\nlevel     of    scrutiny      and    regardless      of    whether   First    Amendment\n\nreligious rights or merely more general due process parental rights\n\nwere involved.             We held in Barrow I that those Brantley and Fyfe\n\nopinions were controlling, and the law of the case requires that we\n\nadhere to that prior holding herein.\n\n                                    II. Attorneys’ Fees\n\n      Smith faults the district court for acting against the non-\n\nbinding arbitration recommendation and awarding Barrow attorneys’\n\nfees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.4                   Barrow, meanwhile, cross-appeals,\n\ncontending that the district court’s award of attorneys’ fees was\n\n\n\n      4\n       Subsection (b) of 42 U.S.C. § 1988, “Proceedings in vindication of\ncivil rights,” provides that in actions to enforce section 1983, a court “may\nallow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable\nattorney’s fee as part of the costs . . . .”\n      “Section 1988 ‘is a tool that ensures the vindication of important\nrights, even when large sums of money are not at stake, by making attorney’s\nfees available under a private attorney general theory.’” Hopwood v. Texas,\n236 F.3d 256, 278 (5th Cir. 2000) (quoting Farrar v. Hobby, 113 S.Ct. 566, 578\n(1992) (O’Connor, J., concurring)).\n\n                                                19\n\fthe result of improper reduction.            We disagree with both parties\n\nand affirm the district court’s award of fees.\n\n      As we have previously stated, “We cannot overemphasize the\n\nconcept that a district court has broad discretion in determining\n\nthe amount of a fee award.”          Associated Builders & Contractors of\n\nLouisiana, Inc. v. Orleans Parish Sch. Bd., 919 F.2d 374, 379 (5th\n\nCir. 1990).   While we review the award of attorneys’ fees for abuse\n\nof discretion, “[u]nderlying questions of fact are reviewed for\n\nclear error.”    Adams v. Unione Mediterranea di Sicurta, 364 F.3d\n\n646, 656 (5th Cir. 2004).             Such subsidiary factual questions\n\ninclude determinations of “whether the reported hourly rate is\n\nreasonable and whether the reported tasks are duplicative or\n\nunrelated to the purposes of the law suit.”            Associated Builders &\n\nContractors of Louisiana, Inc., 919 F.2d at 379.               The breadth of\n\ndiscretion accorded to the district court in awarding attorneys’\n\nfees is appropriate given that “[a]ppellate courts have only a\n\nlimited opportunity to appreciate the complexity of trying any\n\ngiven case and the level of professional skill needed to prosecute\n\nit.” Hopwood v. Texas, 236 F.3d 256, 277 (5th Cir. 2000); see also\n\nAssociated Builders & Contractors of Louisiana, Inc., 919 F.2d at\n\n379   (stating   that   the    district      court’s   broad   discretion   is\n\n“‘appropriate    in     view    of     the    district    court’s    superior\n\nunderstanding of the litigation and the desirability of avoiding\n\nfrequent appellate review of what essentially are factual matters’”\n\n\n                                       20\n\f(quoting Hensley v. Eckerhart, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 1941 (1983))).\n\n       The district court thoroughly evaluated and considered the\n\npropriety of the attorneys’ fees award.              In its memorandum opinion\n\nand order dated December 20, 2005, the district court discussed for\n\nover fifty pages its reasons for the attorneys’ fees award.                    Given\n\nthe     district       court’s     impressively       careful        and    thorough\n\nconsideration of this issue, we cannot conclude that the court\n\nabused its discretion.           Cf. Associated Builders & Contractors of\n\nLouisiana, Inc., 919 F.2d at 379 (declaring the abuse of discretion\n\nstandard possible only where the district court has provided a\n\nconcise and clear explanation for its award of fees).\n\n                          III.     Offers of Judgment\n\n       Lastly, Smith also contends that the district court erred when\n\nit ruled that his Rule 68 offers of judgment were ineffective.                      At\n\nissue are two offers of judgment: one made jointly by codefendants\n\nSmith    and    GISD    for   $30,000.00,      and   one   by    Smith      only   for\n\n$100,000.00.        Smith argues that in regards to the $30,000.00 joint\n\noffer, the district court should have compared the offer to the\n\nrecovery Barrow obtained against both Smith and GISD, which Smith\n\nargues would make the offer amount greater than Barrow’s recovery\n\nbecause       the    amount      Barrow   was    ordered        to    pay    GISD—or\n\n$14,492.65—should be subtracted from her recovery of $35,455.00\n\nfrom Smith.         In relation to his $100,000.00 offer, Smith argues\n\nthat    the    district   court     incorrectly      concluded       that   Barrow’s\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fattorneys’ fees and court costs, together with her recovery, were\n\nsuch   that   they   defeated   the   larger   offer.   Both   of   Smith’s\n\narguments result in his conclusion that he should not be liable for\n\nBarrow’s post-offer costs or fees and that he should be able to\n\nrecover his costs from Barrow.\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 “permits defendants in an\n\naction to present an offer of judgment to the plaintiffs at any\n\ntime more than 10 days before trial; the plaintiff has 10 days in\n\nwhich to unconditionally accept the offer.” Ramming v. Natural Gas\n\nPipeline Co. of Am., 390 F.3d 366, 370 (5th Cir. 2004).             Rule 68\n\nstates in pertinent part:\n\n       “At any time more than 10 days before the trial begins,\n       a party defending against a claim may serve upon the\n       adverse party an offer to allow judgment to be taken\n       against the defending party for the money or property or\n       to the effect specified in the offer, with costs then\n       accrued. . . . If the judgment finally obtained by the\n       offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree\n       must pay the costs incurred after the making of the\n       offer.” FED. R. CIV. P. 68.\n\nThe “severe consequences which may result post-trial from rejection\n\nof pre-trial offers” supports Rule 68’s purpose of “encouraging\n\nsettlement” and “discouraging protracted litigation.” Ramming, 390\n\nF.3d at 370 n.2.\n\n       We review the district court’s interpretation of Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 68 de novo. Basha v. Mitsubishi Motor Credit of\n\nAm., Inc., 336 F.3d 451, 453 (5th Cir. 2003).             “The district\n\ncourt’s findings regarding the factual circumstances under which\n\n\n\n                                      22\n\fRule 68 offers and acceptances are made, however, are reviewed\n\nunder the clear error standard.”               Id.\n\n     We agree with the district court’s determination that Smith’s\n\ntwo offers of judgment were ineffective.                   His argument that the\n\namount Barrow paid to GISD should be subtracted from her recovery\n\nfrom Smith in analyzing the $30,000.00 offer is incorrect; Barrow\n\ndid not recover anything against GISD, and thus there is nothing to\n\nconsider    in    relation   to    GISD     in       determining    Barrow’s   total\n\nrecovery.    Further, in relation to Smith’s $100,000.00 offer of\n\njudgment, it is true that if one reduced Barrow’s attorneys’ fees\n\nenough at the time that he made the offer, one could say that\n\nBarrow did not recover enough to defeat Smith’s second offer of\n\njudgment.        However, such a result would require a substantial\n\nreduction of these fees.          The district court did not consider the\n\nexcessiveness of hourly rates for each attorney to be evenly spread\n\nbetween the early and later years of this case.                    It was not clear\n\nerror or an abuse of discretion for the district court to determine\n\nsuch a substantial reduction of fees at the time of the $100,000.00\n\noffer would be inappropriate.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n                                    AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\f",

Smith presents three\n\narguments       against    the   judgment,     contending     that:     first,    the\n\ndistrict court erroneously applied a heightened level of scrutiny\n\nin analyzing the constitutionality of the state action at issue in\n\nthis case; second, the district court erred in deciding to award\n\nBarrow attorneys’ fees; and third, the district court erred when it\n\nruled       that   Smith’s   $30,000.00       joint   offer   of   judgment      with\n\ncodefendant Greenville Independent School District (GISD) and his\n\nlater $100,000.00 offer, both made pursuant to Federal Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 68, were ineffective to invoke Rule 68's provision\n\nrequiring certain offerees to pay post-offer costs.\n\n       Barrow cross-appeals, arguing that the district court erred in\n\ndetermining the prevailing market rate for Barrow’s attorneys and\n\nin making downward adjustments to Barrow’s attorneys’ hours.\n\n       For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n\n                           FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW1\n\n       During the summer of 1998, Barrow was employed as a teacher by\n\nGISD, where Smith was then a superintendent.                   Barrow’s children\n\nwere       enrolled   in   the   Greenville     Christian     School,    a   private\n\nreligious school.\n\n       That summer, an assistant principal position at a middle\n\nschool became open at GISD, and Barrow applied for the job.

Barrow responded that she was very much interested in\n\nbecoming an assistant principal, but she would not remove her\n\nchildren from their private religious school.\n\n     After Barrow’s name was included in the applicant pool, Smith\n\ndirected the assistant superintendent for personnel to see if\n\nBarrow would move her children to public school.    She would not,\n\nand GISD hired another person for the assistant principal position.\n\nSmith later told Barrow and her husband that he had not recommended\n\nBarrow for the position because their children attended private\n\nschool.\n\n     Barrow filed this suit in 2000 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nalleging that Smith violated her constitutional rights by refusing\n\nto consider her for the assistant principal position because Barrow\n\nwould not move her children from the private Christian school into\n\na GISD school.\n\n     Smith moved for summary judgment based on his assertion that\n\nhe was entitled to qualified immunity, permitting the court to\n\nassume for the purpose of his motion that he decided not to promote\n\nBarrow at least in part because she chose to educate her children\n\nin a private school.

On July 27, 2004, the\n\ndistrict court judge presiding over the non-binding arbitration\n\nrecommended that Barrow’s fee request be denied in its entirety or,\n\nalternatively, drastically reduced.\n\n      At    trial,   Barrow   asserted     two   claims   against   Smith:    a\n\nreligious rights claim and a parental rights claim.            On March 25,\n\n2005, after a two-week trial, the jury reached its verdict.                  It\n\nrejected Barrow’s religious rights claim, but found in her favor on\n\nher parental rights claim.         The jury awarded Barrow $15,455.00 in\n\ncompensatory damages and $20,000.00 in punitive damages against\n\nSmith.      Barrow lost all claims against GISD.\n\n      Barrow and Smith both filed post-judgment motions, but the\n\ndistrict court denied all of these.              On December 20, 2005, the\n\ndistrict court awarded Barrow $631,293.00 in attorneys’ fees and\n\n$22,775.22 in expenses and taxable court costs.\n\n      Smith filed notice of appeal on January 12, 2006.

See Barrow I, 332 F.3d at 847–48 (discussing\n\nBrantley I and Fyfe).\n\n     In Brantley I, the plaintiff Brantley brought suit under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 against the superintendent of education and board of\n\neducation in Montgomery County, Mississippi, alleging that they\n\nviolated her constitutional rights to direct her child’s education\n\nby firing her from her position as a public school cafeteria worker\n\n“for the sole reason that her son attended a private academy rather\n\nthan the local public school.”    718 F.2d at 1355.   Unlike in the\n\npresent case, there was no suggestion that the plaintiff’s decision\n\nto send her son to private school was based on religion; Brantley\n\nhad transferred her son from a public high school to a private,\n\nsegregated academy in hopes that he “would have a better chance of\n\nplaying varsity sports at the academy.”      Id. at 1355–56.   This\n\ncourt deemed that the decision to transfer Brantley’s son to\n\nprivate school fell under the umbrella of the Constitution’s\n\n\n                                  6\n\fguarantee of familial privacy, id. at 1359, but we recognized that,\n\n“[i]n the realm of public school employment, the court must balance\n\nthe interests of the school employee with the interest of the state\n\nin promoting efficiency in the educational services which it\n\nprovides through its school employees.”        Id.     The panel explained,\n\n“The state may legitimately interfere with the constitutionally\n\nprotected conduct of a public school employee whenever that conduct\n\nmaterially and substantially impedes the operation or effectiveness\n\nof the educational program.”        Id.   Accordingly, the judgment was\n\nreversed and the case remanded to the district court to determine,\n\nfirst,   whether   Brantley’s   son’s     enrollment    in   private   school\n\n“materially and substantially interfered with the operation or\n\neffectiveness of the educational program” at Brantley’s school.\n\nId.   The panel directed the district court to also determine\n\n“whether the protected activity played a substantial part in the\n\nboard’s discharge decision,” and that if it did, whether Brantley\n\n“would have been fired anyway for reasons completely independent of\n\nthe private school enrollment decision.”         Id.\n\n      Brantley’s case appeared before this court again in Brantley\n\nv. Surles (Brantley II), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454297\"><a href=\"/opinion/454297/mrs-tobie-brantley-v-mf-surles/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 479 (5th Cir. 1985) (per\n\ncuriam),   after   the   district   court   determined       on   remand   that\n\nBrantley was fired from her job for nondiscriminatory reasons.               We\n\nreversed and remanded again after concluding that the ostensible\n\nreason for Brantley’s discharge—a disrespectful remark made about\n\n\n                                     7\n\fa board of education member—could not have been the basis for her\n\ndischarge.    Id. at 481–82.   But we agreed with the district court’s\n\ndeterminations that the private school education of Brantley’s son\n\nplayed a substantial part in the board’s decision to fire Brantley,\n\nand that there was “no evidence that the enrollment of Brantley’s\n\nson in the private school materially and substantially interfered\n\nwith the operation or effectiveness of the educational program at\n\nthe public school.”      Id. at 480.      The local superintendent of\n\neducation had testified that interracial dissension might occur\n\nafter Brantley’s son withdrew to enroll in a private, segregated\n\nschool, but the superintendent’s belief was unsupported “by any\n\nobjective evidence.”     Id.\n\n     In Fyfe v. Curlee, the plaintiff Fyfe was a secretary to a\n\npublic elementary school principal when she enrolled her daughter\n\nin a private, all-white academy.          902 F.2d at 402.      Like the\n\nplaintiff in the Brantley cases, Fyfe’s reasons for selecting a\n\nprivate education for her child were unrelated to religion; she and\n\nher husband were concerned about her daughter’s experiences with\n\nanother white child at the public school and thought that her\n\ndaughter would be happier at the private academy.        Id.   Around the\n\ntime of Fyfe’s decision to enroll her daughter in private school,\n\nblack citizens began boycotting local businesses, primarily “to put\n\npressure on the school system to increase the number of black\n\nteachers     and   administrators.”       Id.      The    local   school\n\n\n                                      8\n\fsuperintendent encouraged Fyfe to resign.           Id.   When Fyfe refused,\n\nhe transferred her to a newly created, undesirable job.              Id. at\n\n402–03.    Fyfe filed suit under section 1983, alleging retaliation\n\nagainst her for exercising her constitutional right to enroll her\n\ndaughter in private school.           Id. at 402.     This court concluded\n\nthat, by transferring her to a menial position, the school district\n\nhad violated Fyfe’s First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.            Id. at\n\n405.    The question then became whether the record revealed that\n\nFyfe’s “protected conduct of enrolling her child in a private\n\nschool was detrimental to the effecient operation of the [] school\n\nsystem.”    Id.   We made clear that this analysis—which requires\n\nbalancing the interest of the school employee with that of the\n\nstate in promoting efficiency in educational services—“is to be\n\nconducted by the court as a matter of law, not fact,” id., and that\n\nthe defendant state shoulders the burden to show that the child’s\n\nenrollment in private school harms the public school system.              See\n\nid. at 406 (because defendant had failed to demonstrate that its\n\ninterference with the plaintiff’s parental rights was necessary for\n\nthe efficient operation of the school system, plaintiff prevailed\n\nas a matter of law).       We concluded that the state had “failed to\n\ndemonstrate that its action in reassigning Mrs. Fyfe was necessary\n\nto the smooth and efficient operation of the school system.”              Id.\n\nat 406.    We explained:\n\n       “[T]he   school     district     produced    no    evidence   of\n\n\n                                       9\n\f     substantial interference with its effectiveness as a\n     result of Mrs. Fyfe’s enrollment of her daughter in\n     private school . . . . The record is completely silent\n     on any effect Shannon Fyfe’s move to the private school\n     had on the appellee school district. This court held in\n     the second appeal in Brantley that belief alone of such\n     interference ‘unsupported by any objective evidence’ is\n     not sufficient to demonstrate material interference to\n     carry the balancing test for the school district.\n     Brantley v. Surles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"454297\"><a href=\"/opinion/454297/mrs-tobie-brantley-v-mf-surles/\"><span class=\"volume\">765</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 480 (5th Cir. 1985).”\n     Id. at 405.\n\nOur analysis was unchanged by the fact that a boycott of local\n\nbusinesses had been threatened in case a public school employee\n\nenrolled his or her child in a private, segregated school.   There\n\nwas no evidence that this possibility of a boycott was related to\n\nFyfe, or that it impeded the school system’s operation:\n\n     “No causal link was ever made in the district court\n     between the threatened school boycott and Mrs. Fyfe’s\n     action. When asked on cross-examination whether she was\n     aware that one of the demands of the boycotting group was\n     ‘that the school system not employ anybody who does now\n     or ever has had a child in a private segregated academy,’\n     the plaintiff responded that she had read about that in\n     the paper. The mere fact that this demand was made on\n     the school system however cannot be sufficient to\n     demonstrate that Mrs. Fyfe’s enrollment of her daughter\n     at a private school caused substantial and material\n     interference with the school system’s operation and\n     effectiveness.” Id. at 405.\n\n     When the instant case first appeared before a panel of this\n\ncourt in Barrow I, we relied on the Brantley and Fyfe cases for\n\ncertain principles.   For example, we stated in Barrow I that those\n\ncases clarified that “public-school employees like Barrow have a\n\nprotected right to educate their children in private school,” 332\n\nF.3d at 848, and that this public school employee right was clearly\n\n\n                                 10\n\festablished when Smith refused to consider Barrow for the assistant\n\nprincipal position.       Id.    Most important to the instant appeal, in\n\nBarrow I, we relied on the Brantley and Fyfe cases in declaring\n\nthat a “state cannot take an adverse employment action against a\n\npublic-school employee for exercising this right [to educate his or\n\nher   child   in   private      school]    unless     it    can   prove    that   the\n\nemployee’s selection of private school materially and substantially\n\naffects the state’s educational mission.”                  Id.\n\n      Because we had unequivocally declared in Barrow I the state’s\n\nburden to show Barrow’s enrollment of her children in private\n\nschool caused detriment to its educational mission, we found it\n\nunnecessary to address in the opinion from that appeal the question\n\nof the degree of scrutiny to be applied to a state’s adverse action\n\nagainst a public school employee for sending his or her child to a\n\nprivate school.     Id. at 849 n.20.           We found it to be an unnecessary\n\nanalysis because, regardless of the level of scrutiny applied, it\n\nwas   still   incumbent    on    the   defendant      to     show   that   Barrow’s\n\nselection of school for her children had an injurious effect on the\n\noperations of the public school system that employed her.                    If the\n\ndefendant failed to meet that burden, its defense would be a\n\nnonstarter.    We explained:\n\n      “[W]e express no opinion on the particular degree of\n      scrutiny a state action must undergo to withstand a\n      challenge to its constitutionality in a case like this\n      one. Instead, we simply recognize that the state cannot\n      strip its school employees of the right to choose a\n      private-school education for their children without\n\n                                          11\n\f     proving that the unfettered exercise of this right will\n     undermine a state interest.     Barrow and amici curiae\n     argue that any state action that interferes with this\n     right is subject to strict scrutiny. We need not take up\n     this question today. In the absence of objective proof\n     that Barrow’s choice of a private-school education for\n     her children will undermine a state interest the\n     district’s patronage policy fails irrespective of the\n     degree of scrutiny applied.” Id. (emphasis added).2\n\nHaving found that Barrow asserted a constitutionally protected\n\nright, and that Smith interfered with that right, Barrow would\n\nprevail if the defendants did not show that the interference was\n\nrequired for the smooth and efficient operations of the school\n\nsystem.    This was the effect of our reliance in Barrow I on\n\nBrantley and Fyfe.\n\n     Smith argues that requiring defendants in a case with facts\n\nsuch as these to show that the public school employee’s choice of\n\na private school education for their children impeded with the\n\npublic school system’s operations constitutes strict scrutiny of\n\nthe defendant school board’s actions. Smith asserts that Barrow is\n\nnot entitled     to   this   degree   of   scrutiny   without   a   religious\n\ncomponent to her claim, and Smith contends that any possibility of\n\nsuch a religious component was eradicated when the jury found that\n\nBarrow’s religious rights were not violated.\n\n\n     2\n       We likewise made clear in Barrow I that we did not need to decide\nwhether the right asserted by the plaintiff fell under the First Amendment or\nthe Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because, regardless, the\ndefendant had the burden of showing that the enrollment of Barrow’s children\nin private school impeded school operations. See 332 F.3d at 846–47\n(considering together three claims asserted by Barrow because “at bottom all\naver that Barrow, a public-school employee, has a constitutionally-protected\nright to select a private-school education for her children”).\n\n                                      12\n\f     One might argue that because the jury found that religious\n\nrights were not violated, there is no religious component in this\n\ncase.

See id. at 382–83.

Marshall, a case decided before the Brantley cases\n\nand Fyfe v. Curlee, plaintiffs challenged a regulation requiring\n\nthat any high school student who attended certain summer sports\n\ntraining camps be suspended temporarily from varsity athletic\n\neligibility.    661 F.2d at 1028.        Various reasons supported the\n\nrule: “the need to control over-zealous coaches, parents and\n\ncommunities, the achieving of a competitive balance between those\n\nwho can afford to attend summer camp and those who cannot, the\n\navoidance of various excessive pressures on students, and the\n\nabrogation of the use of camps as recruiting mechanisms.”             Id. at\n\n1030.   The district court declared the rule unconstitutional, but\n\nthis court reversed, finding that it did not violate either the due\n\nprocess   clause   or   equal   protection   clause   of   the    Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.     Id. at 1028. We determined that the rule did not\n\nimplicate any fundamental constitutional right, and that therefore\n\nthe appropriate level of scrutiny was rational basis.            Id. at 1029,\n\n1030.\n\n\n                                    14\n\f       In    Littlefield   v.   Forney     Independent     School     District,\n\nindividual students and parents of students challenged a district-\n\nwide mandatory uniform policy. 268 F.3d at 279. Specifically, the\n\nparents contended that the compulsory uniform policy violated their\n\nconstitutional right to control their children’s education in\n\nviolation of the Fourteenth Amendment.            Id. at 282.       The parents\n\nargued that their right to control their children’s education was\n\na fundamental right and that therefore the court should apply\n\nstrict scrutiny in analyzing the school uniform policy.                 Id. at\n\n288.       We disagreed, declining to find a “fundamental right for\n\nparents to control the clothing their children wear to public\n\nschools.”3       Id. at 289.    We analyzed the asserted parental right\n\nunder a rational-basis standard.           Id.\n\n       While both Kite and Littlefield employ a rational basis\n\nstandard to analyze state interference with parental rights, those\n\ncases      are   distinguishable   from    the   instant   case.      Kite   and\n\nLittlefield address policies relating to what goes on at the public\n\nschool: ineligibility to participate in school varsity athletics if\n\ncertain types of summer sport camps are attended, and a district-\n\nwide compulsory school uniform policy.               The defendant Smith’s\n\n\n\n       3\n        We explained:\n       “While Parents may have a fundamental right in the upbringing and\n       education of their children, this right does not cover the\n       Parents’ objection to a public school Uniform Policy. It has long\n       been recognized that parental rights are not absolute in the\n       public school context and can be subject to reasonable\n       regulation.” 268 F.3d at 291.\n\n                                      15\n\fstance toward Barrow’s decision to educate her children in private\n\nschool does not in any way relate to what occurs at a GISD-operated\n\npublic school.   Stated differently, a rule requiring public school\n\nemployees to enroll their children in public schools is simply more\n\ninvasive of parental rights and less clearly tied to the public\n\nschool’s management of its students and educational program than\n\nthe Kite and Littlefield rules addressing school varsity athletics\n\neligibility   and    school      uniforms.             Kite   and     Littlefield    are\n\ndistinguishable, and they are not controlling in this case.\n\n     Nevertheless, we acknowledge that it is possible to argue that\n\nwithout a situation akin to that in Wisconsin v. Yoder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108530\"><a href=\"/opinion/108530/wisconsin-v-yoder/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1526</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, only rational basis—and not strict scrutiny—should be applied\n\nin evaluating a state action that imposes requirements on parental\n\ndecisions regarding education.                   In Yoder, respondents had been\n\ncharged, tried, and convicted of violating the State of Wisconsin’s\n\ncompulsory school-attendance law that required parents to send\n\ntheir children      to    attend      public      or   private      school   until   the\n\nchildren reached         16   years    of   age.        92    S.Ct.   at   1529.     The\n\nrespondents, two members of the Old Order Amish religion and one\n\nmember of the Conservative Amish Mennonite Church, had declined to\n\nsend their 14 and 15 year-old children to public school after they\n\ncompleted the eighth grade, and the children were not enrolled in\n\nany private school, nor did they meet any applicable exception to\n\nthe Wisconsin statute.             Id.      The United States Supreme Court\n\n\n\n                                            16\n\fstated:\n\n     “[I]n order for Wisconsin to compel school attendance\n     beyond the eighth grade against a claim that such\n     attendance interferes with the practice of a legitimate\n     religious belief, it must appear either that the State\n     does not deny the free exercise of religious belief by\n     its requirement, or that there is a state interest of\n     sufficient magnitude to override the interest claiming\n     protection under the Free Exercise Clause.” Id. at 1532.\n\nThe Court found that, in the respondents’ case, enforcement of the\n\ncompulsory school-attendance law after the eighth grade “would\n\ngravely endanger if not destroy the free exercise of respondents’\n\nreligious beliefs,” and the focus of its analysis thus turned to\n\nwhether   the    state   interest   was   sufficient   to   override   the\n\nrespondents’ religious-based interest in declining to send their\n\nchildren to public school after the eighth grade.           Id. at 1535.\n\nThe Court made clear its analysis was more rigorous than the\n\nrational-basis test:        “[W]hen the interests of parenthood are\n\ncombined with a free exercise claim of the nature revealed by this\n\nrecord, more than merely a ‘reasonable relation to some purpose\n\nwithin the competency of the State’ is required to sustain the\n\nvalidity of the State’s requirement under the First Amendment.”\n\nId. at 1542.     The Court concluded that the State of Wisconsin was\n\nprecluded from forcing the respondents to send their children to\n\nformal school until the age of 16 by the First and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments.     Id.   Thus, Yoder arguably supports Smith’s contention\n\nthat heightened scrutiny is appropriate only where the state action\n\nalso adversely affects free exercise of religion, which the jury\n\n\n                                    17\n\fverdict in this case makes clear is no longer at issue.\n\n      Even if we agree with Smith, however, that Yoder represents\n\nthe only possible basis for a heightened level of scrutiny in cases\n\ndealing with state interference of parental rights, it remains the\n\nschool district’s burden to show that Barrow’s decision to send her\n\nchildren to private school had a materially adverse effect on the\n\npublic school district.    This is so because Barrow I renders that\n\nthe law of the case.\n\n      Under the law of the case doctrine, “[o]nce a panel of this\n\ncourt has decided an issue of law or fact, the decision continues\n\nto govern all subsequent stages of the same case.”   Free v.

In its memorandum opinion\n\nand order dated December 20, 2005, the district court discussed for\n\nover fifty pages its reasons for the attorneys’ fees award.                    Given\n\nthe     district       court’s     impressively       careful        and    thorough\n\nconsideration of this issue, we cannot conclude that the court\n\nabused its discretion.           Cf. Associated Builders & Contractors of\n\nLouisiana, Inc., 919 F.2d at 379 (declaring the abuse of discretion\n\nstandard possible only where the district court has provided a\n\nconcise and clear explanation for its award of fees).\n\n                          III.     Offers of Judgment\n\n       Lastly, Smith also contends that the district court erred when\n\nit ruled that his Rule 68 offers of judgment were ineffective.                      At\n\nissue are two offers of judgment: one made jointly by codefendants\n\nSmith    and    GISD    for   $30,000.00,      and   one   by    Smith      only   for\n\n$100,000.00.        Smith argues that in regards to the $30,000.00 joint\n\noffer, the district court should have compared the offer to the\n\nrecovery Barrow obtained against both Smith and GISD, which Smith\n\nargues would make the offer amount greater than Barrow’s recovery\n\nbecause       the    amount      Barrow   was    ordered        to    pay    GISD—or\n\n$14,492.65—should be subtracted from her recovery of $35,455.00\n\nfrom Smith.         In relation to his $100,000.00 offer, Smith argues\n\nthat    the    district   court     incorrectly      concluded       that   Barrow’s\n\n\n\n                                          21\n\fattorneys’ fees and court costs, together with her recovery, were\n\nsuch   that   they   defeated   the   larger   offer.   Both   of   Smith’s\n\narguments result in his conclusion that he should not be liable for\n\nBarrow’s post-offer costs or fees and that he should be able to\n\nrecover his costs from Barrow.\n\n       Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 68 “permits defendants in an\n\naction to present an offer of judgment to the plaintiffs at any\n\ntime more than 10 days before trial; the plaintiff has 10 days in\n\nwhich to unconditionally accept the offer.” Ramming v.

If the judgment finally obtained by the\n       offeree is not more favorable than the offer, the offeree\n       must pay the costs incurred after the making of the\n       offer.” FED. R. CIV. P. 68.\n\nThe “severe consequences which may result post-trial from rejection\n\nof pre-trial offers” supports Rule 68’s purpose of “encouraging\n\nsettlement” and “discouraging protracted litigation.” Ramming, 390\n\nF.3d at 370 n.2.\n\n       We review the district court’s interpretation of Federal Rule\n\nof Civil Procedure 68 de novo.

Mitsubishi Motor Credit of\n\nAm., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"31945\"><a href=\"/opinion/31945/basha-v-mitsubishi-mtr-crdt/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 453 (5th Cir. 2003).             “The district\n\ncourt’s findings regarding the factual circumstances under which\n\n\n\n                                      22\n\fRule 68 offers and acceptances are made, however, are reviewed\n\nunder the clear error standard.”               Id.\n\n     We agree with the district court’s determination that Smith’s\n\ntwo offers of judgment were ineffective.                   His argument that the\n\namount Barrow paid to GISD should be subtracted from her recovery\n\nfrom Smith in analyzing the $30,000.00 offer is incorrect; Barrow\n\ndid not recover anything against GISD, and thus there is nothing to\n\nconsider    in    relation   to    GISD     in       determining    Barrow’s   total\n\nrecovery.    Further, in relation to Smith’s $100,000.00 offer of\n\njudgment, it is true that if one reduced Barrow’s attorneys’ fees\n\nenough at the time that he made the offer, one could say that\n\nBarrow did not recover enough to defeat Smith’s second offer of\n\njudgment.        However, such a result would require a substantial\n\nreduction of these fees.          The district court did not consider the\n\nexcessiveness of hourly rates for each attorney to be evenly spread\n\nbetween the early and later years of this case.                    It was not clear\n\nerror or an abuse of discretion for the district court to determine\n\nsuch a substantial reduction of fees at the time of the $100,000.00\n\noffer would be inappropriate.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n                                    AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\f</pre>",
