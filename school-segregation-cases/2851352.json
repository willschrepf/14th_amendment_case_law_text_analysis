          "plain_text": "In the\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFor the Seventh Circuit\n\nNo. 98-3614\n\nMelinda Erickson,\n\nPlaintiff-Appellee,\n\n\nUnited States of America,\n\nIntervenor,\n\nv.\n\nBoard of Governors of State Colleges and\nUniversities for Northeastern Illinois University,\n\nDefendant-Appellant.\n\n\n\nAppeal from the United States District Court\nfor the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division.\nNo. 95 C 2541--John A. Nordberg, Judge.\n\n\nArgued April 27, 1999--Decided March 27, 2000\n\n\n\n  Before Eschbach, Easterbrook, and Diane P. Wood, Circuit\nJudges.\n\n  Easterbrook, Circuit Judge. We must decide\nwhether Title I of the Americans with\nDisabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. sec.sec. 12111-17, is\nan exercise of power under sec.5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment, which confers authority \"to\nenforce, by appropriate legislation, the\nprovisions of this article.\" Defendant in this\nsuit is an arm of Illinois and therefore one of\nthe United States for purposes of the Eleventh\nAmendment. Congress has power under the Commerce\nClause to adopt the ADA’s rules, but given the\nEleventh Amendment a statute that rests only on\nthe Commerce Clause can not authorize private\nsuits against states in federal court. Seminole\nTribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996). But if\nsec.5 bestows power to adopt the ADA, then private\nlitigation is compatible with the Eleventh\nAmendment. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. 445\n(1976).\n\n  Melinda Erickson worked for five years in the\nCollege of Business and Management at\nNortheastern Illinois University, rising from\n\fsecretary to \"program associate.\" She contends\nthat the University failed to accommodate her\nefforts to have children. Medical care for her\ninfertility was physically demanding and had side\neffects. Both the treatment and the circumstances\nthat gave rise to it were emotionally draining.\nErickson often did not come to work and was late\non days when she did appear. She was fired after\nshe became distraught and stayed home for six\nworking days. Erickson does not contend that the\nattendance requirements were designed to\ndiscriminate against persons with disabilities.\nInstead she argues that the University should\nhave tolerated absences and tardiness that it\nwould not have condoned from a healthy employee.\nInvoking the Eleventh Amendment, the University\nfiled a motion to dismiss, which the district\ncourt denied. 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis 15779 (N.D.\nIll. Oct. 1, 1998). The University’s\ninterlocutory appeal is within our jurisdiction,\nsee Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S. at 52, even though\nthe University does not assert sovereign immunity\nwith respect to Erickson’s claim under the\nPregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C.\nsec.2000e(k). Scott v. Lacy, 811 F.2d 1153 (7th\nCir. 1987). Cf. Wisconsin Department of\nCorrections v. Schacht, 524 U.S. 381 (1998). The\nUnited States intervened as a party in this court\nto defend the ADA’s constitutionality. See 28\nU.S.C. sec.2403(a).\n\n  Three times during the last four Terms, the\nSupreme Court has addressed the extent of\nlegislative power under sec.5. Kimel v. Florida\nBoard of Regents, 120 S. Ct. 631 (2000); Florida\nPrepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board v.\nCollege Savings Bank, 527 U.S. 627 (1999); Boerne\nv. Flores, 521 U.S. 507 (1997). Thrice it has\nstressed that the language of sec.5, which gives\nCongress the power to \"enforce\" the Fourteenth\nAmendment, must be taken seriously. Statutes that\ncreate new rights, or expand old rights beyond\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s bounds, do not\n\"enforce\" that amendment.\n\n  Boerne dealt with the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. sec.sec.\n2000bb to 2000bb-4, a response to Employment\nDivision v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990). Smith had\nheld that the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment never requires accommodation of\nreligiously inspired practices, so that laws\nneutral with respect to religion are valid. The\nRFRA, by contrast, obliged states to accommodate\npractices associated with religion. The Court\nheld that an accommodation requirement could not\nbe thought to \"enforce\" a constitutional norm\nthat does not require accommodation. Florida\nPrepaid held that Congress may not use sec.5 to\nabrogate state sovereign immunity on the ground\n\fthat statutory rights are \"property\" under the\nFourteenth Amendment. Kimel held that sec.5 does\nnot support the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct, 29 U.S.C. sec.sec. 621-34, because although\nthe ADEA forbids consideration of an employee’s\nage unless age is a \"bona fide occupational\nqualification reasonably necessary to the normal\noperation of the particular business\",\nsec.623(f)(1), the Constitution’s own requirement\nis considerably more lenient. The Equal\nProtection Clause permits a state to consider a\nperson’s age unless age lacks a rational\nrelationship to the state’s objective. Most\nconsideration of age in employment therefore is\nconstitutional; but under the ADEA most\nconsideration of age is forbidden; Kimel\ntherefore held that the ADEA sets up an\nindependent rule and does not \"enforce\" the\nConstitution’s rule.\n\n  Twenty-three days before the Supreme Court\ndecided Boerne, we held in Crawford v. Indiana\nDepartment of Corrections, 115 F.3d 481, 487 (7th\nCir. 1997), that sec.5 supports Title II of the\nADA, which deals with public services. Our opinion\nanalogized the ADA to the ADEA and observed that\nthe latter statute had been applied to states in\nprivate litigation. Kimel shows that if our\nanalogy to the ADEA is precise, then Crawford is\nno longer authoritative; Florida Prepaid and\nBoerne likewise call for a fresh look at the\nsubject. Elsewhere a great deal of ink has been\nspilled on this question. After Boerne but before\nKimel, panels of five appellate courts held that\nsec.5 supplies the necessary legislative power,\nthough there was one squarely contrary holding by\na court en banc. Compare Muller v. Costello, 187\nF.3d 298 (2d Cir. 1999); Coolbaugh v. Louisiana,\n136 F.3d 430 (5th Cir. 1998); Clark v.\nCalifornia, 123 F.3d 1267 (9th Cir. 1997); Martin\nv. Kansas, 190 F.3d 1120 (10th Cir. 1999); and\nKimel v. Florida Board of Regents, 139 F.3d 1426,\n1433, 1441-44 (11th Cir. 1998), with Alsbrook v.\nMaumelle, 184 F.3d 999 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc).\nThe fourth circuit is internally divided.\nAlthough Amos v. Maryland Department of Public\nSafety, 178 F.3d 212 (4th Cir. 1999) (rehearing\nen banc granted Dec. 28, 1999), holds that\nprivate ADA litigation may proceed against state\nprisons, Brown v. North Carolina Division of\nMotor Vehicles, 166 F.3d 698 (4th Cir. 1999),\nheld that a regulation, based on the ADA,\nrequiring the state’s Division of Motor Vehicles\nto accommodate disabled drivers, is\nunconstitutional. Recently a divided panel of the\nninth circuit disagreed with Brown. See Dare v.\nCalifornia Department of Motor Vehicles, 191 F.3d\n1167 (9th Cir. 1999). The Supreme Court’s opinion\nin Kimel calls all of these decisions into\nquestion, and we think it best to analyze the\n\fsubject afresh rather than to rehash pre-Kimel\nconclusions in and out of this circuit. Believing\nthat the Supreme Court would tackle the issue\nbefore July, the second circuit declined to\nreconsider Muller in light of Kimel. See\nKilcullen v. New York State Department of Labor,\n2000 U.S. App. Lexis 2714 (2d Cir. Feb. 24, 2000).\nBut settlements have dashed that hope; we\ntherefore undertake independent consideration.\n\n  Whether Congress has authorized federal\nlitigation against states is our initial\nquestion. Kimel answered yes for the ADEA, see 120\nS. Ct. at 640-42, and the same answer is\nappropriate for the ADA. By incorporating 42\nU.S.C. sec.2000e, the ADA defines persons, and\nthus employers, to include units of government.\n42 U.S.C. sec.12111(5)(A), (7). Fitzpatrick held\nthat sec.2000e is a sufficiently clear statement.\nSection 12202 adds that \"[a] State shall not be\nimmune under the eleventh amendment to the\nConstitution of the United States from an action\nin Federal or State court of competent\njurisdiction for a violation of this chapter.\"\nFinally, just in case there were doubt,\nsec.12101(b)(4) invokes all possible sources of\nauthority to enact the ADA, \"including the power\nto enforce the fourteenth amendment\".\n  On the question whether a statute such as the\nADA enforces the Fourteenth Amendment, Kimel\nestablishes two principal propositions. First,\nbecause the rational-basis test applies to age\ndiscrimination, almost all of the ADEA’s\nrequirements stand apart from the Constitution’s\nrule. Most age discrimination is rational, and\ntherefore constitutional, yet the Act forbids it.\nThe ADEA therefore does not \"enforce\" the\nFourteenth Amendment. 120 S. Ct. at 645-48.\nSecond, there is no need for prophylactic rules\nto catch evasions of the rational-basis test by\nstate governments. Congress did not find that\nsuch a problem exists, and there is no evidence\nof one. The ADEA therefore cannot be understood as\nenforcement legislation. 120 S. Ct. at 648-50.\nBoth of these propositions are true of the ADA as\nwell--indeed, the ADA is harder to conceive as\n\"enforcement\" of the Fourteenth Amendment than is\nthe ADEA. Under the ADEA employers must ignore age\nbut are free to act on the basis of attributes\nsuch as strength, mental acuity, and salary that\nare related to age. Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins,\n507 U.S. 604 (1993). In other words, the ADEA\nforbids disparate treatment but not disparate\nimpact. EEOC v. Francis W. Parker School, 41 F.3d\n1073, 1077 (7th Cir. 1994); Anderson v. Baxter\nHealthcare Corp., 13 F.3d 1120 (7th Cir. 1994).\nLikewise with the Constitution and most other\nemployment-discrimination laws. E.g., Troupe v.\nMay Department Stores Co., 20 F.3d 734 (7th Cir.\n1994) (the Pregnancy Discrimination Act does not\n\frequire accommodation). Title I of the ADA, by\ncontrast, requires employers to consider and to\naccommodate disabilities, and in the process\nextends beyond the anti-discrimination principle.\n42 U.S.C. sec.12112(b)(5)(A), (6) (defining\nfailure to accommodate, and criteria with\ndisparate impacts, as \"discrimination\"). (Some\nother titles of the ADA are less expansive. See\nDoe v. Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co., 179 F.3d\n557 (7th Cir. 1999). Our concern in this case is\nTitle I, and unelaborated references to \"the ADA\"\nare to Title I.)\n\n  A rational-basis test applies to distinctions on\nthe ground of disability, just as to distinctions\non the ground of age. Cleburne v. Cleburne Living\nCenter, Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 439-42 (1985); Heller\nv. Doe, 509 U.S. 312, 319-21 (1993); United\nStates v. Harris, 197 F.3d 870, 873-76 (7th Cir.\n1999). Consideration of an employee’s\ndisabilities is proper, so far as the\nConstitution is concerned. See Cleburne, 473 U.S.\nat 444 (\"governmental consideration of those\ndifferences in the vast majority of situations is\nnot only legitimate but also desirable\").\nConsider this from the perspective of a\nuniversity such as our defendant. A would-be\nprofessor who is not in the top 1% of the\npopulation in mental acuity is not apt to be a\ngood teacher and scholar. Likewise it is rational\nfor a university to favor someone with good\nvision over someone who requires the assistance\nof a reader. The sighted person can master more\nof the academic literature (reading is much\nfaster than listening), improving his chance to\nbe a productive scholar, and also is less\nexpensive (because the university need not pay\nfor the reader). An academic institution that\nprefers to use a given budget to hire a sighted\nscholar plus a graduate teaching assistant,\nrather than a blind scholar plus a reader, has\ncomplied with its constitutional obligation to\navoid irrational action. But it has not complied\nwith the ADA, which requires accommodation at any\ncost less than \"undue hardship\". 42 U.S.C.\nsec.12112(b) (5)(A), sec.12111(10). How the\n\"undue hardship\" defense under the ADA compares\nwith the \"bona fide occupational qualification\"\ndefense under the ADEA is an interesting question,\nbut not one we need pursue: both statutes\npresumptively forbid consideration of attributes\nthat the Constitution permits states to consider,\nand then (like the RFRA) require the state to\ncarry a burden of persuasion in order to take the\ncharacteristic into account. As in Kimel, the\nfact that the law has made adverse action based\non a characteristic \"prima facie unlawful\" shows\nthe extent of its departure from the\nConstitution’s own rule. 120 S. Ct. at 647. Like\nthe ADEA, the ADA \"prohibits very little conduct\n\flikely to be held unconstitutional,\" id. at 648.\n\n  The ADA’s main target is an employer’s rational\nconsideration of disabilities. Rational\ndiscrimination by definition does not violate a\nconstitutional provision that condemns only\nirrational distinctions based on disabilities.\nCongress has ample power under the Commerce\nClause to forbid rational discrimination, which\nmay bear especially heavily on a class of persons\nwho suffer from diminished human (and often\nfinancial) capital. But to say that in devising\nthese new rules Congress is just \"enforcing\" a\nsubstantive command present in sec.1 of the\nFourteenth Amendment since 1868 would be a legal\nfiction. Boerne, Florida Prepaid, and Kimel hold\nthat fictions do not support legislation under\nsec.5.\n\n  One way to distinguish the ADA from the ADEA would\nbe to emphasize a remark in Kimel that \"[o]ld age\n. . . does not define a discrete and insular\nminority because all persons, if they live out\ntheir normal life spans, will experience it.\" 120\nS. Ct. at 645. The argument would continue that\nmany disabilities are immutable; few people born\nblind acquire vision later. We do not read the\nCourt’s observation in Kimel as distinguishing\namong characteristics that are subject to\nrational-basis review; instead the Court offered\nthe observation as one reason why earlier cases\nhad applied the rational-basis test to age.\nBecause Cleburne held that the rational-basis\ntest likewise governs disabilities, the reasoning\nbehind that opinion need not come back into\nconsideration. We know from Cleburne that\nrational distinctions based on disabilities\ncomport with the Constitution. What is more, many\ndisabilities come and go, or progress with time.\nBeethoven did not become deaf, or Milton blind,\nuntil middle age. Erickson’s medical problem\naffected her for a number of years but not for a\nlifetime (if only because medical treatment may\nhave succeeded, or because after menopause it\nwould have lost significance). One can imagine an\nargument under sec.5 for a federal law dealing\nwith discrimination against persons with life-\nlong disabilities, but the ADA is not such a law--\nnot only because it extends beyond permanently\ndisabled persons, but also because\n\"discrimination\" as the ADA defines it, see\nsec.12112(b), has little in common with\n\"discrimination\" in constitutional law.\n\n  To see this, consider the role of intent. When\na state law or practice does not expressly\nconcern a particular characteristic (such as\nrace, sex, age, or disability), but has a\ndisparate impact on persons with that\ncharacteristic, the plaintiff in constitutional\n\flitigation must establish that the state intends\nto discriminate on the basis of that\ncharacteristic. See, e.g., Personnel\nAdministrator v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256 (1979)\n(sex); Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976)\n(race). Things are otherwise under the ADA, which\nnot only demands accommodation (which forces the\nemployer to consider, rather than ignore,\ndisabilities) but also prohibits any rule or\npractice that has a disparate impact, unless the\nrule is \"job-related for the position in question\nand is consistent with business necessity\". 42\nU.S.C. sec.12112(b)(6). See Washington v. Indiana\nHigh School Athletic Ass’n, 181 F.3d 840 (7th\nCir. 1999) (under the ADA the plaintiff need not\nshow that the governmental body intended to\ndiscriminate on account of disability). Cases\nsuch as Feeney and Davis hold that the Equal\nProtection Clause does not forbid laws and\npractices that have a disparate impact; but the\nADA does forbid them.\n\n  By requiring that employers accommodate rather\nthan disregard disabilities, the ADA is a cousin\nto the RFRA. Smith held that demands for\naccommodation and claims of disparate impact have\nno constitutional footing under the Free Exercise\nClause; it takes express or intentional\ndiscrimination to violate that provision. See\nalso Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.\nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993). Congress then\nenacted the RFRA, which requires every unit of\ngovernment to justify any law or practice that\nburdens a person’s exercise of religion, \"even if\nthe burden results from a rule of general\napplicability\". 42 U.S.C. sec.2000bb-1(a). This\nrequires a state to accommodate religiously\nmotivated behavior unless it can show a\n\"compelling\" reason for neutrality between\nreligious and secular conduct. Boerne responded\nthat Congress may not redefine the constitutional\nrule under the rubric of \"enforcement.\"\n\n  What the RFRA did for religion, the ADA does for\ndisabilities. In neither situation does the\nConstitution forbid neutral laws or practices\nthat create disparate impacts; in neither\nsituation does the Constitution require\naccommodation. Both the RFRA and the ADA replace\nthe Constitution’s approach with a prohibition of\ndisparate impact and jettison neutrality in favor\nof accommodation. The RFRA’s demand for a\n\"compelling governmental interest\", 42 U.S.C.\nsec.2000bb-1(b)(1), made it harder for a\ngovernment to prevail than do the ADA’s\nrequirements (job-relatedness, business\nnecessity, and undue hardship), but there is a\ncountervailing difference that makes the ADA the\nmore adventuresome. The Free Exercise Clause\nforbids all intentional discrimination against\n\freligious practices; the Equal Protection Clause\nhas no similar rule about disabilities. Rational\ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities\nis constitutionally permissible in a way that\nrational discrimination against religious\npractices is not. This makes the ADA harder than\nthe RFRA to justify under sec.5, for \"[i]t is\nprecisely in a close case that the independent\njudgment of Congress on a constitutional question\nshould make a difference.\" Michael W. McConnell,\nInstitutions and Interpretation: A Critique of\nCity of Boerne v. Flores, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 153,\n155 (1997). See also Stephen L. Carter, The\nMorgan \"Power\" and the Forced Reconsideration of\nConstitutional Decisions, 53 U. Chi. L. Rev. 819\n(1986). Some of the Justices and several careful\nscholars believe that the rule of decision in the\nRFRA is the Constitution’s own. See Boerne, 521\nU.S. at 544 (O’Connor, J., dissenting), 565\n(Souter, J., dissenting). Others who support the\nmajority position in Smith acknowledge that the\nquestion is difficult. See generally Symposium,\nReflections on City of Boerne v. Flores, 39\nWilliam & Mary L. Rev. 597 (1998). But no one\nbelieves that the Equal Protection Clause\nestablishes the disparate-impact and mandatory-\naccommodation rules found in the ADA. The statute\nis outside the boundaries of constitutional\ndiscourse in a way that the RFRA was not. If the\nRFRA and the ADEA exceed the sec.5 power, then so\ndoes the ADA--at least to the extent it extends\nbeyond remedies for irrational discrimination.\n\n  Well, then, can the ADA be sustained as\nreasonable prophylactic legislation? Because the\nADA requires accommodation, forbids practices with\ndisparate impact, and disregards the employer’s\nintent, it is harder than the ADEA to characterize\nas a remedial measure. The ADEA was a real anti-\ndiscrimination law; unless age was held against\nthe employee, there was no violation. The ADA goes\nbeyond the anti-discrimination principle, a step\nthat requires reason to think that only by going\nto these lengths is it possible to implement the\ncore constitutional rule. Yet just as for the\nADEA, Congress did not find that states have\nadopted clever devices that conceal irrational\ndiscrimination. The legislative findings in 42\nU.S.C. sec.12101 contain not a word about state\ngovernments. Congress did find that persons with\ndisabilities have been discriminated against; it\nfound the same in the ADEA for age. What it did\nnot find is that the practices labeled\n\"discrimination\" are irrational (as that term\nworks under the Equal Protection Clause) or that\nstates are major offenders--a critical inquiry\nnot only under Kimel but also under Florida\nPrepaid. Instead, Congress used the word\n\"discrimination\" in sec.12101, and Committees of\nCongress used that word in the legislative\n\fhistory, to refer to any disadvantage that\naccompanies a disability. For example, the\nstatement in H.R. Rep. No. 101-485(II), 101st\nCong. 2d Sess. 37 (1990), that \"inconsistent\ntreatment of people with disabilities by\ndifferent State or local government agencies is\nboth inequitable and illogical for a society\ncommitted to full access for people with\ndisabilities\" means only that different public\nbodies treated persons differently, because the\nRehabilitation Act applied to some persons but\nnot others; it does not mean that either\ntreatment was unconstitutional. \"Inconsistent\" is\nnot a synonym for irrational--especially not when\nit was a federal statute that induced the\ninconsistency on which the Committee remarked.\n  Just as in Kimel, legislative statements about\ndiscrimination consist \"almost entirely of\nisolated sentences clipped from floor debates and\nlegislative reports.\" 120 S. Ct. at 649. These\nsnippets use the word \"discrimination\" in a way\nthat fails to distinguish between rational\ndistinctions (which the Constitution allows) and\nirrational ones (which it forbids). The sort of\nfindings that would permit adoption of the ADA as\na precautionary measure, after the fashion of the\nVoting Rights Act, see South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, 383 U.S. 301 (1966), must establish\nthat states have been able to disguise forbidden\ndiscrimination as the permissible kind. Nothing\nin the legislative findings, or the debates\npreceding the ADA’s adoption, shows (or even\nasserts) that state governments engaged in\ndeception that prevented victims of irrational\ndiscrimination from obtaining a remedy. Findings\nunderlying Title VII were more substantial, and\nbecause employers frequently disguised their\nresort to racial criteria it is easier to justify\nthe disparate-impact features of Title VII as\nremedial measures. In re Employment\nDiscrimination Litigation, 198 F.3d 1305 (11th\nCir. 1999), concludes accordingly that sec.5\nsupports the disparate-impact rules under Title\nVII, as well as the disparate-treatment rules\naddressed in Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer. We leave that\nquestion for another day and hold only that the\nbackground of the ADA does not meet the standards\nthat Boerne and Kimel set for using sec.5 to\nenact prophylactic legislation.\n\n  From all of this it follows that the ADA does\nnot \"enforce\" the Fourteenth Amendment, and from\nSeminole Tribe it follows that the Eleventh\nAmendment and associated principles of sovereign\nimmunity block private litigation against states\nin federal court. But Northeastern Illinois\nUniversity must understand the limits of this\nholding. The ADA is valid legislation, which both\nprivate and public actors must follow. Even if\nthe Supreme Court should overrule Garcia v. San\n\fAntonio Metropolitan Transit Authority, 469 U.S.\n528 (1985), and return to the view of National\nLeague of Cities v. Usery, 426 U.S. 833, 852\n(1976), that laws resting only on the Commerce\nClause cannot \"directly displace the States’\nfreedom to structure integral operations in areas\nof traditional governmental functions,\" the\nUniversity still would be bound by the ADA, for\nrunning a university is no more a core\ngovernmental function than is running a railroad.\nSee United Transportation Union v. Long Island\nR.R., 455 U.S. 678 (1982). Like most railroads,\nmost universities in the United States are\nprivate. All our holding means is that private\nlitigation to enforce the ADA may not proceed in\nfederal court. Erickson may repair to Illinois\ncourt--for although states may implement a\nblanket rule of sovereign immunity, see Alden v.\nMaine, 527 U.S. 706 (1999), Illinois has not done\nthis. Having opened its courts to claims based on\nstate law, including its own prohibition of\ndisability discrimination by units of state\ngovernment, see 775 ILCS 5/1-102, 5/2-\n101(B)(1)(c), Illinois may not exclude claims\nbased on federal law. Howlett v. Rose, 496 U.S.\n356, 367-75 (1990); FERC v. Mississippi, 456 U.S.\n742, 759-69 (1982); Testa v. Katt, 330 U.S. 386\n(1947). Moreover, the United States may enforce\nthe ADA against the University and other state\nactors through federal litigation. West Virginia\nv. United States, 479 U.S. 305, 311 n.4 (1987).\nBut Erickson has not enlisted the United States\nas her champion (its intervention was for the\npurpose of defending Erickson’s right to sue in\nher own name), so this suit belongs in state\ncourt.\nReversed\n\n\n\n  Diane P. Wood, Circuit Judge, dissenting. The\nAmericans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12111 et seq., stands at the\nintersection of two lines of cases that address\nCongress’s power under section 5 of the\nFourteenth Amendment to abrogate the Eleventh\nAmendment immunity of the states. Laws that fall\nwithin the section 5 power may abrogate the\nStates’ Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit, if\nCongress has made its intent to abrogate\n\"unmistakably clear\" in the language of the\nstatute. See City of Boerne v. Flores, 521 U.S.\n507 (1997); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon,\n473 U.S. 234, 242 (1985). When the question has\nbeen whether Title VII of the Civil Rights Act\nrepresents a valid use of Congress’s power under\nsection 5, courts have answered in the\naffirmative. See, e.g., Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer,\n427 U.S. 445, 456-57 (1976); In re Employment\nDiscrimination Litigation Against State of\n\fAlabama, 198 F.3d 1305, 1324 (11th Cir. 1999)\n(finding that disparate impact analysis is a\nvalid prophylactic measure and thus that this\naspect of Title VII, equally with the disparate\ntreatment branch, is a valid exercise of section\n5 power).\n\n  On the other hand, the Supreme Court has\nrecently ruled that the Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act, or ADEA, 29 U.S.C. sec. 621-34,\nexceeded Congress’s section 5 powers and thus\ncould not as a matter of law override the State’s\nEleventh Amendment immunity. Kimel v. Florida\nBoard of Regents, 120 S.Ct. 631 (2000). The\nquestion before us today, as the majority\nrecognizes, is which line of authority to apply\nto yet another statute, the ADA. This is plainly\na delicate and difficult issue, as the Supreme\nCourt itself appeared to have signaled when it\ngranted certiorari in Florida Dept. of\nCorrections v. Dickson, 120 S.Ct. 976 (2000), and\nin Alsbrook v. Arkansas, 120 S.Ct. 1003 (2000),\ntwo cases presenting precisely the problem before\nus now. The Court dismissed those two petitions\nunder S.Ct. Rule 46.1, and so it will not be\nconsidering the issue during the present Term.\nSee Dickson, No. 98-829, 2000 WL 215674 (U.S.,\nFeb. 23, 2000), and Alsbrook, No. 99-423, 2000 WL\n230234 (U.S., Mar. 1, 2000). We must therefore\ndecide this case without the prospect of\nimmediate guidance from Washington. For the\nreasons I explain below, I conclude that Title I\nof the ADA falls within Congress’s section 5\npowers under the principles the Court has\narticulated. I would therefore find that Erickson\nis entitled to bring her ADA suit against\nNortheastern Illinois University consistently\nwith the Eleventh Amendment, and I respectfully\ndissent.\n\nI\n\n  Although the literal language of the Eleventh\nAmendment addresses only the question of the\nextent of the judicial power of the United States\n(which \"shall not be construed to extend to any\nsuit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted\nagainst one of the United States by Citizens of\nanother State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any\nForeign State,\" U.S. Const. amend. XI), the Supreme\nCourt has held in a recent line of decisions that\nthe meaning of this part of the Constitution is\nnot limited to the precise words of the text.\nInstead, the Eleventh Amendment reflects the\nstructural fact that each state is a sovereign\nentity within the federal system, and as such,\neach state enjoys sovereign immunity from suit\nexcept insofar as its immunity has legitimately\nbeen curtailed. See Seminole Tribe v. Florida,\n517 U.S. 44, 54 (1996); Alden v. Maine, 119 S.Ct.\n\f2240, 2253-54 (1999); Florida Prepaid\nPostsecondary Education Expense Board v. College\nSavings Bank, 119 S.Ct. 2199, 2204 (1999).\n\n  There are a number of ways in which sovereign\nimmunity can be overcome consistently with the\nlaw: the state might consent to suit; to much the\nsame effect, it might choose to waive its\nsovereign immunity; or Congress might enact\nlegislation that abrogates the state’s\nimmunity./1 Only the last of those options is\nrelevant here. Abrogation is constitutionally\npossible only in narrow circumstances. First,\nCongress must make its intent to abrogate\n\"unmistakably clear\" in the language of the\nstatute. See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 640 (citing\nDellmuth v. Muth, 491 U.S. 223, 228 (1989), and\nquoting from Atascadero, 473 U.S. at 242).\nSecond, it must act pursuant to a valid grant of\nconstitutional power. Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 642;\nCity of Boerne, 521 U.S. 507, 519; Green v.\nMansour, 474 U.S. 64, 68 (1985). Here, everyone\nagrees that the only source of congressional\npower at issue is section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Cf. Florida Prepaid, 119 S.Ct. at\n2205.\n\n  In Kimel, the Court found that the ADEA\nsatisfied the \"clear statement\" requirement for\nabrogation. 120 S.Ct. at 640-42. The majority\nfinds, and I agree, that the same is true of the\nADA. Unlike the majority, however, I also\nconclude that Congress legitimately used its\npower under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment\nwhen it made the ADA applicable to the states.\n\n  As I have already noted, we know that Title VII\nrepresents a valid exercise of Congress’s section\n5 power to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity of the states, but the ADEA does not.\nThe Kimel Court made the latter finding because,\nfollowing City of Boerne, it concluded that the\nADEA was a measure that went beyond either\nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment or valid\nprophylactic measures designed to prevent\nviolations of the Constitution. See Kimel, 120\nS.Ct. at 645, 648-49. In Florida Prepaid, the\nCourt explained the difference between valid\nefforts to exercise section 5 powers and those\nthat go beyond the constitutional limits as\nfollows:\n\nWhile the line between measures that remedy or\nprevent unconstitutional actions and measures\nthat make a substantive change in the governing\nlaw is not easy to discern, and Congress must\nhave wide latitude in determining where it lies,\nthe distinction exists and must be observed.\nThere must be a congruence and proportionality\nbetween the injury to be prevented or remedied\n\fand the means adopted to that end.\n\n119 S.Ct. at 2205 (quoting from City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 519-20).\n\n  While the majority appears to concede that\nKimel should guide our decision with respect to\nthe ADA, its reading of Kimel overlooks important\nqualifications on that decision. The majority\nsees Kimel as a case holding that virtually all\ndiscrimination that is subject to rational basis\nreview for equal protection clause purposes is\noutside the scope of Congress’s section 5 powers.\nAnte, at 5. I find no hint of this in Kimel; to\nthe contrary, after recognizing that age\ndiscrimination is subject to rational basis\nreview, the Court took pains to analyze the ADEA\nin detail before finding that it cannot be\nsustained against the states as a valid exercise\nof the section 5 powers. That analysis would have\nbeen entirely beside the point if the mere fact\nof rational basis review was enough to decide the\ncase. Furthermore, the majority here, in\nrejecting the idea that the accommodation\nprovisions of the ADA could be sustained under\nsection 5 (ante at 7) ignores the express holding\nof Kimel that \"we have never held that section 5\nprecludes Congress from enacting reasonably\nprophylactic legislation.\" 120 S.Ct. at 648.\nLast, the majority appears to hold that virtually\nall antidiscrimination statutes that focus on\ndisparate impact, rather than intentional\ndisparate treatment, exceed Congress’s section 5\npowers. In so doing, it has created a square\nconflict with the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in\nEmployment Discrimination, supra, 198 F.3d at\n1324.\n\n  Kimel provides the analytical approach for\nassessing whether a statute addressing\ndiscrimination is a valid exercise of the section\n5 power. Looking at both the legislative record\nand the language of the pertinent statute, the\nKimel Court first asked whether the substantive\nrequirements of the statute were proportionate to\nany unconstitutional conduct that the statute\ncould have targeted. 120 S.Ct. at 645. It looked\nto earlier decisions that had considered the\nconstitutional implications of age discrimination\nand found it significant that all had upheld age\ndistinctions against constitutional challenges.\nSee Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991);\nVance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93 (1979);\nMassachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427\nU.S. 307 (1976) (per curiam). Second, it\nconsulted the legislative record to see if it\nrevealed either (1) a pattern of age\ndiscrimination committed by the states or (2)\n\"any discrimination whatsoever that rose to the\nlevel of constitutional violation.\" 120 S.Ct. at\n\f648-50. Finding neither element present, the\nCourt concluded that Congress did not in the ADEA\nvalidly abrogate the states’ sovereign immunity.\n\n  Following this roadmap, one can see that the\nADA differs critically from the ADEA in the areas\nthe Supreme Court deemed significant. The first\nquestion concerns the level of constitutional\nprotection the Supreme Court has recognized in\nprior cases for persons with disabilities. With\nthat standard in mind, the next question is\nwhether the ADA represents a proportionate\nresponse to the likelihood of constitutional\nviolations.\n\n  The leading case on the equal protection\ndimensions of disability discrimination is City\nof Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., 473\nU.S. 432 (1985). Although, as the majority\nobserves, the Court ultimately decided that\nrational basis review was proper for the\nordinance in that case, the majority finds the\nCourt’s reasoning to be irrelevant, ante at 6.\nThe majority also pays no heed to the fact that\nthe Court struck down the Cleburne ordinance\nbecause it unconstitutionally discriminated\nagainst the mentally retarded (clearly\nillustrating that legislation prohibiting\ndiscrimination with respect to a category that\nreceives rational basis review might indeed be\nenforcing the Constitution). I cannot dismiss\neither aspect of Cleburne so readily.\n\n  The specific question before the Court in\nCleburne was whether a local ordinance that\nrequired a special use permit for a home for the\nmentally retarded, but that imposed no such\nrequirement for many similar uses, violated the\nequal protection rights of the mentally disabled.\nThe Court held that mental retardation should not\nbe treated as a \"quasi-suspect classification\"\nfor equal protection purposes, but it\nnevertheless found that the ordinance failed\nrational basis scrutiny, because the permit\nrequirement \"rest[ed] on an irrational prejudice\nagainst the mentally retarded . . . .\" Cleburne,\n473 U.S. at 450./2 In coming to that conclusion,\nthe Court subjected the city’s proffered reasons\nin defense of the ordinance to careful scrutiny,\neven while it avoided introducing undue rigidity\ninto its analysis by using terms like \"suspect\"\nor \"quasi-suspect\" classifications--terms which\nthe Court later pointed out had sometimes given\nrise to the erroneous notion that scrutiny that\nwas strict in theory was often fatal in fact. See\nAdarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200,\n237 (1995).\n\n  Both the rationale of Cleburne and the nature\nof disability discrimination itself, as outlined\n\fin the congressional findings and legislative\nhistory of the ADA, highlight important\ndifferences between disability and age as bases\nfor differential treatment, and they reveal,\ncontrary to the majority’s surprising suggestion,\nthat the ADA is indeed a statute designed to\nprohibit irrational discrimination.\n\n  As the Kimel Court observed, older persons\n\"have not been subjected to a history of\npurposeful unequal treatment.\" 120 S.Ct. at 645\n(citing Murgia, 427 U.S. at 313, quoting San\nAntonio Independent School Dist. v. Rodriguez,\n411 U.S. 1, 28 (1973)). In contrast, Congress\nfound in the ADA that disabled persons have been\n\"subjected to a history of purposeful unequal\ntreatment,\" \"in such critical areas as\nemployment, housing, public accommodations,\neducation, transportation, communication,\nrecreation, institutionalization, health\nservices, voting, and access to public services.\"\n42 U.S.C. sec. 12101. Second, harking back to the\nwell known idea in United States v. Carolene\nProducts, 304 U.S. 144, 152-53 n.4 (1938), in no\nmeaningful sense of the term can the elderly be\nregarded as a \"discrete and insular minorit[y]\";\nto the contrary, as Kimel notes, \"all persons, if\nthey live out their normal life spans, will\nexperience [old age].\" 120 S.Ct. at 645. This is\na strong reason to believe that the normal\npolitical processes are adequate to protect the\ninterests of the elderly and that they will not\nbe singled out for unconstitutionally\ndiscriminatory treatment.\n\n  The disabled stand in a distinctly different\nposition. Not everyone is or will become\ndisabled. And the fact that some disabilities\narise later in life and some do not persist for\na lifetime does not make them the equivalent of\nthe inexorable aging process. The point is that\nCongress found that those who are disabled will\nsuffer during the time they are disabled from the\nsame invidious discrimination that has haunted\nracial minorities and women. The ADA reflects\nCongress’s finding that society has the ability\nto, and has historically, \"tended to isolate and\nsegregate individuals with disabilities.\" 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12101.\n\n  There are other reasons as well to conclude\nthat the ADA is a permissible exercise of\nCongress’s section 5 power. Apart from the\nsalient differences between age and disability as\nbases for categorization, the two statutes fare\nquite differently under the proportionality\nanalysis required by Boerne and Kimel. The broad\nsweep of the ADEA caused the Supreme Court to\nfind that it was not a proportional response to\nthe problem of age discrimination. The ADEA\n\fprohibits all employment discrimination on the\nbasis of age against persons in the protected\nclass (those above the age of 40). 29 U.S.C. sec.\n623(a)(1). The only tempering of this rule\nappears in the statutory rules allowing an\nemployer to justify age-based distinctions if it\nshows either a substantial basis for believing\nthat all or nearly all employees above a given\nage lack the qualifications required for the\nposition or that reliance on the age\nclassification is necessary because individual\ntesting for qualifications is highly impractical.\nKimel, 120 S.Ct. at 647 (citing Western Air Lines\nv. Criswell, 472 U.S. 400, 422 (1985)). The\nEEOC’s implementing regulations, as well as cases\ndecided under the ADEA, make it clear that these\nexceptions were intended to be narrow ones. See\n29 C.F.R. sec. 1625.6(a); see also Western Air\nLines, 472 U.S. at 422.\n\n  The ADA adopts a more nuanced approach to the\nproblem of disability discrimination. An employer\nis entitled to treat a disabled person\ndifferently--indeed, even to deny employment to\nthe person on that basis--if there are no\nreasonable accommodations that will permit the\nindividual to do the job and she cannot handle\nthe job without accommodations. 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12113. See, e.g., Stewart v. County of Brown, 86\nF.3d 107, 112 (7th Cir. 1996); Pond v. Michelin\nNorth America, Inc., 183 F.3d 592, 596 (7th Cir.\n1999); Sieberns v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 125\nF.3d 1019, 1022 (7th Cir. 1997). Thus, while an\nemployer discriminating on the basis of age must\ndemonstrate that it would be \"highly impractical\"\nnot to do so, an employer making distinctions on\nthe basis of disability need only show that\n\"reasonable steps\" of accommodation, such as\nmodifying work schedules, training materials,\nfacilities, or policies, will not work. See 42\nU.S.C. sec.sec. 12113, 12111. The incorporation\nof a reasonableness standard in the duty to\naccommodate, which itself modifies the duty not\nto discriminate on the basis of disability, is\nessentially a legislative incorporation of the\nproportionality test required under the\nConstitution. It also illustrates, contrary to\nthe majority’s suggestion, that the duty to\naccommodate is not a command to give \"special\"\ntreatment; instead, it spells out the way that\ndiscrimination is to be avoided. I would\ntherefore find that the ADA meets the first part\nof the Kimel analysis.\n\n  The second question under Kimel requires us to\nconsider whether the legislative record reveals\neither a pattern of age discrimination committed\nby the states or \"any discrimination whatsoever\nthat [rises] to the level of constitutional\nviolation.\" 120 S.Ct. at 649. Here, although the\n\fevidence is stronger on the second point than the\nfirst, the record shows both kinds of disability\ndiscrimination.\n\n  With respect to the first question (i.e.\nlegislative findings pertaining specifically to\nstate behavior), the legislative record is\nadmittedly sparse. Nevertheless, the House Report\nnotes that \"inconsistent treatment of people with\ndisabilities by different state or local\ngovernment agencies is both inequitable and\nillogical.\" H.R. Rep. No. 101-485 (II). More\nimportantly, the express congressional findings\nwith respect to pervasive discrimination address\nmany areas that are controlled to a significant\ndegree by state and local governments. For\nexample, Congress identified discrimination in\neducation as a particular problem. See 42 U.S.C.\nsec. 12101(3). Education in this country is\noverwhelmingly an enterprise of state and local\ngovernment./3 Another sector singled out in the\nstatute was health services, see 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101(3), in which state and local governments\nalso play a powerful role./4 The story is\nsimilar for transportation, which is also\nmentioned in sec. 12101(3)./5 Congress’s\nspecific attention to sectors with such a\nsubstantial state and local governmental presence\nindicates that it knew that government action at\nthe state level was an important part of the\nproblem it was addressing.\n\n  The other evidence the Kimel Court found\nlacking for the ADEA--a record of discrimination\nthat reveals constitutional violations--is\npresent in abundance for the ADA. It would be\nhard to imagine greater scrutiny than Congress\ngave to the harm caused by disability\ndiscrimination when it passed the ADA. Its\nfindings explain in painstaking detail the extent\nof the evil. See 42 U.S.C. sec. 12101./6 We give\ncongressional findings substantial deference,\nbecause Congress \"is far better equipped than the\njudiciary to amass and evaluate the vast amounts\nof data bearing upon legislative questions.\"\nTurner Broadcasting Systems v. F.C.C., 520 U.S.\n180, 195 (1997). This is the legislative task the\nSupreme Court contemplated in Cleburne, where it\nheld that the way disabled people are \"to be\ntreated under the law is a difficult and often a\ntechnical matter, very much a task for\nlegislators guided by qualified professionals and\nnot by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the\njudiciary.\" Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 442-43.\n\n  The ADA’s legislative findings distinguish the\nADA from both the ADEA and RFRA, the statute\nbefore the Court in City of Boerne. Like the ADEA\nand unlike the ADA, Congress did not make\nfindings in the RFRA about the seriousness or\n\fscope of discrimination against religious\npersons. See 42 U.S.C. sec.sec. 2000bb to\n2000bb-4. As I have already noted, in the ADEA\nCongress never identified \"any discrimination\nwhatsoever that rose to the level of\nconstitutional violation.\" Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at\n649. The only evidence the Kimel Court found\nshowing the harm at which the ADEA was aimed was\na few \"isolated sentences clipped from floor\ndebates and legislative reports.\" Id. When\nformulating the ADA, in contrast, Congress\ncompiled an immense legislative record. It\nexamined all this evidence and found that \"[t]he\nseverity and pervasiveness of discrimination\nagainst people with disabilities [was] well\ndocumented.\" H.R. 101-485 (II). This factor\ntherefore points toward a conclusion that the\nlegislative basis for a valid exercise of\nCongress’s section 5 powers is present for the\nADA, even though it was not for the ADEA or RFRA.\n\n  Before leaving this subject, it is important to\nnote that the majority has elevated a single\npoint in the legislative history to dispositive\nsignificance: the absence of a statement\nsomewhere to the effect that \"we are passing this\nlaw because we need to correct discrimination on\nthe basis of disability committed by the states.\"\nI see nothing in Kimel that gives such primacy to\nthis single point. Combining the explicit\ncoverage of sectors in which the states are the\nprincipal actors, with the deliberate decision of\nCongress to make the states subject to the\nstatute, and finally with the enormous\nlegislative record documenting the depth of the\nproblem of disability discrimination, I find the\nsecond part of the Kimel approach to be satisfied\nfor the ADA.\n\nII\n\n  Given its conclusion about the Eleventh\nAmendment, the majority does not reach the last\nquestion that was presented in this case, which\nwas whether the analysis that applies to an\nEleventh Amendment argument directed at the\ngeneral prohibition in the ADA against\ndiscrimination is different from the analysis\nappropriate to the accommodation provisions of\nthe Act. Because I would reject the general\nEleventh Amendment defense, I add a brief word on\nthis point. In my view, because the accommodation\nduty and the duty to avoid discrimination are\nnothing more than two sides of the same coin, the\nanswer is no.\n\n  The ADA defines discrimination to include \"not\nmaking reasonable accommodations to the known\nphysical or mental limitations of an otherwise\nqualified individual with a disability who is an\n\fapplicant or employee, unless . . . [the] covered\nentity can demonstrate that the accommodation\nwould impose an undue hardship on the operation\nof the business of such covered entity.\" 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12112(b)(5)(A). The Act also provides\nthat an employer may defend against a charge of\ndiscrimination by showing that its goals require\ndiscrimination--that they \"cannot be accomplished\nby reasonable accommodation.\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12113(a).\n\n  The University argues that this statutory\naccommodation process is unconstitutional under\nPrintz v. United States, 521 U.S. 898 (1997),\nbecause it violates the Tenth Amendment by\nforcing state officials to administer a federal\nregulatory scheme. In my view, however, the\nPrintz model has no bearing on the question\nbefore us. The flaws the Court identified in\nPrintz included the act of conscripting state\nofficials to administer a federal program, the\neffective reallocation of duties from the\nbranches of the federal government to which the\nConstitution assigned them to the state\nofficials, and the conferral of policy-making\nauthority on the state officials without adequate\nguidance. The Printz Court found that forcing the\nstate to implement this type of regulatory system\nviolated the principles of separation of powers\nand dual sovereignty. Id. at 922, 932, 930.\n\n  The ADA does not establish anything like the\nregulatory scheme for handguns at issue in\nPrintz. The ADA is instead a straightforward law\nprohibiting discrimination on the part of all\nemployers, private and governmental alike, and\ndefining the way the prohibition must be\nimplemented. It provides the employers with\nprecise definitions to follow: a reasonable\naccommodation is one tailored to the\ndiscrimination issue before the employer, which\ndoes not \"impose an undue hardship on the\noperation [of the employer’s business].\" 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12112(b)(5)(A). Unlike the regulatory\nsystem before the Printz Court, the ADA does not\nconfer any special powers on employers in general\nor on state employers in particular. Employers\nare not administering a federal benefit by\nproviding a reasonable accommodation; they are\nrefraining from discrimination and to some degree\ntaking preventative measures. There is no duty to\naccommodate that is separate from the general\nobligation to avoid discrimination against the\ndisabled.\n  It bears repeating that, for this purpose,\nstate employers stand in exactly the same\nposition as private employers. As this court held\nin Travis v. Reno, 163 F.3d 1000, 1004-05 (7th\nCir. 1998), federal law may pervasively regulate\nstates as market participants; the anti-\n\fcommandeering law of Printz only comes into play\nwhen the federal government calls on the states\nto use their sovereign powers to implement a\nfederal regulatory program. In Travis, which came\nto the result later endorsed by the Supreme Court\nin Reno v. Condon, supra, we concluded that the\nDrivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) did not\nviolate the Tenth Amendment. The DPPA requires\ndisclosure of certain records by the state, and\nso necessarily forces the state to come up with\na system of determining which records should be\ndisclosed, as well as how best to disclose them.\nThe system was found constitutional because it\naffects states in their role as owners of\ndatabases, not in their role as governments.\nCondon, 120 S.Ct. at 672; Travis, 163 F.3d at\n1004.\n\n  Though the ADA forces the states to comply with\na federal regulation, it affects the states in\ntheir role as employers, not in their role as\ngovernments. Federal regulations of states acting\nas employers have been upheld in the past. In\nGarcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit\nAuthority, 469 U.S. 528 (1985), the Court held\nthat state employers may be forced to follow the\nfederal Fair Labor Standards Act’s wage and hour\nrules. Nothing in the recent line of Eleventh\nAmendment decisions undermines that rule. To the\ncontrary, in Alden v. Maine the Court went out of\nits way to reaffirm that \"[t]he constitutional\nprivilege of a State to assert its sovereign\nimmunity in its own courts does not confer upon\nthe State a concomitant right to disregard the\nConstitution or valid federal law.\" 119 S.Ct. at\n2266. Instead, the Court assumed that the states\nwould ordinarily live up to their duties under\nfederal law as a matter of good faith, and it\nnoted that enforcement of federal obligations by\nthe federal government remains permissible under\nthe constitutional design. Id. at 2267. The fact\nof dual sovereignty does not, therefore, carry\nwith it any implication that states are allowed\nto disregard or to frustrate valid federal\nprograms. See City of New York v. United States,\n179 F.3d 29, 35 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n  By defining discrimination in part as not\nmaking reasonable accommodations to disabled\nemployees, the ADA does impose costs on\nemployers, including the states. Employers must\naffirmatively act to alter any practices they\nhave in place that discriminate against the\ndisabled. Of course, this makes a great deal of\nsense. Just because an employer has a\ndiscriminatory practice, such as maintaining\nsteep stairways or only offering breaks at wide\nintervals and therefore not allowing diabetics to\ntake their medication, does not mean that the\nemployer should be able to continue such a\n\fdiscriminatory practice without violating the\nADA, any more than an employer’s refusal in the\npast to construct a women’s restroom would\njustify a refusal to hire female employees. The\nADA allows an employer to adjust the workplace\nenvironment on a case-by-case basis, adopting\nonly those changes that are reasonably necessary\nto refrain from discriminating against the\ndisabled individual or individuals in question.\n\n  The ADA hardly broke new ground when it\nincorporated this type of affirmative duty. The\nEqual Protection Clause often requires states to\ntake affirmative measures to eliminate or prevent\ndiscriminatory systems. For example, states with\nracially discriminatory reapportionment plans\nmust redraw their congressional districts. See,\ne.g., Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 652 (1993)\n(holding that the state’s reapportionment plan\nmight violate the Equal Protection Clause). The\nlogic of the University’s argument here would, if\ntaken to its limits, call into question every\naffirmative injunction a court has ever entered\nto prevent threatened future violations of the\nconstitutional guarantee of equal protection of\nthe laws. Nothing in the Supreme Court decisions\non which the University relies even hints at such\na radical result. Similarly, the First Amendment\nguarantee of the right of free exercise of\nreligion carries with it an implied duty on the\npart of the state to make reasonable adjustments.\nSee, e.g., Sherbert v.

City\nof Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 546 (1993); Zorach v.\nClauson, 343 U.S. 306, 313-14 (1952). Boerne does\nnot overrule these direct constitutional rulings.\n  Last, as I indicated above, I do not read any\nof the Supreme Court’s recent decisions as\noverruling prior rulings that have upheld\ncongressional legislation prohibiting measures\nwith a discriminatory impact as valid exercises\nof the section 5 power. As the Eleventh Circuit\nexplained in Employment Discrimination,\n\"disparate impact analysis was designed as a\n’prophylactic’ measure.\" 198 F.3d at 1321 (citing\nConnecticut v. Teal, 457 U.S. 440, 449 (1982),\nAlbemarle Paper Co. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405, 417\n(1975), and Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S.\n424, 435 (1971)). The Eleventh Circuit went on to\nexplain that even though, in a disparate impact\ncase, \"the plaintiff is never explicitly required\nto demonstrate discriminatory motive, a genuine\nfinding of disparate impact can be highly\nprobative of the employer’s motive since a racial\n’imbalance is often a telltale sign of purposeful\ndiscrimination.’\" Id. (citing International\nBrotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431\nU.S. 324, 339-40 n.20 (1977)). It found from this\nthat the disparate impact provisions of Title VII\n\fare preventive rules that have the necessary\ncongruence between the means used and the\nconstitutional violation to be addressed\n(intentional discrimination). Id. at 1322.\nNothing in Kimel comes close to suggesting that\nthe Court was overruling this long line of its\nown authority, upon which the Eleventh Circuit\ncarefully relied, and I am not prepared to take\nthat step in the present case.\n\n  For all these reasons, I therefore respectfully\ndissent from the majority’s conclusion that the\nEleventh Amendment bars Erickson’s suit against\nNortheastern University.\n\n\n\n\n/1 The extent of the protection from suit that\nresults from a finding of sovereign immunity is\nalso an important question, because, at least in\ncertain contexts, sovereign immunity is qualified\nrather than absolute. See, e.g., the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. sec.sec.\n1602, 1605. Despite the exchange between the\nmajority and dissenters in College Savings Bank\nv. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense\nBd., 119 S.Ct. 2219, 2230-31, 2235-37 (1999), on\nthe significance of market participation for\nsovereign immunity purposes, there remains some\ntension in the Supreme Court’s cases on this\npoint. See Reno v. Condon, 120 S.Ct. 666 (2000)\n(finding the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act to\nbe a valid exercise of Congress’s Commerce Clause\npower, and non-violative of state sovereignty\nunder both the Tenth and Eleventh Amendments,\nbecause it regulated the state’s market\nactivities); California v. Deep Sea Research, 523\nU.S. 491, 506-07 (1998) (finding that, in\ndetermining whether sovereign immunity applies to\nstates, the Court looks at whether sovereign\nimmunity would apply to the federal government,\nbecause \"this Court has recognized a correlation\nbetween sovereign immunity principles applicable\nto States and the Federal government,\" and at\nwhether sovereign immunity would apply to a\nforeign government). Although I recognize that\nthe Supreme Court may ultimately have more to say\non the subject, I am assuming here, consistently\nwith College Savings and Kimel, that the\ncommercial character of the operation of a state\nuniversity system is not enough to qualify the\nstate’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n/2 This implies a more exacting test for rationality\nthan the majority finds in Cleburne, ante at 6-7.\nThe majority goes on to advance the astonishing\npropositions that it would be rational for a\nuniversity to conclude that anyone not in the top\n1% of the population is not apt to be a good\n\fteacher and scholar, or that it would be rational\nto refuse to hire a blind professor because she\ncould not master material as fast as her sighted\ncolleagues. Such a view flies in the face of\nevidence about the accomplishments of the\nvisually impaired; it assumes rationality in the\nprocess of choosing who exactly falls within the\ntop 1% of the population; and it illustrates\nexactly the kind of stereotyped thinking that the\nADA was designed to combat.\n\n/3 A 1995 study by the Department of Education\nshowed that 90% of elementary and secondary\neducation in the United States is public--only\n10% of students are enrolled in private schools.\nSee <http://www.ed.gov>.\n\n/4 Together, state and local   governments were\nresponsible for 12.7% of the   United States’\nhealth expenditures in 1998,   while private\nindividuals and corporations   were responsible for\nonly 54% of those costs. See\n<http://www.hcfa.gov>.\n\n/5 Government as a whole paid about 50% of\ntransportation costs in the United States in\n1996, with state and local governments covering\nabout 60% of those costs, or 34.5% of the total.\nSee <http://www.bts.gov>.\n\n/6 Congress found that:\n(1) some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more\nphysical or mental disabilities, and this number\nis increasing as the population as a whole is\ngrowing older;\n(2) historically, society has tended to isolate\nand segregate individuals with disabilities, and,\ndespite some improvements, such forms of\ndiscrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities continue to be a serious and\npervasive social problem;\n(3) discrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities persists in such critical areas as\nemployment, housing, public accommodations,\neducation, transportation, communication,\nrecreation, institutionalization, health\nservices, voting, and access to public services;\n(4) unlike individuals who have experienced\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, sex,\nnational origin, religion, or age, individuals\nwho have experienced discrimination on the basis\nof disability have often had no legal recourse to\nredress such discrimination;\n(5) individuals with disabilities continually\nencounter various forms of discrimination,\nincluding outright intentional exclusion, the\ndiscriminatory effects of architectural,\ntransportation, and communication barriers,\noverprotective rules and policies, failure to\nmake modifications to existing facilities and\n\fpractices, exclusionary qualification standards\nand criteria, segregation, and relegation to\nlesser services, programs, activities, benefits,\njobs, or other opportunities;\n(6) census data, national polls, and other\nstudies have documented that people with\ndisabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior\nstatus in our society, and are severely\ndisadvantaged socially, vocationally,\neconomically, and educationally;\n(7) individuals with disabilities are a discrete\nand insular minority who have been faced with\nrestrictions and limitations, subjected to a\nhistory of purposeful unequal treatment, and\nrelegated to a position of political\npowerlessness in our society, based on\ncharacteristics that are beyond the control of\nsuch individuals and resulting from stereotypic\nassumptions not truly indicative of the\nindividual ability of such individuals to\nparticipate in, and contribute to, society;\n(8) the Nation’s proper goals regarding\nindividuals with disabilities are to assure\nequality of opportunity, full participation,\nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency\nfor such individuals, and\n(9) the continuing existence of unfair and\nunnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies\npeople with disabilities the opportunity to\ncompete on an equal basis and to pursue those\nopportunities for which our free society is\njustifiably famous, and costs the United States\nbillions of dollars in unnecessary expenses\nresulting from dependency and nonproductivity.\n\n42 U.S.C. sec. 12101.\n\f",

Thrice it has\nstressed that the language of sec.5, which gives\nCongress the power to \"enforce\" the Fourteenth\nAmendment, must be taken seriously. Statutes that\ncreate new rights, or expand old rights beyond\nthe Fourteenth Amendment’s bounds, do not\n\"enforce\" that amendment.\n\n  Boerne dealt with the Religious Freedom\nRestoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), 42 U.S.C. sec.sec.\n2000bb to 2000bb-4, a response to Employment\nDivision v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112404\"><a href=\"/opinion/112404/employment-div-dept-of-human-resources-of-ore-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">872</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990). Smith had\nheld that the Free Exercise Clause of the First\nAmendment never requires accommodation of\nreligiously inspired practices, so that laws\nneutral with respect to religion are valid. The\nRFRA, by contrast, obliged states to accommodate\npractices associated with religion. The Court\nheld that an accommodation requirement could not\nbe thought to \"enforce\" a constitutional norm\nthat does not require accommodation. Florida\nPrepaid held that Congress may not use sec.5 to\nabrogate state sovereign immunity on the ground\n\fthat statutory rights are \"property\" under the\nFourteenth Amendment. Kimel held that sec.5 does\nnot support the Age Discrimination in Employment\nAct, 29 U.S.C. sec.sec. 621-34, because although\nthe ADEA forbids consideration of an employee’s\nage unless age is a \"bona fide occupational\nqualification reasonably necessary to the normal\noperation of the particular business\",\nsec.623(f)(1), the Constitution’s own requirement\nis considerably more lenient. The Equal\nProtection Clause permits a state to consider a\nperson’s age unless age lacks a rational\nrelationship to the state’s objective. Most\nconsideration of age in employment therefore is\nconstitutional; but under the ADEA most\nconsideration of age is forbidden; Kimel\ntherefore held that the ADEA sets up an\nindependent rule and does not \"enforce\" the\nConstitution’s rule.\n\n  Twenty-three days before the Supreme Court\ndecided Boerne, we held in Crawford v. Indiana\nDepartment of Corrections, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"741785\"><a href=\"/opinion/741785/ricky-crawford-v-indiana-department-of-corrections/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 487 (7th\nCir. 1997), that sec.5 supports Title II of the\nADA, which deals with public services.

Kimel shows that if our\nanalogy to the ADEA is precise, then Crawford is\nno longer authoritative; Florida Prepaid and\nBoerne likewise call for a fresh look at the\nsubject. Elsewhere a great deal of ink has been\nspilled on this question.

The Supreme Court’s opinion\nin Kimel calls all of these decisions into\nquestion, and we think it best to analyze the\n\fsubject afresh rather than to rehash pre-Kimel\nconclusions in and out of this circuit. Believing\nthat the Supreme Court would tackle the issue\nbefore July, the second circuit declined to\nreconsider Muller in light of Kimel. See\nKilcullen v. New York State Department of Labor,\n2000 U.S. App. Lexis 2714 (2d Cir. Feb. 24, 2000).\nBut settlements have dashed that hope; we\ntherefore undertake independent consideration.\n\n  Whether Congress has authorized federal\nlitigation against states is our initial\nquestion. Kimel answered yes for the ADEA, see 120\nS. Ct. at 640-42, and the same answer is\nappropriate for the ADA. By incorporating 42\nU.S.C. sec.2000e, the ADA defines persons, and\nthus employers, to include units of government.\n42 U.S.C. sec.12111(5)(A), (7). Fitzpatrick held\nthat sec.2000e is a sufficiently clear statement.\nSection 12202 adds that \"[a] State shall not be\nimmune under the eleventh amendment to the\nConstitution of the United States from an action\nin Federal or State court of competent\njurisdiction for a violation of this chapter.\"\nFinally, just in case there were doubt,\nsec.12101(b)(4) invokes all possible sources of\nauthority to enact the ADA, \"including the power\nto enforce the fourteenth amendment\".\n  On the question whether a statute such as the\nADA enforces the Fourteenth Amendment, Kimel\nestablishes two principal propositions. First,\nbecause the rational-basis test applies to age\ndiscrimination, almost all of the ADEA’s\nrequirements stand apart from the Constitution’s\nrule. Most age discrimination is rational, and\ntherefore constitutional, yet the Act forbids it.\nThe ADEA therefore does not \"enforce\" the\nFourteenth Amendment. 120 S. Ct. at 645-48.\nSecond, there is no need for prophylactic rules\nto catch evasions of the rational-basis test by\nstate governments. Congress did not find that\nsuch a problem exists, and there is no evidence\nof one. The ADEA therefore cannot be understood as\nenforcement legislation. 120 S. Ct. at 648-50.\nBoth of these propositions are true of the ADA as\nwell--indeed, the ADA is harder to conceive as\n\"enforcement\" of the Fourteenth Amendment than is\nthe ADEA. Under the ADEA employers must ignore age\nbut are free to act on the basis of attributes\nsuch as strength, mental acuity, and salary that\nare related to age. Hazen Paper Co. v.

A would-be\nprofessor who is not in the top 1% of the\npopulation in mental acuity is not apt to be a\ngood teacher and scholar. Likewise it is rational\nfor a university to favor someone with good\nvision over someone who requires the assistance\nof a reader. The sighted person can master more\nof the academic literature (reading is much\nfaster than listening), improving his chance to\nbe a productive scholar, and also is less\nexpensive (because the university need not pay\nfor the reader). An academic institution that\nprefers to use a given budget to hire a sighted\nscholar plus a graduate teaching assistant,\nrather than a blind scholar plus a reader, has\ncomplied with its constitutional obligation to\navoid irrational action. But it has not complied\nwith the ADA, which requires accommodation at any\ncost less than \"undue hardship\". 42 U.S.C.\nsec.12112(b) (5)(A), sec.12111(10). How the\n\"undue hardship\" defense under the ADA compares\nwith the \"bona fide occupational qualification\"\ndefense under the ADEA is an interesting question,\nbut not one we need pursue: both statutes\npresumptively forbid consideration of attributes\nthat the Constitution permits states to consider,\nand then (like the RFRA) require the state to\ncarry a burden of persuasion in order to take the\ncharacteristic into account. As in Kimel, the\nfact that the law has made adverse action based\non a characteristic \"prima facie unlawful\" shows\nthe extent of its departure from the\nConstitution’s own rule. 120 S. Ct. at 647. Like\nthe ADEA, the ADA \"prohibits very little conduct\n\flikely to be held unconstitutional,\" id. at 648.\n\n  The ADA’s main target is an employer’s rational\nconsideration of disabilities. Rational\ndiscrimination by definition does not violate a\nconstitutional provision that condemns only\nirrational distinctions based on disabilities.\nCongress has ample power under the Commerce\nClause to forbid rational discrimination, which\nmay bear especially heavily on a class of persons\nwho suffer from diminished human (and often\nfinancial) capital. But to say that in devising\nthese new rules Congress is just \"enforcing\" a\nsubstantive command present in sec.1 of the\nFourteenth Amendment since 1868 would be a legal\nfiction. Boerne, Florida Prepaid, and Kimel hold\nthat fictions do not support legislation under\nsec.5.\n\n  One way to distinguish the ADA from the ADEA would\nbe to emphasize a remark in Kimel that \"[o]ld age\n. . . does not define a discrete and insular\nminority because all persons, if they live out\ntheir normal life spans, will experience it.\" 120\nS. Ct. at 645. The argument would continue that\nmany disabilities are immutable; few people born\nblind acquire vision later. We do not read the\nCourt’s observation in Kimel as distinguishing\namong characteristics that are subject to\nrational-basis review; instead the Court offered\nthe observation as one reason why earlier cases\nhad applied the rational-basis test to age.\nBecause Cleburne held that the rational-basis\ntest likewise governs disabilities, the reasoning\nbehind that opinion need not come back into\nconsideration. We know from Cleburne that\nrational distinctions based on disabilities\ncomport with the Constitution. What is more, many\ndisabilities come and go, or progress with time.\nBeethoven did not become deaf, or Milton blind,\nuntil middle age. Erickson’s medical problem\naffected her for a number of years but not for a\nlifetime (if only because medical treatment may\nhave succeeded, or because after menopause it\nwould have lost significance). One can imagine an\nargument under sec.5 for a federal law dealing\nwith discrimination against persons with life-\nlong disabilities, but the ADA is not such a law--\nnot only because it extends beyond permanently\ndisabled persons, but also because\n\"discrimination\" as the ADA defines it, see\nsec.12112(b), has little in common with\n\"discrimination\" in constitutional law.\n\n  To see this, consider the role of intent. When\na state law or practice does not expressly\nconcern a particular characteristic (such as\nrace, sex, age, or disability), but has a\ndisparate impact on persons with that\ncharacteristic, the plaintiff in constitutional\n\flitigation must establish that the state intends\nto discriminate on the basis of that\ncharacteristic.

Feeney, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110098\"><a href=\"/opinion/110098/personnel-administrator-of-mass-v-feeney/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1979)\n(sex); Washington v.

Things are otherwise under the ADA, which\nnot only demands accommodation (which forces the\nemployer to consider, rather than ignore,\ndisabilities) but also prohibits any rule or\npractice that has a disparate impact, unless the\nrule is \"job-related for the position in question\nand is consistent with business necessity\". 42\nU.S.C. sec.12112(b)(6). See Washington v. Indiana\nHigh School Athletic Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764930\"><a href=\"/opinion/764930/eric-washington-and-central-catholic-high-school-v-indiana-high-school/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">840</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th\nCir. 1999) (under the ADA the plaintiff need not\nshow that the governmental body intended to\ndiscriminate on account of disability). Cases\nsuch as Feeney and Davis hold that the Equal\nProtection Clause does not forbid laws and\npractices that have a disparate impact; but the\nADA does forbid them.\n\n  By requiring that employers accommodate rather\nthan disregard disabilities, the ADA is a cousin\nto the RFRA. Smith held that demands for\naccommodation and claims of disparate impact have\nno constitutional footing under the Free Exercise\nClause; it takes express or intentional\ndiscrimination to violate that provision. See\nalso Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v.\nHialeah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112881\"><a href=\"/opinion/112881/church-of-lukumi-babalu-aye-inc-v-hialeah/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1993). Congress then\nenacted the RFRA, which requires every unit of\ngovernment to justify any law or practice that\nburdens a person’s exercise of religion, \"even if\nthe burden results from a rule of general\napplicability\". 42 U.S.C. sec.2000bb-1(a). This\nrequires a state to accommodate religiously\nmotivated behavior unless it can show a\n\"compelling\" reason for neutrality between\nreligious and secular conduct. Boerne responded\nthat Congress may not redefine the constitutional\nrule under the rubric of \"enforcement.\"\n\n  What the RFRA did for religion, the ADA does for\ndisabilities. In neither situation does the\nConstitution forbid neutral laws or practices\nthat create disparate impacts; in neither\nsituation does the Constitution require\naccommodation. Both the RFRA and the ADA replace\nthe Constitution’s approach with a prohibition of\ndisparate impact and jettison neutrality in favor\nof accommodation. The RFRA’s demand for a\n\"compelling governmental interest\", 42 U.S.C.\nsec.2000bb-1(b)(1), made it harder for a\ngovernment to prevail than do the ADA’s\nrequirements (job-relatedness, business\nnecessity, and undue hardship), but there is a\ncountervailing difference that makes the ADA the\nmore adventuresome. The Free Exercise Clause\nforbids all intentional discrimination against\n\freligious practices; the Equal Protection Clause\nhas no similar rule about disabilities. Rational\ndiscrimination against persons with disabilities\nis constitutionally permissible in a way that\nrational discrimination against religious\npractices is not. This makes the ADA harder than\nthe RFRA to justify under sec.5, for \"[i]t is\nprecisely in a close case that the independent\njudgment of Congress on a constitutional question\nshould make a difference.\" Michael W. McConnell,\nInstitutions and Interpretation: A Critique of\nCity of Boerne v. Flores, 111 Harv. L. Rev. 153,\n155 (1997). See also Stephen L. Carter, The\nMorgan \"Power\" and the Forced Reconsideration of\nConstitutional Decisions, 53 U. Chi. L. Rev. 819\n(1986). Some of the Justices and several careful\nscholars believe that the rule of decision in the\nRFRA is the Constitution’s own. See Boerne, 521\nU.S. at 544 (O’Connor, J., dissenting), 565\n(Souter, J., dissenting). Others who support the\nmajority position in Smith acknowledge that the\nquestion is difficult. See generally Symposium,\nReflections on City of Boerne v. Flores, 39\nWilliam & Mary L. Rev. 597 (1998). But no one\nbelieves that the Equal Protection Clause\nestablishes the disparate-impact and mandatory-\naccommodation rules found in the ADA. The statute\nis outside the boundaries of constitutional\ndiscourse in a way that the RFRA was not. If the\nRFRA and the ADEA exceed the sec.5 power, then so\ndoes the ADA--at least to the extent it extends\nbeyond remedies for irrational discrimination.\n\n  Well, then, can the ADA be sustained as\nreasonable prophylactic legislation? Because the\nADA requires accommodation, forbids practices with\ndisparate impact, and disregards the employer’s\nintent, it is harder than the ADEA to characterize\nas a remedial measure. The ADEA was a real anti-\ndiscrimination law; unless age was held against\nthe employee, there was no violation. The ADA goes\nbeyond the anti-discrimination principle, a step\nthat requires reason to think that only by going\nto these lengths is it possible to implement the\ncore constitutional rule. Yet just as for the\nADEA, Congress did not find that states have\nadopted clever devices that conceal irrational\ndiscrimination. The legislative findings in 42\nU.S.C. sec.12101 contain not a word about state\ngovernments. Congress did find that persons with\ndisabilities have been discriminated against; it\nfound the same in the ADEA for age. What it did\nnot find is that the practices labeled\n\"discrimination\" are irrational (as that term\nworks under the Equal Protection Clause) or that\nstates are major offenders--a critical inquiry\nnot only under Kimel but also under Florida\nPrepaid. Instead, Congress used the word\n\"discrimination\" in sec.12101, and Committees of\nCongress used that word in the legislative\n\fhistory, to refer to any disadvantage that\naccompanies a disability. For example, the\nstatement in H.R. Rep. No. 101-485(II), 101st\nCong. 2d Sess. 37 (1990), that \"inconsistent\ntreatment of people with disabilities by\ndifferent State or local government agencies is\nboth inequitable and illogical for a society\ncommitted to full access for people with\ndisabilities\" means only that different public\nbodies treated persons differently, because the\nRehabilitation Act applied to some persons but\nnot others; it does not mean that either\ntreatment was unconstitutional. \"Inconsistent\" is\nnot a synonym for irrational--especially not when\nit was a federal statute that induced the\ninconsistency on which the Committee remarked.\n  Just as in Kimel, legislative statements about\ndiscrimination consist \"almost entirely of\nisolated sentences clipped from floor debates and\nlegislative reports.\" 120 S. Ct. at 649. These\nsnippets use the word \"discrimination\" in a way\nthat fails to distinguish between rational\ndistinctions (which the Constitution allows) and\nirrational ones (which it forbids). The sort of\nfindings that would permit adoption of the ADA as\na precautionary measure, after the fashion of the\nVoting Rights Act, see South Carolina v.\nKatzenbach, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107182\"><a href=\"/opinion/107182/south-carolina-v-katzenbach/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">301</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966), must establish\nthat states have been able to disguise forbidden\ndiscrimination as the permissible kind. Nothing\nin the legislative findings, or the debates\npreceding the ADA’s adoption, shows (or even\nasserts) that state governments engaged in\ndeception that prevented victims of irrational\ndiscrimination from obtaining a remedy. Findings\nunderlying Title VII were more substantial, and\nbecause employers frequently disguised their\nresort to racial criteria it is easier to justify\nthe disparate-impact features of Title VII as\nremedial measures.

Bitzer. We leave that\nquestion for another day and hold only that the\nbackground of the ADA does not meet the standards\nthat Boerne and Kimel set for using sec.5 to\nenact prophylactic legislation.\n\n  From all of this it follows that the ADA does\nnot \"enforce\" the Fourteenth Amendment, and from\nSeminole Tribe it follows that the Eleventh\nAmendment and associated principles of sovereign\nimmunity block private litigation against states\nin federal court.

We must therefore\ndecide this case without the prospect of\nimmediate guidance from Washington. For the\nreasons I explain below, I conclude that Title I\nof the ADA falls within Congress’s section 5\npowers under the principles the Court has\narticulated.

XI), the Supreme\nCourt has held in a recent line of decisions that\nthe meaning of this part of the Constitution is\nnot limited to the precise words of the text.\nInstead, the Eleventh Amendment reflects the\nstructural fact that each state is a sovereign\nentity within the federal system, and as such,\neach state enjoys sovereign immunity from suit\nexcept insofar as its immunity has legitimately\nbeen curtailed.

Abrogation is constitutionally\npossible only in narrow circumstances. First,\nCongress must make its intent to abrogate\n\"unmistakably clear\" in the language of the\nstatute. See Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at 640 (citing\nDellmuth v.

Here, everyone\nagrees that the only source of congressional\npower at issue is section 5 of the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Cf. Florida Prepaid, 119 S.Ct. at\n2205.\n\n  In Kimel, the Court found that the ADEA\nsatisfied the \"clear statement\" requirement for\nabrogation. 120 S.Ct. at 640-42. The majority\nfinds, and I agree, that the same is true of the\nADA. Unlike the majority, however, I also\nconclude that Congress legitimately used its\npower under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment\nwhen it made the ADA applicable to the states.\n\n  As I have already noted, we know that Title VII\nrepresents a valid exercise of Congress’s section\n5 power to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment\nimmunity of the states, but the ADEA does not.\nThe Kimel Court made the latter finding because,\nfollowing City of Boerne, it concluded that the\nADEA was a measure that went beyond either\nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment or valid\nprophylactic measures designed to prevent\nviolations of the Constitution. See Kimel, 120\nS.Ct. at 645, 648-49. In Florida Prepaid, the\nCourt explained the difference between valid\nefforts to exercise section 5 powers and those\nthat go beyond the constitutional limits as\nfollows:\n\nWhile the line between measures that remedy or\nprevent unconstitutional actions and measures\nthat make a substantive change in the governing\nlaw is not easy to discern, and Congress must\nhave wide latitude in determining where it lies,\nthe distinction exists and must be observed.\nThere must be a congruence and proportionality\nbetween the injury to be prevented or remedied\n\fand the means adopted to that end.\n\n119 S.Ct. at 2205 (quoting from City of Boerne,\n521 U.S. at 519-20).\n\n  While the majority appears to concede that\nKimel should guide our decision with respect to\nthe ADA, its reading of Kimel overlooks important\nqualifications on that decision. The majority\nsees Kimel as a case holding that virtually all\ndiscrimination that is subject to rational basis\nreview for equal protection clause purposes is\noutside the scope of Congress’s section 5 powers.\nAnte, at 5. I find no hint of this in Kimel; to\nthe contrary, after recognizing that age\ndiscrimination is subject to rational basis\nreview, the Court took pains to analyze the ADEA\nin detail before finding that it cannot be\nsustained against the states as a valid exercise\nof the section 5 powers. That analysis would have\nbeen entirely beside the point if the mere fact\nof rational basis review was enough to decide the\ncase. Furthermore, the majority here, in\nrejecting the idea that the accommodation\nprovisions of the ADA could be sustained under\nsection 5 (ante at 7) ignores the express holding\nof Kimel that \"we have never held that section 5\nprecludes Congress from enacting reasonably\nprophylactic legislation.\" 120 S.Ct. at 648.\nLast, the majority appears to hold that virtually\nall antidiscrimination statutes that focus on\ndisparate impact, rather than intentional\ndisparate treatment, exceed Congress’s section 5\npowers. In so doing, it has created a square\nconflict with the Eleventh Circuit’s decision in\nEmployment Discrimination, supra, 198 F.3d at\n1324.\n\n  Kimel provides the analytical approach for\nassessing whether a statute addressing\ndiscrimination is a valid exercise of the section\n5 power. Looking at both the legislative record\nand the language of the pertinent statute, the\nKimel Court first asked whether the substantive\nrequirements of the statute were proportionate to\nany unconstitutional conduct that the statute\ncould have targeted. 120 S.Ct. at 645. It looked\nto earlier decisions that had considered the\nconstitutional implications of age discrimination\nand found it significant that all had upheld age\ndistinctions against constitutional challenges.\nSee Gregory v.

Finding neither element present, the\nCourt concluded that Congress did not in the ADEA\nvalidly abrogate the states’ sovereign immunity.\n\n  Following this roadmap, one can see that the\nADA differs critically from the ADEA in the areas\nthe Supreme Court deemed significant. The first\nquestion concerns the level of constitutional\nprotection the Supreme Court has recognized in\nprior cases for persons with disabilities. With\nthat standard in mind, the next question is\nwhether the ADA represents a proportionate\nresponse to the likelihood of constitutional\nviolations.\n\n  The leading case on the equal protection\ndimensions of disability discrimination is City\nof Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985). Although, as the majority\nobserves, the Court ultimately decided that\nrational basis review was proper for the\nordinance in that case, the majority finds the\nCourt’s reasoning to be irrelevant, ante at 6.\nThe majority also pays no heed to the fact that\nthe Court struck down the Cleburne ordinance\nbecause it unconstitutionally discriminated\nagainst the mentally retarded (clearly\nillustrating that legislation prohibiting\ndiscrimination with respect to a category that\nreceives rational basis review might indeed be\nenforcing the Constitution). I cannot dismiss\neither aspect of Cleburne so readily.\n\n  The specific question before the Court in\nCleburne was whether a local ordinance that\nrequired a special use permit for a home for the\nmentally retarded, but that imposed no such\nrequirement for many similar uses, violated the\nequal protection rights of the mentally disabled.\nThe Court held that mental retardation should not\nbe treated as a \"quasi-suspect classification\"\nfor equal protection purposes, but it\nnevertheless found that the ordinance failed\nrational basis scrutiny, because the permit\nrequirement \"rest[ed] on an irrational prejudice\nagainst the mentally retarded . . . .\" Cleburne,\n473 U.S. at 450./2 In coming to that conclusion,\nthe Court subjected the city’s proffered reasons\nin defense of the ordinance to careful scrutiny,\neven while it avoided introducing undue rigidity\ninto its analysis by using terms like \"suspect\"\nor \"quasi-suspect\" classifications--terms which\nthe Court later pointed out had sometimes given\nrise to the erroneous notion that scrutiny that\nwas strict in theory was often fatal in fact.

In contrast, Congress\nfound in the ADA that disabled persons have been\n\"subjected to a history of purposeful unequal\ntreatment,\" \"in such critical areas as\nemployment, housing, public accommodations,\neducation, transportation, communication,\nrecreation, institutionalization, health\nservices, voting, and access to public services.\"\n42 U.S.C. sec. 12101. Second, harking back to the\nwell known idea in United States v. Carolene\nProducts, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103017\"><a href=\"/opinion/103017/united-states-v-carolene-products-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 152-53 n.4 (1938), in no\nmeaningful sense of the term can the elderly be\nregarded as a \"discrete and insular minorit[y]\";\nto the contrary, as Kimel notes, \"all persons, if\nthey live out their normal life spans, will\nexperience [old age].\" 120 S.Ct. at 645. This is\na strong reason to believe that the normal\npolitical processes are adequate to protect the\ninterests of the elderly and that they will not\nbe singled out for unconstitutionally\ndiscriminatory treatment.\n\n  The disabled stand in a distinctly different\nposition. Not everyone is or will become\ndisabled. And the fact that some disabilities\narise later in life and some do not persist for\na lifetime does not make them the equivalent of\nthe inexorable aging process. The point is that\nCongress found that those who are disabled will\nsuffer during the time they are disabled from the\nsame invidious discrimination that has haunted\nracial minorities and women. The ADA reflects\nCongress’s finding that society has the ability\nto, and has historically, \"tended to isolate and\nsegregate individuals with disabilities.\" 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12101.\n\n  There are other reasons as well to conclude\nthat the ADA is a permissible exercise of\nCongress’s section 5 power. Apart from the\nsalient differences between age and disability as\nbases for categorization, the two statutes fare\nquite differently under the proportionality\nanalysis required by Boerne and Kimel. The broad\nsweep of the ADEA caused the Supreme Court to\nfind that it was not a proportional response to\nthe problem of age discrimination. The ADEA\n\fprohibits all employment discrimination on the\nbasis of age against persons in the protected\nclass (those above the age of 40). 29 U.S.C. sec.\n623(a)(1). The only tempering of this rule\nappears in the statutory rules allowing an\nemployer to justify age-based distinctions if it\nshows either a substantial basis for believing\nthat all or nearly all employees above a given\nage lack the qualifications required for the\nposition or that reliance on the age\nclassification is necessary because individual\ntesting for qualifications is highly impractical.\nKimel, 120 S.Ct. at 647 (citing Western Air Lines\nv. Criswell, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111474\"><a href=\"/opinion/111474/western-air-lines-inc-v-criswell/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 422 (1985)). The\nEEOC’s implementing regulations, as well as cases\ndecided under the ADEA, make it clear that these\nexceptions were intended to be narrow ones. See\n29 C.F.R. sec. 1625.6(a); see also Western Air\nLines, 472 U.S. at 422.\n\n  The ADA adopts a more nuanced approach to the\nproblem of disability discrimination. An employer\nis entitled to treat a disabled person\ndifferently--indeed, even to deny employment to\nthe person on that basis--if there are no\nreasonable accommodations that will permit the\nindividual to do the job and she cannot handle\nthe job without accommodations. 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12113.

Thus, while an\nemployer discriminating on the basis of age must\ndemonstrate that it would be \"highly impractical\"\nnot to do so, an employer making distinctions on\nthe basis of disability need only show that\n\"reasonable steps\" of accommodation, such as\nmodifying work schedules, training materials,\nfacilities, or policies, will not work. See 42\nU.S.C. sec.sec. 12113, 12111. The incorporation\nof a reasonableness standard in the duty to\naccommodate, which itself modifies the duty not\nto discriminate on the basis of disability, is\nessentially a legislative incorporation of the\nproportionality test required under the\nConstitution. It also illustrates, contrary to\nthe majority’s suggestion, that the duty to\naccommodate is not a command to give \"special\"\ntreatment; instead, it spells out the way that\ndiscrimination is to be avoided. I would\ntherefore find that the ADA meets the first part\nof the Kimel analysis.\n\n  The second question under Kimel requires us to\nconsider whether the legislative record reveals\neither a pattern of age discrimination committed\nby the states or \"any discrimination whatsoever\nthat [rises] to the level of constitutional\nviolation.\" 120 S.Ct. at 649. Here, although the\n\fevidence is stronger on the second point than the\nfirst, the record shows both kinds of disability\ndiscrimination.\n\n  With respect to the first question (i.e.\nlegislative findings pertaining specifically to\nstate behavior), the legislative record is\nadmittedly sparse. Nevertheless, the House Report\nnotes that \"inconsistent treatment of people with\ndisabilities by different state or local\ngovernment agencies is both inequitable and\nillogical.\" H.R. Rep. No. 101-485 (II). More\nimportantly, the express congressional findings\nwith respect to pervasive discrimination address\nmany areas that are controlled to a significant\ndegree by state and local governments. For\nexample, Congress identified discrimination in\neducation as a particular problem. See 42 U.S.C.\nsec. 12101(3). Education in this country is\noverwhelmingly an enterprise of state and local\ngovernment./3 Another sector singled out in the\nstatute was health services, see 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12101(3), in which state and local governments\nalso play a powerful role./4 The story is\nsimilar for transportation, which is also\nmentioned in sec. 12101(3)./5 Congress’s\nspecific attention to sectors with such a\nsubstantial state and local governmental presence\nindicates that it knew that government action at\nthe state level was an important part of the\nproblem it was addressing.\n\n  The other evidence the Kimel Court found\nlacking for the ADEA--a record of discrimination\nthat reveals constitutional violations--is\npresent in abundance for the ADA. It would be\nhard to imagine greater scrutiny than Congress\ngave to the harm caused by disability\ndiscrimination when it passed the ADA. Its\nfindings explain in painstaking detail the extent\nof the evil. See 42 U.S.C. sec. 12101./6 We give\ncongressional findings substantial deference,\nbecause Congress \"is far better equipped than the\njudiciary to amass and evaluate the vast amounts\nof data bearing upon legislative questions.\"\nTurner Broadcasting Systems v. F.C.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118097\"><a href=\"/opinion/118097/turner-broadcasting-system-inc-v-fcc/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 195 (1997). This is the legislative task the\nSupreme Court contemplated in Cleburne, where it\nheld that the way disabled people are \"to be\ntreated under the law is a difficult and often a\ntechnical matter, very much a task for\nlegislators guided by qualified professionals and\nnot by the perhaps ill-informed opinions of the\njudiciary.\" Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 442-43.\n\n  The ADA’s legislative findings distinguish the\nADA from both the ADEA and RFRA, the statute\nbefore the Court in City of Boerne. Like the ADEA\nand unlike the ADA, Congress did not make\nfindings in the RFRA about the seriousness or\n\fscope of discrimination against religious\npersons. See 42 U.S.C. sec.sec. 2000bb to\n2000bb-4. As I have already noted, in the ADEA\nCongress never identified \"any discrimination\nwhatsoever that rose to the level of\nconstitutional violation.\" Kimel, 120 S.Ct. at\n649. The only evidence the Kimel Court found\nshowing the harm at which the ADEA was aimed was\na few \"isolated sentences clipped from floor\ndebates and legislative reports.\" Id. When\nformulating the ADA, in contrast, Congress\ncompiled an immense legislative record. It\nexamined all this evidence and found that \"[t]he\nseverity and pervasiveness of discrimination\nagainst people with disabilities [was] well\ndocumented.\" H.R. 101-485 (II). This factor\ntherefore points toward a conclusion that the\nlegislative basis for a valid exercise of\nCongress’s section 5 powers is present for the\nADA, even though it was not for the ADEA or RFRA.\n\n  Before leaving this subject, it is important to\nnote that the majority has elevated a single\npoint in the legislative history to dispositive\nsignificance: the absence of a statement\nsomewhere to the effect that \"we are passing this\nlaw because we need to correct discrimination on\nthe basis of disability committed by the states.\"\nI see nothing in Kimel that gives such primacy to\nthis single point. Combining the explicit\ncoverage of sectors in which the states are the\nprincipal actors, with the deliberate decision of\nCongress to make the states subject to the\nstatute, and finally with the enormous\nlegislative record documenting the depth of the\nproblem of disability discrimination, I find the\nsecond part of the Kimel approach to be satisfied\nfor the ADA.\n\nII\n\n  Given its conclusion about the Eleventh\nAmendment, the majority does not reach the last\nquestion that was presented in this case, which\nwas whether the analysis that applies to an\nEleventh Amendment argument directed at the\ngeneral prohibition in the ADA against\ndiscrimination is different from the analysis\nappropriate to the accommodation provisions of\nthe Act. Because I would reject the general\nEleventh Amendment defense, I add a brief word on\nthis point. In my view, because the accommodation\nduty and the duty to avoid discrimination are\nnothing more than two sides of the same coin, the\nanswer is no.\n\n  The ADA defines discrimination to include \"not\nmaking reasonable accommodations to the known\nphysical or mental limitations of an otherwise\nqualified individual with a disability who is an\n\fapplicant or employee, unless . . . [the] covered\nentity can demonstrate that the accommodation\nwould impose an undue hardship on the operation\nof the business of such covered entity.\" 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12112(b)(5)(A). The Act also provides\nthat an employer may defend against a charge of\ndiscrimination by showing that its goals require\ndiscrimination--that they \"cannot be accomplished\nby reasonable accommodation.\" 42 U.S.C. sec.\n12113(a).\n\n  The University argues that this statutory\naccommodation process is unconstitutional under\nPrintz v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118148\"><a href=\"/opinion/118148/printz-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1997),\nbecause it violates the Tenth Amendment by\nforcing state officials to administer a federal\nregulatory scheme. In my view, however, the\nPrintz model has no bearing on the question\nbefore us. The flaws the Court identified in\nPrintz included the act of conscripting state\nofficials to administer a federal program, the\neffective reallocation of duties from the\nbranches of the federal government to which the\nConstitution assigned them to the state\nofficials, and the conferral of policy-making\nauthority on the state officials without adequate\nguidance. The Printz Court found that forcing the\nstate to implement this type of regulatory system\nviolated the principles of separation of powers\nand dual sovereignty. Id. at 922, 932, 930.\n\n  The ADA does not establish anything like the\nregulatory scheme for handguns at issue in\nPrintz. The ADA is instead a straightforward law\nprohibiting discrimination on the part of all\nemployers, private and governmental alike, and\ndefining the way the prohibition must be\nimplemented. It provides the employers with\nprecise definitions to follow: a reasonable\naccommodation is one tailored to the\ndiscrimination issue before the employer, which\ndoes not \"impose an undue hardship on the\noperation [of the employer’s business].\" 42\nU.S.C. sec. 12112(b)(5)(A). Unlike the regulatory\nsystem before the Printz Court, the ADA does not\nconfer any special powers on employers in general\nor on state employers in particular. Employers\nare not administering a federal benefit by\nproviding a reasonable accommodation; they are\nrefraining from discrimination and to some degree\ntaking preventative measures. There is no duty to\naccommodate that is separate from the general\nobligation to avoid discrimination against the\ndisabled.\n  It bears repeating that, for this purpose,\nstate employers stand in exactly the same\nposition as private employers. As this court held\nin Travis v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"760213\"><a href=\"/opinion/760213/david-m-travis-v-janet-reno-attorney-general-of-the-united-states-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1004-05 (7th\nCir. 1998), federal law may pervasively regulate\nstates as market participants; the anti-\n\fcommandeering law of Printz only comes into play\nwhen the federal government calls on the states\nto use their sovereign powers to implement a\nfederal regulatory program. In Travis, which came\nto the result later endorsed by the Supreme Court\nin Reno v. Condon, supra, we concluded that the\nDrivers Privacy Protection Act (DPPA) did not\nviolate the Tenth Amendment. The DPPA requires\ndisclosure of certain records by the state, and\nso necessarily forces the state to come up with\na system of determining which records should be\ndisclosed, as well as how best to disclose them.\nThe system was found constitutional because it\naffects states in their role as owners of\ndatabases, not in their role as governments.\nCondon, 120 S.Ct. at 672; Travis, 163 F.3d at\n1004.\n\n  Though the ADA forces the states to comply with\na federal regulation, it affects the states in\ntheir role as employers, not in their role as\ngovernments. Federal regulations of states acting\nas employers have been upheld in the past. In\nGarcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit\nAuthority, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111308\"><a href=\"/opinion/111308/garcia-v-san-antonio-metropolitan-transit-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">469</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">528</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1985), the Court held\nthat state employers may be forced to follow the\nfederal Fair Labor Standards Act’s wage and hour\nrules. Nothing in the recent line of Eleventh\nAmendment decisions undermines that rule. To the\ncontrary, in Alden v. Maine the Court went out of\nits way to reaffirm that \"[t]he constitutional\nprivilege of a State to assert its sovereign\nimmunity in its own courts does not confer upon\nthe State a concomitant right to disregard the\nConstitution or valid federal law.\" 119 S.Ct. at\n2266. Instead, the Court assumed that the states\nwould ordinarily live up to their duties under\nfederal law as a matter of good faith, and it\nnoted that enforcement of federal obligations by\nthe federal government remains permissible under\nthe constitutional design. Id. at 2267. The fact\nof dual sovereignty does not, therefore, carry\nwith it any implication that states are allowed\nto disregard or to frustrate valid federal\nprograms. See City of New York v. United States,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764671\"><a href=\"/opinion/764671/the-city-of-new-york-and-rudolph-giuliani-as-mayor-of-the-city-of-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">179</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35 (2d Cir. 1999).\n\n  By defining discrimination in part as not\nmaking reasonable accommodations to disabled\nemployees, the ADA does impose costs on\nemployers, including the states. Employers must\naffirmatively act to alter any practices they\nhave in place that discriminate against the\ndisabled. Of course, this makes a great deal of\nsense. Just because an employer has a\ndiscriminatory practice, such as maintaining\nsteep stairways or only offering breaks at wide\nintervals and therefore not allowing diabetics to\ntake their medication, does not mean that the\nemployer should be able to continue such a\n\fdiscriminatory practice without violating the\nADA, any more than an employer’s refusal in the\npast to construct a women’s restroom would\njustify a refusal to hire female employees. The\nADA allows an employer to adjust the workplace\nenvironment on a case-by-case basis, adopting\nonly those changes that are reasonably necessary\nto refrain from discriminating against the\ndisabled individual or individuals in question.\n\n  The ADA hardly broke new ground when it\nincorporated this type of affirmative duty. The\nEqual Protection Clause often requires states to\ntake affirmative measures to eliminate or prevent\ndiscriminatory systems. For example, states with\nracially discriminatory reapportionment plans\nmust redraw their congressional districts. See,\ne.g., Shaw v. Reno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112905\"><a href=\"/opinion/112905/shaw-v-reno/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">630</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 652 (1993)\n(holding that the state’s reapportionment plan\nmight violate the Equal Protection Clause). The\nlogic of the University’s argument here would, if\ntaken to its limits, call into question every\naffirmative injunction a court has ever entered\nto prevent threatened future violations of the\nconstitutional guarantee of equal protection of\nthe laws. Nothing in the Supreme Court decisions\non which the University relies even hints at such\na radical result. Similarly, the First Amendment\nguarantee of the right of free exercise of\nreligion carries with it an implied duty on the\npart of the state to make reasonable adjustments.\nSee, e.g., Sherbert v.

It found from this\nthat the disparate impact provisions of Title VII\n\fare preventive rules that have the necessary\ncongruence between the means used and the\nconstitutional violation to be addressed\n(intentional discrimination). Id. at 1322.\nNothing in Kimel comes close to suggesting that\nthe Court was overruling this long line of its\nown authority, upon which the Eleventh Circuit\ncarefully relied, and I am not prepared to take\nthat step in the present case.\n\n  For all these reasons, I therefore respectfully\ndissent from the majority’s conclusion that the\nEleventh Amendment bars Erickson’s suit against\nNortheastern University.\n\n\n\n\n/1 The extent of the protection from suit that\nresults from a finding of sovereign immunity is\nalso an important question, because, at least in\ncertain contexts, sovereign immunity is qualified\nrather than absolute. See, e.g., the Foreign\nSovereign Immunities Act, 28 U.S.C. sec.sec.\n1602, 1605. Despite the exchange between the\nmajority and dissenters in College Savings Bank\nv.

See Reno v. Condon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118327\"><a href=\"/opinion/118327/reno-v-condon/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Deep Sea Research, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118199\"><a href=\"/opinion/118199/california-v-deep-sea-research-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 506-07 (1998) (finding that, in\ndetermining whether sovereign immunity applies to\nstates, the Court looks at whether sovereign\nimmunity would apply to the federal government,\nbecause \"this Court has recognized a correlation\nbetween sovereign immunity principles applicable\nto States and the Federal government,\" and at\nwhether sovereign immunity would apply to a\nforeign government). Although I recognize that\nthe Supreme Court may ultimately have more to say\non the subject, I am assuming here, consistently\nwith College Savings and Kimel, that the\ncommercial character of the operation of a state\nuniversity system is not enough to qualify the\nstate’s Eleventh Amendment immunity.\n\n/2 This implies a more exacting test for rationality\nthan the majority finds in Cleburne, ante at 6-7.\nThe majority goes on to advance the astonishing\npropositions that it would be rational for a\nuniversity to conclude that anyone not in the top\n1% of the population is not apt to be a good\n\fteacher and scholar, or that it would be rational\nto refuse to hire a blind professor because she\ncould not master material as fast as her sighted\ncolleagues. Such a view flies in the face of\nevidence about the accomplishments of the\nvisually impaired; it assumes rationality in the\nprocess of choosing who exactly falls within the\ntop 1% of the population; and it illustrates\nexactly the kind of stereotyped thinking that the\nADA was designed to combat.\n\n/3 A 1995 study by the Department of Education\nshowed that 90% of elementary and secondary\neducation in the United States is public--only\n10% of students are enrolled in private schools.\nSee <http://www.ed.gov>.\n\n/4 Together, state and local   governments were\nresponsible for 12.7% of the   United States’\nhealth expenditures in 1998,   while private\nindividuals and corporations   were responsible for\nonly 54% of those costs. See\n<http://www.hcfa.gov>.\n\n/5 Government as a whole paid about 50% of\ntransportation costs in the United States in\n1996, with state and local governments covering\nabout 60% of those costs, or 34.5% of the total.\nSee <http://www.bts.gov>.\n\n/6 Congress found that:\n(1) some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more\nphysical or mental disabilities, and this number\nis increasing as the population as a whole is\ngrowing older;\n(2) historically, society has tended to isolate\nand segregate individuals with disabilities, and,\ndespite some improvements, such forms of\ndiscrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities continue to be a serious and\npervasive social problem;\n(3) discrimination against individuals with\ndisabilities persists in such critical areas as\nemployment, housing, public accommodations,\neducation, transportation, communication,\nrecreation, institutionalization, health\nservices, voting, and access to public services;\n(4) unlike individuals who have experienced\ndiscrimination on the basis of race, color, sex,\nnational origin, religion, or age, individuals\nwho have experienced discrimination on the basis\nof disability have often had no legal recourse to\nredress such discrimination;\n(5) individuals with disabilities continually\nencounter various forms of discrimination,\nincluding outright intentional exclusion, the\ndiscriminatory effects of architectural,\ntransportation, and communication barriers,\noverprotective rules and policies, failure to\nmake modifications to existing facilities and\n\fpractices, exclusionary qualification standards\nand criteria, segregation, and relegation to\nlesser services, programs, activities, benefits,\njobs, or other opportunities;\n(6) census data, national polls, and other\nstudies have documented that people with\ndisabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior\nstatus in our society, and are severely\ndisadvantaged socially, vocationally,\neconomically, and educationally;\n(7) individuals with disabilities are a discrete\nand insular minority who have been faced with\nrestrictions and limitations, subjected to a\nhistory of purposeful unequal treatment, and\nrelegated to a position of political\npowerlessness in our society, based on\ncharacteristics that are beyond the control of\nsuch individuals and resulting from stereotypic\nassumptions not truly indicative of the\nindividual ability of such individuals to\nparticipate in, and contribute to, society;\n(8) the Nation’s proper goals regarding\nindividuals with disabilities are to assure\nequality of opportunity, full participation,\nindependent living, and economic self-sufficiency\nfor such individuals, and\n(9) the continuing existence of unfair and\nunnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies\npeople with disabilities the opportunity to\ncompete on an equal basis and to pursue those\nopportunities for which our free society is\njustifiably famous, and costs the United States\nbillions of dollars in unnecessary expenses\nresulting from dependency and nonproductivity.\n\n42 U.S.C. sec. 12101.\n\f</pre>",
