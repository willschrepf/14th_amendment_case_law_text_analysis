(the “Trustee”).\n\nWe affirm.\n\n       This matter concerns a trust (the “Trust”)2 created under the October\n\n1, 1971 will of Joseph L. Grahek, deceased. The Trust’s asset was income-\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n    See Pa. O.C. Rule 2.9.\n2\n  There are two trusts at issue in this litigation. The parties reference them\nas Trust A and Trust B. For purposes of this memorandum, we shall refer to\nboth as the Trust.\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\fJ-A03018-17\n\n\nproducing property (the “Property”) located in Orange County, California.3\n\nMarion Grahek (“Mrs. Grahek”), the decedent’s wife was the Trust’s income\n\nbeneficiary during her lifetime.          Appellants David J. Grahek and Philip L.\n\nGrahek were remainder beneficiaries.4             The Trust produced $200,000 to\n\n$300,000 per year in income for Mrs. Grahek.\n\n       On August 28, 2006, the Trust sold the Property because it was under\n\nthreat of eminent domain from the Orange County School District.              The\n\nTrustee planned to reinvest the sale proceeds—$8.7 million5—in like-kind\n\nproperty in order to avoid the capital gains tax. Section 1033 of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code permits conversion of property without recognition of a\n\ncapital gain if the property in question is under threat of eminent domain.\n\n26 U.S.C.A. § 1033.         In this case, a qualifying 1033 exchange needed to\n\noccur before the end of 2009.\n\n\n\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\n\n3\n We culled our summary of facts from the orphans’ court’s March 11, 2016\nmemorandum.\n4\n   Mrs. Grahek died on October 16, 2013. Appellants Kathleen G. Connal,\nJames V. A. Grahek and Steven P. Grahek did not participate in this litigation\nand were never listed in the caption until the notice of appeal. Opinion Sur\nAppeal, 6/2/2016, at 1 n.2. The orphans’ court questioned the standing of\nthese parties. Id. Neither side briefed the issue, and we have no need to\naddress it.\n5\n    The net gain on the sale was $8.2 million.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fJ-A03018-17\n\n\n       The Trustee invested roughly $2.1 million of the sale proceeds in\n\nmoney market accounts.           That amount would eventually cover the down\n\npayment on a replacement property or the capital gains tax.          The Trustee\n\nintended to obtain nonrecourse financing for the remainder of the purchase\n\nprice of a replacement property. The Trustee planned to find a replacement\n\nproperty that would produce sufficient income to cover the mortgage. The\n\nTrustee invested the remainder of the Property sale proceeds, roughly $6.5\n\nmillion, in a stock portfolio. The Trustee believed its strategy would continue\n\nto produce income for Mrs. Grahek and increase the principal value for the\n\nremainder beneficiaries. Appellants agreed with the Trustee’s plan.\n\n       During the financial crisis of 2008, nonrecourse financing became\n\ntemporarily unavailable and the Trust’s investment portfolio lost some of its\n\nvalue. Dissatisfied with the situation, Appellants David J. Grahek and Philip\n\nL. Grahek petitioned to remove Wells Fargo as trustee.            By agreement,\n\nDavid and Philip Grahek accepted appointments as trustees pro tem.             In\n\n2009, under their direction, the Trust purchased properties in Chattanooga\n\nTennessee and Canton, Georgia.            The Trust did not have to pay a capital\n\ngains tax.\n\n       On October 29, 2010, Appellants filed a petition to compel the filing of\n\nan account.6       The Trustee filed its first account on January 14, 2011.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6\n    See 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 7797.\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-A03018-17\n\n\nAppellants filed objections to the account on March 1, 2011.        The Trustee\n\nfiled a motion for judgment on the pleadings on June 1, 2011. The orphans’\n\ncourt denied that motion on January 23, 2012.          The parties filed a joint\n\nstipulation of facts on March 26, 2015. Appellants filed amended objections\n\ntwo days later. The orphans’ court conducted four days of hearings, the last\n\nof which occurred on April 10, 2015. The orphans’ court entered the order\n\non appeal on March 11, 2016. Appellants filed this timely appeal on April 8,\n\n2016.\n\n        Appellants state the questions involved as follows:\n\n        1. Did the orphans’ court err as a matter of law in concluding\n           that the five-year investment horizon pursued by [the\n           Trustee] satisfied the requirements of the prudent investor\n           rule when [the Trustee] acknowledged that the maximum\n           investment horizon was only three years and four months,\n           and [the Trustee] was notified six months before the market\n           crashed that 100% of the assets would be needed to\n           complete the 1033 exchange?\n\n        2. Did the orphans’ court err as a matter of law in approving\n           [the Trustee’s] compensation in light of its breach of fiduciary\n           duty?\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 4.7\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n7\n    The orphans’ court, in its June 2, 2016 opinion sur appeal, notes that\nAppellants’ questions presented differ in certain details from the issues they\nraised in their objections to the account. Likewise, Appellee asserts that\nAppellants have waived their arguments on appeal because they never\nraised them at trial (a violation of Pa.R.A.P. 302(a)), or because they are not\nincluded in Appellants’ concise statement of errors (resulting in waiver under\nPa.R.A.P. (b)(4)(vii)). As set forth in the main text, we conclude that the\ntrial court’s March 11, 2016 opinion provides a sufficient basis for this\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-A03018-17\n\n\n      The following standard governs our review:\n\n             When reviewing a decree entered by the Orphans’ Court,\n      this Court must determine whether the record is free from legal\n      error and the court’s factual findings are supported by the\n      evidence. Because the Orphans’ Court sits as the fact-finder, it\n      determines the credibility of the witnesses and, on review, we\n      will not reverse its credibility determinations absent an abuse of\n      that discretion. However, we are not constrained to give the\n      same deference to any resulting legal conclusions. Where the\n      rules of law on which the court relied are palpably wrong or\n      clearly inapplicable, we will reverse the court’s decree.\n\nIn re Estate of Fuller, 87 A.3d 330, 333 (Pa. Super. 2014). Further, we\n\nare cognizant that “one who seeks to surcharge a trustee bears the burden\n\nof proving that the trustee breached an applicable fiduciary duty.”        In re\n\nDentler Family Trust, 873 A.2d 738, 745 (Pa. Super. 2005), appeal\n\ndenied, 897 A.2d 1184 (Pa. 2006).\n\n      Instantly, the orphans’ court found no breach of fiduciary duty.\n\nRather, the orphans’ court found that the Trustee met its legal obligations;\n\nthat the Trustee’s plan sufficiently provided for the interests of the income\n\nand remainder beneficiaries; and that a financial crisis of historic proportions\n\nwas unforeseeable.         Having reviewed the record, the parties’ briefs, the\n\napplicable law, and the orphans’ court’s opinion, we adopt the orphans’\n\ncourt’s March 11, 2016 opinion as our own. The orphans’ court’s thoroughly\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\nCourt’s review and an accurate analysis of the substance of Appellants’\nobjections to the account and arguments on appeal.          To the extent\nAppellants intended to raise any issues not addressed in the trial court’s\nMarch 11, 2016 opinion and/or not previously preserved in accordance with\nthe Rules of Appellate Procedure, we deem such issues waived.\n\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fJ-A03018-17\n\n\nand accurately explains the lack of merit in each of Appellants’ objections to\n\nthe Trustee’s account.

Objectors, time and time again, dismiss the duty of the Trustee· to the income\n\nbeneficiary, their own mother.\n\n        This case i$ plagued by two significaht issues-that the Court finds persuasive: 1'fame1y,\n\nthe Trusts in.question served two masters.and the Objectors have the favor of'hindsight, The\n\nTrusts were charged with providing Mrs, Grahek-Atklnson with income; The income generated\n\nduring the time the TrustAssets    wereinvested   in the Placentia Property consisted\n                                                                             .    . . . of. the rental\n                                                                                                   .\n\n\n\nincome of approximately $200,000· $300,000. This was the amount of'mcney'Mrs. Grahek-\n\nAtkinson had received prior to the sale of the Placentia Property and it was. reasenable for. the\n\nTrustee maintain a> stmilar distribution scheme for Mrs. .Grahek-Atkinson during the period ·ot\n\ntime they were seeking·41033 pro;Pe.rty and managing the pro·cee~$ofthe Placeriti.ti Property\n\nsale.

Grahek..Atkiiisoh, Trustees had.a\n\nduty to preserve and growthis principal for the residual beneficiaries.\n\n        The second factor of great significance is the gift of hindsight, Hindsight is 11otonly an\n\nindependent issue but it'interplays with. the Trust serving two masters. The stock market\n\nunexpectedly fellsignificantly    in 2008. Seeing this dramatic decrease in value play out with the\n\nassets ofthe Trust make Objectors quickly jump to the conclusion that the Trustees failed to keep\n\nthe assets safe. With hindsight, they identify what they believe should have been done with the\n\nassets. But their assertions fail to give appropriate weight to the necessity to provide income to\n\nMrs. Grahek-Atkinson.     Objectors would have you believe that all assets should have been kept\n\nin cash and that if Mrs. Grahek-Atkinson    needed more funds than the income generated by\n\nholding money in cash or cash equivalent, principal could have been invaded to provide for her\n\n\n                                                   14\n\fneeds. However, invasion of the principal would have been detrimental to the residual.\n\nbeneficiaries and a breach of the Trustee's fiduciary duty to them ..\n\n       The Court finds that the Trustee fulfilled its fiduciary-duty to the Trusts from the time the\n\nPlacentia Property was sold until the Trustees Pro Temtook over administration of'the Trusts'.\n\nA review of the .choices made by the Trustee and thetestimony of their employees demonstrates\n\nthat the Trustee complied   with the Prudent Investor   Rufo.\n       Atthe time the Placentia Property was sold,Trustee. intertded: to. complete. a J .b:33\nexchange.

However, by agreement, Trustee was replaced.and not one, but two\n\nproperties were purchased by the 1.033 exchange deadline. The choice of properties and\n\nfinancing rested solely with Trustees Pro Tern. Trustees Pro Tern were able to buy two\n\nproperties worth more than the Placentia Property.were able to secure non-recourse financing\n\nand avoided capital gains taxes.\n\n        Furthermore, it is apparent that hindsight guides the argument of Objectors. Initially, the\n\n\n                                                    17\n\fgoalof trustee had been to utilize the·$2 million set aside-for capital gains .taxes as.a cash.\n\ncontribution   to the   purchase ofa replacementproperty.

Such inclusion appears to have been.done.as a courtesy to long-standing\n\nclients. the Objectors started the 1033 exchange process with the expectation thatthey would\n\nsee returns outlined above.\n\n       However, due to the sudden and unexpected collapse of the stock market in 2008, these\n\nanticipated returns did not come to fruition during the Trustee's term, Objectors, in hindsight\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fand only after the catastrophic declinein the-financial markets.in 2008, sought to find a failure.in\n\nthe investment strategydeveloped by Trustee: The.sudden.historic decline in th¢ stock market\n\nand n.o.t theactions ofthe Trustee, resulted in the loss ta portfolio value of'these trusts, The fact\n\nthat the market Collapsed withthe resulting decline in the. portfolio values in the Trusts, does not\n\nestablish that the Trustee breached its fidi.lciary:duty-to Mrs. Grahek-Atkinson.orto .the residual\n\nb:enetldaries;.

Grahek, Philip L. Grahek, Kathleen G. Connal,\n\nJames V.A. Grahek, and Steven P. Grahek, appeal from the March 11, 2016\n\norder adjudicating the account1 of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. (the “Trustee”).\n\nWe affirm.\n\n       This matter concerns a trust (the “Trust”)2 created under the October\n\n1, 1971 will of Joseph L. Grahek, deceased. The Trust’s asset was income-\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n1\n    See Pa. O.C. Rule 2.9.\n2\n  There are two trusts at issue in this litigation. The parties reference them\nas Trust A and Trust B. For purposes of this memorandum, we shall refer to\nboth as the Trust.\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\fJ-A03018-17\n\n\nproducing property (the “Property”) located in Orange County, California.3\n\nMarion Grahek (“Mrs. Grahek”), the decedent’s wife was the Trust’s income\n\nbeneficiary during her lifetime.          Appellants David J. Grahek and Philip L.\n\nGrahek were remainder beneficiaries.4             The Trust produced $200,000 to\n\n$300,000 per year in income for Mrs. Grahek.\n\n       On August 28, 2006, the Trust sold the Property because it was under\n\nthreat of eminent domain from the Orange County School District.              The\n\nTrustee planned to reinvest the sale proceeds—$8.7 million5—in like-kind\n\nproperty in order to avoid the capital gains tax. Section 1033 of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code permits conversion of property without recognition of a\n\ncapital gain if the property in question is under threat of eminent domain.\n\n26 U.S.C.A. § 1033.         In this case, a qualifying 1033 exchange needed to\n\noccur before the end of 2009.\n\n\n\n                       _______________________\n(Footnote Continued)\n\n\n3\n We culled our summary of facts from the orphans’ court’s March 11, 2016\nmemorandum.\n4\n   Mrs. Grahek died on October 16, 2013. Appellants Kathleen G. Connal,\nJames V. A. Grahek and Steven P. Grahek did not participate in this litigation\nand were never listed in the caption until the notice of appeal. Opinion Sur\nAppeal, 6/2/2016, at 1 n.2. The orphans’ court questioned the standing of\nthese parties. Id. Neither side briefed the issue, and we have no need to\naddress it.\n5\n    The net gain on the sale was $8.2 million.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fJ-A03018-17\n\n\n       The Trustee invested roughly $2.1 million of the sale proceeds in\n\nmoney market accounts.           That amount would eventually cover the down\n\npayment on a replacement property or the capital gains tax.          The Trustee\n\nintended to obtain nonrecourse financing for the remainder of the purchase\n\nprice of a replacement property. The Trustee planned to find a replacement\n\nproperty that would produce sufficient income to cover the mortgage. The\n\nTrustee invested the remainder of the Property sale proceeds, roughly $6.5\n\nmillion, in a stock portfolio. The Trustee believed its strategy would continue\n\nto produce income for Mrs. Grahek and increase the principal value for the\n\nremainder beneficiaries. Appellants agreed with the Trustee’s plan.\n\n       During the financial crisis of 2008, nonrecourse financing became\n\ntemporarily unavailable and the Trust’s investment portfolio lost some of its\n\nvalue. Dissatisfied with the situation, Appellants David J. Grahek and Philip\n\nL. Grahek petitioned to remove Wells Fargo as trustee.            By agreement,\n\nDavid and Philip Grahek accepted appointments as trustees pro tem.             In\n\n2009, under their direction, the Trust purchased properties in Chattanooga\n\nTennessee and Canton, Georgia.            The Trust did not have to pay a capital\n\ngains tax.\n\n       On October 29, 2010, Appellants filed a petition to compel the filing of\n\nan account.6       The Trustee filed its first account on January 14, 2011.\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n6\n    See 20 Pa.C.S.A. § 7797.\n\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fJ-A03018-17\n\n\nAppellants filed objections to the account on March 1, 2011.        The Trustee\n\nfiled a motion for judgment on the pleadings on June 1, 2011. The orphans’\n\ncourt denied that motion on January 23, 2012.          The parties filed a joint\n\nstipulation of facts on March 26, 2015. Appellants filed amended objections\n\ntwo days later. The orphans’ court conducted four days of hearings, the last\n\nof which occurred on April 10, 2015. The orphans’ court entered the order\n\non appeal on March 11, 2016. Appellants filed this timely appeal on April 8,\n\n2016.\n\n        Appellants state the questions involved as follows:\n\n        1. Did the orphans’ court err as a matter of law in concluding\n           that the five-year investment horizon pursued by [the\n           Trustee] satisfied the requirements of the prudent investor\n           rule when [the Trustee] acknowledged that the maximum\n           investment horizon was only three years and four months,\n           and [the Trustee] was notified six months before the market\n           crashed that 100% of the assets would be needed to\n           complete the 1033 exchange?\n\n        2. Did the orphans’ court err as a matter of law in approving\n           [the Trustee’s] compensation in light of its breach of fiduciary\n           duty?\n\nAppellants’ Brief at 4.7\n\n____________________________________________\n\n\n7\n    The orphans’ court, in its June 2, 2016 opinion sur appeal, notes that\nAppellants’ questions presented differ in certain details from the issues they\nraised in their objections to the account. Likewise, Appellee asserts that\nAppellants have waived their arguments on appeal because they never\nraised them at trial (a violation of Pa.R.A.P. 302(a)), or because they are not\nincluded in Appellants’ concise statement of errors (resulting in waiver under\nPa.R.A.P. (b)(4)(vii)). As set forth in the main text, we conclude that the\ntrial court’s March 11, 2016 opinion provides a sufficient basis for this\n(Footnote Continued Next Page)\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fJ-A03018-17\n\n\n      The following standard governs our review:\n\n             When reviewing a decree entered by the Orphans’ Court,\n      this Court must determine whether the record is free from legal\n      error and the court’s factual findings are supported by the\n      evidence. Because the Orphans’ Court sits as the fact-finder, it\n      determines the credibility of the witnesses and, on review, we\n      will not reverse its credibility determinations absent an abuse of\n      that discretion. However, we are not constrained to give the\n      same deference to any resulting legal conclusions. Where the\n      rules of law on which the court relied are palpably wrong or\n      clearly inapplicable, we will reverse the court’s decree.\n\nIn re Estate of Fuller, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">330</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (Pa. Super. 2014). Further, we\n\nare cognizant that “one who seeks to surcharge a trustee bears the burden\n\nof proving that the trustee breached an applicable fiduciary duty.”        In re\n\nDentler Family Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1903223\"><a href=\"/opinion/1903223/in-re-dentler-family-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 745 (Pa.

Having reviewed the record, the parties’ briefs, the\n\napplicable law, and the orphans’ court’s opinion, we adopt the orphans’\n\ncourt’s March 11, 2016 opinion as our own.

From the plain language of the Trusts, it\n\nis also apparent that Settler-intended to ensure his wife, Mrs. Grahek-Atkinson was cared for\n\nduring her life and that the assets of the Trust be safeguarded forthe residual beneficiaries.'\n\n        Objectors approach the management of the Trusts from Jhe fundamental starting point\n\nthat \"it was. clear that the.most-important consideration in the management of the Placentia sale\nproceeds was to keep the assets liquid, that.is, to maintain the ability to convert them to cash\n\nwithout loss of principal.as therewas at the timeno.direneed to generate.income or growth.\"\n\nObjectors brief, pg. 42. The Court is not persuaded that the starting polnt was the need to keep\n\n\n       3 The Court also notes. that Settler intended for the Trusts to be administered by a\ncorporate entity. It would seem that allowing the two sons of the Settler to serve as Trustees Pro\nTern is more afield from the intent of Settlor than any of the investment strategies employed by\nTrustee.\n\n                                                   13\n\fthe assets liquid. Objectors, time and time again, dismiss the duty of the Trustee· to the income\n\nbeneficiary, their own mother.\n\n        This case i$ plagued by two significaht issues-that the Court finds persuasive: 1'fame1y,\n\nthe Trusts in.question served two masters.and the Objectors have the favor of'hindsight, The\n\nTrusts were charged with providing Mrs, Grahek-Atklnson with income; The income generated\n\nduring the time the TrustAssets    wereinvested   in the Placentia Property consisted\n                                                                             .    . . . of. the rental\n                                                                                                   .\n\n\n\nincome of approximately $200,000· $300,000. This was the amount of'mcney'Mrs. Grahek-\n\nAtkinson had received prior to the sale of the Placentia Property and it was. reasenable for. the\n\nTrustee maintain a> stmilar distribution scheme for Mrs. .Grahek-Atkinson during the period ·ot\n\ntime they were seeking·41033 pro;Pe.rty and managing the pro·cee~$ofthe Placeriti.ti Property\n\nsale.

Grahek..Atkiiisoh, Trustees had.a\n\nduty to preserve and growthis principal for the residual beneficiaries.\n\n        The second factor of great significance is the gift of hindsight, Hindsight is 11otonly an\n\nindependent issue but it'interplays with. the Trust serving two masters. The stock market\n\nunexpectedly fellsignificantly    in 2008. Seeing this dramatic decrease in value play out with the\n\nassets ofthe Trust make Objectors quickly jump to the conclusion that the Trustees failed to keep\n\nthe assets safe. With hindsight, they identify what they believe should have been done with the\n\nassets. But their assertions fail to give appropriate weight to the necessity to provide income to\n\nMrs. Grahek-Atkinson.     Objectors would have you believe that all assets should have been kept\n\nin cash and that if Mrs. Grahek-Atkinson    needed more funds than the income generated by\n\nholding money in cash or cash equivalent, principal could have been invaded to provide for her\n\n\n                                                   14\n\fneeds. However, invasion of the principal would have been detrimental to the residual.\n\nbeneficiaries and a breach of the Trustee's fiduciary duty to them ..\n\n       The Court finds that the Trustee fulfilled its fiduciary-duty to the Trusts from the time the\n\nPlacentia Property was sold until the Trustees Pro Temtook over administration of'the Trusts'.\n\nA review of the .choices made by the Trustee and thetestimony of their employees demonstrates\n\nthat the Trustee complied   with the Prudent Investor   Rufo.\n       Atthe time the Placentia Property was sold,Trustee. intertded: to. complete. a J .b:33\nexchange.

However, by agreement, Trustee was replaced.and not one, but two\n\nproperties were purchased by the 1.033 exchange deadline. The choice of properties and\n\nfinancing rested solely with Trustees Pro Tern. Trustees Pro Tern were able to buy two\n\nproperties worth more than the Placentia Property.were able to secure non-recourse financing\n\nand avoided capital gains taxes.\n\n        Furthermore, it is apparent that hindsight guides the argument of Objectors. Initially, the\n\n\n                                                    17\n\fgoalof trustee had been to utilize the·$2 million set aside-for capital gains .taxes as.a cash.\n\ncontribution   to the   purchase ofa replacementproperty.

Such inclusion appears to have been.done.as a courtesy to long-standing\n\nclients. the Objectors started the 1033 exchange process with the expectation thatthey would\n\nsee returns outlined above.\n\n       However, due to the sudden and unexpected collapse of the stock market in 2008, these\n\nanticipated returns did not come to fruition during the Trustee's term, Objectors, in hindsight\n\n\n                                                   18\n\fand only after the catastrophic declinein the-financial markets.in 2008, sought to find a failure.in\n\nthe investment strategydeveloped by Trustee: The.sudden.historic decline in th¢ stock market\n\nand n.o.t theactions ofthe Trustee, resulted in the loss ta portfolio value of'these trusts, The fact\n\nthat the market Collapsed withthe resulting decline in the. portfolio values in the Trusts, does not\n\nestablish that the Trustee breached its fidi.lciary:duty-to Mrs. Grahek-Atkinson.orto .the residual\n\nb:enetldaries;.
