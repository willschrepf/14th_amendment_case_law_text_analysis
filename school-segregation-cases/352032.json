(Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)1 LPA challenged the City of\nNewport Beach’s (City) approval of a lot merger application filed by owners of two\nadjoining lots, the John Guida Trust and the Julie Guida Trust (the Guidas), who have\ndemolished the original houses and intend to build a single home on the newly merged\nlot. LPA raise numerous contentions including the City failed to comply with CEQA, the\nCity’s Coastal Land Use Plan adopted pursuant to the California Coastal Act (§ 30000\net seq., the Coastal Act), and its lot merger ordinance contained in the Newport Beach\nMunicipal Code (the Municipal Code). We reject LPA’s arguments and affirm the\njudgment.\n                               FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n              The Guidas own two adjoining lots in the City’s Corona Del Mar\ncommunity on Ocean Boulevard across the street from Lookout Point and Little Corona\nBeach.2 The lot located at 2808 Ocean Boulevard was 7,217 square feet in size and\n40 feet wide (at its widest point). The lot located at 2812 Ocean Boulevard was\n6,483 square feet in size and also 40 feet wide. When the Guidas bought the two lots\neach was developed with a one-story house under 1,500 square feet in size. The Guidas\nplanned on demolishing the existing houses, merging the two lots, and building a new\nhouse.\n\n1             All statutory references are to the Public Resources Code, unless otherwise\nindicated. The CEQA implementing guidelines appear at California Code of\nRegulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq., and will be referred to as the “Guidelines.”\n\n2              Throughout the record the lot merger is referred to as the merger of two lots\nwith two separate addresses. The legal description actually encompasses portions of\nthree lots bearing two separate assessor’s parcel numbers, but we will continue to refer to\nthe merger as encompassing the two lots.\n\n                                             2\n\f               The City’s general plan designates the subject property as single-unit\nresidential detached (RS-D) and its zoning ordinance designates the subject property as\nsingle-unit residential (R-1). Development standards for the R-1 zone require interior\nlots be a minimum of 5,000 square feet and a minimum of 60 feet wide by 80 feet deep.\nThe zoning ordinance sets a density/intensity limit of one single-unit detached dwelling\nfor each legal lot.\n               Because the subject property is located in a coastal zone, it is also subject to\nthe City’s Coastal Land Use Plan (CLUP), adopted pursuant to the Coastal Act. The\nresidential neighborhood where the subject property is located (old Corona del Mar) is\nidentified in the CLUP as being in the single-unit residential detached “B” category\n(RSD-B). The CLUP describes RSD-B residential neighborhoods as having a\n“density/intensity” range (“[t]he RSD category applies to a range of detached\nsingle-family residential dwelling units on a single legal lot . . . .”) of 6.0 to 9.9 dwelling\nunits per acre [DU/AC]. The property is also subject to private deed restrictions\nconcerning the height of structures on the property.\n               Additionally, coastal zone developments often have permit requirements\nfrom both the local agency and the California Coastal Commission (the Commission).\nBut the Commission’s Categorical Exclusion Order E-77-5 (Newport Beach) (hereafter\nCEO-E-77-5), excludes from the Commission’s permit requirement the demolition and\nconstruction of single-family homes that meet certain development standards. When\nutilizing the categorical exclusion, the City must give five days’ written notice to the\nCommission that it has approved a development that conforms to CEO-E-77-5.\nThe Zoning Administrator Approves the Lot Merger\n               On July 7, 2011, the Guidas applied to the City to have the two lots merged\ninto a single lot. As merged, the new lot would be approximately 13,700 square feet,\napproximately 74 feet wide at the front on Ocean Boulevard, 80 feet wide at the back,\nand 180 feet deep.\n\n                                               3\n\f              A public hearing on the proposed lot merger was held before the City’s\nZoning Administrator on September 14, 2011. Several neighbors opposed the\napplication, largely voicing concerns the merger would result in an over-large lot, and\nallow the Guidas to construct a house that would violate the private deed restrictions and\ndamage views from neighboring properties. The Zoning Administrator observed the\npending application was strictly for the lot merger, and the application had nothing to do\nwith the design of the proposed house. The Zoning Administrator also observed that\nwhile the new lot would be large, there were many other similarly sized lots in the area.\nHe specifically observed there was one property about five blocks away that involved the\nmerger of four lots into one.\n              The Zoning Administrator approved the lot merger. His written findings\nincluded that the merger qualified for a class 5 categorical exemption from environmental\nreview under CEQA because it involved minor alterations in land use limitations; the lots\nas merged would comply with the zoning ordinance because it would meet the minimum\nlot width and area standard, it would comply with the general plan because it would\nprovide for a single-family residence, and it was within the 6.0-9.9 dwelling units per\nacre density range described by the CLUP. He found the new lot would be consistent\nwith other nearby lots and would not result in an excessively large lot compared to many\nother existing lots in the area.\n              On September 23, 2011, the Guidas’ neighbors appealed the Zoning\nAdministrator’s approval of the lot merger application to the City’s Planning\nCommission. The stated reasons for the appeal were that the lot merger would allow the\nGuidas to violate the current deed restrictions by building a building that was too tall, and\nwould damage their properties by loss of their views.\nDemolition Permits are Issued\n              The Guidas had also applied for demolition permits to tear down the\nexisting structures on the two lots. On September 27, 2011, the City issued its\n\n                                              4\n\fCEO-E-77-5 notice to the Coastal Commission that it intended to issue the demolition\npermits, and the demolition permits were issued on October 11, 2011. Neither LPA nor\nany other person filed an administrative challenge to the issuance of the demolition\npermits. (See Municipal Code §§ 15.80.010 et seq. [administrative appeals process].)\nThe demolition permits were valid for 180 days, and originally set to expire on April 18,\n2012. The Guidas applied for and were granted an extension of the permits to October\n11, 2012.\nThe Planning Commission Appeal\n              Following a public hearing on October 20, 2011, the Planning Commission\noverturned the Zoning Administrator’s decision and denied the Guidas’ lot merger\napplication. The Planning Commission found the lot merger would create a lot size and\nconfiguration that was inconsistent with the development pattern of the surrounding\nneighborhood. It also found the merger would allow development that was incompatible\nwith the size and mass of structures on neighboring properties. The Guidas appealed the\nPlanning Commission’s decision to the City Council.\nThe City Council Appeal\n              The first City Council hearing on the Guidas’ appeal took place on\nJanuary 24, 2012. The City staff reported the proposed lot merger qualified for a class 5\n(minor land alterations) categorical exemption from CEQA review. At the hearing, the\nGuidas’ representative explained they were working on redesigning their house and were\nwilling to record a covenant imposing design restrictions as to size and mass that were\nmore stringent than required by the City’s zoning ordinance. The Guidas requested the\nmatter be referred back to the Planning Commission to consider appropriate design\nrestrictions. Several neighbors continued to object to the lot merger arguing the lot size\nwould be incompatible with the area. The City Council voted to send the matter back to\nthe Planning Commission to recommend approval or denial of the application based on\nthe Guidas’ proposed design restrictions.\n\n                                             5\n\fThe Planning Commission Reconsiders Application\n              On March 22, 2012, the Planning Commission reconsidered the lot merger\napplication. The staff report explained the Guidas were proposing to abide by design\nrestrictions that included reducing the floor area ratio of their new house by 33 percent\nfrom what the zoning ordinance would allow if the lots were merged (which was also a\n25 percent reduction in size from what could be built on each lot if separately\nredeveloped), and reducing the allowable height by 33 percent. The Guidas additionally\noffered to increase the required setbacks by 33 percent.\n              Neighbors continued to oppose the lot merger on the grounds the resulting\nlot would be incompatible with the neighborhood. The Planning Commission adopted a\nresolution recommending the City Council approve the lot merger subject to a recorded\nconvent restricting development as proposed by the Guidas.\nThe Application Goes Back to City Council\n              The Guidas’ application went back before the City Council on April 24,\n2012, but the hearing was continued to the May 8 to allow additional time to prepare a\nrestrictive covenant. In its report for the May 8 hearing, the City’s staff advised the lot\nmerger was categorically exempt from CEQA review under class 5 (minor land\nalterations), class 1 (demolition of small structures/single-family residence) and class 3\n(new construction of single-family residence). Staff also reported the lot merger would\nsatisfy the CLUP’s density/intensity range of 6.0-9.9 dwelling units per acre. The staff\nreport compared lot sizes in the vicinity of the Guidas’ property. It identified three\nnearby lots of comparable size: 13,326 square feet/66 feet wide; 10,049 square feet/78\nfeet wide; and 14,579 square feet/111 feet wide. The staff report identified numerous (at\nleast 11) properties on Ocean Avenue that exceeded 8,000 square feet.\n              LPA’s counsel appeared at the May 8 City Council hearing. He asserted\nthe project was improperly defined as a lot merger, when in fact the project involved a lot\nmerger, demolition of two houses, and construction of a new house. He stated the two\n\n                                              6\n\flots had “historically significant dwellings” (the first mention of the existing homes),\nwhich he described as “Eichler style structures,” and thus he argued the project was not\ncategorically exempt from CEQA review. The City Attorney explained each of the\nactivities (lot merger, demolition, new construction) was categorically exempt “so the\nCity is not piecemealing them.” Additionally, the City Attorney explained, “We checked\nthe historical records, there’s no listing of it being a historical property in any of the\nregistries . . . . [LPA’s attorney] sort of speculates that there may be some historical\nvalue associated with these two properties and our thorough research of our records\ndo[es] not reveal any of that and there’s no evidence to that effect.” Another project\nopponent complained the lot merger would result in a decrease in the density required by\nthe CLUP—resulting in only 3.2 houses per acre, when the CLUP requires 6.0 to 9.9\nhouses per acre. City Council members responded that CLUP density applied over the\nentire area, not on a lot by lot basis. During the hearing, council members questioned if\nthere was any room for further negotiation between the Guidas and the neighbors. The\nGuidas agreed to attempt further discussions with the neighbors and the hearing was\ncontinued to June 26.\n              On June 13, 2012, the Guidas exercised their demolition permits and the\ntwo houses were demolished.\n              A letter dated June 22, 2012, written by Ruth Alter, owner of an archeology\nconsulting firm, is part of the administrative record. Alter wrote to LPA’s counsel she\nhad seen the two houses on June 2, 2012, and concluded the house at 2808\nOcean Boulevard “was likely the work of a quality designer or architect,” but she could\nnot attribute it to a specific individual without extensive research. Alter appeared at the\nJune 26 hearing and explained she had only been asked by LPA “to do a basic\npreliminary opinion assessment of the two properties.” She concluded there was nothing\nsignificant about the house at 2812 Ocean Boulevard. She described the house at 2808\nOcean Boulevard, as a “beautiful example” of “post and beam construction,” which was a\n\n                                               7\n\frare architectural style “almost always associated with a master designer or a master\narchitect.” She did not identify any particular master designer or master architect\nassociated with the house.\n               In its report for the June 26 hearing, City staff explained the houses on the\ntwo lots were demolished on June 13, pursuant to properly issued permits and because\nissuance of demolition permits is discretionary, it was not subject to CEQA. Staff\nadvised the lot merger was categorically exempt under class 5 (minor land alterations)\nand class 15 (minor land division), and the redevelopment of the new lot would be\nentitled to a class 3 (new construction of single-family residence) categorical exemption.\n               As to the historical resources question, staff explained there was no\ninformation as to who designed the two houses. The City’s permit history for the two\nlots established the houses were built between 1951 and 1953 by the J. Ray Construction\nCompany; the permits did not name the architect or developer and there were no related\nconstruction plans, and the houses were not listed on the City’s historic resources\ninventory list and not recognized as national, state, or local historical resources in the\nhistorical resources element of the City’s general plan.\n               As to the CLUP density issue, the staff report explained the CLUP density\nrange is representative of the predominant development of the entire area. The average\nlot size in the RSD-B area of old Corona del Mar was 4,846 square feet and the proposed\nlot merger would raise the average lot size to 4,857 square feet, which was within the\ndensity range.\n               The Guidas agreed to further development restrictions to be recorded on the\nmerged lot. Any new house would be subject to a floor area limit of 7,116 square feet\n(not including subterranean basement which by city code is not included in the floor area\nlimit), a height limit of 14 feet for the flat roof or top of the floor of the roof deck, front\nsetback of 20 feet, rear set back of 10 feet and side setbacks of six feet. The Planning\nDirector observed that unmerged and without the development restrictions under the\n\n                                                8\n\fzoning ordinance the two lots would be subject to only three-foot setbacks, a 24 to\n29 foot height limit, and up to 14,000 square feet combined of structures.\n              After closing the public hearing, the City Council, with one council\nmember dissenting, adopted Resolution No. 2012-52 approving the Guidas’ lot merger\nsubject to conditions including acceptance of the development restrictions the Guidas\noffered. The City Council found the lot merger was exempt from CEQA under CEQA\ncategorical exemptions classes 3, 5, and 15. It found the lot merger was consistent with\nthe CLUP because it would not cause the maximum density range for the RSD-B area to\nincrease. It found the new lot—80 feet wide and 13,678 square feet—would be\nconsistent with the surrounding pattern of development and would not create an\nexcessively large lot because other nearby lots on Ocean Boulevard have lot widths as\nwide as 73 feet and as large as 13,325 square feet. On June 28, 2012, the City posted its\nnotice of exemption stating the lot merger was categorically exempt from CEQA review.\nThe Petition for Writ of Mandate\n              On August 2, 2012, LPA filed the instant petition for a writ of mandate\nseeking to set aside approval of the lot merger contending the City violated CEQA by\nfinding the project was categorically exempt from CEQA review, violated its own lot\nmerger ordinance, violated the density restrictions imposed by the CLUP, and violated\nthe Coastal Act. The trial court rejected LPA’s contentions and denied mandamus relief.\n                                      DISCUSSION\n1. Standard of Review\n              LPA brought its petition for writ of mandate pursuant to Code of Civil\nProcedure sections 1085 and 1094.5, and Public Resources Code sections 21168 and\n21168.5. “‘In an action to set aside an agency’s determination under [CEQA], the\nappropriate standard of review is determined by the nature of the proceeding below. . . .\n[S]ection 21168 “establishes the standard of review in administrative mandamus\nproceedings” under Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.5, while section 21168.5\n\n                                             9\n\f“governs traditional mandamus actions” under Code of Civil Procedure section 1085.\n[Citation.] The former section applies to proceedings normally termed “quasi-\nadjudicative,” “in which by law a hearing is required to be given, evidence is required to\nbe taken and discretion in the determination of facts is vested in a public agency. . . . ”\n[Citations.] The latter section applies to all other actions taken pursuant to CEQA and\ngenerally encompasses “quasi-legislative” decisions made by a public agency.\n[Citations.]’ [Citations.]\n              “The distinction, however, is rarely significant. In either case, the issue\nbefore the trial court is whether the agency abused its discretion. Abuse of discretion is\nshown if (1) the agency has not proceeded in a manner required by law, or (2) the\ndetermination is not supported by substantial evidence. [Citations.]\n              “‘[I]n undertaking judicial review pursuant to [s]ections 21168 and\n21168.5, courts shall continue to follow the established principle that there is no\npresumption that error is prejudicial.’ [Citation.] However, ‘noncompliance with the\ninformation disclosure provisions of [CEQA] which precludes relevant information from\nbeing presented to the public agency, or noncompliance with substantive requirements of\n[CEQA], may constitute a prejudicial abuse of discretion within the meaning of\n[s]ections 21168 and 21168.5, regardless of whether a different outcome would have\nresulted if the public agency had complied with those provisions.’ [Citation.]\n              “On appeal, the appellate court’s ‘task . . . is the same as that of the trial\ncourt: that is, to review the agency’s actions to determine whether the agency complied\nwith procedures required by law.’ [Citation.] The appellate court reviews the\nadministrative record independently; the trial court’s conclusions are not binding on it.\n[Citations.]” (Gentry v. City of Murrieta (1995) 36 Cal.App.4th 1359, 1374-1376.)\n2. CLUP\n              LPA contends the City Council abused its discretion by approving the lot\nmerger because the construction of only one house on the 13,678 square foot lot would\n\n                                              10\n\fresult in a lower density/intensity of residential development than required by the CLUP\nfor the RSD-B category. We reject its contention.\n              Because the subject property is located in a coastal zone it is subject to\ndevelopment restrictions imposed by the Coastal Act. The Coastal Act establishes a\ncomprehensive framework for coastal planning. (§ 30000 et. seq.) It requires each local\ngovernment having coastal property within its territory to prepare a Local Coastal\nProgram to govern development in its coastal zone. (§§ 30108.6 & 30510.) A Local\nCoastal Program is comprised of the CLUP (Coastal Land Use Plan), which functions as\nthe general plan for the coastal zone, and the CLUP implementation measures that\ninclude the zoning, zoning maps, and implementing actions for the coastal zone.\n(§§ 30108.5, 30108.6.)\n              The Coastal Commission first approved the City’s CLUP in 2005. It “sets\nforth goals, objectives, and policies that govern the use of land and water in the [City’s]\ncoastal zone . . . .” (CLUP, § 1.1.) If there are conflicts between the policies expressed\nin the City’s CLUP and its general plan and zoning ordinance, “the policies of the\n[CLUP] shall take precedence. However, in no case, shall the policies of the [CLUP] be\ninterpreted to allow a development to exceed a development limit established by the\n[g]eneral [p]lan or its implementing ordinances.” (CLUP, § 1.3 (2), italics added.)\n              Chapter 2 of the City’s CLUP addresses coastal zone land use and\ndevelopment policies. Section 2.1, provides, “The [CLUP] was derived from the\nLand Use Element of the General Plan and is intended to identify the distribution of land\nuses in the coastal zone. The Land Use Element may contain more precise development\nlimits for specific properties. Should a conflict exist, the land use intensity or residential\ndensity limit that is most protective of coastal resources shall take precedence. However,\nin no case, shall the policies of the [CLUP] be interpreted to allow a development to\nexceed a development limit established by the General Plan or its implementing\nordinances.” (CLUP, § 2.1, italics added.)\n\n                                              11\n\f              Section 2.1.1 describes the coastal land use categories and describes the\n“type, density and intensity” of each land use. It begins by describing the categories of\n“Residential Neighborhoods” in the coastal zone, including four categories of single-unit\nresidential detached (RSD), which “category applies to a range of detached single-family\nresidential dwelling units on a single legal lot and does not include condominiums or\ncooperative housing.” The four RSD categories are the RSD-A category, described as\nhaving 0.0 to 5.9 dwelling units per acre; the RSD-B category, described as having 6.0 to\n9.9 dwelling units per acre; the RSD-C category, described as having 10.0 to 19.9\ndwelling units per acre; and the RSD-D category, described as having 20.0 to 29.9\ndwelling units per acre. The subject property is identified as being in the RSD-B\ncategory.\n              The gist of LPA’s argument is that by describing the RSD-B residential\nneighborhood category as one having between 6.0 and 9.9 dwelling units per acre, the\nCLUP mandates that each lot must individually meet that development density/intensity\nrequirement. Accordingly, although the zoning ordinance only specifies a minimum lot\nsize of 5,000 square feet and imposes no maximum lot size, the CLUP effectively\nrequires a minimum lot size in the RSD-B area of 4,400 square feet (i.e., 43,560 square\nfeet in one acre divided by the high end of the density range 9.9 equals 4,400), and sets a\nmaximum lot size of 7,260 (i.e., 43,560/6=7,260). Thus, LPA argues, the City cannot\napprove a lot merger that would result in any new lot larger than 7,260 square feet in the\nRSD-B area because it would result in a development density on that lot that is lower\nthan the minimum 6.0 dwelling units per acre required by the CLUP (i.e.,\n43,560/13,678=3.2 dwelling units per acre).\n              When this argument was made before the City Council, City staff explained\nthe CLUP density ranges were “representative of the predominant development of the\nentire area . . . .” Indeed, in the part of the CLUP pertaining to categorical exclusions\nfrom the coastal development permit provisions of the Coastal Act, the CLUP explains,\n\n                                             12\n\f“The permitted residential unit type and maximum density of the [CLUP] reflect the\npredominate form of development in these areas.” (CLUP, § 2.2.3.) The average lot size\nin the area was 4,846, and the merger would bring the average lot size up to 4,857, which\nkept the area in the specified density range. At the May 8, 2012, City Council meeting,\none council member observed density was not viewed “on a lot-by-lot\nbasis. . . . [D]ensity is something that’s applied over the entire old town area of Corona\ndel Mar, you have big lots. You have average lots, you’ve got small lots. So I think that\ndensity is meant to be applied over a much larger area, not a lot, not a block, but a much\nlarger area . . . .” The City Council’s findings in support of the resolution approving the\nlot merger (Resolution 2012-52) included a finding the merger was consistent with the\napplicable regulations including the CLUP. Among the facts supporting that finding\nwere that the CLUP density range was representative of the predominant development in\nthe entire old Corona del Mar area and the merger “does not cause the maximum density\nfor the area to be exceeded.”\n              We conclude the City reasonably interpreted its CLUP as describing the\ndensity range for the RSD-B area, by which a development must be additionally assessed,\nand not as imposing a maximum individual lot size so as to achieve a specific density\nrange on an individual lot. The City’s interpretation controls unless it is clearly\nerroneous. (See Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th\n1173, 1193 (Anderson First Coalition) [“‘an agency’s view of the meaning and scope of\nits own [zoning] ordinance is entitled to great weight unless it is clearly erroneous or\nunauthorized’”]; Friends of Davis v. City of Davis (2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 1004, 1015\n[same]; see also Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control v. Alcoholic Beverage\nControl Appeals Bd. (2005) 128 Cal.App.4th 1195, 1205 [courts defer to an agency’s\ninterpretation of its own regulations].)\n              LPA relies on Pacific Palisades Bowl Mobile Estates, LLC v. City of Los\nAngeles (2012) 55 Cal.4th 783 (Pacific Palisades), in support of its argument that a land\n\n                                             13\n\fuse approval that results in a decrease in the intensity of development constitutes a\n“change in density” that would violate the CLUP. Pacific Palisades held the conversion\nof a mobilehome park from tenant occupancy to resident ownership is a “development”\nfor purposes of the Coastal Act, and thus subject to the Coastal Commission’s permitting\nauthority. The relevant provision in the Coastal Act, section 39106, defines a\n“‘[d]evelopment,’” for which a coastal development permit would be required, as\nincluding a “change in the density or intensity of use of land, including, but not limited\nto . . . any . . . division of land, including lot splits . . . .” The property owner argued a\nmobilehome park conversion was not a “development” because it did not change the\ndensity or intensity of the land use. In rejecting that contention, the Supreme Court\nconcluded an increase or decrease in intensity of the land use was a “change” constituting\na “development.” (Pacific Palisades, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 795.) The mobilehome park\nconversion from rental to resident ownership could theoretically decrease\ndensity/intensity of use “by limiting public access to the coastline or reducing the number\nof lots available for residential purposes . . . .” (Ibid.) And it could theoretically increase\ndensity/intensity of land use by “lead[ing] to problematic design features as owners\nexpress their individuality by decorating or adding to their mobilehomes. Nor is it\nimpossible that owners would block public access to coastal areas or increase the number\nof residents in their units.” (Id. at p. 797.)\n               We fail to see how Pacific Palisades furthers LPA’s position. It dealt with\nthe proper interpretation of a statute, not with how a local agency interprets and applies\nits own land use implementing documents. Pacific Palisades offers no guidance on\nwhether the City’s conclusion its CLUP’s description of the applicable density/intensity\nrange for a residential neighborhood is viewed in a macro sense (the range for the entire\narea) or a micro sense (the exact density that must be achieved on each individual lot).\n               LPA also relies on deBottari v. City Council (1985) 171 Cal.App.3d 1204\n(deBottari), for the proposition that “simple mathematics” must be applied to determine\n\n                                                 14\n\fwhether “general plan and zoning densities” are consistent. In deBottari, a city approved\na general plan amendment of the land use designation from one allowing zero to two\nresidential units per acre, to one allowing three to four. It also approved a zoning\nordinance amendment changing the minimum lot size from 18,000 square feet (about two\nunits per acre) to 10,000 square feet (about four units per acre). (Id. at p. 1207.) The city\nsubsequently refused to place on the ballot a proposed referendum petition that sought to\nrepeal the zoning ordinance amendments and revert to the original zoning. (Id. at\np. 1208.) The court held the referendum petition was properly rejected. The referendum,\nhad it passed, would have resulted in an invalid zoning ordinance because it would have\nconflicted with the amended general plan. (Id. at p. 1213.)\n              Again, we fail to see how deBottari, supra, 171 Cal.App.3d 1204, aids\nLPA. There is no inconsistency between the City’s interpretation of its LCUP, which\ndescribes a density range for the RSD-B area, its general plan designation of\nsingle-family residential, and its zoning ordinance which requires a minimum lot size of\n5,000 square feet.\n              If anything, LPA’s “simple math”/consistency argument underscores why\nthe City’s interpretation of its CLUP is reasonable and LPA’s is not. LPA’s argument is\npremised on their assumption that by describing a density range for the residential\nneighborhood category, by applying simple math, a maximum individual lot size can be\nextrapolated. In the case of the RSD-B area, LPA contend because the low end of the\ndensity range is 6.0 dwelling units per acre, the maximum lot size is 7,260 square feet.\n(We note the City’s staff identified numerous properties on Ocean Avenue in the CLUP’s\nRSD-B area that exceeded 8,000 square feet.) Consistency requires the same simple\nmath be applied to the CLUP’s other residential neighborhood categories. That would\nmean in the RSD-C area, described as having a density range of 10 to 19.9 dwelling units\nper acre, the maximum legal lot size would be 4,356 square feet—even though the City’s\nzoning ordinance sets a minimum legal lot size of 5,000 square feet (or 6,000 square feet\n\n                                             15\n\ffor a corner lot). And in the RSD-D zone, with a density range of 20 to 29.9 dwelling\nunits per acre, applying LPA’s reasoning, the maximum legal lot size would be 2,178\nsquare feet or roughly one-third to one-half of the minimum legal lot size specified by the\nzoning ordinance. LPA’s interpretation would render the CLUP irreconcilable with the\nzoning ordinance—with one setting a maximum lot size well below the minimum lot size\nrequired by the other. The City’s interpretation avoids such an absurdity. In short, the\nCity correctly determined the lot merger would not run afoul of the CLUP because after\naccounting for the larger lot, the housing density in the area remained within the CLUP’s\ndensity range.\n3. CEQA Issues\n              LPA attacks the City’s findings the lot merger was categorically exempt\nfrom CEQA review. We reject its contentions.\na. CEQA Background\n              “[T]he Legislature intended CEQA to be interpreted to afford the fullest\npossible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory\nlanguage. [Citation.] Central to CEQA is the EIR, which has as its purpose informing\nthe public and government officials of the environmental consequences of decisions\nbefore they are made. [Citation.]” (Sierra Club v. County of Sonoma (1992)\n6 Cal.App.4th 1307, 1315 (Sierra Club).) “An EIR must be prepared on any ‘project’ a\nlocal agency intends to approve or carry out which ‘may have a significant effect on the\nenvironment.’ (§§ 21100, 21151; Guidelines, § 15002, subd. (f)(1).) The term ‘project’\nis broadly defined and includes any activities which have a potential for resulting in\nphysical changes in the environment, directly or ultimately. (§ 21065; Guidelines,\n§ 15002, subd. (d), 15378, subd. (a); [citation].)” (Sierra Club, supra, 6 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1315, fn. omitted.) A “‘significant effect on the environment’ “ is defined as “a\nsubstantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in any of the physical conditions\n\n\n\n                                             16\n\fwithin the area affected by the project including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna,\nambient noise, and objects of historic or aesthetic significance.” (Guidelines, § 15382.)\n              Not all projects are subject to CEQA. “CEQA authorizes the resources\nagency to adopt guidelines that list classes of exempt projects, namely projects ‘which\nhave been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which shall\nbe exempt from this division.’ ( . . . § 21084, subd. (a).) These classes of projects are\ncalled ‘categorical exemptions’ and are detailed in Guidelines section 15300 et seq.”\n(Wollmer v. City of Berkeley (2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1329, 1347 (Wollmer).) Where a\npublic agency decides that proposed activity is categorically exempt and no exceptions\napply, a notice of exemption is filed, and no further environmental review is necessary.\n(Guidelines, § 15062, subd. (a); No Oil, Inc. v. City of Los Angeles (1974) 13 Cal.3d 68,\n74.) But the categorical exemptions have exceptions and qualifications. (Wollmer,\nsupra, 193 Cal.App.4th at p. 1347.) As relevant here, the exceptions include that a\ncategorical exemption may not be used for an activity or project “where there is a\nreasonable possibility that [it] will have a significant effect on the environment due to\nunusual circumstances[,]” or if it “may cause a substantial adverse change in the\nsignificance of a historical resource.” (Guidelines, § 15300.2, subds. (c) & (f).)\nb. Categorical Exemptions\n              The City found the lot merger was exempt from CEQA review under\nGuidelines section 15305 (class 5), which applies to any “minor alterations in land use\nlimitations in areas with an average slope of less than 20%, which do not result in any\nchanges in land use or density, including but not limited to: [¶] (a) Minor lot line\nadjustments, side yard, and set back variances not resulting in the creation of any new\nparcel; [¶] (b) Issuance of minor encroachment permits; [or] (c) Reversion to acreage in\naccordance with the Subdivision Map Act.” Additionally, the City found the lot merger\nwas exempt under Guidelines section 15315 (class 15), which applies to “the division of\nproperty in urbanized areas zoned for residential . . . use into four or fewer parcels when\n\n                                             17\n\fthe division is in conformance with the General Plan and zoning, no variances or\nexceptions are required, all services and access to the proposed parcels to local standards\nare available, the parcel was not involved in a division of a larger parcel within the\nprevious 2 years, and the parcel does not have an average slope greater than 20 percent.”\nThe City also found, to the extent the lot merger approval precedes construction of a new\nresidence, it was exempt under Guidelines section 15303 (class 3), which applies to\n“construction and location of limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures,” an\nexemption that specifically includes “one single-family residence,” on a legal parcel in a\nresidential zone.”\n              “‘[T]he substantial evidence test governs our review of the [agency’s]\nfactual determination that a project falls within a categorical exemption.’ [Citation.]”\n(San Lorenzo Valley Community Advocates for Responsible Education v. San Lorenzo\nValley Unified School Dist. (2006) 139 Cal.App.4th 1356, 1381-1382; Committee to Save\nthe Hollywoodland Specific Plan v. City of Los Angeles (2008) 161 Cal.App.4th 1168,\n1187.) Below and on appeal, LPA address only the applicability of the class 5\nexemption. As the trial court noted in its statement of decision, at trial, LPA “barely\nacknowledge [the class 15] exemption and have not challenged it on the merits.”\n              LPA argues the class 5 exemption can only be applied if the lot merger will\n“not result in any changes in land use or density.” It argues the lot merger will result in a\nchange in density because it will decrease the density of development on the lot below\nthat required by the CLUP. We have already addressed and rejected the faulty premise\nfor LPA’s reasoning above. The City found the lot merger would not change the land use\nor density because the merged lot remained within the general plan (and zoning\nordinances) single-unit residential detached zoning designation. Additionally, there was\nno change in density because as merged the lot was consistent with the 6.0-9.9 dwelling\nunits per acre density/intensity range called for in the CLUP. Substantial evidence\nsupports its finding the class 5 exemption applied.\n\n                                             18\n\f              Even were we to agree with LPA that the class 5 exemption did not apply,\nas we have noted it has not challenged the City’s application of the class 15 exemption to\nthe lot merger. Nor has it challenged the City’s determination the class 3 exemption\napplies to any new construction on the merged lot. Accordingly, LPA has waived any\nargument those categorical exemptions do not apply.\n              Moreover, in their respondents’ briefs on appeal, the City and the Guidas\npoint out there are several other applicable categorical exemptions beyond those listed in\nthe City’s notice of exemption. (These additional categorical exemptions were also\nraised by the City and the Guidas in the trial court and most were mentioned in the\nvarious staff reports contained in the administrative record.) (See California Farm\nBureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173,\n190-191 [agency may rely on additional categorical exemptions if there is no claim or\nshowing of prejudice].) LPA does not reply to the City’s and the Guidas’ arguments\nconcerning the applicability of these categorical exemptions. The demolition of the\noriginal houses was categorically exempt under Guidelines section 15301, subdivision (l)\n(class 1), which applies to “[d]emolition and removal of individual small structures listed\nin this subdivision; [¶] (1) One single-family residence. In urbanized areas, up to three\nsingle-family residences may be demolished under this exemption.” The demolition of\nthe original houses and construction of a new house is categorically exempt under\nGuidelines section 15302 (class 2), which applies to “replacement or reconstruction of\nexisting structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the same site\nas the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose and capacity as the\nstructure replaced.” And the demolition, lot merger, and reconstruction of the houses\nwere categorically exempt under Guidelines section 15332 (class 32), which “consists of\nprojects characterized as in-fill development” provided the project is consistent with the\ngeneral plan and zoning, is on a site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded\nby urban uses, the site is not an endangered species habitat, there will be no significant\n\n                                             19\n\feffects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality, and the site can be\nadequately served by all required utilities and public services.\n               In sum, there is substantial evidence supporting the City’s determination\nthe lot merger application was categorically exempt from CEQA review. Accordingly,\nwe turn to the issue of whether an exception to categorical exemption applied.\nc. Historical Resources Exception\n               LPA contends that even if one of the foregoing categorical exemptions\napplies, the “historical resources” exception precludes the use of a categorical exemption\nto avoid CEQA review in this case. We disagree.\n               If an agency finds, “‘“based on substantial evidence in the record, that the\nproject falls within a categorical exemption,”’” a party challenging that finding must\npresent evidence an exception to the exemption is applicable. (Hines v. California\nCoastal Com. (2010) 186 Cal.App.4th 830, 855 (Hines).) As relevant, Guidelines\nsection 15300.2, subdivisions (c) and (f), provides a categorical exemption cannot be\nused “where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect\non the environment due to unusual circumstances” or for “a project which may cause a\nsubstantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.” Although LPA\nrefers to both the unusual circumstances and the historical resources exception, they\nanalyze only the latter.\n               “There is a split of authority on the appropriate standard of judicial review\nof a question of fact when the issue is whether a project that would otherwise be found\ncategorically exempt is subject to one of [the] . . . exceptions. . . . ‘Some courts . . . hold[]\nthat a finding of categorical exemption cannot be sustained if there is a “fair argument”\nbased on substantial evidence that the project will have significant environmental\nimpacts, even where the agency is presented with substantial evidence to the contrary.\n[Citation.] Other courts apply an ordinary substantial evidence test . . . deferring to the\nexpress or implied findings of the local agency that has found a categorical exemption\n\n                                               20\n\fapplicable. [Citations.]’” (Hines, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th at pp. 855-856.) The question\nof the correct standard is currently pending before our Supreme Court. (Berkeley Hillside\nPreservation v. City of Berkeley, rev. granted May 23, 2012, S201116.) We need not\nresolve this issue because even applying the less deferential “fair argument” standard, we\nfind there is simply no substantial evidence to support LPA’s contention the historical\nresources exception applies.\n              Preliminarily, we fail to see why LPA’s argument the original houses were\nhistorical resources is not moot, given they were demolished pursuant to validly issued\ndemolition permits that were not timely challenged by LPA. LPA, in passing, asserts that\neven though houses were demolished, a reconstructive historical survey could be\nperformed to assess their importance (i.e., a “paper reconstruction”). And because the\nCity did not address historical significance of the two houses, the magnitude of the\nimpact of their demolition remains in question. But as the trial court recognized at the\nhearing below, given that issuance of the demolition permits was a ministerial act, they\nwere not challenged, and were lawfully acted upon, “I don’t think you can come back\ntoday and after something has been pulverized say, well, it was historical.”\n              Moreover, even if the original houses still stood, LPA could not prevail. As\nnoted above, “[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a\nsubstantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.” (Guidelines,\n§ 15300.2, subd. (f).) As observed in Valley Advocates v. City of Fresno (2008)\n160 Cal.App.4th 1039, 1051 (Valley Advocates), there are three relevant categories:\n“(1) mandatory historical resources, (2) presumptive historical resources and\n(3) discretionary historical resources.” To qualify as a mandatory or presumptive\nhistorical resource, the structures must have been listed on state or local registers of\nhistorical resources, or identified as historically significant in an historical resources\nsurvey. (Id. at pp. 1051-1054; § 21084.1; Guidelines, § 15064.5.) It is undisputed the\noriginal houses met none of the requirements to be considered mandatory or presumptive\n\n                                              21\n\fhistorical resources. They were not listed on any national, state, or local list of\nhistorical resources, nor were they on any survey of historical resources.\n              LPA apparently relies on the City’s discretion to consider a structure as a\nhistorical resource even if not officially designated as such. But that category does not\napply because there is no substantial evidence to support LPA’s contention the houses\nwere historical resources. The only pre-demolition evidence came at the May 8, 2012,\nCity Council meeting, when counsel for LPA claimed the two lots had “Eichler style\nstructures” on them and therefore were “historical resource[s].” In response, the City\nAttorney explained, “We checked the historical records, there’s no listing of it being a\nhistorical property in any of the registries . . . [Petitioners’ attorney] sort of speculates\nthat there may be some historical value associated with these two properties and our\nthorough research of our records do[es] not reveal any of that and there’s no evidence to\nthat effect.” The houses were demolished on June 13, 2012, pursuant to the validly\nissued and unchallenged demolition permits. In a letter dated June 22, LPA’s expert,\nAlter, wrote to Petitioners’ counsel the house at 2808 Ocean Boulevard was “likely the\nwork of a quality designer or architect,” but she could not identify any particular designer\nor architect. At the June 26 hearing, Alter stated the house at 2812 Ocean Boulevard was\nnothing extraordinary, but the house at 2808 Ocean Boulevard was a “beautiful example”\nof “post and beam construction,” an architectural style “almost always associated with a\nmaster designer or a master architect,” but again she did not identify any particular\nmaster designer or master architect associated with the house. LPA’s\npost-demolition evidence the houses were a style of architecture normally associated\nwith a “master designer or master architect” is not substantial evidence the houses had\nany historical significance or were historical resources. In its report for the June 26\nhearing, City staff explained the City’s permit history for the two lots showed the houses\nwere built between 1951 and 1953 by the J. Ray Construction Company, there was no\nrecord containing the name of the developer or architect, the houses were not listed on the\n\n                                               22\n\fCity’s Historic Resource Inventory or lists compiled by the City’s Ad Hoc Historic\nPreservation Advisory Committee, and the houses were not recognized as national state\nor local historical resources in the City’s Historical Resources Element of the General\nPlan. The City was entitled to rely on the expertise of planning staff (Porterville Citizens\nfor Responsible Hillside Development v. City of Porterville (2007) 157 Cal.App.4th 885,\n901), and it was not required to apply the historical resources exception to the categorical\nexemptions from further CEQA review of the lot merger application.\nd. Piecemealing\n              LPA’s final CEQA argument is one of improper project “piecemealing.”\nThey accuse the City of improperly considering the demolition of the existing houses\nseparately from the lot merger application so as to avoid CEQA review.\n              Ordinarily issuance of a building or demolition permit is a ministerial\nproject and exempt from CEQA. (Adams Point Preservation Society v. City of Oakland\n(1987) 192 Cal.App.3d 203, 206-208; Guidelines, § 15268.) But LPA argues the project\nshould be viewed as the demolition and the lot merger combined. And because approval\nof the latter was a discretionary action, the entire project was discretionary and thus\nsubject to CEQA. (See Guidelines, §§ 15268, subd. (d) [“Where a project involves an\napproval that contains elements of both a ministerial action and a discretionary action, the\nproject will be deemed to be discretionary and will be subject to the requirements of\nCEQA”], 15378, subd. (a) [“‘[p]roject’ means the whole of an action, which has a\npotential for resulting in either a direct [or indirect] physical change in the environment”],\n15378, subd. (c) [“project” means the activity being approved and not each separate\ngovernmental approval].) LPA asserts the demolition was improperly segregated from\nthe lot merger to avoid CEQA review.\n              Although an agency cannot divide a project into separate parts to avoid\nCEQA review, when each aspect is categorically exempt the combined effect of the\nexemptions places the entire project outside the scope of CEQA. (California Farm\n\n                                             23\n\fBureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) 143 Cal.App.4th 173,\n191; see Surfrider Foundation v. California Coastal Com. (1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 151,\n155 [“Commission’s action was exempt from CEQA due to the combined application of\ntwo types of exemptions”].) Here, even if viewed as discretionary rather than ministerial,\nthe demolition of the two houses was categorically exempt (see Guidelines, § 15301,\nsubd. (l) [class 1 exemption for demolition and removal of individual small structures\nincluding up to three single-family residences in urbanized areas]), and as already\nexplained there is no substantial evidence the houses were historical resources so as to\nrequire application of any of the exceptions to application of those categorical\nexemptions. Similarly, as already explained the lot merger was categorically exempt.\nLPA offers no explanation as to why the combined effect of the categorical exemptions\nwould not take the project, as defined by LPA, out of CEQA’s scope.3\n4. Violation of City’s Lot Merger Ordinance\n              LPA argues approval of the lot merger violated the City’s lot merger\nordinance codified in Municipal Code chapter 19.68. The argument is completely\nunsupported by any citation to legal authorities or any cogent analysis. Instead, LPA\nrefers us to the “well developed” argument it included in its opening brief filed in the trial\ncourt (which we note consisted of a scant 11 sentences and was similarly unsupported by\ncitation to authority or legal analysis). For that reason alone, we consider the argument\nwaived. “‘Appellate briefs must provide argument and legal authority for the positions\ntaken. “When an appellant fails to raise a point, or asserts it but fails to support it with\nreasoned argument and citations to authority, we treat the point as waived.”’ [Citation.]\n‘We are not bound to develop appellants’ argument for them. [Citation.] The absence of\ncogent legal argument or citation to authority allows this court to treat the contention as\n\n\n3            For this reason, we need not consider the Guidas’ argument LPA failed to\nexhaust administrative remedies as to the demolition permits, or that any challenge to\nthem is untimely.\n\n                                              24\n\fwaived.’ [Citations.]” (Cahill v. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2011) 194 Cal.App.4th\n939, 956 (Cahill).)\n              Moreover, the argument is without merit. In its opening brief LPA\nspecifically refers to the required findings that “[t]he lots as merged will be consistent\nwith the pattern of development nearby and will not result in a lot width, depth or\norientation, or development site that is incompatible with nearby lots[,]” and “[a]pproval\nof the [lot] merger will not . . . be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements\nin the neighborhood or the general welfare of the City[.]” (Mun. Code § 19.68.030\n(H)(1) & (5).) The gist of its argument seems to be because the Planning Commission\noriginally found those findings could not be made, and that conclusion was later reached\nby the one dissenting council member, the City Council could not make the requisite\nfindings.\n              But in its resolution approving the lot merger, the City Council made all\nfindings required by its lot merger ordinance.4 As to the findings raised by LPA, the City\n\n\n4              Municipal Code section 19.68.030 sets forth the findings required for\napproval of a lot merger. They include: “1. Approval of the merger will not, under the\ncircumstances of this particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, comfort\nand general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed\nuse or be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or\nthe general welfare of the City, and further that the proposed lot merger is consistent with\nthe legislative intent of [this title]; and [¶] 2. The lots to be merged are under common fee\nownership at the time of the merger; and [¶] 3. The lots as merged will be consistent or\nwill be more closely compatible with the applicable zoning regulations and will be\nconsistent with other regulations relating to the subject property including, but not limited\nto, the General Plan and any applicable Coastal Plan or Specific Plan; and [¶] 4. Neither\nthe lots as merged nor adjoining parcels will be deprived of legal access as a result of the\nmerger; and [¶] 5. The lots as merged will be consistent with the surrounding pattern of\ndevelopment and will not create an excessively large lot that is not compatible with the\nsurrounding development. In making this finding, the review authority may consider the\nfollowing: [¶] Whether development of the merged lots could significantly deviate from\nthe pattern of development of adjacent and/or adjoining lots in a manner that would result\nin an unreasonable detriment to the use and enjoyment of other properties. [¶] Whether\nthe merged lots would be consistent with the character or general orientation of adjacent\n\n                                             25\n\fCouncil found approval of the lot merger would not be detrimental or injurious to\nproperty and improvements in the neighborhood or the general welfare of the City\nbecause future development would comply with the zoning ordinance development\nstandards, the merger would not impact public views of the ocean (because no public\nviews existed), the merger would result in a legal building site, the merger would not\nresult in creation of additional parcels, and there would be no change in land use or\nincrease in density. The City Council also found the lots as merged would be consistent\nwith the surrounding pattern of development and would not create an excessively large\nlot or a lot that was incompatible with the surrounding development because the area lots\nwere of “varying shapes and sizes”; as merged, the subject lot would have a “width of\n80 feet and area of 13,678 square feet”; and “[o]ther nearby lots on Ocean Boulevard\nhave lot widths as wide as 73 feet and area as large as 13,325 square feet.” We must\naccord great deference to the City’s findings the lot merger is consistent with its\nMunicipal Code. (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) 130 Cal.App.4th\n1173, 1192.) LPA has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate the City’s findings are\nunsupported by the record.5\n5. Coastal Act\n              LPA contends approval of the lot merger violated the Coastal Act. The\nargument is completely devoid of any legal analysis or citation to authority—LPA does\nnot cite a single provision of the Coastal Act or explain how it was violated by approval\nof the lot merger. Although LPA refers to the Commission’s CEO-E-77-5 excluding the\ndemolition and construction of single-family homes from Coastal Commission review,\n\n\nand/or adjoining lots. [¶] Whether the merged lots would be conforming or in greater\nconformity with the minimum lot width and area standards for the zoning district.”\n\n5              In their reply brief, LPA asserts the other large lots in the area all predate\nthe City’s lot merger ordinance and its CLUP, and this lot will be the largest created by a\nmerger. They cite no evidence in the administrative record to support this claim.\n\n                                             26\n\fthey have failed to offer any explanation as to how the Coastal Act has been violated.\nAccordingly, we treat the argument as waived. (Cahill, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p. 956\n[“‘We are not bound to develop appellants’ argument for them’”].)\n6. Augmentation of Administrative Record\n              Finally, in a three-sentence argument, LPA contends the trial court abused\nits discretion by denying its request to augment the administrative record. It offers\nabsolutely no explanation as to what documents it sought to add or what relevance they\nhad to the issues below. There is no legal analysis as to whether the documents were\nitems that should have been included on in the administrative record in the first instance\n(see § 21167.6, subd. (e) [describing contents of administrative record]), other than\nLPA’s single sentence stating there is no evidence in the administrative record\ndemonstrating the documents were not among the documents submitted to the City.\nMore significantly, it offers no explanation as how it was prejudiced by the absence of\nthe unidentified documents from the administrative record. The argument is waived.\n(Cahill, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p. 956.)\n                                      DISPOSITION\n              The judgment is affirmed. Respondents and Real Parties in Interest are\nawarded their costs on appeal.\n\n\n                                                   O’LEARY, P.

(Pub. Resources Code, § 21000 et seq.)1 LPA challenged the City of\nNewport Beach’s (City) approval of a lot merger application filed by owners of two\nadjoining lots, the John Guida Trust and the Julie Guida Trust (the Guidas), who have\ndemolished the original houses and intend to build a single home on the newly merged\nlot. LPA raise numerous contentions including the City failed to comply with CEQA, the\nCity’s Coastal Land Use Plan adopted pursuant to the California Coastal Act (§ 30000\net seq., the Coastal Act), and its lot merger ordinance contained in the Newport Beach\nMunicipal Code (the Municipal Code). We reject LPA’s arguments and affirm the\njudgment.\n                               FACTS AND PROCEDURE\n              The Guidas own two adjoining lots in the City’s Corona Del Mar\ncommunity on Ocean Boulevard across the street from Lookout Point and Little Corona\nBeach.2 The lot located at 2808 Ocean Boulevard was 7,217 square feet in size and\n40 feet wide (at its widest point). The lot located at 2812 Ocean Boulevard was\n6,483 square feet in size and also 40 feet wide. When the Guidas bought the two lots\neach was developed with a one-story house under 1,500 square feet in size. The Guidas\nplanned on demolishing the existing houses, merging the two lots, and building a new\nhouse.\n\n1             All statutory references are to the Public Resources Code, unless otherwise\nindicated. The CEQA implementing guidelines appear at California Code of\nRegulations, title 14, section 15000 et seq., and will be referred to as the “Guidelines.”\n\n2              Throughout the record the lot merger is referred to as the merger of two lots\nwith two separate addresses. The legal description actually encompasses portions of\nthree lots bearing two separate assessor’s parcel numbers, but we will continue to refer to\nthe merger as encompassing the two lots.\n\n                                             2\n\f               The City’s general plan designates the subject property as single-unit\nresidential detached (RS-D) and its zoning ordinance designates the subject property as\nsingle-unit residential (R-1). Development standards for the R-1 zone require interior\nlots be a minimum of 5,000 square feet and a minimum of 60 feet wide by 80 feet deep.\nThe zoning ordinance sets a density/intensity limit of one single-unit detached dwelling\nfor each legal lot.\n               Because the subject property is located in a coastal zone, it is also subject to\nthe City’s Coastal Land Use Plan (CLUP), adopted pursuant to the Coastal Act. The\nresidential neighborhood where the subject property is located (old Corona del Mar) is\nidentified in the CLUP as being in the single-unit residential detached “B” category\n(RSD-B). The CLUP describes RSD-B residential neighborhoods as having a\n“density/intensity” range (“[t]he RSD category applies to a range of detached\nsingle-family residential dwelling units on a single legal lot . . . .”) of 6.0 to 9.9 dwelling\nunits per acre [DU/AC]. The property is also subject to private deed restrictions\nconcerning the height of structures on the property.\n               Additionally, coastal zone developments often have permit requirements\nfrom both the local agency and the California Coastal Commission (the Commission).\nBut the Commission’s Categorical Exclusion Order E-77-5 (Newport Beach) (hereafter\nCEO-E-77-5), excludes from the Commission’s permit requirement the demolition and\nconstruction of single-family homes that meet certain development standards. When\nutilizing the categorical exclusion, the City must give five days’ written notice to the\nCommission that it has approved a development that conforms to CEO-E-77-5.\nThe Zoning Administrator Approves the Lot Merger\n               On July 7, 2011, the Guidas applied to the City to have the two lots merged\ninto a single lot. As merged, the new lot would be approximately 13,700 square feet,\napproximately 74 feet wide at the front on Ocean Boulevard, 80 feet wide at the back,\nand 180 feet deep.\n\n                                               3\n\f              A public hearing on the proposed lot merger was held before the City’s\nZoning Administrator on September 14, 2011. Several neighbors opposed the\napplication, largely voicing concerns the merger would result in an over-large lot, and\nallow the Guidas to construct a house that would violate the private deed restrictions and\ndamage views from neighboring properties. The Zoning Administrator observed the\npending application was strictly for the lot merger, and the application had nothing to do\nwith the design of the proposed house. The Zoning Administrator also observed that\nwhile the new lot would be large, there were many other similarly sized lots in the area.\nHe specifically observed there was one property about five blocks away that involved the\nmerger of four lots into one.\n              The Zoning Administrator approved the lot merger. His written findings\nincluded that the merger qualified for a class 5 categorical exemption from environmental\nreview under CEQA because it involved minor alterations in land use limitations; the lots\nas merged would comply with the zoning ordinance because it would meet the minimum\nlot width and area standard, it would comply with the general plan because it would\nprovide for a single-family residence, and it was within the 6.0-9.9 dwelling units per\nacre density range described by the CLUP. He found the new lot would be consistent\nwith other nearby lots and would not result in an excessively large lot compared to many\nother existing lots in the area.\n              On September 23, 2011, the Guidas’ neighbors appealed the Zoning\nAdministrator’s approval of the lot merger application to the City’s Planning\nCommission. The stated reasons for the appeal were that the lot merger would allow the\nGuidas to violate the current deed restrictions by building a building that was too tall, and\nwould damage their properties by loss of their views.\nDemolition Permits are Issued\n              The Guidas had also applied for demolition permits to tear down the\nexisting structures on the two lots. On September 27, 2011, the City issued its\n\n                                              4\n\fCEO-E-77-5 notice to the Coastal Commission that it intended to issue the demolition\npermits, and the demolition permits were issued on October 11, 2011. Neither LPA nor\nany other person filed an administrative challenge to the issuance of the demolition\npermits. (See Municipal Code §§ 15.80.010 et seq. [administrative appeals process].)\nThe demolition permits were valid for 180 days, and originally set to expire on April 18,\n2012. The Guidas applied for and were granted an extension of the permits to October\n11, 2012.\nThe Planning Commission Appeal\n              Following a public hearing on October 20, 2011, the Planning Commission\noverturned the Zoning Administrator’s decision and denied the Guidas’ lot merger\napplication. The Planning Commission found the lot merger would create a lot size and\nconfiguration that was inconsistent with the development pattern of the surrounding\nneighborhood. It also found the merger would allow development that was incompatible\nwith the size and mass of structures on neighboring properties. The Guidas appealed the\nPlanning Commission’s decision to the City Council.\nThe City Council Appeal\n              The first City Council hearing on the Guidas’ appeal took place on\nJanuary 24, 2012. The City staff reported the proposed lot merger qualified for a class 5\n(minor land alterations) categorical exemption from CEQA review. At the hearing, the\nGuidas’ representative explained they were working on redesigning their house and were\nwilling to record a covenant imposing design restrictions as to size and mass that were\nmore stringent than required by the City’s zoning ordinance. The Guidas requested the\nmatter be referred back to the Planning Commission to consider appropriate design\nrestrictions. Several neighbors continued to object to the lot merger arguing the lot size\nwould be incompatible with the area. The City Council voted to send the matter back to\nthe Planning Commission to recommend approval or denial of the application based on\nthe Guidas’ proposed design restrictions.\n\n                                             5\n\fThe Planning Commission Reconsiders Application\n              On March 22, 2012, the Planning Commission reconsidered the lot merger\napplication. The staff report explained the Guidas were proposing to abide by design\nrestrictions that included reducing the floor area ratio of their new house by 33 percent\nfrom what the zoning ordinance would allow if the lots were merged (which was also a\n25 percent reduction in size from what could be built on each lot if separately\nredeveloped), and reducing the allowable height by 33 percent. The Guidas additionally\noffered to increase the required setbacks by 33 percent.\n              Neighbors continued to oppose the lot merger on the grounds the resulting\nlot would be incompatible with the neighborhood. The Planning Commission adopted a\nresolution recommending the City Council approve the lot merger subject to a recorded\nconvent restricting development as proposed by the Guidas.\nThe Application Goes Back to City Council\n              The Guidas’ application went back before the City Council on April 24,\n2012, but the hearing was continued to the May 8 to allow additional time to prepare a\nrestrictive covenant. In its report for the May 8 hearing, the City’s staff advised the lot\nmerger was categorically exempt from CEQA review under class 5 (minor land\nalterations), class 1 (demolition of small structures/single-family residence) and class 3\n(new construction of single-family residence). Staff also reported the lot merger would\nsatisfy the CLUP’s density/intensity range of 6.0-9.9 dwelling units per acre. The staff\nreport compared lot sizes in the vicinity of the Guidas’ property. It identified three\nnearby lots of comparable size: 13,326 square feet/66 feet wide; 10,049 square feet/78\nfeet wide; and 14,579 square feet/111 feet wide. The staff report identified numerous (at\nleast 11) properties on Ocean Avenue that exceeded 8,000 square feet.\n              LPA’s counsel appeared at the May 8 City Council hearing. He asserted\nthe project was improperly defined as a lot merger, when in fact the project involved a lot\nmerger, demolition of two houses, and construction of a new house. He stated the two\n\n                                              6\n\flots had “historically significant dwellings” (the first mention of the existing homes),\nwhich he described as “Eichler style structures,” and thus he argued the project was not\ncategorically exempt from CEQA review. The City Attorney explained each of the\nactivities (lot merger, demolition, new construction) was categorically exempt “so the\nCity is not piecemealing them.” Additionally, the City Attorney explained, “We checked\nthe historical records, there’s no listing of it being a historical property in any of the\nregistries . . . . [LPA’s attorney] sort of speculates that there may be some historical\nvalue associated with these two properties and our thorough research of our records\ndo[es] not reveal any of that and there’s no evidence to that effect.” Another project\nopponent complained the lot merger would result in a decrease in the density required by\nthe CLUP—resulting in only 3.2 houses per acre, when the CLUP requires 6.0 to 9.9\nhouses per acre. City Council members responded that CLUP density applied over the\nentire area, not on a lot by lot basis. During the hearing, council members questioned if\nthere was any room for further negotiation between the Guidas and the neighbors. The\nGuidas agreed to attempt further discussions with the neighbors and the hearing was\ncontinued to June 26.\n              On June 13, 2012, the Guidas exercised their demolition permits and the\ntwo houses were demolished.\n              A letter dated June 22, 2012, written by Ruth Alter, owner of an archeology\nconsulting firm, is part of the administrative record. Alter wrote to LPA’s counsel she\nhad seen the two houses on June 2, 2012, and concluded the house at 2808\nOcean Boulevard “was likely the work of a quality designer or architect,” but she could\nnot attribute it to a specific individual without extensive research. Alter appeared at the\nJune 26 hearing and explained she had only been asked by LPA “to do a basic\npreliminary opinion assessment of the two properties.” She concluded there was nothing\nsignificant about the house at 2812 Ocean Boulevard. She described the house at 2808\nOcean Boulevard, as a “beautiful example” of “post and beam construction,” which was a\n\n                                               7\n\frare architectural style “almost always associated with a master designer or a master\narchitect.” She did not identify any particular master designer or master architect\nassociated with the house.\n               In its report for the June 26 hearing, City staff explained the houses on the\ntwo lots were demolished on June 13, pursuant to properly issued permits and because\nissuance of demolition permits is discretionary, it was not subject to CEQA. Staff\nadvised the lot merger was categorically exempt under class 5 (minor land alterations)\nand class 15 (minor land division), and the redevelopment of the new lot would be\nentitled to a class 3 (new construction of single-family residence) categorical exemption.\n               As to the historical resources question, staff explained there was no\ninformation as to who designed the two houses. The City’s permit history for the two\nlots established the houses were built between 1951 and 1953 by the J. Ray Construction\nCompany; the permits did not name the architect or developer and there were no related\nconstruction plans, and the houses were not listed on the City’s historic resources\ninventory list and not recognized as national, state, or local historical resources in the\nhistorical resources element of the City’s general plan.\n               As to the CLUP density issue, the staff report explained the CLUP density\nrange is representative of the predominant development of the entire area. The average\nlot size in the RSD-B area of old Corona del Mar was 4,846 square feet and the proposed\nlot merger would raise the average lot size to 4,857 square feet, which was within the\ndensity range.\n               The Guidas agreed to further development restrictions to be recorded on the\nmerged lot. Any new house would be subject to a floor area limit of 7,116 square feet\n(not including subterranean basement which by city code is not included in the floor area\nlimit), a height limit of 14 feet for the flat roof or top of the floor of the roof deck, front\nsetback of 20 feet, rear set back of 10 feet and side setbacks of six feet. The Planning\nDirector observed that unmerged and without the development restrictions under the\n\n                                                8\n\fzoning ordinance the two lots would be subject to only three-foot setbacks, a 24 to\n29 foot height limit, and up to 14,000 square feet combined of structures.\n              After closing the public hearing, the City Council, with one council\nmember dissenting, adopted Resolution No. 2012-52 approving the Guidas’ lot merger\nsubject to conditions including acceptance of the development restrictions the Guidas\noffered. The City Council found the lot merger was exempt from CEQA under CEQA\ncategorical exemptions classes 3, 5, and 15. It found the lot merger was consistent with\nthe CLUP because it would not cause the maximum density range for the RSD-B area to\nincrease. It found the new lot—80 feet wide and 13,678 square feet—would be\nconsistent with the surrounding pattern of development and would not create an\nexcessively large lot because other nearby lots on Ocean Boulevard have lot widths as\nwide as 73 feet and as large as 13,325 square feet. On June 28, 2012, the City posted its\nnotice of exemption stating the lot merger was categorically exempt from CEQA review.\nThe Petition for Writ of Mandate\n              On August 2, 2012, LPA filed the instant petition for a writ of mandate\nseeking to set aside approval of the lot merger contending the City violated CEQA by\nfinding the project was categorically exempt from CEQA review, violated its own lot\nmerger ordinance, violated the density restrictions imposed by the CLUP, and violated\nthe Coastal Act.

CLUP\n              LPA contends the City Council abused its discretion by approving the lot\nmerger because the construction of only one house on the 13,678 square foot lot would\n\n                                              10\n\fresult in a lower density/intensity of residential development than required by the CLUP\nfor the RSD-B category. We reject its contention.\n              Because the subject property is located in a coastal zone it is subject to\ndevelopment restrictions imposed by the Coastal Act. The Coastal Act establishes a\ncomprehensive framework for coastal planning. (§ 30000 et. seq.) It requires each local\ngovernment having coastal property within its territory to prepare a Local Coastal\nProgram to govern development in its coastal zone. (§§ 30108.6 & 30510.) A Local\nCoastal Program is comprised of the CLUP (Coastal Land Use Plan), which functions as\nthe general plan for the coastal zone, and the CLUP implementation measures that\ninclude the zoning, zoning maps, and implementing actions for the coastal zone.\n(§§ 30108.5, 30108.6.)\n              The Coastal Commission first approved the City’s CLUP in 2005. It “sets\nforth goals, objectives, and policies that govern the use of land and water in the [City’s]\ncoastal zone . . . .” (CLUP, § 1.1.) If there are conflicts between the policies expressed\nin the City’s CLUP and its general plan and zoning ordinance, “the policies of the\n[CLUP] shall take precedence. However, in no case, shall the policies of the [CLUP] be\ninterpreted to allow a development to exceed a development limit established by the\n[g]eneral [p]lan or its implementing ordinances.” (CLUP, § 1.3 (2), italics added.)\n              Chapter 2 of the City’s CLUP addresses coastal zone land use and\ndevelopment policies. Section 2.1, provides, “The [CLUP] was derived from the\nLand Use Element of the General Plan and is intended to identify the distribution of land\nuses in the coastal zone. The Land Use Element may contain more precise development\nlimits for specific properties. Should a conflict exist, the land use intensity or residential\ndensity limit that is most protective of coastal resources shall take precedence. However,\nin no case, shall the policies of the [CLUP] be interpreted to allow a development to\nexceed a development limit established by the General Plan or its implementing\nordinances.” (CLUP, § 2.1, italics added.)\n\n                                              11\n\f              Section 2.1.1 describes the coastal land use categories and describes the\n“type, density and intensity” of each land use. It begins by describing the categories of\n“Residential Neighborhoods” in the coastal zone, including four categories of single-unit\nresidential detached (RSD), which “category applies to a range of detached single-family\nresidential dwelling units on a single legal lot and does not include condominiums or\ncooperative housing.” The four RSD categories are the RSD-A category, described as\nhaving 0.0 to 5.9 dwelling units per acre; the RSD-B category, described as having 6.0 to\n9.9 dwelling units per acre; the RSD-C category, described as having 10.0 to 19.9\ndwelling units per acre; and the RSD-D category, described as having 20.0 to 29.9\ndwelling units per acre. The subject property is identified as being in the RSD-B\ncategory.\n              The gist of LPA’s argument is that by describing the RSD-B residential\nneighborhood category as one having between 6.0 and 9.9 dwelling units per acre, the\nCLUP mandates that each lot must individually meet that development density/intensity\nrequirement. Accordingly, although the zoning ordinance only specifies a minimum lot\nsize of 5,000 square feet and imposes no maximum lot size, the CLUP effectively\nrequires a minimum lot size in the RSD-B area of 4,400 square feet (i.e., 43,560 square\nfeet in one acre divided by the high end of the density range 9.9 equals 4,400), and sets a\nmaximum lot size of 7,260 (i.e., 43,560/6=7,260). Thus, LPA argues, the City cannot\napprove a lot merger that would result in any new lot larger than 7,260 square feet in the\nRSD-B area because it would result in a development density on that lot that is lower\nthan the minimum 6.0 dwelling units per acre required by the CLUP (i.e.,\n43,560/13,678=3.2 dwelling units per acre).\n              When this argument was made before the City Council, City staff explained\nthe CLUP density ranges were “representative of the predominant development of the\nentire area . . . .” Indeed, in the part of the CLUP pertaining to categorical exclusions\nfrom the coastal development permit provisions of the Coastal Act, the CLUP explains,\n\n                                             12\n\f“The permitted residential unit type and maximum density of the [CLUP] reflect the\npredominate form of development in these areas.” (CLUP, § 2.2.3.) The average lot size\nin the area was 4,846, and the merger would bring the average lot size up to 4,857, which\nkept the area in the specified density range. At the May 8, 2012, City Council meeting,\none council member observed density was not viewed “on a lot-by-lot\nbasis. . . . [D]ensity is something that’s applied over the entire old town area of Corona\ndel Mar, you have big lots. You have average lots, you’ve got small lots. So I think that\ndensity is meant to be applied over a much larger area, not a lot, not a block, but a much\nlarger area . . . .” The City Council’s findings in support of the resolution approving the\nlot merger (Resolution 2012-52) included a finding the merger was consistent with the\napplicable regulations including the CLUP. Among the facts supporting that finding\nwere that the CLUP density range was representative of the predominant development in\nthe entire old Corona del Mar area and the merger “does not cause the maximum density\nfor the area to be exceeded.”\n              We conclude the City reasonably interpreted its CLUP as describing the\ndensity range for the RSD-B area, by which a development must be additionally assessed,\nand not as imposing a maximum individual lot size so as to achieve a specific density\nrange on an individual lot. The City’s interpretation controls unless it is clearly\nerroneous. (See Anderson First Coalition v.

Pacific Palisades held the conversion\nof a mobilehome park from tenant occupancy to resident ownership is a “development”\nfor purposes of the Coastal Act, and thus subject to the Coastal Commission’s permitting\nauthority. The relevant provision in the Coastal Act, section 39106, defines a\n“‘[d]evelopment,’” for which a coastal development permit would be required, as\nincluding a “change in the density or intensity of use of land, including, but not limited\nto . . . any . . . division of land, including lot splits . . . .” The property owner argued a\nmobilehome park conversion was not a “development” because it did not change the\ndensity or intensity of the land use. In rejecting that contention, the Supreme Court\nconcluded an increase or decrease in intensity of the land use was a “change” constituting\na “development.” (Pacific Palisades, supra, 55 Cal.4th at p. 795.) The mobilehome park\nconversion from rental to resident ownership could theoretically decrease\ndensity/intensity of use “by limiting public access to the coastline or reducing the number\nof lots available for residential purposes . . . .” (Ibid.) And it could theoretically increase\ndensity/intensity of land use by “lead[ing] to problematic design features as owners\nexpress their individuality by decorating or adding to their mobilehomes. Nor is it\nimpossible that owners would block public access to coastal areas or increase the number\nof residents in their units.” (Id. at p. 797.)\n               We fail to see how Pacific Palisades furthers LPA’s position. It dealt with\nthe proper interpretation of a statute, not with how a local agency interprets and applies\nits own land use implementing documents. Pacific Palisades offers no guidance on\nwhether the City’s conclusion its CLUP’s description of the applicable density/intensity\nrange for a residential neighborhood is viewed in a macro sense (the range for the entire\narea) or a micro sense (the exact density that must be achieved on each individual lot).\n               LPA also relies on deBottari v.

In deBottari, a city approved\na general plan amendment of the land use designation from one allowing zero to two\nresidential units per acre, to one allowing three to four. It also approved a zoning\nordinance amendment changing the minimum lot size from 18,000 square feet (about two\nunits per acre) to 10,000 square feet (about four units per acre). (Id. at p. 1207.)

There is no inconsistency between the City’s interpretation of its LCUP, which\ndescribes a density range for the RSD-B area, its general plan designation of\nsingle-family residential, and its zoning ordinance which requires a minimum lot size of\n5,000 square feet.\n              If anything, LPA’s “simple math”/consistency argument underscores why\nthe City’s interpretation of its CLUP is reasonable and LPA’s is not. LPA’s argument is\npremised on their assumption that by describing a density range for the residential\nneighborhood category, by applying simple math, a maximum individual lot size can be\nextrapolated. In the case of the RSD-B area, LPA contend because the low end of the\ndensity range is 6.0 dwelling units per acre, the maximum lot size is 7,260 square feet.\n(We note the City’s staff identified numerous properties on Ocean Avenue in the CLUP’s\nRSD-B area that exceeded 8,000 square feet.) Consistency requires the same simple\nmath be applied to the CLUP’s other residential neighborhood categories. That would\nmean in the RSD-C area, described as having a density range of 10 to 19.9 dwelling units\nper acre, the maximum legal lot size would be 4,356 square feet—even though the City’s\nzoning ordinance sets a minimum legal lot size of 5,000 square feet (or 6,000 square feet\n\n                                             15\n\ffor a corner lot). And in the RSD-D zone, with a density range of 20 to 29.9 dwelling\nunits per acre, applying LPA’s reasoning, the maximum legal lot size would be 2,178\nsquare feet or roughly one-third to one-half of the minimum legal lot size specified by the\nzoning ordinance. LPA’s interpretation would render the CLUP irreconcilable with the\nzoning ordinance—with one setting a maximum lot size well below the minimum lot size\nrequired by the other. The City’s interpretation avoids such an absurdity. In short, the\nCity correctly determined the lot merger would not run afoul of the CLUP because after\naccounting for the larger lot, the housing density in the area remained within the CLUP’s\ndensity range.\n3. CEQA Issues\n              LPA attacks the City’s findings the lot merger was categorically exempt\nfrom CEQA review. We reject its contentions.\na.

Categorical Exemptions\n              The City found the lot merger was exempt from CEQA review under\nGuidelines section 15305 (class 5), which applies to any “minor alterations in land use\nlimitations in areas with an average slope of less than 20%, which do not result in any\nchanges in land use or density, including but not limited to: [¶] (a) Minor lot line\nadjustments, side yard, and set back variances not resulting in the creation of any new\nparcel; [¶] (b) Issuance of minor encroachment permits; [or] (c) Reversion to acreage in\naccordance with the Subdivision Map Act.” Additionally, the City found the lot merger\nwas exempt under Guidelines section 15315 (class 15), which applies to “the division of\nproperty in urbanized areas zoned for residential . . . use into four or fewer parcels when\n\n                                             17\n\fthe division is in conformance with the General Plan and zoning, no variances or\nexceptions are required, all services and access to the proposed parcels to local standards\nare available, the parcel was not involved in a division of a larger parcel within the\nprevious 2 years, and the parcel does not have an average slope greater than 20 percent.”\nThe City also found, to the extent the lot merger approval precedes construction of a new\nresidence, it was exempt under Guidelines section 15303 (class 3), which applies to\n“construction and location of limited numbers of new, small facilities or structures,” an\nexemption that specifically includes “one single-family residence,” on a legal parcel in a\nresidential zone.”\n              “‘[T]he substantial evidence test governs our review of the [agency’s]\nfactual determination that a project falls within a categorical exemption.’ [Citation.]”\n(San Lorenzo Valley Community Advocates for Responsible Education v.

As the trial court noted in its statement of decision, at trial, LPA “barely\nacknowledge [the class 15] exemption and have not challenged it on the merits.”\n              LPA argues the class 5 exemption can only be applied if the lot merger will\n“not result in any changes in land use or density.” It argues the lot merger will result in a\nchange in density because it will decrease the density of development on the lot below\nthat required by the CLUP. We have already addressed and rejected the faulty premise\nfor LPA’s reasoning above. The City found the lot merger would not change the land use\nor density because the merged lot remained within the general plan (and zoning\nordinances) single-unit residential detached zoning designation. Additionally, there was\nno change in density because as merged the lot was consistent with the 6.0-9.9 dwelling\nunits per acre density/intensity range called for in the CLUP. Substantial evidence\nsupports its finding the class 5 exemption applied.\n\n                                             18\n\f              Even were we to agree with LPA that the class 5 exemption did not apply,\nas we have noted it has not challenged the City’s application of the class 15 exemption to\nthe lot merger. Nor has it challenged the City’s determination the class 3 exemption\napplies to any new construction on the merged lot. Accordingly, LPA has waived any\nargument those categorical exemptions do not apply.\n              Moreover, in their respondents’ briefs on appeal, the City and the Guidas\npoint out there are several other applicable categorical exemptions beyond those listed in\nthe City’s notice of exemption. (These additional categorical exemptions were also\nraised by the City and the Guidas in the trial court and most were mentioned in the\nvarious staff reports contained in the administrative record.) (See California Farm\nBureau Federation v. California Wildlife Conservation Bd. (2006) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">143</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

LPA does not reply to the City’s and the Guidas’ arguments\nconcerning the applicability of these categorical exemptions. The demolition of the\noriginal houses was categorically exempt under Guidelines section 15301, subdivision (l)\n(class 1), which applies to “[d]emolition and removal of individual small structures listed\nin this subdivision; [¶] (1) One single-family residence. In urbanized areas, up to three\nsingle-family residences may be demolished under this exemption.” The demolition of\nthe original houses and construction of a new house is categorically exempt under\nGuidelines section 15302 (class 2), which applies to “replacement or reconstruction of\nexisting structures and facilities where the new structure will be located on the same site\nas the structure replaced and will have substantially the same purpose and capacity as the\nstructure replaced.” And the demolition, lot merger, and reconstruction of the houses\nwere categorically exempt under Guidelines section 15332 (class 32), which “consists of\nprojects characterized as in-fill development” provided the project is consistent with the\ngeneral plan and zoning, is on a site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded\nby urban uses, the site is not an endangered species habitat, there will be no significant\n\n                                             19\n\feffects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality, and the site can be\nadequately served by all required utilities and public services.\n               In sum, there is substantial evidence supporting the City’s determination\nthe lot merger application was categorically exempt from CEQA review. Accordingly,\nwe turn to the issue of whether an exception to categorical exemption applied.\nc. Historical Resources Exception\n               LPA contends that even if one of the foregoing categorical exemptions\napplies, the “historical resources” exception precludes the use of a categorical exemption\nto avoid CEQA review in this case. We disagree.\n               If an agency finds, “‘“based on substantial evidence in the record, that the\nproject falls within a categorical exemption,”’” a party challenging that finding must\npresent evidence an exception to the exemption is applicable.

As relevant, Guidelines\nsection 15300.2, subdivisions (c) and (f), provides a categorical exemption cannot be\nused “where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect\non the environment due to unusual circumstances” or for “a project which may cause a\nsubstantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.” Although LPA\nrefers to both the unusual circumstances and the historical resources exception, they\nanalyze only the latter.\n               “There is a split of authority on the appropriate standard of judicial review\nof a question of fact when the issue is whether a project that would otherwise be found\ncategorically exempt is subject to one of [the] . . . exceptions. . . . ‘Some courts . . . hold[]\nthat a finding of categorical exemption cannot be sustained if there is a “fair argument”\nbased on substantial evidence that the project will have significant environmental\nimpacts, even where the agency is presented with substantial evidence to the contrary.\n[Citation.] Other courts apply an ordinary substantial evidence test . . . deferring to the\nexpress or implied findings of the local agency that has found a categorical exemption\n\n                                               20\n\fapplicable. [Citations.]’” (Hines, supra, 186 Cal.App.4th at pp. 855-856.) The question\nof the correct standard is currently pending before our Supreme Court. (Berkeley Hillside\nPreservation v. City of Berkeley, rev. granted May 23, 2012, S201116.) We need not\nresolve this issue because even applying the less deferential “fair argument” standard, we\nfind there is simply no substantial evidence to support LPA’s contention the historical\nresources exception applies.\n              Preliminarily, we fail to see why LPA’s argument the original houses were\nhistorical resources is not moot, given they were demolished pursuant to validly issued\ndemolition permits that were not timely challenged by LPA. LPA, in passing, asserts that\neven though houses were demolished, a reconstructive historical survey could be\nperformed to assess their importance (i.e., a “paper reconstruction”). And because the\nCity did not address historical significance of the two houses, the magnitude of the\nimpact of their demolition remains in question. But as the trial court recognized at the\nhearing below, given that issuance of the demolition permits was a ministerial act, they\nwere not challenged, and were lawfully acted upon, “I don’t think you can come back\ntoday and after something has been pulverized say, well, it was historical.”\n              Moreover, even if the original houses still stood, LPA could not prevail. As\nnoted above, “[a] categorical exemption shall not be used for a project which may cause a\nsubstantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.” (Guidelines,\n§ 15300.2, subd. (f).) As observed in Valley Advocates v. City of Fresno (2008)\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2279770\"><a href=\"/opinion/2279770/valley-advocates-v-city-of-fresno/\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1051 (Valley Advocates), there are three relevant categories:\n“(1) mandatory historical resources, (2) presumptive historical resources and\n(3) discretionary historical resources.” To qualify as a mandatory or presumptive\nhistorical resource, the structures must have been listed on state or local registers of\nhistorical resources, or identified as historically significant in an historical resources\nsurvey. (Id. at pp. 1051-1054; § 21084.1; Guidelines, § 15064.5.) It is undisputed the\noriginal houses met none of the requirements to be considered mandatory or presumptive\n\n                                              21\n\fhistorical resources. They were not listed on any national, state, or local list of\nhistorical resources, nor were they on any survey of historical resources.\n              LPA apparently relies on the City’s discretion to consider a structure as a\nhistorical resource even if not officially designated as such. But that category does not\napply because there is no substantial evidence to support LPA’s contention the houses\nwere historical resources. The only pre-demolition evidence came at the May 8, 2012,\nCity Council meeting, when counsel for LPA claimed the two lots had “Eichler style\nstructures” on them and therefore were “historical resource[s].” In response, the City\nAttorney explained, “We checked the historical records, there’s no listing of it being a\nhistorical property in any of the registries . . . [Petitioners’ attorney] sort of speculates\nthat there may be some historical value associated with these two properties and our\nthorough research of our records do[es] not reveal any of that and there’s no evidence to\nthat effect.” The houses were demolished on June 13, 2012, pursuant to the validly\nissued and unchallenged demolition permits. In a letter dated June 22, LPA’s expert,\nAlter, wrote to Petitioners’ counsel the house at 2808 Ocean Boulevard was “likely the\nwork of a quality designer or architect,” but she could not identify any particular designer\nor architect. At the June 26 hearing, Alter stated the house at 2812 Ocean Boulevard was\nnothing extraordinary, but the house at 2808 Ocean Boulevard was a “beautiful example”\nof “post and beam construction,” an architectural style “almost always associated with a\nmaster designer or a master architect,” but again she did not identify any particular\nmaster designer or master architect associated with the house. LPA’s\npost-demolition evidence the houses were a style of architecture normally associated\nwith a “master designer or master architect” is not substantial evidence the houses had\nany historical significance or were historical resources. In its report for the June 26\nhearing, City staff explained the City’s permit history for the two lots showed the houses\nwere built between 1951 and 1953 by the J. Ray Construction Company, there was no\nrecord containing the name of the developer or architect, the houses were not listed on the\n\n                                               22\n\fCity’s Historic Resource Inventory or lists compiled by the City’s Ad Hoc Historic\nPreservation Advisory Committee, and the houses were not recognized as national state\nor local historical resources in the City’s Historical Resources Element of the General\nPlan. The City was entitled to rely on the expertise of planning staff (Porterville Citizens\nfor Responsible Hillside Development v. City of Porterville (2007) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2255316\"><a href=\"/opinion/2255316/porterville-citizens-v-city-of-porterville/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

Piecemealing\n              LPA’s final CEQA argument is one of improper project “piecemealing.”\nThey accuse the City of improperly considering the demolition of the existing houses\nseparately from the lot merger application so as to avoid CEQA review.\n              Ordinarily issuance of a building or demolition permit is a ministerial\nproject and exempt from CEQA. (Adams Point Preservation Society v. City of Oakland\n(1987) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2107617\"><a href=\"/opinion/2107617/adams-point-preservation-soc-v-city-of-oakland/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 206-208; Guidelines, § 15268.) But LPA argues the project\nshould be viewed as the demolition and the lot merger combined. And because approval\nof the latter was a discretionary action, the entire project was discretionary and thus\nsubject to CEQA. (See Guidelines, §§ 15268, subd. (d) [“Where a project involves an\napproval that contains elements of both a ministerial action and a discretionary action, the\nproject will be deemed to be discretionary and will be subject to the requirements of\nCEQA”], 15378, subd. (a) [“‘[p]roject’ means the whole of an action, which has a\npotential for resulting in either a direct [or indirect] physical change in the environment”],\n15378, subd. (c) [“project” means the activity being approved and not each separate\ngovernmental approval].) LPA asserts the demolition was improperly segregated from\nthe lot merger to avoid CEQA review.\n              Although an agency cannot divide a project into separate parts to avoid\nCEQA review, when each aspect is categorically exempt the combined effect of the\nexemptions places the entire project outside the scope of CEQA.

Here, even if viewed as discretionary rather than ministerial,\nthe demolition of the two houses was categorically exempt (see Guidelines, § 15301,\nsubd. (l) [class 1 exemption for demolition and removal of individual small structures\nincluding up to three single-family residences in urbanized areas]), and as already\nexplained there is no substantial evidence the houses were historical resources so as to\nrequire application of any of the exceptions to application of those categorical\nexemptions. Similarly, as already explained the lot merger was categorically exempt.\nLPA offers no explanation as to why the combined effect of the categorical exemptions\nwould not take the project, as defined by LPA, out of CEQA’s scope.3\n4. Violation of City’s Lot Merger Ordinance\n              LPA argues approval of the lot merger violated the City’s lot merger\nordinance codified in Municipal Code chapter 19.68. The argument is completely\nunsupported by any citation to legal authorities or any cogent analysis. Instead, LPA\nrefers us to the “well developed” argument it included in its opening brief filed in the trial\ncourt (which we note consisted of a scant 11 sentences and was similarly unsupported by\ncitation to authority or legal analysis). For that reason alone, we consider the argument\nwaived. “‘Appellate briefs must provide argument and legal authority for the positions\ntaken. “When an appellant fails to raise a point, or asserts it but fails to support it with\nreasoned argument and citations to authority, we treat the point as waived.”’ [Citation.]\n‘We are not bound to develop appellants’ argument for them. [Citation.] The absence of\ncogent legal argument or citation to authority allows this court to treat the contention as\n\n\n3            For this reason, we need not consider the Guidas’ argument LPA failed to\nexhaust administrative remedies as to the demolition permits, or that any challenge to\nthem is untimely.\n\n                                              24\n\fwaived.’ [Citations.]” (Cahill v. San Diego Gas & Electric Co. (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">939</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 956 (Cahill).)\n              Moreover, the argument is without merit. In its opening brief LPA\nspecifically refers to the required findings that “[t]he lots as merged will be consistent\nwith the pattern of development nearby and will not result in a lot width, depth or\norientation, or development site that is incompatible with nearby lots[,]” and “[a]pproval\nof the [lot] merger will not . . . be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements\nin the neighborhood or the general welfare of the City[.]” (Mun. Code § 19.68.030\n(H)(1) & (5).) The gist of its argument seems to be because the Planning Commission\noriginally found those findings could not be made, and that conclusion was later reached\nby the one dissenting council member, the City Council could not make the requisite\nfindings.\n              But in its resolution approving the lot merger, the City Council made all\nfindings required by its lot merger ordinance.4 As to the findings raised by LPA, the City\n\n\n4              Municipal Code section 19.68.030 sets forth the findings required for\napproval of a lot merger. They include: “1. Approval of the merger will not, under the\ncircumstances of this particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, peace, comfort\nand general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of such proposed\nuse or be detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or\nthe general welfare of the City, and further that the proposed lot merger is consistent with\nthe legislative intent of [this title]; and [¶] 2. The lots to be merged are under common fee\nownership at the time of the merger; and [¶] 3. The lots as merged will be consistent or\nwill be more closely compatible with the applicable zoning regulations and will be\nconsistent with other regulations relating to the subject property including, but not limited\nto, the General Plan and any applicable Coastal Plan or Specific Plan; and [¶] 4. Neither\nthe lots as merged nor adjoining parcels will be deprived of legal access as a result of the\nmerger; and [¶] 5. The lots as merged will be consistent with the surrounding pattern of\ndevelopment and will not create an excessively large lot that is not compatible with the\nsurrounding development. In making this finding, the review authority may consider the\nfollowing: [¶] Whether development of the merged lots could significantly deviate from\nthe pattern of development of adjacent and/or adjoining lots in a manner that would result\nin an unreasonable detriment to the use and enjoyment of other properties. [¶] Whether\nthe merged lots would be consistent with the character or general orientation of adjacent\n\n                                             25\n\fCouncil found approval of the lot merger would not be detrimental or injurious to\nproperty and improvements in the neighborhood or the general welfare of the City\nbecause future development would comply with the zoning ordinance development\nstandards, the merger would not impact public views of the ocean (because no public\nviews existed), the merger would result in a legal building site, the merger would not\nresult in creation of additional parcels, and there would be no change in land use or\nincrease in density. The City Council also found the lots as merged would be consistent\nwith the surrounding pattern of development and would not create an excessively large\nlot or a lot that was incompatible with the surrounding development because the area lots\nwere of “varying shapes and sizes”; as merged, the subject lot would have a “width of\n80 feet and area of 13,678 square feet”; and “[o]ther nearby lots on Ocean Boulevard\nhave lot widths as wide as 73 feet and area as large as 13,325 square feet.” We must\naccord great deference to the City’s findings the lot merger is consistent with its\nMunicipal Code. (Anderson First Coalition v. City of Anderson (2005) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2245770\"><a href=\"/opinion/2245770/anderson-coalition-v-city-of-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1192.) LPA has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate the City’s findings are\nunsupported by the record.5\n5. Coastal Act\n              LPA contends approval of the lot merger violated the Coastal Act. The\nargument is completely devoid of any legal analysis or citation to authority—LPA does\nnot cite a single provision of the Coastal Act or explain how it was violated by approval\nof the lot merger. Although LPA refers to the Commission’s CEO-E-77-5 excluding the\ndemolition and construction of single-family homes from Coastal Commission review,\n\n\nand/or adjoining lots. [¶] Whether the merged lots would be conforming or in greater\nconformity with the minimum lot width and area standards for the zoning district.”\n\n5              In their reply brief, LPA asserts the other large lots in the area all predate\nthe City’s lot merger ordinance and its CLUP, and this lot will be the largest created by a\nmerger. They cite no evidence in the administrative record to support this claim.\n\n                                             26\n\fthey have failed to offer any explanation as to how the Coastal Act has been violated.\nAccordingly, we treat the argument as waived. (Cahill, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p. 956\n[“‘We are not bound to develop appellants’ argument for them’”].)\n6. Augmentation of Administrative Record\n              Finally, in a three-sentence argument, LPA contends the trial court abused\nits discretion by denying its request to augment the administrative record. It offers\nabsolutely no explanation as to what documents it sought to add or what relevance they\nhad to the issues below. There is no legal analysis as to whether the documents were\nitems that should have been included on in the administrative record in the first instance\n(see § 21167.6, subd. (e) [describing contents of administrative record]), other than\nLPA’s single sentence stating there is no evidence in the administrative record\ndemonstrating the documents were not among the documents submitted to the City.\nMore significantly, it offers no explanation as how it was prejudiced by the absence of\nthe unidentified documents from the administrative record. The argument is waived.\n(Cahill, supra, 194 Cal.App.4th at p. 956.)\n                                      DISPOSITION\n              The judgment is affirmed. Respondents and Real Parties in Interest are\nawarded their costs on appeal.\n\n\n                                                   O’LEARY, P.
