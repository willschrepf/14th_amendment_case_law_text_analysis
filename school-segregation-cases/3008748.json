STEWART, Chief Judge:\n      This case involves a lengthy history of desegregation litigation between\nthe United States, Intervenor-Defendant-Appellee Simpson County School\nDistrict   (the   “District”),   and   Intervenors-Plaintiffs-Appellants     (the\n“Intervenors”), a class representing current and future students attending the\nDistrict’s schools. In 2013, the District moved for unitary status in the only\narea of its school system remaining under federal supervision: faculty and staff\nassignments. The United States and the Intervenors objected. After a two-\nday hearing and post-hearing submissions, the district court denied unitary\nstatus based on the District’s noncompliance with the court’s desegregation\norder. Both the District and the Intervenors moved for reconsideration, and\nthe district court denied both motions. The Intervenors now appeal the district\ncourt’s order denying unitary status and order denying reconsideration. We\nconclude that the Intervenors lack standing to appeal and, therefore, DISMISS\nthe Intervenors’ appeal without regard to the merits.\n                                       I.\n      Although we do not reach the merits of the decisions below, a general\noverview of the history of this case is necessary to understand the narrow issue\nwe resolve today. For over forty years, the District has been under a federal\ncourt order to desegregate its schools. In July 1970, the United States sued\nthe State of Mississippi and several of its school districts, including the\nDistrict, alleging each had violated the Fourteenth Amendment by operating\nschool systems that discriminated based on race. On August 11, 1970, the\ndistrict court entered its first desegregation order (the “1970 Order”) approving\na school desegregation plan and obligating the District to follow procedures\ndesigned to end discrimination in faculty and staff assignments, student\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430     Page: 3   Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-60542\ntransfers, transportation, school construction and site selection, and school\nactivities. The 1970 Order also required the District to submit bi-annual\nreports to the court, including, inter alia, information related to the racial\ncomposition of the District’s students and teachers.\n      In June 1982, Intervenors Cynthia Fletcher, Gloria Barnes, and David\nBarnes, then minor students attending the District’s schools, and their\nrepresentatives filed a class action complaint against the District for failing to\ncomply with the 1970 Order. The Intervenors alleged that the District had\ncontinued to maintain segregated schools by allowing white students to attend\nschools outside of their designated geographical zone thereby creating\ndisproportionate ratios of black to white students within certain zones.     The\nIntervenors also alleged that the District continued to discriminate in\nemployment decisions, student discipline, and student placement in special\neducation and gifted-student programs.\n      In August 1983, after negotiations between the United States, the\nIntervenors, and the District, the district court entered a second desegregation\norder (the “1983 Consent Decree”) outlining further procedures the District\nwas to follow to end discrimination in its schools. Notably, with respect to\nemployment practices, the 1983 Consent Decree required the District to\nadvertise available positions, use standard employment forms, use objective\nrating criteria to review applications and score interviewees, and offer\navailable positions to the highest-scoring applicant regardless of race. The\n1983 Consent Decree further required the District to provide the United States\nand the Intervenors with notice of any proposed change to the District’s\nemployment procedures at least sixty days before the District formally adopted\nthe change. Finally, the 1983 Consent Decree broadened the District’s bi-\nannual reporting requirements to include, inter alia, the racial composition of\njob applicants, new hires, and demoted, terminated, or non-renewed employees\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 14-60542       Document: 00513253430     Page: 4    Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-60542\nand any action taken by the District that was inconsistent with the 1983\nConsent Decree, “includ[ing], for example, any effort to hire or promote an\nindividual who is not the most qualified person available for the position being\nfilled.”\n       In 2001, the District moved for unitary status for the first time since\nfederal supervision began in 1970.            The United States responded, only\nobjecting to a declaration of unitary status in the area of faculty and staff\nassignments; the Intervenors did not respond or otherwise object. Absent an\nobjection from the United States or the Intervenors and based on its\nindependent review of the evidence, the district court granted unitary status\nin all areas except faculty and staff assignments. The court denied unitary\nstatus     in   faculty   and   staff   assignments    based    on    the   District’s\nacknowledgement that it had violated the 1983 Consent Decree regarding\ncertain employment issues. This court affirmed the district court’s decision on\nappeal. United States v. Mississippi, 211 F. App’x 296 (5th Cir. 2006).\n       On April 5, 2011, on the United States and the District’s joint motion,\nand with no objection from the Intervenors, the district court entered a third\ndesegregation order (the “2011 Consent Decree”), which generally embraced\nthe employment procedures in the 1983 Consent Decree, but further specified\nthe mechanics by which the District was to make employment decisions in\nseveral respects.     Under the 2011 Consent Decree, the District’s Human\nResources Director was required to review and numerically score written job\napplications based on certain objective criteria. The District’s Superintendent\nor a school’s principal was required to interview the highest-scoring applicant\nas well as any other “applicant[] with a score higher than that of the lowest-\nscoring applicant selected for an interview,” unless certain exceptions applied.\nInterviewed applicants received a second numerical score based on certain\nsubjective criteria. The subjective interview score was added to the objective\n                                          4\n\f     Case: 14-60542       Document: 00513253430          Page: 5     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-60542\napplication score, and the District was required to offer the position to the\napplicant with the highest composite score unless “a legitimate negative reason\nexists not to hire the applicant.” 1\n       Before the District offered a position to a lower-scoring applicant, it was\nrequired to provide the United States and the Intervenors with all application\nmaterials related to the position in question and a statement explaining why\nthe District had chosen not to offer the position to the highest-scoring\napplicant. The United States and the Intervenors could then object in writing. 2\nIn the absence of a written objection, the District’s decision to hire the lower-\nscoring applicant became final.             However, if the United States or the\nIntervenors timely objected, the District was required to provide the United\nStates and the Intervenors with the opportunity to object in the district court.\n       In November 2011, the United States moved to enjoin the District from\nviolating the terms of the 2011 Consent Decree, alleging that, on at least\nnineteen occasions, the District had hired individuals that were not the\nhighest-scoring applicant without providing the United States with an\nopportunity to object. In January 2012, the district court granted the motion\nbased on the District’s admission that it had not satisfied the notice\n\n\n\n\n       1 The 2011 Consent Decree provides some examples of “legitimate reasons” for the\nDistrict not to hire the highest-scoring applicant: “Such a negative reason would exist, for\ninstance, if upon checking references the applicant receives negative comments such as\nneeding improvement or unacceptable performance, if the applicant has provided false or\nmisleading information about his or her certifications or about any other information on the\njob application, if the applicant does not satisfy the criminal background/child abuse registry\ncheck required by state law, or if the applicant has been terminated or non-renewed for good\ncause from any previous job or position. The District may not, however, fail to hire the\nhighest overall-rated applicant only because it favors a lower-rated applicant.”\n       2 The Intervenors could also object to the District’s hiring of a highest-scoring\n\napplicant if that applicant did not also have the highest objective application score.\n                                              5\n\f     Case: 14-60542      Document: 00513253430         Page: 6    Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-60542\nrequirements in the 2011 Consent Decree. The district court extended the\nterm of the 2011 Consent Decree to October 15, 2012. 3\n       On January 30, 2013, the District moved for unitary status in the\nremaining area of faculty and staff assignments. The United States did not\nobject. Despite a long absence from the litigation, the Intervenors filed an\nobjection challenging whether the District had complied with court orders and\nseeking discovery and a public hearing.               The district court denied the\nIntervenors’ discovery requests but granted the Intervenors’ request for a\nhearing. Several days later, the court entered an order setting a hearing on\nthe District’s motion, outlining the requirements for providing notice of the\nhearing to the community, and establishing a process for community members\nto submit objections to the District’s motion.\n       During the public objections period, the district court received over 500\nobjections to the District’s motion. A large number of these objections were\ngeneric in form or merely stated “I object.” However, some objectors detailed\nspecific hiring or termination incidents and were permitted to testify to those\nincidents over the course of a two-day fairness hearing in January 2014. At\nthe conclusion of the fairness hearing, the court held the District’s motion in\nabeyance pending the filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law\nby the United States, the Intervenors, and the District. In these filings, both\nthe United States and the Intervenors requested, inter alia, that the court\n\n\n\n\n       3 At oral argument, counsel for the District made several confounding statements\nsuggesting that the district court entered a new consent decree in 2012 and that this “2012\nConsent Decree” is at issue in this appeal. As counsel later clarified, the district court’s\nJanuary 2012 order merely extended the term of the 2011 Consent Decree without alteration\nor modification. See Opinion and Order at 3, United States v. Mississippi, No. 3:70-cv-4706-\nWHB-LRA (S.D. Miss. Jan. 10, 2012), ECF No. 48 (“The term of the Consent Decree entered\nby the Court on April 5, 2011, is hereby extended up to and including October 15, 2012.”\n(internal citation omitted)).\n                                             6\n\f     Case: 14-60542       Document: 00513253430         Page: 7     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-60542\nappoint an independent monitor to oversee the District’s compliance with the\n2011 Consent Decree.\n       On April 30, 2014, the district court denied unitary status based on the\nDistrict’s failure to comply with the 2011 Consent Decree, citing, as one\nexample of noncompliance, the District’s modification of its Interview Guide\nand Assessment forms without first providing the United States and the\nIntervenors with notice of the proposed change. The court therefore extended\nthe 2011 Consent Decree to March 15, 2015, at which time the District could\nagain move for unitary status. 4            The court denied as unwarranted the\nIntervenors’ and the United States’ requested amendments to the 2011\nConsent Decree, including the request for a court-appointed monitor.\n       The District and the Intervenors each moved for reconsideration of the\ndistrict court’s order denying unitary status. The District argued that only the\nemployment provisions of the 2011 Consent Decree that the court found the\nDistrict to have violated should be extended and requested that the court limit\nfuture objections to unitary status to that basis. The Intervenors challenged\nthe court’s legal analysis and evidentiary determinations. The court disagreed\nwith both parties’ contentions and denied the motions for reconsideration.\n       The Intervenors timely appealed the district court’s order denying\nunitary status and order denying reconsideration. 5\n                                             II.\n       Ordinarily, our review of this appeal would be guided by well-established\ndesegregation principles. Following the Supreme Court’s decisions in Brown I\nand Brown II, school districts were charged with an “affirmative duty to . . .\n\n\n\n       4 After this court heard oral arguments, the District again moved for full unitary\nstatus on September 17, 2015. Soon thereafter, the district court stayed the District’s motion\npending our resolution of this appeal.\n       5 The United States is not a party to this appeal.\n\n                                              7\n\f    Case: 14-60542      Document: 00513253430        Page: 8    Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-60542\nconvert” their segregated education systems into “a unitary system in which\nracial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch.” Green v. Cty. Sch.\nBd. of New Kent Cty., Va., 391 U.S. 430, 435–38 (1968). This affirmative duty,\nand the federal court supervision it required, was not intended to exist in\nperpetuity. See Bd. of Educ. of Okla. City Pub. Sch., Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 89,\nOkla. Cty., Okla. v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237, 247–48 (1991). Instead, “the ultimate\nobjective . . . [is] to return school districts to the control of local authorities . . .\n[once] shown that the school district has attained the requisite degree of\ncompliance.” Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467, 489–90 (1992).\n      “The ultimate inquiry in determining whether a school district is unitary\nis whether (1) the school district has complied in good faith with desegregation\norders for a reasonable amount of time, and (2) the school district has\neliminated the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable.”\nAnderson v. Sch. Bd. of Madison Cty., 517 F.3d 292, 297 (5th Cir. 2008)\n(footnote omitted). The compliance prong requires a school district to show\nthat it has consistently complied with the court’s desegregation orders in good\nfaith. Id. A school district has eliminated the vestiges of past discrimination\nto the extent practicable when it has made “every reasonable effort . . . to\neradicate segregation and its insidious residue.” Id. at 298 (quoting Ross v.\nHouston Indep. Sch. Dist., 699 F.2d 218, 227–28 (5th Cir. 1983)).\n      To demonstrate that it is unitary with respect to faculty and staff\nassignments, a school district must establish that its “current employment\npractices [are] non-discriminatory and in compliance with constitutional\nstandards” and that “the adverse effects of any earlier, unlawful employment\npractices . . . have been adequately remedied.” Fort Bend Indep. Sch. Dist. v.\nCity of Stafford, 651 F.2d 1133, 1140 (5th Cir. 1981). This court has also\nrequired a showing that the racial composition of a school’s faculty and staff\ndoes “not indicate that the school is intended for either African-American or\n                                           8\n\f     Case: 14-60542       Document: 00513253430          Page: 9     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-60542\nwhite students.” Anderson, 517 F.3d at 303. We have cautioned, however,\n“that these requirements do not establish an arbitrary racial quota.” Id.\n       Notwithstanding these desegregation guideposts, this case comes before\nus with an unusual procedural posture—the Intervenors, not the District,\nappeal the district court’s denial of unitary status. See, e.g., E.E.O.C. v. Chi.\nClub, 86 F.3d 1423, 1431 (7th Cir. 1996) (“It is unusual, although not\nimpermissible, for a party to appeal from a judgment in which it prevailed.”).\nThis wrinkle raises the “threshold question” of whether the Intervenors have\nstanding to appeal the district court’s favorable rulings. Zente v. Credit Mgmt.,\nL.P., 789 F.3d 601, 603–04 (5th Cir. 2015).\n       “It is a central tenet of appellate jurisdiction that a party who is not\naggrieved by a judgment of the district court has no standing to appeal it.” 6\nWard v. Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist., 393 F.3d 599, 603 (5th Cir. 2004). “A party\nwho receives all that he has sought generally is not aggrieved by the judgment\naffording the relief and cannot appeal from it.” Deposit Guar. Nat’l Bank,\nJackson, Miss. v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 333 (1980); cf. Forney v. Apfel, 524 U.S.\n266, 271 (1998) (“[T]his Court also has clearly stated that a party is ‘aggrieved’\nand ordinarily can appeal a decision ‘granting in part and denying in part the\nremedy requested.’” (quoting United States v. Jose, 519 U.S. 54, 56 (1996) (per\ncuriam))). Moreover, because appellate courts review judgments, not opinions,\nsee Ward, 393 F.3d at 603, “[a] party may not appeal from a judgment or decree\nin his favor, for the purpose of obtaining a review of findings he deems\nerroneous which are not necessary to support the decree.” Roper, 445 U.S. at\n335 (quoting Elec. Fittings Corp. v. Thomas & Betts Co., 307 U.S. 241, 242\n\n\n\n       6This “rule is one of federal appellate practice, however, derived from the statutes\ngranting appellate jurisdiction and the historic practices of the appellate courts; it does not\nhave its source in the jurisdictional limitations of Art. III.” Deposit Guar. Nat’l Bank,\nJackson, Miss. v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 333–34 (1980).\n                                              9\n\f   Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430     Page: 10   Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-60542\n(1939)); see also Mathias v. WorldCom Techs., Inc., 535 U.S. 682, 684 (2002)\n(per curiam).\n      However, a prevailing party has standing to appeal if he can\ndemonstrate that he was aggrieved by a favorable judgment. Ward, 393 F.3d\nat 603–04. “Courts have recognized a handful of situations in which a party\nmay be sufficiently aggrieved by a favorable judgment to appeal it, such as\nwhere the judgment itself contains prejudicial language on issues immaterial\nto the disposition of the case, where collateral estoppel may harm the party in\nfuture proceedings, or where the party will suffer financial loss as a result of\nthe judgment.” Conwill v. Greenberg Traurig, L.L.P., 448 F. App’x 434, 436–\n37 (5th Cir. 2011) (collecting cases).      Similarly, courts have permitted\nprevailing parties to appeal unfavorable findings that may have an adverse\nfuture effect. See Camreta v. Greene, 131 S. Ct. 2020, 2030–33 (2011) (holding,\nin the limited context of qualified immunity, that a prevailing party may\nchallenge an adverse finding that has a “significant future effect on the conduct\nof public officials”); but see Mathias, 535 U.S. at 684 (dismissing prevailing\nparties’ appeal seeking review “of uncongenial findings not essential to the\njudgment and not binding upon them in future litigation”).\n      Neither party to this appeal raised the issue of the Intervenors’ appellate\nstanding in their initial briefs. The court sua sponte raised the issue and\nordered the parties to file supplemental briefing addressing “whether and on\nwhat ground(s) Plaintiffs-Intervenors have standing to appeal the district\ncourt’s denial of unitary status.” In their supplemental brief, the Intervenors\ncontend that they have standing to appeal because the district court’s orders\ndid not afford them with the complete relief requested and contain findings\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\f    Case: 14-60542        Document: 00513253430          Page: 11     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-60542\nand language that adversely affect them in future unitary proceedings. We\naddress each of these arguments in turn. 7\n                                              A.\n       The Intervenors first contend that they have standing to appeal because\nthe district court’s April 30 order did not afford them all of the relief they\nrequested. The district court granted the Intervenors’ principal request—a\ndenial of unitary status—but denied their additional requests that the District\nremain under court supervision for two years and that the 2011 Consent\nDecree be amended to provide for a court-appointed consultant responsible for\nmonitoring the District’s employment practices.\n       In the ordinary case, the district court’s decision to afford the Intervenors\nwith some, but not all, of the relief requested might well be sufficient to allow\nthe Intervenors to appeal. See, e.g., Forney, 524 U.S. at 271–72. However, the\nIntervenors have not challenged the district court’s denial of this additional\nrelief on appeal. The Intervenors make no mention of the additional relief in\ntheir initial brief. Moreover, in their supplemental brief directed at the issue\nof standing, the Intervenors make no argument that the district court erred in\ndenying the additional relief. The Intervenors may not rely on this requested\nrelief to establish standing when they have not challenged the district court’s\ndenial on appeal. Cf. id. at 271 (allowing a prevailing party that received\n“some, but not all, of the relief she requested” to appeal a lower court’s order\n“insofar as it denies her the relief she has sought.” (emphasis added)). Were we\n\n\n\n\n       7  As a preliminary matter, we note that the Intervenors make no argument that the\ndistrict court’s order denying reconsideration provides a basis for standing separate and\napart from the court’s order denying unitary status. Accordingly, the Intervenors have\nwaived any such argument. See, e.g., T.L. James & Co. v. Traylor Bros., Inc., 294 F.3d 743,\n750 (5th Cir. 2002) (“It is well-settled that when a party fails to brief an issue, it cannot be\nconsidered on appeal.”). The Intervenors’ standing arguments focus exclusively on the\ndistrict court’s order denying unitary status, and our analysis will do the same.\n                                              11\n\f    Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430     Page: 12    Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-60542\nto conclude otherwise, we would be placed in the untenable position of\nreviewing the district court’s decision to deny the Intervenors additional relief\nabsent any argument from the Intervenors as to why that relief was\nwarranted. Accordingly, we decline to hold that the Intervenors have standing\nto appeal on this basis.\n                                        B.\n      The Intervenors next contend that they have standing to appeal because\nthe district court’s April 30 order adversely affects them in future unitary\nproceedings.   Specifically, the Intervenors contend that the district court\nnecessarily concluded that the District had eliminated the vestiges of de jure\nsegregation; limited its holding as to the District’s non-compliance with court\norders to the narrow employment forms violation identified in the April 30\norder; and precluded the Intervenors from raising certain objections and\nevidence in future unitary proceedings. Essentially, the Intervenors contend\nthat certain language in the district court’s order, viewed in isolation and left\nopen to interpretation, could conceivably be conclusive or collaterally estop\nthem in the future and would, in turn, adversely affect their ability to challenge\nfuture motions for unitary status. We disagree.\n      Our review of the Intervenors’ contentions must begin with the axioms\nthat appellate courts review judgments, not opinions, see, e.g., Ward, 393 F.3d\nat 603, and that a party may not appeal a favorable ruling “for the purpose of\nobtaining a review of findings he deems erroneous which are not necessary to\nsupport the decree.” Roper, 445 U.S. at 335 (quoting Elec. Fittings, 307 U.S.\nat 242). Here, the Intervenors do not appeal from any judgment of the district\ncourt; rather, they challenge an interlocutory order that unequivocally denies\nunitary status.      Even then, the Intervenors wisely do not challenge the\ninterlocutory order’s favorable outcome. Instead, the Intervenors acknowledge\nthat their principal dissatisfaction lies with the district court’s explanation for\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 14-60542         Document: 00513253430           Page: 13     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                         No. 14-60542\ndenying unitary status. 8 Although the challenged statements may be less than\nfriendly to the Intervenors, they are not essential to the court’s denial of\nunitary status, and, as we explain today, we see no reason to conclude that\nthey will have any preclusive or adverse effect in the future. 9 It is well-\nestablished that the Intervenors may not appeal for the sole purpose of seeking\na more favorable opinion from the district court. See, e.g., Ward, 393 F.3d at\n603–04 (collecting cases and concluding that “because the plaintiffs are not\nseeking a modification of the judgment but only a modification of the opinion,\nthey have no standing to appeal”).\n       The Intervenors contend that they have standing to appeal based on a\nnumber of cases, each of which is inapposite. In Electrical Fittings, the district\ncourt entered judgment for the defendant based on non-infringement of the\n\n\n\n       8  The Intervenors’ arguments on appeal focus on isolated statements in the district\ncourt’s order denying unitary status. See Opinion and Order at 10, United States v.\nMississippi, No. 3:70-cv-4706-WHB-LRA (S.D. Miss. April 30, 2014), ECF No. 196 (“The\nCourt additionally finds that the District has shown, by the preponderance of the evidence,\nthat it has eliminated the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable.”); id.\n(“[U]nitary status must nevertheless be denied because the District has not shown that it has\nfully complied with the express terms of the 2011 Consent Decree. For example, under the\nterms of the 2011 Consent Decree, the District is not permitted to modify any of the Interview\nGuide and Assessment Forms . . . without first providing the [United States] and Intervenors\na written description of the proposed changes . . . .”); id. at 14 (“Any objections to unitary\nstatus would need to be based on actions or decision taken by the District during the time\nperiod following the January 2014 fairness hearing.”).\n        9 In their supplemental brief, the Intervenors repeatedly express a fear that language\n\nin the district court’s order denying unitary status may collaterally estop them in future\nunitary proceedings, but make little, if any, attempt to explain how this fear may come to\nfruition. We see no basis to conclude that nonessential matters resolved in the district court’s\norder denying unitary status could collaterally estop the Intervenors in the future. See, e.g.,\nKlamath Strategic Inv. Fund ex rel. St. Croix Ventures v. United States, 568 F.3d 537, 546\n(5th Cir. 2009) (“[A]n interlocutory ruling will only have collateral estoppel effect in\nsubsequent litigation if the ultimate judgment in the case was dependent upon the\ninterlocutory ruling.”); see also 18 Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice\nand Procedure § 4402 (2d ed. 2015) (“It is insufficient for the invocation of [collateral estoppel]\nthat some question of fact or law in a later suit was relevant to a prior adjudication between\nthe parties; the contested issue must have been litigated and necessary to the judgment\nearlier rendered.”).\n                                               13\n\f    Case: 14-60542       Document: 00513253430          Page: 14     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-60542\nplaintiff’s patent, but found that the patent itself was valid. See 307 U.S. at\n241–42.     The appellate court dismissed the appeal, concluding that the\nerroneous finding of patent validity was nonessential to the judgment and\nwould not estop the defendants in the future. Id. at 242. The Supreme Court\nreversed, reasoning that the finding of patent validity, “though . . . immaterial\nto the disposition of the cause, [stood] as an adjudication of one of the issues\nlitigated.” Id. Thus, “the petitioners were entitled to have this portion of the\ndecree eliminated,” and the appellate court should have “entertain[ed] the\nappeal, not for the purpose of passing on the merits, but to direct the\nreformation of the decree.” Id.\n       Electrical Fittings is distinguishable from this case in that, here, the\nIntervenors ask the court to reform statements in an interlocutory order rather\nthan explanations that appear on the face of a judgment. See In re DES Litig.,\n7 F.3d 20, 25 (2d Cir. 1993); see also Klamath Strategic Inv. Fund ex rel. St.\nCroix Ventures v. United States, 568 F.3d 537, 546 (5th Cir. 2009); Envtl. Prot.\nInfo. Ctr., Inc. v. Pac. Lumber Co., 257 F.3d 1071, 1075 (9th Cir. 2001) (citing\nElec. Fittings, 307 U.S. at 242, and stating “[w]e have, however, strictly\ninterpreted ‘decree’ to mean ‘judgment’”). Moreover, the Intervenors do not ask\nthe court to revisit any issue necessarily litigated and decided against them in\nthe interlocutory ruling at issue. 10 See Roper, 445 U.S. at 335 n.7. Rather, the\nIntervenors ask the court to entertain their appeal for the sole purpose of\n\n\n\n\n       10 The Electrical Fittings Court was not at all clear as to its reasons for allowing the\nprevailing party to appeal. See Elec. Fittings, 307 U.S. at 242. In Roper, the Court clarified\nthe Electrical Fittings holding, noting that the petitioners there were allowed to appeal the\ndistrict court’s error “because there had been an adverse decision on a litigated issue, they\ncontinued to assert an interest in the outcome of that issue, and for policy reasons this Court\nconsidered the procedural question of sufficient importance to allow an appeal.” See Roper,\n445 U.S. at 335 n.7.\n                                             14\n\f    Case: 14-60542    Document: 00513253430      Page: 15   Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-60542\nrevisiting ancillary reasoning and language with which they disagree.\nElectrical Fittings does not require this court to indulge such a request.\n      The plaintiffs also rely on Deposit Guaranty National Bank, Jackson,\nMississippi v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326 (1980). In that case, the Court allowed class-\naction plaintiffs to appeal the district court’s denial of class certification\nnotwithstanding the court’s judgment in the plaintiffs’ favor. See id. at 327–\n31, 334. The Court highlighted the plaintiffs’ ongoing interest in shifting legal\nexpenses to other class litigants and held that “[i]n an appropriate case, appeal\nmay be permitted from an adverse ruling collateral to the judgment on the\nmerits at the behest of the party who has prevailed on the merits, so long as\nthat party retains a stake in the appeal satisfying the requirements of Art. III.”\nId. at 334 & n.6; see also Camreta, 131 S. Ct. at 2030 (citing Roper, 445 U.S. at\n336 n.7, and stating “[o]n the few occasions when we have departed from [the\nprinciple that appellate courts review judgments, not opinions], we have\npointed to a policy reason . . . of sufficient importance to allow an appeal by the\nwinner below” (internal alteration, citation, and quotation marks omitted)); In\nre DES Litig., 7 F.3d at 25 n.5. Here, the Intervenors make no argument that\nthe district court’s rulings affect the financial consequences of the litigation\nand have not identified any other legitimate policy reasons for allowing an\nappeal at this stage of the litigation.       Thus, the Intervenors have not\nestablished why standing is appropriate under Roper.\n      Nor can the Intervenors show standing under Aetna Casualty & Surety\nCo. v. Cunningham, 224 F.2d 478 (5th Cir. 1955). There, plaintiff sought to\nrecover from defendant on two separate claims—fraud and indemnification.\nId. at 479.   The district court entered judgment for the plaintiff on the\nindemnification claim but ruled against the plaintiff on the fraud claim. Id.\nDespite receiving a favorable ruling, this court allowed the plaintiff to appeal\nbased on the plaintiff’s assertion that a judgment on the alternative fraud\n                                        15\n\f   Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430      Page: 16   Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-60542\nclaim would be more preferable in bankruptcy. Id. at 480. In so concluding,\nwe noted “judgment[s] may have different qualities and legal consequences\ndependent on the claim on which it is based” and highlighted the reality that\nthe indemnification and fraud claims were “separate and distinct.” Id. We\nwent on to hold “that when, as a practical matter, the denial of any one claim\nresults in the plaintiff not getting the relief to which it claims to be entitled,\nwhether in the amount or in the quality of the judgment, it has a right to be\nheard on appeal.” Id. at 480–81.\n      The Intervenors contend that Aetna provides standing in this case\nbecause the Intervenors raised a number of “separate and distinct” violations\nof the 2011 Consent Decree before the district court and “in essence, the\nDistrict Court ruled against Plaintiff-Intervenors on all but the issue of use of\nforms.” Thus, the Intervenors contend, “[t]he District Court’s opinion and\norder is adverse to Plaintiff-Intervenors on the other violations raised.”\n      We disagree with the Intervenors’ reading of the district court’s April 30\norder. In discussing the District’s non-compliance with the 2011 Consent\nDecree, the district court used the phrase “for example,” which indicates that\nthe court’s conclusion was not based upon the one violation discussed. See, e.g.,\nThe American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 637 (5th ed. 2011)\n(defining “example” as “[o]ne that is representative of a whole” and “for\nexample” as “[a]n illustrative instance”).       By citing only one illustrative\nexample of the District’s non-compliance in the April 30 order, the district court\ndid not rule against the Intervenors as to all but the specific violation\nreferenced, limit the scope of future unitary proceedings, or otherwise dilute\n\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\f    Case: 14-60542        Document: 00513253430          Page: 17     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-60542\nthe quality of the decision the Intervenors received—a denial of unitary\nstatus. 11 Thus, Aetna is of no moment.\n       At oral argument, counsel for the Intervenors stated that Department of\nDefense, Office of Dependents Schools v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, 879\nF.2d 1220 (4th Cir. 1989), was the best case in support of the Intervenors’\nstanding argument. Department of Defense involved a procedural framework\nthat is not applicable to the situation here. See id. at 1221. Moreover, the\nIntervenors’ reliance on the Fourth Circuit’s analysis is otherwise unavailing.\nThere, the Fourth Circuit held that an agency had standing to appeal a\nfavorable dismissal based on an adverse legal premise underlying the\ndismissal—that the agency’s head had no power to review and disapprove of\ncertain collective bargaining agreements.                 Id. at 1220–22.         The court\nspecifically noted that, if the agency was denied standing to appeal, it would\nbe harmed to the extent it had to suffer a long appeals process before it could\nseek judicial review of the adverse legal premise. Id. at 1221–22. In a practical\n\n\n\n\n       11  The district court’s treatment of the District’s motion for reconsideration further\nsupports our conclusion that the court did not implicitly rule against the Intervenors as to all\nbut the specific violation referenced or otherwise limit the scope of future unitary inquiries.\nOn reconsideration, the District requested that the court limit future unitary inquiries to the\nspecific employment forms issue identified in the court’s order denying unitary status. The\ncourt denied this request, reasoning that:\n        As understood by the Court, Fifth Circuit precedent requires that the District\n        comply, in good faith, with all of the terms of the 2011 Consent Decree for a\n        reasonable amount of time before it can be declared unitary in the areas of\n        faculty and staff assignments. The District has not, to date, satisfied this\n        burden, and has been given another opportunity to show that it can, and will,\n        abide by the Orders of this Court as written. Accordingly, because the Court\n        does not believe the District can satisfy the necessary burden of proof for\n        obtaining unitary status through piecemeal compliance, the Court finds no\n        basis for either reconsidering or clarifying the Opinion and Order by which the\n        Motion for Unitary Status was denied.\nSee Opinion and Order at 5–6, United States v. Mississippi, No. 3:70-cv-4706-WHB-LRA (S.D.\nMiss. July 8, 2014), ECF 204 (emphasis in original).\n                                              17\n\f   Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430       Page: 18   Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-60542\nsense, the court held that this meant that the agency was “aggrieved” so as to\nhave standing to appeal. See id.\n      The Intervenors contend that Department of Defense is analogous here\nbecause the district court’s April 30 order rejected the Intervenors’ proof of the\nDistrict’s violations of the 2011 Consent Decree beyond the specific violation\nreferenced and limited future objections to unitary status to violations\noccurring after the January 2014 fairness hearing.                Based on this\ninterpretation, the Intervenors contend that the April 30 order could preclude\nappellate review of the district court’s evidentiary determinations as to pre-\n2014-fairness-hearing violations. Again, we disagree.\n      Based on our reading and counsel for the District’s representations at\noral argument, we do not interpret the district court’s April 30 order as\nforeclosing the Intervenors from offering evidence of pre-fairness hearing\nviolations in future unitary proceedings, otherwise limiting the scope of future\nunitary proceedings, or barring appellate review of the district court’s\nevidentiary determinations.     As counsel for the District conceded at oral\nargument, we expect that the Intervenors will have a full and fair opportunity\nin future unitary proceedings to offer evidence that the District has failed to\neliminate the vestiges of de jure segregation or to comply in good faith with the\ncourt’s desegregation order, whether that evidence be based on alleged\nviolations considered at the January 2014 fairness hearing or occurring\nthereafter. Should the district court reject the Intervenors’ evidence and grant\nunitary status at some time in the future, this court will remain open to hear\nthe Intervenors’ appellate arguments, including those, if appropriate, that\nchallenge determinations made in the April 30 order. For now, however, we\ndecline to accept the Intervenors’ invitation to jumpstart the appellate process\nin the face of the district court’s order unequivocally denying unitary status.\n\n\n                                       18\n\f   Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430     Page: 19   Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-60542\n                                      III.\n      Having considered the Intervenors’ arguments, we conclude that they\nare not sufficiently aggrieved and therefore lack standing to appeal the district\ncourt’s orders. We therefore DISMISS the Intervenors’ appeal without regard\nto the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\f",

STEWART, Chief Judge:\n      This case involves a lengthy history of desegregation litigation between\nthe United States, Intervenor-Defendant-Appellee Simpson County School\nDistrict   (the   “District”),   and   Intervenors-Plaintiffs-Appellants     (the\n“Intervenors”), a class representing current and future students attending the\nDistrict’s schools. In 2013, the District moved for unitary status in the only\narea of its school system remaining under federal supervision: faculty and staff\nassignments. The United States and the Intervenors objected. After a two-\nday hearing and post-hearing submissions, the district court denied unitary\nstatus based on the District’s noncompliance with the court’s desegregation\norder. Both the District and the Intervenors moved for reconsideration, and\nthe district court denied both motions. The Intervenors now appeal the district\ncourt’s order denying unitary status and order denying reconsideration. We\nconclude that the Intervenors lack standing to appeal and, therefore, DISMISS\nthe Intervenors’ appeal without regard to the merits.\n                                       I.\n      Although we do not reach the merits of the decisions below, a general\noverview of the history of this case is necessary to understand the narrow issue\nwe resolve today. For over forty years, the District has been under a federal\ncourt order to desegregate its schools. In July 1970, the United States sued\nthe State of Mississippi and several of its school districts, including the\nDistrict, alleging each had violated the Fourteenth Amendment by operating\nschool systems that discriminated based on race. On August 11, 1970, the\ndistrict court entered its first desegregation order (the “1970 Order”) approving\na school desegregation plan and obligating the District to follow procedures\ndesigned to end discrimination in faculty and staff assignments, student\n                                       2\n\f    Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430     Page: 3   Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-60542\ntransfers, transportation, school construction and site selection, and school\nactivities. The 1970 Order also required the District to submit bi-annual\nreports to the court, including, inter alia, information related to the racial\ncomposition of the District’s students and teachers.\n      In June 1982, Intervenors Cynthia Fletcher, Gloria Barnes, and David\nBarnes, then minor students attending the District’s schools, and their\nrepresentatives filed a class action complaint against the District for failing to\ncomply with the 1970 Order. The Intervenors alleged that the District had\ncontinued to maintain segregated schools by allowing white students to attend\nschools outside of their designated geographical zone thereby creating\ndisproportionate ratios of black to white students within certain zones.     The\nIntervenors also alleged that the District continued to discriminate in\nemployment decisions, student discipline, and student placement in special\neducation and gifted-student programs.\n      In August 1983, after negotiations between the United States, the\nIntervenors, and the District, the district court entered a second desegregation\norder (the “1983 Consent Decree”) outlining further procedures the District\nwas to follow to end discrimination in its schools. Notably, with respect to\nemployment practices, the 1983 Consent Decree required the District to\nadvertise available positions, use standard employment forms, use objective\nrating criteria to review applications and score interviewees, and offer\navailable positions to the highest-scoring applicant regardless of race. The\n1983 Consent Decree further required the District to provide the United States\nand the Intervenors with notice of any proposed change to the District’s\nemployment procedures at least sixty days before the District formally adopted\nthe change. Finally, the 1983 Consent Decree broadened the District’s bi-\nannual reporting requirements to include, inter alia, the racial composition of\njob applicants, new hires, and demoted, terminated, or non-renewed employees\n                                        3\n\f     Case: 14-60542       Document: 00513253430     Page: 4    Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-60542\nand any action taken by the District that was inconsistent with the 1983\nConsent Decree, “includ[ing], for example, any effort to hire or promote an\nindividual who is not the most qualified person available for the position being\nfilled.”\n       In 2001, the District moved for unitary status for the first time since\nfederal supervision began in 1970.            The United States responded, only\nobjecting to a declaration of unitary status in the area of faculty and staff\nassignments; the Intervenors did not respond or otherwise object. Absent an\nobjection from the United States or the Intervenors and based on its\nindependent review of the evidence, the district court granted unitary status\nin all areas except faculty and staff assignments. The court denied unitary\nstatus     in   faculty   and   staff   assignments    based    on    the   District’s\nacknowledgement that it had violated the 1983 Consent Decree regarding\ncertain employment issues. This court affirmed the district court’s decision on\nappeal. United States v. Mississippi, 211 F. App’x 296 (5th Cir. 2006).\n       On April 5, 2011, on the United States and the District’s joint motion,\nand with no objection from the Intervenors, the district court entered a third\ndesegregation order (the “2011 Consent Decree”), which generally embraced\nthe employment procedures in the 1983 Consent Decree, but further specified\nthe mechanics by which the District was to make employment decisions in\nseveral respects.     Under the 2011 Consent Decree, the District’s Human\nResources Director was required to review and numerically score written job\napplications based on certain objective criteria. The District’s Superintendent\nor a school’s principal was required to interview the highest-scoring applicant\nas well as any other “applicant[] with a score higher than that of the lowest-\nscoring applicant selected for an interview,” unless certain exceptions applied.\nInterviewed applicants received a second numerical score based on certain\nsubjective criteria. The subjective interview score was added to the objective\n                                          4\n\f     Case: 14-60542       Document: 00513253430          Page: 5     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-60542\napplication score, and the District was required to offer the position to the\napplicant with the highest composite score unless “a legitimate negative reason\nexists not to hire the applicant.” 1\n       Before the District offered a position to a lower-scoring applicant, it was\nrequired to provide the United States and the Intervenors with all application\nmaterials related to the position in question and a statement explaining why\nthe District had chosen not to offer the position to the highest-scoring\napplicant. The United States and the Intervenors could then object in writing. 2\nIn the absence of a written objection, the District’s decision to hire the lower-\nscoring applicant became final.             However, if the United States or the\nIntervenors timely objected, the District was required to provide the United\nStates and the Intervenors with the opportunity to object in the district court.\n       In November 2011, the United States moved to enjoin the District from\nviolating the terms of the 2011 Consent Decree, alleging that, on at least\nnineteen occasions, the District had hired individuals that were not the\nhighest-scoring applicant without providing the United States with an\nopportunity to object. In January 2012, the district court granted the motion\nbased on the District’s admission that it had not satisfied the notice\n\n\n\n\n       1 The 2011 Consent Decree provides some examples of “legitimate reasons” for the\nDistrict not to hire the highest-scoring applicant: “Such a negative reason would exist, for\ninstance, if upon checking references the applicant receives negative comments such as\nneeding improvement or unacceptable performance, if the applicant has provided false or\nmisleading information about his or her certifications or about any other information on the\njob application, if the applicant does not satisfy the criminal background/child abuse registry\ncheck required by state law, or if the applicant has been terminated or non-renewed for good\ncause from any previous job or position. The District may not, however, fail to hire the\nhighest overall-rated applicant only because it favors a lower-rated applicant.”\n       2 The Intervenors could also object to the District’s hiring of a highest-scoring\n\napplicant if that applicant did not also have the highest objective application score.\n                                              5\n\f     Case: 14-60542      Document: 00513253430         Page: 6    Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-60542\nrequirements in the 2011 Consent Decree. The district court extended the\nterm of the 2011 Consent Decree to October 15, 2012. 3\n       On January 30, 2013, the District moved for unitary status in the\nremaining area of faculty and staff assignments. The United States did not\nobject. Despite a long absence from the litigation, the Intervenors filed an\nobjection challenging whether the District had complied with court orders and\nseeking discovery and a public hearing.               The district court denied the\nIntervenors’ discovery requests but granted the Intervenors’ request for a\nhearing. Several days later, the court entered an order setting a hearing on\nthe District’s motion, outlining the requirements for providing notice of the\nhearing to the community, and establishing a process for community members\nto submit objections to the District’s motion.\n       During the public objections period, the district court received over 500\nobjections to the District’s motion. A large number of these objections were\ngeneric in form or merely stated “I object.” However, some objectors detailed\nspecific hiring or termination incidents and were permitted to testify to those\nincidents over the course of a two-day fairness hearing in January 2014. At\nthe conclusion of the fairness hearing, the court held the District’s motion in\nabeyance pending the filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law\nby the United States, the Intervenors, and the District. In these filings, both\nthe United States and the Intervenors requested, inter alia, that the court\n\n\n\n\n       3 At oral argument, counsel for the District made several confounding statements\nsuggesting that the district court entered a new consent decree in 2012 and that this “2012\nConsent Decree” is at issue in this appeal. As counsel later clarified, the district court’s\nJanuary 2012 order merely extended the term of the 2011 Consent Decree without alteration\nor modification. See Opinion and Order at 3, United States v. Mississippi, No. 3:70-cv-4706-\nWHB-LRA (S.D. Miss. Jan. 10, 2012), ECF No. 48 (“The term of the Consent Decree entered\nby the Court on April 5, 2011, is hereby extended up to and including October 15, 2012.”\n(internal citation omitted)).\n                                             6\n\f     Case: 14-60542       Document: 00513253430         Page: 7     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-60542\nappoint an independent monitor to oversee the District’s compliance with the\n2011 Consent Decree.\n       On April 30, 2014, the district court denied unitary status based on the\nDistrict’s failure to comply with the 2011 Consent Decree, citing, as one\nexample of noncompliance, the District’s modification of its Interview Guide\nand Assessment forms without first providing the United States and the\nIntervenors with notice of the proposed change. The court therefore extended\nthe 2011 Consent Decree to March 15, 2015, at which time the District could\nagain move for unitary status. 4            The court denied as unwarranted the\nIntervenors’ and the United States’ requested amendments to the 2011\nConsent Decree, including the request for a court-appointed monitor.\n       The District and the Intervenors each moved for reconsideration of the\ndistrict court’s order denying unitary status. The District argued that only the\nemployment provisions of the 2011 Consent Decree that the court found the\nDistrict to have violated should be extended and requested that the court limit\nfuture objections to unitary status to that basis. The Intervenors challenged\nthe court’s legal analysis and evidentiary determinations. The court disagreed\nwith both parties’ contentions and denied the motions for reconsideration.\n       The Intervenors timely appealed the district court’s order denying\nunitary status and order denying reconsideration. 5\n                                             II.\n       Ordinarily, our review of this appeal would be guided by well-established\ndesegregation principles.

The court sua sponte raised the issue and\nordered the parties to file supplemental briefing addressing “whether and on\nwhat ground(s) Plaintiffs-Intervenors have standing to appeal the district\ncourt’s denial of unitary status.” In their supplemental brief, the Intervenors\ncontend that they have standing to appeal because the district court’s orders\ndid not afford them with the complete relief requested and contain findings\n\n\n\n\n                                       10\n\f    Case: 14-60542        Document: 00513253430          Page: 11     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-60542\nand language that adversely affect them in future unitary proceedings. We\naddress each of these arguments in turn. 7\n                                              A.\n       The Intervenors first contend that they have standing to appeal because\nthe district court’s April 30 order did not afford them all of the relief they\nrequested. The district court granted the Intervenors’ principal request—a\ndenial of unitary status—but denied their additional requests that the District\nremain under court supervision for two years and that the 2011 Consent\nDecree be amended to provide for a court-appointed consultant responsible for\nmonitoring the District’s employment practices.\n       In the ordinary case, the district court’s decision to afford the Intervenors\nwith some, but not all, of the relief requested might well be sufficient to allow\nthe Intervenors to appeal. See, e.g., Forney, 524 U.S. at 271–72. However, the\nIntervenors have not challenged the district court’s denial of this additional\nrelief on appeal. The Intervenors make no mention of the additional relief in\ntheir initial brief. Moreover, in their supplemental brief directed at the issue\nof standing, the Intervenors make no argument that the district court erred in\ndenying the additional relief. The Intervenors may not rely on this requested\nrelief to establish standing when they have not challenged the district court’s\ndenial on appeal. Cf. id. at 271 (allowing a prevailing party that received\n“some, but not all, of the relief she requested” to appeal a lower court’s order\n“insofar as it denies her the relief she has sought.” (emphasis added)). Were we\n\n\n\n\n       7  As a preliminary matter, we note that the Intervenors make no argument that the\ndistrict court’s order denying reconsideration provides a basis for standing separate and\napart from the court’s order denying unitary status. Accordingly, the Intervenors have\nwaived any such argument. See, e.g., T.L. James & Co. v. Traylor Bros., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n750 (5th Cir. 2002) (“It is well-settled that when a party fails to brief an issue, it cannot be\nconsidered on appeal.”). The Intervenors’ standing arguments focus exclusively on the\ndistrict court’s order denying unitary status, and our analysis will do the same.\n                                              11\n\f    Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430     Page: 12    Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-60542\nto conclude otherwise, we would be placed in the untenable position of\nreviewing the district court’s decision to deny the Intervenors additional relief\nabsent any argument from the Intervenors as to why that relief was\nwarranted. Accordingly, we decline to hold that the Intervenors have standing\nto appeal on this basis.\n                                        B.\n      The Intervenors next contend that they have standing to appeal because\nthe district court’s April 30 order adversely affects them in future unitary\nproceedings.   Specifically, the Intervenors contend that the district court\nnecessarily concluded that the District had eliminated the vestiges of de jure\nsegregation; limited its holding as to the District’s non-compliance with court\norders to the narrow employment forms violation identified in the April 30\norder; and precluded the Intervenors from raising certain objections and\nevidence in future unitary proceedings. Essentially, the Intervenors contend\nthat certain language in the district court’s order, viewed in isolation and left\nopen to interpretation, could conceivably be conclusive or collaterally estop\nthem in the future and would, in turn, adversely affect their ability to challenge\nfuture motions for unitary status. We disagree.\n      Our review of the Intervenors’ contentions must begin with the axioms\nthat appellate courts review judgments, not opinions, see, e.g., Ward, 393 F.3d\nat 603, and that a party may not appeal a favorable ruling “for the purpose of\nobtaining a review of findings he deems erroneous which are not necessary to\nsupport the decree.” Roper, 445 U.S. at 335 (quoting Elec. Fittings, 307 U.S.\nat 242). Here, the Intervenors do not appeal from any judgment of the district\ncourt; rather, they challenge an interlocutory order that unequivocally denies\nunitary status.      Even then, the Intervenors wisely do not challenge the\ninterlocutory order’s favorable outcome. Instead, the Intervenors acknowledge\nthat their principal dissatisfaction lies with the district court’s explanation for\n                                        12\n\f    Case: 14-60542         Document: 00513253430           Page: 13     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                         No. 14-60542\ndenying unitary status. 8 Although the challenged statements may be less than\nfriendly to the Intervenors, they are not essential to the court’s denial of\nunitary status, and, as we explain today, we see no reason to conclude that\nthey will have any preclusive or adverse effect in the future. 9 It is well-\nestablished that the Intervenors may not appeal for the sole purpose of seeking\na more favorable opinion from the district court. See, e.g., Ward, 393 F.3d at\n603–04 (collecting cases and concluding that “because the plaintiffs are not\nseeking a modification of the judgment but only a modification of the opinion,\nthey have no standing to appeal”).\n       The Intervenors contend that they have standing to appeal based on a\nnumber of cases, each of which is inapposite. In Electrical Fittings, the district\ncourt entered judgment for the defendant based on non-infringement of the\n\n\n\n       8  The Intervenors’ arguments on appeal focus on isolated statements in the district\ncourt’s order denying unitary status. See Opinion and Order at 10, United States v.\nMississippi, No. 3:70-cv-4706-WHB-LRA (S.D. Miss. April 30, 2014), ECF No. 196 (“The\nCourt additionally finds that the District has shown, by the preponderance of the evidence,\nthat it has eliminated the vestiges of prior de jure segregation to the extent practicable.”); id.\n(“[U]nitary status must nevertheless be denied because the District has not shown that it has\nfully complied with the express terms of the 2011 Consent Decree. For example, under the\nterms of the 2011 Consent Decree, the District is not permitted to modify any of the Interview\nGuide and Assessment Forms . . . without first providing the [United States] and Intervenors\na written description of the proposed changes . . . .”); id. at 14 (“Any objections to unitary\nstatus would need to be based on actions or decision taken by the District during the time\nperiod following the January 2014 fairness hearing.”).\n        9 In their supplemental brief, the Intervenors repeatedly express a fear that language\n\nin the district court’s order denying unitary status may collaterally estop them in future\nunitary proceedings, but make little, if any, attempt to explain how this fear may come to\nfruition. We see no basis to conclude that nonessential matters resolved in the district court’s\norder denying unitary status could collaterally estop the Intervenors in the future.

See 307 U.S. at\n241–42.     The appellate court dismissed the appeal, concluding that the\nerroneous finding of patent validity was nonessential to the judgment and\nwould not estop the defendants in the future. Id. at 242. The Supreme Court\nreversed, reasoning that the finding of patent validity, “though . . . immaterial\nto the disposition of the cause, [stood] as an adjudication of one of the issues\nlitigated.” Id. Thus, “the petitioners were entitled to have this portion of the\ndecree eliminated,” and the appellate court should have “entertain[ed] the\nappeal, not for the purpose of passing on the merits, but to direct the\nreformation of the decree.” Id.\n       Electrical Fittings is distinguishable from this case in that, here, the\nIntervenors ask the court to reform statements in an interlocutory order rather\nthan explanations that appear on the face of a judgment.

There, plaintiff sought to\nrecover from defendant on two separate claims—fraud and indemnification.\nId. at 479.   The district court entered judgment for the plaintiff on the\nindemnification claim but ruled against the plaintiff on the fraud claim. Id.\nDespite receiving a favorable ruling, this court allowed the plaintiff to appeal\nbased on the plaintiff’s assertion that a judgment on the alternative fraud\n                                        15\n\f   Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430      Page: 16   Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-60542\nclaim would be more preferable in bankruptcy. Id. at 480. In so concluding,\nwe noted “judgment[s] may have different qualities and legal consequences\ndependent on the claim on which it is based” and highlighted the reality that\nthe indemnification and fraud claims were “separate and distinct.” Id. We\nwent on to hold “that when, as a practical matter, the denial of any one claim\nresults in the plaintiff not getting the relief to which it claims to be entitled,\nwhether in the amount or in the quality of the judgment, it has a right to be\nheard on appeal.” Id. at 480–81.\n      The Intervenors contend that Aetna provides standing in this case\nbecause the Intervenors raised a number of “separate and distinct” violations\nof the 2011 Consent Decree before the district court and “in essence, the\nDistrict Court ruled against Plaintiff-Intervenors on all but the issue of use of\nforms.” Thus, the Intervenors contend, “[t]he District Court’s opinion and\norder is adverse to Plaintiff-Intervenors on the other violations raised.”\n      We disagree with the Intervenors’ reading of the district court’s April 30\norder. In discussing the District’s non-compliance with the 2011 Consent\nDecree, the district court used the phrase “for example,” which indicates that\nthe court’s conclusion was not based upon the one violation discussed. See, e.g.,\nThe American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 637 (5th ed. 2011)\n(defining “example” as “[o]ne that is representative of a whole” and “for\nexample” as “[a]n illustrative instance”).       By citing only one illustrative\nexample of the District’s non-compliance in the April 30 order, the district court\ndid not rule against the Intervenors as to all but the specific violation\nreferenced, limit the scope of future unitary proceedings, or otherwise dilute\n\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\f    Case: 14-60542        Document: 00513253430          Page: 17     Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-60542\nthe quality of the decision the Intervenors received—a denial of unitary\nstatus. 11 Thus, Aetna is of no moment.\n       At oral argument, counsel for the Intervenors stated that Department of\nDefense, Office of Dependents Schools v. Federal Labor Relations Authority, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"526462\"><a href=\"/opinion/526462/department-of-defense-office-of-dependents-schools-v-federal-labor/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 1989), was the best case in support of the Intervenors’\nstanding argument. Department of Defense involved a procedural framework\nthat is not applicable to the situation here. See id. at 1221. Moreover, the\nIntervenors’ reliance on the Fourth Circuit’s analysis is otherwise unavailing.\nThere, the Fourth Circuit held that an agency had standing to appeal a\nfavorable dismissal based on an adverse legal premise underlying the\ndismissal—that the agency’s head had no power to review and disapprove of\ncertain collective bargaining agreements.                 Id. at 1220–22.         The court\nspecifically noted that, if the agency was denied standing to appeal, it would\nbe harmed to the extent it had to suffer a long appeals process before it could\nseek judicial review of the adverse legal premise. Id. at 1221–22. In a practical\n\n\n\n\n       11  The district court’s treatment of the District’s motion for reconsideration further\nsupports our conclusion that the court did not implicitly rule against the Intervenors as to all\nbut the specific violation referenced or otherwise limit the scope of future unitary inquiries.\nOn reconsideration, the District requested that the court limit future unitary inquiries to the\nspecific employment forms issue identified in the court’s order denying unitary status. The\ncourt denied this request, reasoning that:\n        As understood by the Court, Fifth Circuit precedent requires that the District\n        comply, in good faith, with all of the terms of the 2011 Consent Decree for a\n        reasonable amount of time before it can be declared unitary in the areas of\n        faculty and staff assignments. The District has not, to date, satisfied this\n        burden, and has been given another opportunity to show that it can, and will,\n        abide by the Orders of this Court as written. Accordingly, because the Court\n        does not believe the District can satisfy the necessary burden of proof for\n        obtaining unitary status through piecemeal compliance, the Court finds no\n        basis for either reconsidering or clarifying the Opinion and Order by which the\n        Motion for Unitary Status was denied.\nSee Opinion and Order at 5–6, United States v. Mississippi, No. 3:70-cv-4706-WHB-LRA (S.D.\nMiss. July 8, 2014), ECF 204 (emphasis in original).\n                                              17\n\f   Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430       Page: 18   Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-60542\nsense, the court held that this meant that the agency was “aggrieved” so as to\nhave standing to appeal. See id.\n      The Intervenors contend that Department of Defense is analogous here\nbecause the district court’s April 30 order rejected the Intervenors’ proof of the\nDistrict’s violations of the 2011 Consent Decree beyond the specific violation\nreferenced and limited future objections to unitary status to violations\noccurring after the January 2014 fairness hearing.                Based on this\ninterpretation, the Intervenors contend that the April 30 order could preclude\nappellate review of the district court’s evidentiary determinations as to pre-\n2014-fairness-hearing violations. Again, we disagree.\n      Based on our reading and counsel for the District’s representations at\noral argument, we do not interpret the district court’s April 30 order as\nforeclosing the Intervenors from offering evidence of pre-fairness hearing\nviolations in future unitary proceedings, otherwise limiting the scope of future\nunitary proceedings, or barring appellate review of the district court’s\nevidentiary determinations.     As counsel for the District conceded at oral\nargument, we expect that the Intervenors will have a full and fair opportunity\nin future unitary proceedings to offer evidence that the District has failed to\neliminate the vestiges of de jure segregation or to comply in good faith with the\ncourt’s desegregation order, whether that evidence be based on alleged\nviolations considered at the January 2014 fairness hearing or occurring\nthereafter. Should the district court reject the Intervenors’ evidence and grant\nunitary status at some time in the future, this court will remain open to hear\nthe Intervenors’ appellate arguments, including those, if appropriate, that\nchallenge determinations made in the April 30 order. For now, however, we\ndecline to accept the Intervenors’ invitation to jumpstart the appellate process\nin the face of the district court’s order unequivocally denying unitary status.\n\n\n                                       18\n\f   Case: 14-60542     Document: 00513253430     Page: 19   Date Filed: 10/30/2015\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-60542\n                                      III.\n      Having considered the Intervenors’ arguments, we conclude that they\nare not sufficiently aggrieved and therefore lack standing to appeal the district\ncourt’s orders. We therefore DISMISS the Intervenors’ appeal without regard\nto the merits.\n\n\n\n\n                                       19\n\f</pre>",
