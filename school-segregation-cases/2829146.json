Plaintiffs, Appellants herein (“Plaintiffs”), appeal from the final\n\njudgment of the United States District Court for Western Kentucky at Bowling Green denying their\n\nMotion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or, in the alternative, Motion for a New Trial in this age-\n\nbased discrimination case arising under the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, K.R.S. § 344.040(1).\n\nPlaintiffs, forty-nine (49) employees of Defendant-Appellee, Tyson Bearing Corporation, Inc.\n\n(“Tyson”), allege that the application of a collectively bargained agreement with the United Steel\n\nWorkers of America, AFL-CIO, the labor organization representing the employees at Tyson,\n\ndiscriminates against them on the basis of age in violation of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act.\n\nPlaintiffs appeal the jury verdict for Tyson in this diversity age discrimination action. For the\n\n\n        *\n           The Honorable Edmund A. Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of\nOhio, sitting by designation.\n\freasons that follow, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n                                                     I.\n\n\n        Plaintiffs are all hourly employees over the age of 40 who work for Tyson. Each is a\n\nrecipient of a pension from the former owner of the Tyson facility, SKF, USA, Inc. (“SKF”).\n\nPlaintiffs assert that Tyson pays them lower wages and provides them less advantageous vacation\n\nbenefits than their co-workers because of their protected status as workers over the age of forty (40).\n\n        Effective June 11, 1999, Tyson, a corporate entity formed by its parent company, Roller\n\nBearing Corporation of America (“RBC”), purchased the Tapered Bearing Division of SKF at\n\nGlasgow, Kentucky. Prior to the time of the purchase, the Tapered Bearing Division of SKF was\n\nexperiencing financial difficulties. In February 1999, RBC proposed to take over and continue\n\noperating the Tapered Bearing Division in the same building that SKF occupied.\n\n        Most SKF tapered bearing employees were represented by the United Steelworkers of\n\nAmerica, AFL-CIO (“Union”). Accordingly, Tyson negotiated with the Union over the terms and\n\nconditions of employment that would apply after the purchase.1 Tyson negotiated with the Union,\n\nas well as suppliers, subcontractors, and salaried employees, in order to secure financial concessions\n\nso as to make the acquisition viable. As Tyson and the Union negotiated, Tyson understood that\n\nSKF was losing money and that the Tapered Bearing Division was expecting reduced sales volumes\n\non an on-going basis. Tyson therefore anticipated that, after the parties finalized the transaction, it\n\nwould be forced to reduce the employee roster to 130 from the approximately 260 employees then\n\n\n\n        1\n                 Plaintiffs did not join the Union as a party. Tyson filed a third-party complaint against\nthe Union and tried to join it as a party. The district court, however, granted the Union’s motion to\ndismiss the third-party complaint. That issue is not before the Court.\n\n                                                     2\n\fcovered by the Union contract.\n\n        During the negotiations, Tyson’s representative, Mike Gostomski, proposed a $5.00 per hour\n\nacross the board wage reduction for all employees. The Union rejected this proposal. Instead, the\n\nparties developed the idea to allow SKF retirees to work at Tyson as “second tier” employees.2\n\nUltimately, the concept of second-tier employees was memorialized in a Memorandum of\n\nAgreement. The Memorandum of Agreement provided, in pertinent part:\n\n        It is contemplated . . . that certain members of the bargaining unit, currently\n        employed by SKF, will retire under the SKF Pension Plan, prior to the closing date\n        [June 15, 1999], pursuant to the 30-Year Retirement without actuarial reduction\n        option (including these employees who are eligible to age into such option pursuant\n        to the 1999 amendments to the labor contract) described in a Memorandum of\n        Understanding between SKF and the Union or pursuant to an Early Retirement\n        option with actuarial reduction, based on age 55 or older and at least 10 years of\n        service, and will thereafter confirm to the Company that they are available for\n        immediate employment in a Tyson Bearing Bargaining Unit position at the Tyson\n        Bearing Glasgow facility after the closing date. The parties have agreed that such\n        retirees (hereinafter “retiree-applicants) will be employed by the Company subject\n        to certain terms and conditions that differ from the terms and conditions generally\n        applicable under the labor contract.\n\n(Memorandum of Agreement, at 2; Jx. at 206.) This modification created a class of 79 “retiree-\n\napplicants” which included all 49 of the Plaintiffs in this case. The retiree-applicants were to be\n\ntreated, for compensation purposes, as employees hired after March 31, 1996.3 This categorization\n\n\n        2\n                  The parties dispute the issue of who, as between the Union and Tyson, originally\npresented the idea of a second tier of employees. The district court determined that Plaintiffs had adduced\nevidence to the effect that Tyson imposed this obligation on the Union on a take-it-or-leave-it-basis and\nthat this dispute about a genuine issue of material fact precluded summary judgment on Plaintiffs’\ndisparate treatment claim.\n        3\n                 In particular, the Memorandum of Agreement indicated that a retiree-applicant “ . . . shall\nbe considered to be an employee hired after March 31, 1996, for purposes of Article XIV, Section 3., of\nthe labor contract.” (Memorandum of Agreement, Section III, “Retiree-Applicants”; Jx. 195.) Section\nXIV of the labor contract provided that “[a]ll employees hired after March 31, 1996 will be paid $3.00\nper hour, lower than the prevailing wage scale in effect for this labor agreement.” (Labor Agreement,\nSection XIV; Jx. 170.)\n\n                                                     3\n\fmeant that retiree-applicants would be paid $3.00 less per hour than they had been earning with SKF\n\nand that they would receive only two weeks of vacation time.4 All the retiree-applicants were\n\nreceiving a pension from SKF when they became employees of Tyson. This class included only\n\nworkers who had 10 years of service credit with SKF and had attained the age of 55, and employees\n\nwith at least 30 years of SKF service.5 Plaintiffs are among the class of employees who\n\naffirmatively severed their employment with SKF by retiring before the closing date and were\n\nrehired by Tyson after the sale.\n\n        The Memorandum of Agreement affected no other class of employees’ wages or vacation\n\ntime.6 Some employees who were over the age of 40 and eligible for retirement from SKF chose\n\nnot to do so. These active employees who were over 40 but who did not retire or begin receiving\n\na pension from SKF transferred to Tyson and did not have their pay or vacation benefits reduced.\n\n        The Memorandum of Agreement was incorporated into the then-existing labor agreement\n\nbetween SKF and the Union. On June 11, 1999, Tyson assumed the current collective bargaining\n\n\n        4\n                   The Union also bargained for a number of benefits for the retiree-applicants not\notherwise available to individuals hired after March 31, 1996, including the following: (1) they would be\nassigned to the same position they held at SKF; (2) they would not have to serve another probationary\nperiod; (3) they would be eligible for insurance benefits as if they had been employed prior to March 27,\n1993; (4) they would maintain their original seniority date from SKF for purposes of layoff, recall,\ntransfers, filling of vacancies, and other such non-economic provisions of the Agreement; (5) they would\nbe entitled to two weeks of vacation and would be eligible for increased vacation if certain production\ncost levels were reached; (6) they would be entitled to a monthly additional payment of $150 if they opted\nout of single medical coverage, or $250 if they opted out of married with or without dependents medical\ninsurance coverage; (7) they would be entitled to certain wage increases based on Tyson’s production\ncosts in the future; and (8) they would not be required to take a medical examination to qualify for\nemployment.\n        5\n           Although second tier employees made $3.00 less per hour, with the reduced wage, plus their\nretirement benefit, the parties expected that the group would receive a combined wage and pension\nbenefit that exceeded their former wage level.\n        6\n                Other employees who started work after March 31, 1996 continued to have only two\nweeks of vacation and earn $3.00 less per hour than their previously hired counterparts.\n\n                                                    4\n\fagreement negotiated by the Union and SKF and signed the Memorandum of Agreement. Tyson\n\ntherefore agreed to transfer active SKF employees to its payroll and to employ then-current SKF\n\nemployees who had retired from SKF prior to the closing date.\n\n       After Tyson’s takeover, some of the retiree-applicants filed a grievance asserting that the pay\n\nand vacation time reduction violated the collective bargaining agreement. The grievance was\n\nprocessed through the initial steps, but did not proceed to arbitration.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed a complaint in Kentucky state court on August 29, 2002 alleging age\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, K.R.S. § 344.040(1) and (2), asserting\n\nboth disparate treatment and disparate impact theories of recovery. On October 5, 2001, Tyson\n\nremoved the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.\n\n       On September 3, 2002, Tyson filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiffs\n\nhad no proof of intentional discrimination and that Plaintiffs could not state a claim for disparate\n\nimpact under the age discrimination provisions of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act. Plaintiffs\n\nresponded and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the facially discriminatory\n\nnature of the policy at issue entitled them to summary judgment. The district court denied the\n\nparties’ motions for summary judgment on January 2, 2003.\n\n       Both parties filed motions for reconsideration. Plaintiffs argued that they had submitted\n\nsufficient evidence of direct discrimination to justify summary judgment in their favor. Defendant\n\nmaintained that Plaintiffs had shown insufficient evidence of discriminatory intent to allege a\n\ncognizable claim of disparate treatment on the basis of age and that no disparate impact age\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fdiscrimination cause of action exists under the Kentucky Civil Rights Act.7 On February 7, 2003,\n\nthe district court denied Plaintiffs’ motion and granted Tyson’s motion to the extent it argued that\n\nthe Kentucky Civil Rights Act does not recognize an age-based discrimination claim under a\n\ndisparate impact theory of recovery.\n\n       The parties proceeded to trial on the issue of disparate treatment. Plaintiffs submitted\n\nproposed jury instruction incorporating three theories of liability: (1) disparate impact; (2) disparate\n\ntreatment based on circumstantial evidence that focused on a McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n\n411 U.S. 792 (1973), “pretext” analysis; and (3) disparate treatment based on the facially\n\ndiscriminatory nature of the policy at issue. The district court refused to give a disparate impact\n\ninstruction and instead gave the following instructions:\n\n              In order to prevail on their claim of age discrimination, the Plaintiffs must\n       prove the following two essential elements by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n               (1)     The Plaintiffs were forty years of age or older; and\n\n               (2)     Plaintiffs’ age was a motivating factor in the Defendant’s decision to\n                       enter into the Memorandum of Agreement of June 10, 1999 that\n                       reduced Plaintiffs’ compensation and benefits.\n\n              The term “motivating factor” means a consideration that moved Defendant\n       Tyson Bearing Co. toward its decision. A consideration can be a “motivating factor”\n       without being the only motivation for a particular decision. However, it must have\n       been a factor that actually led to the decision.\n\n              The mere fact that Plaintiffs are 40 years of age or older and received reduced\n       pay and benefits is not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish Plaintiffs’ claim.\n\n(Instruction 6, Jx. 137.)\n\n       The jury returned a verdict in favor of Tyson. Plaintiffs filed post-trial motions requesting\n\n       7\n                Defendant Tyson also argued that Plaintiffs’ claims were preempted by Section 301 of\nthe Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185(a). The district court rejected that argument. The\nissue of preemption, however, is not presently before the Court.\n\n                                                   6\n\fjudgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative, a new trial. The district court denied Plaintiffs’\n\nmotions. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       Plaintiffs assert error in the district court’s denial of its (1) motion for summary judgment\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; (2) motion for judgment as a matter of law (directed verdict) under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 50(a); and (3) motion for judgment as a matter of law (notwithstanding the verdict) under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in denying its alternative\n\nmotion for new trial. Finally, Plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred by failing to give\n\ncertain jury instructions relating to its theories of recovery for age-based discrimination.\n\n       “[W]here summary judgment is denied and the movant subsequently loses after a full trial\n\non the merits, the denial of summary judgment may not be appealed.” Jarrett v. Epperly, 896 F.2d\n\n1013, 1016 (6th Cir. 1990); see also Garrison v. Cassens Transport Co., 334 F.3d 528, 537 (6th Cir.\n\n2003) (same). “[I]n cases where an appellant made a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment that\n\nwas denied, makes those same arguments in a Rule 50(a) motion at the close of evidence that was\n\nalso denied, lost in front of a jury, then renewed its arguments in a rejected Rule 50(b) motion after\n\nthe entry of judgment, we will review only the denial of the Rule 50(b) motion.” K & T Enters., Inc.\n\nv. Zurich Ins. Co., 97 F.3d 171, 174 (6th Cir. 1996). Because Plaintiffs asserted the same arguments\n\nin their Rule 56 motion for summary judgment and both motions for judgment as a matter of law\n\nwith respect to all issues except those involving their disparate impact theory of liability under the\n\nKentucky Civil Rights Act,8 the Court reviews only the district court’s denial of Plaintiffs’ Rule\n\n       8\n                  As set forth, infra, Plaintiffs allege that the Court should recognize a claim of\ndiscrimination under the Kentucky Civil Rights Act using a disparate-impact theory of recovery. Because\nthe district court awarded summary judgment to Tyson on this claim, it was not properly the subject of\n\n                                                  7\n\f50(b) motion.\n\n         As to Plaintiffs’ Rule 50(b) renewed Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law, the Court\n\nreviews the denial de novo. Gray v. Toshiba Am. Consumer Prods., 263 F.3d 595, 598 (6th Cir.\n\n2001). The Court does not “weigh the evidence, evaluate the credibility of the witnesses, or\n\nsubstitute our judgment for that of the jury.” Wehr v. Ryan's Family Steak Houses, Inc., 49 F.3d\n\n1150, 1152 (6th Cir. 1995). Instead, the Court must view the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto the party against whom the motion is made, giving the non-moving party the benefit of all\n\nreasonable inferences. Garrison, 334 F.3d at 537 (citing Phelps v. Yale Sec. Inc., 986 F.2d 1020,\n\n1023 (6th Cir. 1993)). “The motion should be granted, and the district court reversed, only if\n\nreasonable minds could not come to a conclusion other than one favoring the movant.” K & T\n\nEnters. Inc., 97 F.3d at 176; Garrison, 334 F.3d at 537-38.\n\n         The district court properly denied the motion for a new trial under Rule 50(b) “‘if the verdict\n\nis one that reasonably could be reached, regardless of whether the trial judge might have reached\n\na different conclusion were he [or she] the trier of fact.’” Powers v. Bayliner Marine Corp., 83 F.3d\n\n789, 796 (6th Cir. 1996)(quoting Wayne v. Village of Sebring, 36 F.3d 517, 525 (6th Cir. 1994)). This\n\nCourt will reverse a district court’s denial of a motion for a new trial only on a showing of abuse of\n\ndiscretion. Id. An abuse of discretion is defined as “a definite and firm conviction that the trial court\n\ncommitted a clear error of judgment.” Monette v. AM-7-7 Baking Co., 929 F.2d 276, 280 (6th Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n         The district court dismissed Plaintiffs’ claim for age-based discrimination under their\n\n\n\n\nany of the trial and post-trial motions. The district court’s decision to award summary judgment to Tyson\non the disparate impact claim is subject to de novo review.\n\n                                                    8\n\fdisparate impact theory of recovery and awarded summary judgment to Tyson on this claim. The\n\nstandard of review applicable to the district court’s decision to grant Tyson’s Motion for Summary\n\nJudgment is de novo. Darrah v. City of Oak Park, 255 F.3d 301, 305 (6th Cir. 2001).9\n\n                                                    III.\n\n        Plaintiffs claims arise under the Kentucky Civil Rights Act (“KCRA”). The statute provides\n\nthat it is unlawful for an employer:\n\n        (1)     To fail or refuse to hire, or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\n                discriminate against an individual with respect to compensation, terms,\n                conditions, or privileges of employment, because of the individual's . . . age\n                forty (40) and over . . .[and]\n\n        (2)     To limit, segregate, or classify employees in any way which would deprive\n                or tend to deprive an individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n                adversely affect status as an employee, because of the individual's . . . age\n                forty (40) and over . . . .\n\nK.R.S. § 344.040(1) & (2). Kentucky courts typically interpret the age discrimination proscriptions\n\nof the KCRA to mirror the prohibitions set forth in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n\n1967, 29 U.S.C. § 623 et seq. (“ADEA”), and hence look to federal cases for guidance in applying\n\n\n\n\n        9\n                  Plaintiffs presented jury instructions relating to their various theories of liability. The\ndistrict court did not give instructions relating to Plaintiffs’ disparate impact claim because it had\ndismissed that claim on summary judgment. The district court also rejected an instruction on Plaintiffs’\nclaim that the Memorandum of Agreement is direct evidence, in and of itself, of age discrimination.\nTyson contends that Plaintiffs waived their objections to the jury instructions by failing to reassert their\narguments at the charge conference. Regardless of whether Plaintiffs objected to the jury instructions in\nthis case, Fed. R. Civ. P. 51, which requires a party to object to jury instructions on the record, does not\nprevent normal appellate review of the underlying merits issues here because Plaintiffs made all necessary\narguments to preserve the matters in its appeal with respect to their disparate treatment claim, including\nwhether the Memorandum of Agreement was direct evidence, in its Rule 50 motion for judgment as a\nmatter of law or alternately for a new trial. Similarly, with respect to their disparate impact claim,\nPlaintiffs preserved their arguments through their appeal of the district court’s denial of their Rule 56\nmotion for summary judgment.\n\n                                                     9\n\fthe state law.10 Harker v. Federal Land Bank of Louisville, Ky., 679 S.W.2d 226, 229 (Ky. 1984).\n\n        Generally, a plaintiff may rely upon one of two alternate theories of recovery to establish a\n\nclaim of illegal discrimination: disparate treatment or disparate impact. The Supreme Court often\n\ndistinguishes between the two theories of discrimination and describes the distinction as follows:\n\n                “Disparate treatment” . . . is the most easily understood type of\n        discrimination. The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others\n        because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Proof of discriminatory\n        motive is critical, although it can in some situations be inferred from the mere fact\n        of differences in treatment. . . .\n\n                 Claims of disparate treatment may be distinguished from claims that stress\n        “disparate impact.” The latter involve employment practices that are facially neutral\n        in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group\n        than another and cannot be justified by business necessity. Proof of discriminatory\n        motive . . . is not required under a disparate-impact theory.\n\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324, 335 n.15 (1977) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n        Plaintiffs have invoked both disparate treatment and disparate impact theories in this case.\n\nPlaintiffs’ ability to recover for age discrimination based on a disparate treatment theory is well-\n\nsupported in the language of the ADEA and in this Court’s precedent. Plaintiffs’ ability to recover\n\n\n\n        10\n                The ADEA provides as follows:\n\n        It shall be unlawful for an employer–\n\n        (1)     to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate\n                against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or\n                privileges of employment, because of such individual's age;\n\n        (2)     to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any way which would deprive or\n                tend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n                adversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual's age . . . .\n\n29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1) & (2).\n\n                                                    10\n\fbased upon a disparate impact theory, however, is unsettled in this and other circuits. We turn first\n\nto Plaintiffs’ contentions under disparate treatment as a theory of recovery and, given the context\n\nin which Plaintiffs argue it, decline to rule on Plaintiffs’ disparate impact claim.\n\nA.      Disparate Treatment\n\n        1.       Direct Evidence\n\n        Plaintiffs maintain that Tyson’s retiree-applicant wage and benefit policy, which directed\n\nwage and benefit cuts to a group of workers who were all over the age of 40, discriminates on its\n\nface against them on the basis of their age. Plaintiffs argue that any policy that by its express terms,\n\napplies only to the detriment of members of a protected class is discriminatory on its face. Because\n\na Tyson employee had to be over the age of 40 in order for the wage and benefit reductions to apply,\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the policy discriminated against all the members of the group of retiree-\n\napplicants on its face.\n\n        Plaintiffs argue that the Memorandum of Agreement is direct evidence, in and of itself, of\n\nage discrimination, and that they are therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue\n\nof liability.   Plaintiffs rely on Trans World Airlines, Inc. v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111 (1985), in\n\nsupport of their argument that a discrimination plaintiff need only prove that a facially\n\ndiscriminatory policy exits, and nothing more, in order to prevail on the claim.\n\n        In Thurston, the airline, TWA, adopted a policy whereby captains who became disqualified\n\nfrom serving as pilots for reasons other than age could remain working and could automatically\n\ndisplace less senior flight engineers. 469 U.S. at 116. Captains who reached the age of 60, however,\n\ncould not automatically “bump” flight engineers and could remain with the airline only if they had\n\nbeen able to obtain flight engineer status through the bidding procedures outlined in the collective\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fbargaining agreement. If the airline had no vacancy prior to a captain’s 60th birthday, or if the\n\ncaptain lacked the requisite seniority to bid on a vacancy, the captain would be retired. Id. A\n\ncaptain displaced for any reason besides age did not have to resort to the bidding procedures of the\n\nlabor agreement. Id. at 116-17. The Supreme Court held that the airline’s facially discriminatory\n\njob-transfer policy violated the ADEA. Id. at 128. Thurston did not, however, establish the\n\nunequivocal principle that an employer’s facially discriminatory policy will in every instance and\n\nwithout more entitle an ADEA claimant to judgment as a matter of law. Case law following\n\nThurston clarifies the standards of liability under the ADEA.\n\n        Plaintiffs misapprehend the nature of direct proof necessary to sustain their claim in a\n\ndisparate treatment case. In the context of discrimination cases, “direct evidence is that evidence\n\nwhich, if believed, requires the conclusion that unlawful discrimination was at least a motivating\n\nfactor in the employer’s actions.” Jacklyn v. Schering-Plough Healthcare Prods. Sales Corp., 176\n\nF.3d 921, 926 (6th Cir. 1999); see also Manzer v. Diamond Shamrock Chems. Co., 29 F.3d 1078,\n\n1081 (6th Cir. 1994) (evidence that requires the jury to infer a fact is not direct evidence). Plaintiffs\n\npoint to no evidence that Tyson deliberately selected them and intended to discriminate against them\n\non the basis of age. Importantly, Plaintiffs voluntarily chose to retire from SKF prior to the takeover\n\nby Tyson. Other than pointing to the policy itself, Plaintiffs offer no evidence to suggest that\n\ndiscrimination was at least a motivating factor.\n\n        The policy itself does not treat similarly situated individuals differently because of their age.\n\nThe retiree-applicants are not similarly situated to the employees who did not terminate employment\n\nwith SKF prior to the closing date. That is, Plaintiffs are distinguishable from those employees who\n\nremained active employees and do not receive a pension from SKF. Tyson argues that the financial\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fposition of the retiree-applicants actually improved after the sale from SKF, notwithstanding the\n\n$3.00 reduction in pay. Those employees who elected to receive the pension ended up with a\n\ncombined pension and wage rate that exceeded their compensation prior to this sale.\n\n        Moreover, in a disparate treatment case, liability depends on whether the protected trait– in\n\nthis case, age– motivated the adverse employment decision. Hazen Paper Co. v. Biggins, 507 U.S.\n\n604, 610 (1993). “Whatever the employer’s decisionmaking process, a disparate treatment claim\n\ncannot succeed unless the employee’s protected trait actually played a role in that process and had\n\na determinative influence on the outcome.” Id. Accordingly, Hazen Paper clarified that, under the\n\nADEA, proof of discriminatory motive is critical to the success of a plaintiff’s discriminatory\n\ntreatment claim. Id.\n\n        This Court has consistently emphasized that a claim of disparate treatment under the ADEA\n\nrequires proof of discriminatory motive. See, e.g., Allen v. Diebold, Inc., 33 F.3d 674, 677 (6th Cir.\n\n1994); Lyon v. Ohio Educ. Ass’n & Professional Staff Union, 53 F.3d 135, 138 (6th Cir. 1995); Gantt\n\nv. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., 143 F.3d 1042, 1048 (6th Cir. 1998).11 The ADEA prohibits adverse\n\nemployment action that is actually motivated by age. There is no disparate treatment under the\n\nADEA, however, when an employer acts on the basis of other factors that are only empirically\n\ncorrelated with age, such as pension status, seniority, or wage rate. Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 609;\n\n\n\n\n        11\n                  Similarly, the Kentucky Civil Rights Act makes it an unlawful practice to discriminate\nagainst an individual in the terms or conditions of employment “because of the individual’s . . . age forty\n(40) and over . . .” K.R.S. § 344.040(1)(emphasis added); see also K.R.S. § 344.040(2)(noting unlawful\nemployment practice to “limit, segregate, or classify employees . . because of the individual’s . . . age\nforty (40) and over . . .”)(emphasis added).\n\n\n                                                    13\n\fGantt, 143 F.3d at 1048; Allen, 33 F.3d at 677; Lyon, 53 F.3d at 138.12 Recently, the Supreme Court\n\nemphasized that an employer does not violate the ADEA by acting on the basis of other factors, such\n\nas pension status:\n\n        [In Hazen Paper,] . . . we held there is no violation of the ADEA in firing an\n        employee because his pension is about to vest, a basis for action that we took to be\n        analytically distinct from age, even though it would never occur without advanced\n        years. . . We said that “the very essence of age discrimination [is] for an older\n        employee to be fired because the employer believes that productivity and\n        competence decline with old age,”. . . whereas discrimination on the basis of pension\n        status “would not constitute discriminatory treatment on the basis of age [because\n        t]he prohibited stereotype [of the faltering worker] would not have figured in this\n        decision, and the attendant stigma would not ensue . . . .”\n\nGeneral Dynamics Land Sys., Inc. v. Cline, 124 S.Ct. 1236, 1244 (2004)(citations omitted).\n\n        Tyson argued at trial that it was motivated by financial considerations and that it negotiated\n\nthe Memorandum of Agreement in order to make the sale and transfer of SKF, a failing business,\n\nfinancially feasible. Plaintiffs recognize that Tyson acted for financial reasons, but assert that Tyson\n\ndrew these distinctions based on the affected employees’ age and pension status. Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat Tyson itself argued that it distinguished the employees according to their pension status. Tyson\n\ndenies that it drew any distinctions based on age or pension status but instead consistently argued\n\nthat it was driven solely by financial considerations.\n\n        Even if Tyson had been motivated by the retiree-applicants’ pension status, that factor is not\n\n\n        12\n                The KCRA is similar in this respect and provides that discrimination in wages or\nconditions of employment is not unlawful when made on a basis other than age:\n\n        Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, it is not an unlawful practice for an\n        employer to apply different standards of compensation, or different terms, conditions, or\n        privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority or merit system, . . . if the\n        differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of . . . age forty (40) and\n        over . . . .\n\nK.R.S. § 344.100 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                       14\n\fan impermissible basis even though it is an empirical correlate with age. Plaintiffs say that the\n\nretiree-applicants’ pension status was an obvious proxy for their age of 40 and over and that Tyson\n\nused pension status as an excuse to discriminate against them on the basis of age. Plaintiffs’\n\nargument, however, is not supported by any evidence of record.\n\n       A plaintiff is not precluded from pursuing the possibility that an employer “who targets\n\nemployees with a particular pension status on the assumption that these employees are likely to be\n\nolder thereby engages in age discrimination.” Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 612-13. “Pension status\n\nmay be a proxy for age . . . in the sense that the employer may suppose a correlation between the two\n\nfactors and act accordingly.” Id. at 613. Plaintiffs contend that Tyson “had to suppose such a\n\ncorrelation. . . because of the obvious age-biased parameters (age 55 years or 30 years of company\n\nservice with SKF) of the ‘retiree-applicant’ policy.” Appellants’ Brief, at p. 33 (emphasis in\n\noriginal). This argument either presupposes that there was direct evidence of Tyson’s motivation\n\nor relies too heavily on Plaintiffs’ unsupported theory that the retiree-applicant policy violated the\n\nADEA per se. The only evidence Plaintiffs produced that the pay reduction was motivated by\n\ndiscriminatory animus was the adverse impact of the policy. While a plaintiff is not precluded from\n\nseeking to prove that pension status was a subterfuge for age discrimination, the record here does\n\nnot contain evidence to support such a contention.\n\n       This Court has underscored that “[t]he ADEA was not intended to protect older workers from\n\nthe often harsh economic realities of common business decisions and the hardships associated with\n\ncorporate reorganizations, downsizing, plant closings and relocations.” Allen, 33 F.3d at 677.\n\nConsequently, the Court has held that to state a claim under the ADEA, “plaintiffs must allege that\n\n[defendant] discriminated against them because they were old, not because they were\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fexpensive . . . .” Id. at 677; see also EEOC v. American Tel. & Tel. Co., 2000 WL 332006, No. 98-\n\n4348 (6th Cir. March 22, 2000)(unpublished). In this case, Plaintiffs have offered no facts or direct\n\nevidence that Tyson intended for the retiree-applicant policy to discriminate against the employees\n\non the basis of their protected trait of age.\n\n        Under a de novo standard of review, the district court therefore did not err is denying\n\nPlaintiffs’ motion for judgment as a matter of law in this regard. With respect to Plaintiffs’ motion\n\nfor new trial, the jury in this case reached the conclusion that the Defendant had no intent to\n\ndiscriminate on the basis of age. This Court may reverse the decision of the district court only if\n\n“reasonable minds could not come to a conclusion other than the one favoring the movant\n\n[Plaintiffs].” K & T Enters., Inc. v. Zurich Ins. Co., 97 F.3d 171, 176 (6th Cir. 1996). After a review\n\nof the record, we find that the decision of the district court was not erroneous.\n\n        2.      Circumstantial Evidence\n\n        Without direct evidence of discrimination, Plaintiffs must rely on the burden-shifting\n\nframework first articulated in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973), and later\n\nrefined in Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248 (1981), to prove disparate\n\ntreatment. Although the Kentucky Supreme Court has not squarely addressed whether the\n\nMcDonnell Douglas burden-shifting analysis applies to age discrimination cases under the KCRA,\n\nthe parties do not dispute the issue and we will therefore assume that it does. Harker, 679 S.W.2d\n\nat 229-30; Turner v. Pendennis Club, 19 S.W.3d 117, 119-20 (Ky. App. 2000).\n\n        Because “[t]here will seldom be ‘eyewitness’ testimony as to the employer’s mental\n\nprocesses,” U.S. Postal Serv. Bd. of Governors v. Aikens, 460 U.S. 711, 716 (1983), courts have\n\nemployed some variant of the framework articulated in McDonnell Douglas to analyze claims that\n\n\n                                                  16\n\fare based largely on circumstantial evidence that arises under the ADEA. Reeves v. Sanderson\n\nPlumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 142 (2000). Under this framework, a plaintiff alleging age\n\ndiscrimination has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of intentional discrimination.\n\nId. Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of intentional discrimination, the burden of\n\nproduction shifts to the defendant to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Weigel v.\n\nBaptist Hosp. of East Tenn.., 302 F.2d 367, 377 (6th Cir. 2002). If the employer carries its burden\n\nof articulating a nondiscriminatory reason for its decision, the presumption of discrimination that\n\narises from the plaintiff’s prima facie case disappears and the plaintiff must show that the\n\ndefendant’s proffered explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination. Burdine, 450 U.S. at\n\n255-56. The plaintiff may establish pretext by showing “either (1) that the proffered reasons had\n\nno basis in fact, (2) that the proffered reasons did not actually motivate his discharge, or (3) that they\n\nwere insufficient to motivate discharge.” Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1084 (quotation marks omitted). “[A]\n\nplaintiff’s prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer’s asserted\n\njustification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully\n\ndiscriminated,” although such a showing might not “always be adequate to sustain a jury’s finding\n\nof liability.” Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148. Irrespective of whether Plaintiffs’ proof of disparate treatment\n\nis direct or circumstantial, the ultimate question regarding liability is the same. Liability depends\n\non whether the protected trait, in this case, age, actually motivated the employer’s decision. Wexler\n\nv. White’s Fine Furniture, Inc., 317 F.3d 564, 584 (6th Cir. 2003)(citing Reeves, 530 U.S. at 141).\n\n        The parties do not dispute that Plaintiffs met their initial burden of establishing a prima facie\n\ncase. The parties focus instead on the element of pretext. Plaintiffs argue that Tyson was unable to\n\narticulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for enforcing the policy mandated by the\n\n\n                                                   17\n\fMemorandum of Agreement.\n\n       Tyson claimed as a nondiscriminatory reason for its action that the wage and vacation benefit\n\nreduction was necessary to make its acquisition of an unprofitable and failing commercial enterprise\n\na viable business decision. Tyson further asserts that the Union agreed to the company’s plan to\n\nlimit a reduction in wages to the retiree-applicant class, rather than an across-the-board $5.00 wage\n\nreduction for all employees. In this manner, at the end of the day, no employee retained by Tyson\n\nwas earning less– if pension benefits are included– than that employee earned before the buyout.\n\nAccording to Tyson, this method was designed to prevent a pay cut to any employee, not to\n\ndiscriminate against older workers.\n\n       Plaintiffs acknowledge Tyson’s stated reason for the retiree-applicant policy was to save\n\nmoney and to permit the plant to stay open, but argue that such cost-savings measures may not be\n\nimplemented in a discriminatory fashion.         Because Plaintiffs argue that the policy was\n\ndiscriminatory on its face as against older workers, Plaintiffs maintain that Tyson’s articulated\n\nbusiness justification is not “legitimate.” Plaintiffs argue that Tyson could have achieved the same\n\ncost-savings benefits using other methods, but chose instead to cut wages and vacations benefits of\n\nthe retiree-applicants.\n\n       Plaintiffs, however, may not prove pretext by attacking the soundness of an employment\n\ndecision. Hein v. All Am. Plywood Co., 232 F.3d 482, 490 (6th Cir. 2000); Brocklehurst v. PPG\n\nIndus., Inc., 123 F.3d 890, 898 (6th Cir. 1997). “An age discrimination action is not ‘a device which\n\npermits the jury to examine an employer’s reasons for discharge and determine that the employer’s\n\nbusiness judgment or policies do not appeal to its sensibilities.’” Brocklehurst, 123 F.3d at 898\n\n(quoting Elliott v. Group Med. & Surgical Serv., 714 F.2d 556, 567 (5th Cir. 1983)). Plaintiffs have\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fnot shown that Tyson’s proffered cost-savings justification had no basis in fact, was not the actual\n\nreason motivating the decision to implement the retiree-applicant policy, or that its reason was\n\ninsufficient to justify the decision. Further, Plaintiffs have not produced any evidence that Tyson’s\n\nstated reasons for agreeing with the proposal to treat retiree-applicants as new employees – to save\n\nmoney, to make the acquisition viable, and prevent a cut in over-all compensation to each employee\n\n– were false.13 Plaintiffs insist that the policy was discriminatory, but they did not provide more\n\nthan that assertion in their attempts to persuade the jury that Tyson’s stated business justification\n\nwas a pretext for discrimination.\n\n         Plaintiffs argue that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on liability, applying\n\nthe McDonnell Douglas framework. Employing the burden shifting model articulated in McDonnell\n\nDouglas to analyze Plaintiffs’ ADEA claims, Plaintiffs failed to show pretext, or that age played a\n\nrole in the decision-making process relating to the decision to implement the Memorandum of\n\nAgreement.\n\n         The district court therefore was correct in denying Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment as a matter\n\nof law and is affirmed. To the extent that Plaintiffs sought a new trial on these issues, the jury’s\n\nverdict is reasonably supported such that the district court properly denied Plaintiffs’ motion for new\n\ntrial.\n\nB.       Disparate Impact\n\n         Plaintiffs conceded that proof of “pure” disparate impact, without more, “probably does not\n\n\n         13\n                  Again, the parties dispute whether the Union first proposed the idea of a second tier of\nemployees or if Tyson presented the plan on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Tyson points to trial testimony\nindicating that its representatives did not present the idea. (Gostomski Testimony, Jx. 258-62, 302;\nBartley Testimony; Jx. at 331). Plaintiffs point to testimony that Tyson representatives first presented the\nproposal. (Bartley Testimony, Jx. 335-36.) In any event, there is no dispute that the challenged pay\nstructure was agreed upon by the Defendant with the Union.\n\n                                                    19\n\fapply to an age discrimination case.” (Appellants’ Brief, p. 44; Response to Mot. for Summ. Jdgmt.,\n\np. 17.) They argue nonetheless that they were entitled to rely on a disparate impact theory to prove\n\nintentional discrimination under a circumstantial proof model. According to Plaintiffs, the retiree-\n\napplicant policy has a per se disparate impact upon a protected class. They argue that, by its very\n\nnature, any facially discriminatory policy will have a disparate impact upon the individuals to whom\n\nit applies. Plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred when it did not permit them to present its\n\ndisparate impact theory to the jury. The Plaintiffs further contend that the district court failed to\n\ninclude jury instructions relating to this claim. It appears that Plaintiffs misconstrue the application\n\nand contours of a disparate impact claim.\n\n        The issue of whether the ADEA contemplates an action on a disparate-impact basis is the\n\nsubject of intense debate.14 The Supreme Court, in fact, recently granted a petition for a writ of\n\ncertiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to decide whether a disparate\n\nimpact theory of liability is available under the ADEA. Smith v. City of Jackson, Miss., 124 S.Ct.\n\n1724 (2004).15\n\n        As it stands, the Supreme Court in Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. 604 (1993), cast considerable\n\ndoubt on the viability of disparate impact claims in age discrimination cases. The Court recognized\n\nthat it had “never decided whether a disparate impact theory of liability is available under the\n\nADEA,” and expressly declined to decide the issue on the facts presented in that case. Id. at 610.\n\nThe Court emphasized, however, that Section 4(a)(2) of the ADEA prohibits an employer from\n\n\n        14\n                No Kentucky state court has expressly addressed whether a disparate impact theory of\nrecovery for age-based discrimination is available under the Kentucky Civil Rights Act.\n        15\n                The Supreme Court had previously agreed to decide the issue in late 2001, but dismissed\nthe case following a brief oral argument indicating that the writ of certiorari had been improvidently\ngranted. Adams v. Florida Power Co., 535 U.S. 228 (2002).\n\n                                                  20\n\ftaking adverse employment actions “because of [an] individual’s age.” 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2). The\n\nCourt therefore held that the most natural reading of the ADEA compels the conclusion that it\n\nprohibits only intentional age-based discrimination. Id. The Court noted that “[d]isparate treatment\n\n. . . captures the essence of what Congress sought to prohibit in the ADEA.” Id. Although the Court\n\nfocused on clarifying the standards for liability under the ADEA in a disparate treatment case, the\n\nconcurrence noted that “there are substantial arguments that it is improper to carry over disparate\n\nimpact analysis from Title VII to the ADEA.” Id. at 618 (Kennedy J., concurring).\n\n        The circuits are divided as to whether disparate impact claims are cognizable under the\n\nADEA. The Second, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have found that, because the language of the ADEA\n\nparallels Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, disparate impact claims also should be allowed\n\nunder the ADEA.16 In contrast, the viability of disparate impact claims under the ADEA have been\n\nquestioned by the First, Third, Seventh and Tenth Circuits.17\n\n        This Court has recognized the uncertain availability of a disparate impact claim in age\n\ndiscrimination cases, but has not yet definitely decided the issue. See Lyon v. Ohio Educ. Ass’n &\n\nProf. Staff Union, 53 F.3d 135, 139-40 n.5 (6th Cir. 1995)(noting that “[t]here is considerable doubt\n\nas to whether a claim of age discrimination may exist under a disparate-impact theory. . .

Federal Forge . . . that a\n\ndisparate-impact theory of age discrimination may be possible, we have subsequently noted that in\n\nlight of the Supreme Court’s decision in Hazen Paper, . . . there is now ‘considerable doubt as to\n\nwhether a claim of age discrimination may exist under a disparate-impact theory.’” (citations\n\nomitted)). Indeed, this Court opined in Lyon that the Supreme Court’s “focus in Hazen Paper on\n\nCongress’s intent to prevent discrimination based on inaccurate and damaging stereotypes suggests\n\nthat incidental discriminatory effects arising from facially age-neutral policies are not redressable.”\n\nLyon, 53 F.3d at 139 n.5.\n\n       In the present case, recognizing the differences between Title VII and the ADEA, the\n\nadmonitions of Hazen Paper, and the apparent trend among the courts of appeals to conclude that\n\nthe ADEA does not support a disparate impact claim, the district court determined that there could\n\nbe no recovery in this circuit under the ADEA using such a theory. Given the similarities between\n\nthe ADEA and the KCRA, the district court also declined to allow a disparate impact claim under\n\nthe state KCRA. The district court therefore awarded summary judgment to Tyson on Plaintiffs’\n\ndisparate impact claim and subsequently refused to charge the jury on this theory of liability.\n\n       Under the circumstances presented here, we need not decide whether this Circuit will\n\ncondone disparate impact as a viable theory of recovery in an age discrimination case. Plaintiffs\n\nconcede that a cause of action “probably” does not exist under the ADEA for disparate impact\n\nclaims. While they argue that the district court should have permitted them to employ a disparate\n\nimpact theory as a means to recovery, they do not appear to argue that this Court should adopt the\n\ntheory as viable under the ADEA. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that they have established a case of\n\ndisparate treatment by virtue of a wage scale that has a disparate impact on older workers. This\n\n\n                                                  22\n\fargument is effectively foreclosed under the disparate treatment analysis above.\n\n        Further, this case arises in the context of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, not the ADEA. The\n\nSupreme Court of Kentucky has not spoken on this important matter as it relates to its state law. For\n\nthese reasons, the Court declines the opportunity to opine any further than it has in the past in Lyon\n\nand Gantt given the facts presented here.\n\nC.      Evidentiary Issues and Motion for New Trial\n\n        Plaintiffs also assert that the district court erred in admitting certain testimony concerning\n\nwhat Plaintiffs’ Union representatives said during negotiations. If a trial court has improperly\n\nadmitted evidence and a substantial right of a party has been affected, a new trial may be warranted.\n\nGenerally, the grant or denial of a new trial is purely within the discretion of the trial court and will\n\nnot be reversed except upon a showing abuse of discretion. Whittington v. New Jersey Zinc Co., 775\n\nF.2d 698, 700 (6th Cir. 1985).\n\n        Plaintiffs argue that Tyson should not have been permitted to shift responsibility for its\n\ndiscriminatory conduct to the Union. Before trial, Plaintiffs moved to limit any testimony that\n\nwould attempt to show that they had waived their rights by being members of a union that had\n\nagreed to the policy about which they were complaining. Plaintiffs based their arguments on the\n\ndistrict court’s reasoning in its Opinion and Order dismissing Tyson’s third-party complaint against\n\nthe Union. The district court did not rule on this motion.         Mike Gostomski testified that Joe\n\nVillines, a Union representative, had suggested the basic parameters of the retiree-applicant policy.\n\nPlaintiffs now assert that the testimony should not have been admitted because it was hearsay.\n\n        A district court’s evidentiary determinations are subject to an abuse of discretion standard\n\nof review. See United States v. Rios, 842 F.2d 868, 872 (6th Cir.1988). A district court’s\n\n\n                                                   23\n\fconclusions of law, however, such as whether proffered evidence constitutes hearsay within the\n\nmeaning of the Federal Rules of Evidence, are reviewed de novo. United States v. Levy, 904 F.2d\n\n1026, 1029 (6th Cir. 1990).\n\n       Hearsay is defined as “a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at\n\nthe trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.” Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(c). The district court’s determination to admit Mr. Gostomski’s testimony that Joe Villines,\n\nStaff Representative for the Union, suggested and agreed to the retiree-applicants’ portion of the\n\nMemorandum of Agreement was proper. First, the statements were admissible non-hearsay used\n\nto show Gostomski’s state of mind. Whether the retiree-applicant reductions would be agreeable\n\nto the Union members is immaterial; the testimony that the Union would not accept the across-the-\n\nboard reductions, but would allow selective reductions, was not used to prove the truth of the matter\n\nasserted, but to show Tyson’s state of mind in adopting the proposal.\n\n       Second, this statement, having a bearing on the intent underlying Tyson’s subsequent\n\nconduct, is admissible. McCormick on Evidence § 249, 100-01 (5th Ed. 2003). The statements\n\nconstituted part of the verbal act of contract offer and acceptance of the type that is excluded from\n\nthe definition of hearsay. Preferred Properties, Inc. v. Indian River Estates, Inc., 276 F.3d 790, 798\n\nn.5 (6th Cir. 2002) (“The verbal acts doctrine applies where ‘legal consequences flow from the fact\n\nthat words were said, e.g. the words of offer and acceptance which create a contract.’” (quoting\n\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1558 (6th Ed. 1990))).\n\n       Third, even assuming that the statements were otherwise inadmissible hearsay, they would\n\nbe admissible either as a statement by Plaintiffs’ agent concerning a matter within the scope of the\n\nagency made during the existence of the relationship, or as a statement by a person authorized by\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fthe Plaintiffs to make a statement concerning the subject. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D); Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(C).\n\n       Because the district court correctly ruled that Gostomski’s testimony concerning what\n\nPlaintiffs’ union representative said during negotiations was admissible, Plaintiffs were not entitled\n\nto a new trial on that basis. The district court decision in this respect, therefore, is affirmed.\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED in all respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\f",

Plaintiffs, Appellants herein (“Plaintiffs”), appeal from the final\n\njudgment of the United States District Court for Western Kentucky at Bowling Green denying their\n\nMotion for Judgment as a Matter of Law or, in the alternative, Motion for a New Trial in this age-\n\nbased discrimination case arising under the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, K.R.S. § 344.040(1).\n\nPlaintiffs, forty-nine (49) employees of Defendant-Appellee, Tyson Bearing Corporation, Inc.\n\n(“Tyson”), allege that the application of a collectively bargained agreement with the United Steel\n\nWorkers of America, AFL-CIO, the labor organization representing the employees at Tyson,\n\ndiscriminates against them on the basis of age in violation of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act.\n\nPlaintiffs appeal the jury verdict for Tyson in this diversity age discrimination action. For the\n\n\n        *\n           The Honorable Edmund A. Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District of\nOhio, sitting by designation.\n\freasons that follow, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.\n\n                                                     I.\n\n\n        Plaintiffs are all hourly employees over the age of 40 who work for Tyson. Each is a\n\nrecipient of a pension from the former owner of the Tyson facility, SKF, USA, Inc. (“SKF”).\n\nPlaintiffs assert that Tyson pays them lower wages and provides them less advantageous vacation\n\nbenefits than their co-workers because of their protected status as workers over the age of forty (40).\n\n        Effective June 11, 1999, Tyson, a corporate entity formed by its parent company, Roller\n\nBearing Corporation of America (“RBC”), purchased the Tapered Bearing Division of SKF at\n\nGlasgow, Kentucky. Prior to the time of the purchase, the Tapered Bearing Division of SKF was\n\nexperiencing financial difficulties. In February 1999, RBC proposed to take over and continue\n\noperating the Tapered Bearing Division in the same building that SKF occupied.\n\n        Most SKF tapered bearing employees were represented by the United Steelworkers of\n\nAmerica, AFL-CIO (“Union”). Accordingly, Tyson negotiated with the Union over the terms and\n\nconditions of employment that would apply after the purchase.1 Tyson negotiated with the Union,\n\nas well as suppliers, subcontractors, and salaried employees, in order to secure financial concessions\n\nso as to make the acquisition viable. As Tyson and the Union negotiated, Tyson understood that\n\nSKF was losing money and that the Tapered Bearing Division was expecting reduced sales volumes\n\non an on-going basis. Tyson therefore anticipated that, after the parties finalized the transaction, it\n\nwould be forced to reduce the employee roster to 130 from the approximately 260 employees then\n\n\n\n        1\n                 Plaintiffs did not join the Union as a party. Tyson filed a third-party complaint against\nthe Union and tried to join it as a party. The district court, however, granted the Union’s motion to\ndismiss the third-party complaint. That issue is not before the Court.\n\n                                                     2\n\fcovered by the Union contract.\n\n        During the negotiations, Tyson’s representative, Mike Gostomski, proposed a $5.00 per hour\n\nacross the board wage reduction for all employees. The Union rejected this proposal. Instead, the\n\nparties developed the idea to allow SKF retirees to work at Tyson as “second tier” employees.2\n\nUltimately, the concept of second-tier employees was memorialized in a Memorandum of\n\nAgreement. The Memorandum of Agreement provided, in pertinent part:\n\n        It is contemplated . . . that certain members of the bargaining unit, currently\n        employed by SKF, will retire under the SKF Pension Plan, prior to the closing date\n        [June 15, 1999], pursuant to the 30-Year Retirement without actuarial reduction\n        option (including these employees who are eligible to age into such option pursuant\n        to the 1999 amendments to the labor contract) described in a Memorandum of\n        Understanding between SKF and the Union or pursuant to an Early Retirement\n        option with actuarial reduction, based on age 55 or older and at least 10 years of\n        service, and will thereafter confirm to the Company that they are available for\n        immediate employment in a Tyson Bearing Bargaining Unit position at the Tyson\n        Bearing Glasgow facility after the closing date. The parties have agreed that such\n        retirees (hereinafter “retiree-applicants) will be employed by the Company subject\n        to certain terms and conditions that differ from the terms and conditions generally\n        applicable under the labor contract.\n\n(Memorandum of Agreement, at 2; Jx. at 206.) This modification created a class of 79 “retiree-\n\napplicants” which included all 49 of the Plaintiffs in this case. The retiree-applicants were to be\n\ntreated, for compensation purposes, as employees hired after March 31, 1996.3 This categorization\n\n\n        2\n                  The parties dispute the issue of who, as between the Union and Tyson, originally\npresented the idea of a second tier of employees. The district court determined that Plaintiffs had adduced\nevidence to the effect that Tyson imposed this obligation on the Union on a take-it-or-leave-it-basis and\nthat this dispute about a genuine issue of material fact precluded summary judgment on Plaintiffs’\ndisparate treatment claim.\n        3\n                 In particular, the Memorandum of Agreement indicated that a retiree-applicant “ . . . shall\nbe considered to be an employee hired after March 31, 1996, for purposes of Article XIV, Section 3., of\nthe labor contract.” (Memorandum of Agreement, Section III, “Retiree-Applicants”; Jx. 195.) Section\nXIV of the labor contract provided that “[a]ll employees hired after March 31, 1996 will be paid $3.00\nper hour, lower than the prevailing wage scale in effect for this labor agreement.” (Labor Agreement,\nSection XIV; Jx. 170.)\n\n                                                     3\n\fmeant that retiree-applicants would be paid $3.00 less per hour than they had been earning with SKF\n\nand that they would receive only two weeks of vacation time.4 All the retiree-applicants were\n\nreceiving a pension from SKF when they became employees of Tyson. This class included only\n\nworkers who had 10 years of service credit with SKF and had attained the age of 55, and employees\n\nwith at least 30 years of SKF service.5 Plaintiffs are among the class of employees who\n\naffirmatively severed their employment with SKF by retiring before the closing date and were\n\nrehired by Tyson after the sale.\n\n        The Memorandum of Agreement affected no other class of employees’ wages or vacation\n\ntime.6 Some employees who were over the age of 40 and eligible for retirement from SKF chose\n\nnot to do so. These active employees who were over 40 but who did not retire or begin receiving\n\na pension from SKF transferred to Tyson and did not have their pay or vacation benefits reduced.\n\n        The Memorandum of Agreement was incorporated into the then-existing labor agreement\n\nbetween SKF and the Union. On June 11, 1999, Tyson assumed the current collective bargaining\n\n\n        4\n                   The Union also bargained for a number of benefits for the retiree-applicants not\notherwise available to individuals hired after March 31, 1996, including the following: (1) they would be\nassigned to the same position they held at SKF; (2) they would not have to serve another probationary\nperiod; (3) they would be eligible for insurance benefits as if they had been employed prior to March 27,\n1993; (4) they would maintain their original seniority date from SKF for purposes of layoff, recall,\ntransfers, filling of vacancies, and other such non-economic provisions of the Agreement; (5) they would\nbe entitled to two weeks of vacation and would be eligible for increased vacation if certain production\ncost levels were reached; (6) they would be entitled to a monthly additional payment of $150 if they opted\nout of single medical coverage, or $250 if they opted out of married with or without dependents medical\ninsurance coverage; (7) they would be entitled to certain wage increases based on Tyson’s production\ncosts in the future; and (8) they would not be required to take a medical examination to qualify for\nemployment.\n        5\n           Although second tier employees made $3.00 less per hour, with the reduced wage, plus their\nretirement benefit, the parties expected that the group would receive a combined wage and pension\nbenefit that exceeded their former wage level.\n        6\n                Other employees who started work after March 31, 1996 continued to have only two\nweeks of vacation and earn $3.00 less per hour than their previously hired counterparts.\n\n                                                    4\n\fagreement negotiated by the Union and SKF and signed the Memorandum of Agreement. Tyson\n\ntherefore agreed to transfer active SKF employees to its payroll and to employ then-current SKF\n\nemployees who had retired from SKF prior to the closing date.\n\n       After Tyson’s takeover, some of the retiree-applicants filed a grievance asserting that the pay\n\nand vacation time reduction violated the collective bargaining agreement. The grievance was\n\nprocessed through the initial steps, but did not proceed to arbitration.\n\n       Plaintiffs filed a complaint in Kentucky state court on August 29, 2002 alleging age\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act, K.R.S. § 344.040(1) and (2), asserting\n\nboth disparate treatment and disparate impact theories of recovery. On October 5, 2001, Tyson\n\nremoved the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.\n\n       On September 3, 2002, Tyson filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiffs\n\nhad no proof of intentional discrimination and that Plaintiffs could not state a claim for disparate\n\nimpact under the age discrimination provisions of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act. Plaintiffs\n\nresponded and filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that the facially discriminatory\n\nnature of the policy at issue entitled them to summary judgment. The district court denied the\n\nparties’ motions for summary judgment on January 2, 2003.\n\n       Both parties filed motions for reconsideration. Plaintiffs argued that they had submitted\n\nsufficient evidence of direct discrimination to justify summary judgment in their favor. Defendant\n\nmaintained that Plaintiffs had shown insufficient evidence of discriminatory intent to allege a\n\ncognizable claim of disparate treatment on the basis of age and that no disparate impact age\n\n\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fdiscrimination cause of action exists under the Kentucky Civil Rights Act.7 On February 7, 2003,\n\nthe district court denied Plaintiffs’ motion and granted Tyson’s motion to the extent it argued that\n\nthe Kentucky Civil Rights Act does not recognize an age-based discrimination claim under a\n\ndisparate impact theory of recovery.\n\n       The parties proceeded to trial on the issue of disparate treatment. Plaintiffs submitted\n\nproposed jury instruction incorporating three theories of liability: (1) disparate impact; (2) disparate\n\ntreatment based on circumstantial evidence that focused on a McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1973), “pretext” analysis; and (3) disparate treatment based on the facially\n\ndiscriminatory nature of the policy at issue. The district court refused to give a disparate impact\n\ninstruction and instead gave the following instructions:\n\n              In order to prevail on their claim of age discrimination, the Plaintiffs must\n       prove the following two essential elements by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n               (1)     The Plaintiffs were forty years of age or older; and\n\n               (2)     Plaintiffs’ age was a motivating factor in the Defendant’s decision to\n                       enter into the Memorandum of Agreement of June 10, 1999 that\n                       reduced Plaintiffs’ compensation and benefits.\n\n              The term “motivating factor” means a consideration that moved Defendant\n       Tyson Bearing Co. toward its decision. A consideration can be a “motivating factor”\n       without being the only motivation for a particular decision. However, it must have\n       been a factor that actually led to the decision.\n\n              The mere fact that Plaintiffs are 40 years of age or older and received reduced\n       pay and benefits is not sufficient, in and of itself, to establish Plaintiffs’ claim.\n\n(Instruction 6, Jx. 137.)\n\n       The jury returned a verdict in favor of Tyson. Plaintiffs filed post-trial motions requesting\n\n       7\n                Defendant Tyson also argued that Plaintiffs’ claims were preempted by Section 301 of\nthe Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. § 185(a). The district court rejected that argument. The\nissue of preemption, however, is not presently before the Court.\n\n                                                   6\n\fjudgment as a matter of law, or in the alternative, a new trial. The district court denied Plaintiffs’\n\nmotions. This appeal followed.\n\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       Plaintiffs assert error in the district court’s denial of its (1) motion for summary judgment\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 56; (2) motion for judgment as a matter of law (directed verdict) under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 50(a); and (3) motion for judgment as a matter of law (notwithstanding the verdict) under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 50(b). Plaintiffs also argue that the district court erred in denying its alternative\n\nmotion for new trial. Finally, Plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred by failing to give\n\ncertain jury instructions relating to its theories of recovery for age-based discrimination.\n\n       “[W]here summary judgment is denied and the movant subsequently loses after a full trial\n\non the merits, the denial of summary judgment may not be appealed.” Jarrett v.

The statute provides\n\nthat it is unlawful for an employer:\n\n        (1)     To fail or refuse to hire, or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to\n                discriminate against an individual with respect to compensation, terms,\n                conditions, or privileges of employment, because of the individual's . . . age\n                forty (40) and over . . .[and]\n\n        (2)     To limit, segregate, or classify employees in any way which would deprive\n                or tend to deprive an individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\n                adversely affect status as an employee, because of the individual's . . . age\n                forty (40) and over . . . .\n\nK.R.S. § 344.040(1) & (2). Kentucky courts typically interpret the age discrimination proscriptions\n\nof the KCRA to mirror the prohibitions set forth in the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of\n\n1967, 29 U.S.C. § 623 et seq.

The Supreme Court often\n\ndistinguishes between the two theories of discrimination and describes the distinction as follows:\n\n                “Disparate treatment” . . . is the most easily understood type of\n        discrimination. The employer simply treats some people less favorably than others\n        because of their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. Proof of discriminatory\n        motive is critical, although it can in some situations be inferred from the mere fact\n        of differences in treatment. . . .\n\n                 Claims of disparate treatment may be distinguished from claims that stress\n        “disparate impact.” The latter involve employment practices that are facially neutral\n        in their treatment of different groups but that in fact fall more harshly on one group\n        than another and cannot be justified by business necessity. Proof of discriminatory\n        motive . . . is not required under a disparate-impact theory.\n\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters v.

Disparate Treatment\n\n        1.       Direct Evidence\n\n        Plaintiffs maintain that Tyson’s retiree-applicant wage and benefit policy, which directed\n\nwage and benefit cuts to a group of workers who were all over the age of 40, discriminates on its\n\nface against them on the basis of their age. Plaintiffs argue that any policy that by its express terms,\n\napplies only to the detriment of members of a protected class is discriminatory on its face. Because\n\na Tyson employee had to be over the age of 40 in order for the wage and benefit reductions to apply,\n\nPlaintiffs argue that the policy discriminated against all the members of the group of retiree-\n\napplicants on its face.\n\n        Plaintiffs argue that the Memorandum of Agreement is direct evidence, in and of itself, of\n\nage discrimination, and that they are therefore entitled to judgment as a matter of law on the issue\n\nof liability.

Captains who reached the age of 60, however,\n\ncould not automatically “bump” flight engineers and could remain with the airline only if they had\n\nbeen able to obtain flight engineer status through the bidding procedures outlined in the collective\n\n\n                                                  11\n\fbargaining agreement. If the airline had no vacancy prior to a captain’s 60th birthday, or if the\n\ncaptain lacked the requisite seniority to bid on a vacancy, the captain would be retired. Id. A\n\ncaptain displaced for any reason besides age did not have to resort to the bidding procedures of the\n\nlabor agreement. Id. at 116-17. The Supreme Court held that the airline’s facially discriminatory\n\njob-transfer policy violated the ADEA. Id. at 128. Thurston did not, however, establish the\n\nunequivocal principle that an employer’s facially discriminatory policy will in every instance and\n\nwithout more entitle an ADEA claimant to judgment as a matter of law. Case law following\n\nThurston clarifies the standards of liability under the ADEA.\n\n        Plaintiffs misapprehend the nature of direct proof necessary to sustain their claim in a\n\ndisparate treatment case.

Plaintiffs\n\npoint to no evidence that Tyson deliberately selected them and intended to discriminate against them\n\non the basis of age. Importantly, Plaintiffs voluntarily chose to retire from SKF prior to the takeover\n\nby Tyson. Other than pointing to the policy itself, Plaintiffs offer no evidence to suggest that\n\ndiscrimination was at least a motivating factor.\n\n        The policy itself does not treat similarly situated individuals differently because of their age.\n\nThe retiree-applicants are not similarly situated to the employees who did not terminate employment\n\nwith SKF prior to the closing date. That is, Plaintiffs are distinguishable from those employees who\n\nremained active employees and do not receive a pension from SKF. Tyson argues that the financial\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fposition of the retiree-applicants actually improved after the sale from SKF, notwithstanding the\n\n$3.00 reduction in pay. Those employees who elected to receive the pension ended up with a\n\ncombined pension and wage rate that exceeded their compensation prior to this sale.\n\n        Moreover, in a disparate treatment case, liability depends on whether the protected trait– in\n\nthis case, age– motivated the adverse employment decision.

Plaintiffs recognize that Tyson acted for financial reasons, but assert that Tyson\n\ndrew these distinctions based on the affected employees’ age and pension status. Plaintiffs contend\n\nthat Tyson itself argued that it distinguished the employees according to their pension status. Tyson\n\ndenies that it drew any distinctions based on age or pension status but instead consistently argued\n\nthat it was driven solely by financial considerations.\n\n        Even if Tyson had been motivated by the retiree-applicants’ pension status, that factor is not\n\n\n        12\n                The KCRA is similar in this respect and provides that discrimination in wages or\nconditions of employment is not unlawful when made on a basis other than age:\n\n        Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, it is not an unlawful practice for an\n        employer to apply different standards of compensation, or different terms, conditions, or\n        privileges of employment pursuant to a bona fide seniority or merit system, . . . if the\n        differences are not the result of an intention to discriminate because of . . . age forty (40) and\n        over . . . .\n\nK.R.S. § 344.100 (emphasis added).\n\n                                                       14\n\fan impermissible basis even though it is an empirical correlate with age. Plaintiffs say that the\n\nretiree-applicants’ pension status was an obvious proxy for their age of 40 and over and that Tyson\n\nused pension status as an excuse to discriminate against them on the basis of age. Plaintiffs’\n\nargument, however, is not supported by any evidence of record.\n\n       A plaintiff is not precluded from pursuing the possibility that an employer “who targets\n\nemployees with a particular pension status on the assumption that these employees are likely to be\n\nolder thereby engages in age discrimination.” Hazen Paper, 507 U.S. at 612-13. “Pension status\n\nmay be a proxy for age . . . in the sense that the employer may suppose a correlation between the two\n\nfactors and act accordingly.” Id. at 613. Plaintiffs contend that Tyson “had to suppose such a\n\ncorrelation. . . because of the obvious age-biased parameters (age 55 years or 30 years of company\n\nservice with SKF) of the ‘retiree-applicant’ policy.” Appellants’ Brief, at p. 33 (emphasis in\n\noriginal). This argument either presupposes that there was direct evidence of Tyson’s motivation\n\nor relies too heavily on Plaintiffs’ unsupported theory that the retiree-applicant policy violated the\n\nADEA per se. The only evidence Plaintiffs produced that the pay reduction was motivated by\n\ndiscriminatory animus was the adverse impact of the policy. While a plaintiff is not precluded from\n\nseeking to prove that pension status was a subterfuge for age discrimination, the record here does\n\nnot contain evidence to support such a contention.\n\n       This Court has underscored that “[t]he ADEA was not intended to protect older workers from\n\nthe often harsh economic realities of common business decisions and the hardships associated with\n\ncorporate reorganizations, downsizing, plant closings and relocations.” Allen, 33 F.3d at 677.\n\nConsequently, the Court has held that to state a claim under the ADEA, “plaintiffs must allege that\n\n[defendant] discriminated against them because they were old, not because they were\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fexpensive . . . .” Id. at 677; see also EEOC v.

Under this framework, a plaintiff alleging age\n\ndiscrimination has the initial burden of establishing a prima facie case of intentional discrimination.\n\nId. Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case of intentional discrimination, the burden of\n\nproduction shifts to the defendant to articulate a nondiscriminatory reason for its actions. Weigel v.\n\nBaptist Hosp. of East Tenn.., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">302</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">367</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377 (6th Cir. 2002). If the employer carries its burden\n\nof articulating a nondiscriminatory reason for its decision, the presumption of discrimination that\n\narises from the plaintiff’s prima facie case disappears and the plaintiff must show that the\n\ndefendant’s proffered explanation is merely a pretext for discrimination. Burdine, 450 U.S. at\n\n255-56. The plaintiff may establish pretext by showing “either (1) that the proffered reasons had\n\nno basis in fact, (2) that the proffered reasons did not actually motivate his discharge, or (3) that they\n\nwere insufficient to motivate discharge.” Manzer, 29 F.3d at 1084 (quotation marks omitted). “[A]\n\nplaintiff’s prima facie case, combined with sufficient evidence to find that the employer’s asserted\n\njustification is false, may permit the trier of fact to conclude that the employer unlawfully\n\ndiscriminated,” although such a showing might not “always be adequate to sustain a jury’s finding\n\nof liability.” Reeves, 530 U.S. at 148. Irrespective of whether Plaintiffs’ proof of disparate treatment\n\nis direct or circumstantial, the ultimate question regarding liability is the same. Liability depends\n\non whether the protected trait, in this case, age, actually motivated the employer’s decision. Wexler\n\nv.

The parties focus instead on the element of pretext. Plaintiffs argue that Tyson was unable to\n\narticulate a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for enforcing the policy mandated by the\n\n\n                                                   17\n\fMemorandum of Agreement.\n\n       Tyson claimed as a nondiscriminatory reason for its action that the wage and vacation benefit\n\nreduction was necessary to make its acquisition of an unprofitable and failing commercial enterprise\n\na viable business decision. Tyson further asserts that the Union agreed to the company’s plan to\n\nlimit a reduction in wages to the retiree-applicant class, rather than an across-the-board $5.00 wage\n\nreduction for all employees. In this manner, at the end of the day, no employee retained by Tyson\n\nwas earning less– if pension benefits are included– than that employee earned before the buyout.\n\nAccording to Tyson, this method was designed to prevent a pay cut to any employee, not to\n\ndiscriminate against older workers.\n\n       Plaintiffs acknowledge Tyson’s stated reason for the retiree-applicant policy was to save\n\nmoney and to permit the plant to stay open, but argue that such cost-savings measures may not be\n\nimplemented in a discriminatory fashion.         Because Plaintiffs argue that the policy was\n\ndiscriminatory on its face as against older workers, Plaintiffs maintain that Tyson’s articulated\n\nbusiness justification is not “legitimate.” Plaintiffs argue that Tyson could have achieved the same\n\ncost-savings benefits using other methods, but chose instead to cut wages and vacations benefits of\n\nthe retiree-applicants.\n\n       Plaintiffs, however, may not prove pretext by attacking the soundness of an employment\n\ndecision.

Further, Plaintiffs have not produced any evidence that Tyson’s\n\nstated reasons for agreeing with the proposal to treat retiree-applicants as new employees – to save\n\nmoney, to make the acquisition viable, and prevent a cut in over-all compensation to each employee\n\n– were false.13 Plaintiffs insist that the policy was discriminatory, but they did not provide more\n\nthan that assertion in their attempts to persuade the jury that Tyson’s stated business justification\n\nwas a pretext for discrimination.\n\n         Plaintiffs argue that they were entitled to judgment as a matter of law on liability, applying\n\nthe McDonnell Douglas framework. Employing the burden shifting model articulated in McDonnell\n\nDouglas to analyze Plaintiffs’ ADEA claims, Plaintiffs failed to show pretext, or that age played a\n\nrole in the decision-making process relating to the decision to implement the Memorandum of\n\nAgreement.\n\n         The district court therefore was correct in denying Plaintiffs’ motion for judgment as a matter\n\nof law and is affirmed. To the extent that Plaintiffs sought a new trial on these issues, the jury’s\n\nverdict is reasonably supported such that the district court properly denied Plaintiffs’ motion for new\n\ntrial.\n\nB.

Tyson points to trial testimony\nindicating that its representatives did not present the idea. (Gostomski Testimony, Jx. 258-62, 302;\nBartley Testimony; Jx. at 331). Plaintiffs point to testimony that Tyson representatives first presented the\nproposal. (Bartley Testimony, Jx. 335-36.) In any event, there is no dispute that the challenged pay\nstructure was agreed upon by the Defendant with the Union.\n\n                                                    19\n\fapply to an age discrimination case.” (Appellants’ Brief, p. 44; Response to Mot. for Summ. Jdgmt.,\n\np. 17.) They argue nonetheless that they were entitled to rely on a disparate impact theory to prove\n\nintentional discrimination under a circumstantial proof model. According to Plaintiffs, the retiree-\n\napplicant policy has a per se disparate impact upon a protected class. They argue that, by its very\n\nnature, any facially discriminatory policy will have a disparate impact upon the individuals to whom\n\nit applies. Plaintiffs maintain that the district court erred when it did not permit them to present its\n\ndisparate impact theory to the jury. The Plaintiffs further contend that the district court failed to\n\ninclude jury instructions relating to this claim. It appears that Plaintiffs misconstrue the application\n\nand contours of a disparate impact claim.\n\n        The issue of whether the ADEA contemplates an action on a disparate-impact basis is the\n\nsubject of intense debate.14 The Supreme Court, in fact, recently granted a petition for a writ of\n\ncertiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit to decide whether a disparate\n\nimpact theory of liability is available under the ADEA.

The Court noted that “[d]isparate treatment\n\n. . . captures the essence of what Congress sought to prohibit in the ADEA.” Id. Although the Court\n\nfocused on clarifying the standards for liability under the ADEA in a disparate treatment case, the\n\nconcurrence noted that “there are substantial arguments that it is improper to carry over disparate\n\nimpact analysis from Title VII to the ADEA.” Id. at 618 (Kennedy J., concurring).\n\n        The circuits are divided as to whether disparate impact claims are cognizable under the\n\nADEA. The Second, Eighth, and Ninth Circuits have found that, because the language of the ADEA\n\nparallels Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, disparate impact claims also should be allowed\n\nunder the ADEA.16 In contrast, the viability of disparate impact claims under the ADEA have been\n\nquestioned by the First, Third, Seventh and Tenth Circuits.17\n\n        This Court has recognized the uncertain availability of a disparate impact claim in age\n\ndiscrimination cases, but has not yet definitely decided the issue.

Indeed, this Court opined in Lyon that the Supreme Court’s “focus in Hazen Paper on\n\nCongress’s intent to prevent discrimination based on inaccurate and damaging stereotypes suggests\n\nthat incidental discriminatory effects arising from facially age-neutral policies are not redressable.”\n\nLyon, 53 F.3d at 139 n.5.\n\n       In the present case, recognizing the differences between Title VII and the ADEA, the\n\nadmonitions of Hazen Paper, and the apparent trend among the courts of appeals to conclude that\n\nthe ADEA does not support a disparate impact claim, the district court determined that there could\n\nbe no recovery in this circuit under the ADEA using such a theory. Given the similarities between\n\nthe ADEA and the KCRA, the district court also declined to allow a disparate impact claim under\n\nthe state KCRA. The district court therefore awarded summary judgment to Tyson on Plaintiffs’\n\ndisparate impact claim and subsequently refused to charge the jury on this theory of liability.\n\n       Under the circumstances presented here, we need not decide whether this Circuit will\n\ncondone disparate impact as a viable theory of recovery in an age discrimination case. Plaintiffs\n\nconcede that a cause of action “probably” does not exist under the ADEA for disparate impact\n\nclaims. While they argue that the district court should have permitted them to employ a disparate\n\nimpact theory as a means to recovery, they do not appear to argue that this Court should adopt the\n\ntheory as viable under the ADEA. Instead, Plaintiffs argue that they have established a case of\n\ndisparate treatment by virtue of a wage scale that has a disparate impact on older workers.

The\n\nSupreme Court of Kentucky has not spoken on this important matter as it relates to its state law. For\n\nthese reasons, the Court declines the opportunity to opine any further than it has in the past in Lyon\n\nand Gantt given the facts presented here.\n\nC.      Evidentiary Issues and Motion for New Trial\n\n        Plaintiffs also assert that the district court erred in admitting certain testimony concerning\n\nwhat Plaintiffs’ Union representatives said during negotiations. If a trial court has improperly\n\nadmitted evidence and a substantial right of a party has been affected, a new trial may be warranted.\n\nGenerally, the grant or denial of a new trial is purely within the discretion of the trial court and will\n\nnot be reversed except upon a showing abuse of discretion.

The district court’s determination to admit Mr. Gostomski’s testimony that Joe Villines,\n\nStaff Representative for the Union, suggested and agreed to the retiree-applicants’ portion of the\n\nMemorandum of Agreement was proper. First, the statements were admissible non-hearsay used\n\nto show Gostomski’s state of mind. Whether the retiree-applicant reductions would be agreeable\n\nto the Union members is immaterial; the testimony that the Union would not accept the across-the-\n\nboard reductions, but would allow selective reductions, was not used to prove the truth of the matter\n\nasserted, but to show Tyson’s state of mind in adopting the proposal.\n\n       Second, this statement, having a bearing on the intent underlying Tyson’s subsequent\n\nconduct, is admissible. McCormick on Evidence § 249, 100-01 (5th Ed. 2003). The statements\n\nconstituted part of the verbal act of contract offer and acceptance of the type that is excluded from\n\nthe definition of hearsay. Preferred Properties, Inc. v. Indian River Estates, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776129\"><a href=\"/opinion/776129/preferred-properties-inc-v-indian-river-estates-inc-duane-j-tillimon/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 798\n\nn.5 (6th Cir. 2002) (“The verbal acts doctrine applies where ‘legal consequences flow from the fact\n\nthat words were said, e.g. the words of offer and acceptance which create a contract.’” (quoting\n\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 1558 (6th Ed. 1990))).\n\n       Third, even assuming that the statements were otherwise inadmissible hearsay, they would\n\nbe admissible either as a statement by Plaintiffs’ agent concerning a matter within the scope of the\n\nagency made during the existence of the relationship, or as a statement by a person authorized by\n\n\n                                                 24\n\fthe Plaintiffs to make a statement concerning the subject. Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(D); Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2)(C).\n\n       Because the district court correctly ruled that Gostomski’s testimony concerning what\n\nPlaintiffs’ union representative said during negotiations was admissible, Plaintiffs were not entitled\n\nto a new trial on that basis. The district court decision in this respect, therefore, is affirmed.\n\n                                                  IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED in all respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  25\n\f</pre>",
