Further, that the refusal of defendants to admit them constitutes a denial, under color of Texas law, of educational opportunities, facilities, and advantages substantially equal to those afforded white children, in contravention of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, &#167; 1, and the rights secured by Title 8, U.S.C.A. &#167; 41.  The relief prayed was that the defendants be enjoined from excluding plaintiffs from admission to the college as students upon the ground of their membership in the Negro race, and that a statutory three-judge court be convened for the purpose of determining the constitutionality of the provisions of the Constitution<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and statutes<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> of Texas which require racial segregation in State educational institutions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants in their answer and in the written stipulation on file admit that plaintiffs possessed all of the qualifications necessary for admission to the college and that the exclusion of plaintiffs from admission on account of their race and color was in accordance with the Constitution and statutes of Texas.  Further, that defendants intend to pursue the policy of segregation of the white and colored races in classes conducted at the college until such time as the court shall declare such constitutional and statutory provisions unconstitutional and void.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court being of opinion that a three-judge court was not required, heard the case upon stipulated facts and entered judgment decreeing to the extent here pertinent, (1) that plaintiffs and other Negroes similarly qualified and situated were entitled to substantially equal educational opportunities and facilities within the Wichita Falls Junior College District as those afforded non-Negro students at Hardin Junior College; (2) that plaintiffs and all other qualified Negro students were forthwith to be admitted to Hardin Junior College; (3) that a writ of injunction issue enjoining defendants from discriminatorily denying to plaintiffs, on account of race and color, the right and privilege of attending said college and enjoying the use of all the educational opportunities and facilities there maintained and made available to all non-Negro students.  The judgment further recites that a determination of the issues presented did not require a determination of the validity of any constitutional or statutory provision of Texas under the Fourteenth Amendment.

Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 70 S.Ct. 848, 94 L.Ed. 1114; Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, 331 U.S. 549, 568-574, 67 S.Ct. 1409, 91 L.Ed. 1666.  In Sweatt v. Painter, supra, the issue, as here, related to the extent to which the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment limits the power of a State to distinguish between students of different races in a State-supported educational institution, and in disposing of this issue the court expressly pointed out that it was eliminating from the case the question of constitutionality of the State law which restricts admission to the University of Texas to white students.  Other decisions of the Supreme Court are in accord.  McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637, 70 S.Ct. 851, 94 L.Ed. 1149; Sipuel v. Board of Regents, 332 U.S. 631, 68 S.Ct. 299, 92 L.Ed. 247; Missouri ex rel. Gaines v. Canada, 305 U.S. 337, 59 S.Ct. 232, 83 L.Ed. 208.  Therefore, the question for decision is merely whether the policies, usages and customs of the appellants actually do discriminate against the appellees on account of their race and color in violation of the aforesaid Equal Protection Clause.  Such an issue is a factual one and obviously does not address itself to a three-judge court.  Rescue Army v. Municipal Court, supra; Ex parte Bransford, 310 U.S. 354, 60 S.Ct. 947, 84 L.Ed. 1249; Ex parte Collins, 277 U.S. 565, 48 S.Ct. 585, 72 L.Ed. 990; Beal v. Holcombe, 5 Cir., 193 F.2d 384.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this issue of discrimination, the material uncontroverted facts are these.  Hardin Junior College at Wichita Falls is one of thirty-three public junior colleges in the State of Texas.  But there are no courses or educational facilities within the Wichita Falls Junior College District for qualified Negro junior college students which are equal or substantially equal to the courses and facilities offered and made available to non-Negro junior college students at the Hardin Junior College.  However, there has been established in Houston, Texas, an institution known as Texas Southern University; and at Prairie View, Texas, an institution known as Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College; both of which provide physical facilities equivalent in every respect to the physical facilities of Hardin Junior College.  The two last named institutions are maintained solely for Negroes and the course of instruction, the buildings, the length of term, the courses offered, and all other elements make them the equal of any junior college in Texas.  They each give a full four year course whereas the required curriculum of a junior college consists only of freshman and sophomore college work.  Art. 2815h, &#167; 12, Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. Texas Southern University is located 411 miles from Wichita Falls.  The fare from Wichita Falls to Houston by train is $10.32 and $9.37 by bus.  Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College is 367 miles from Wichita Falls and the fare therefrom to Prairie View by train is $10.15 and by bus $8.57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts and circumstances being as related, the narrow question presented for our determination is whether discrimination in the treatment accorded to persons of different races similarly situated prevails when colored students are denied courses which are given to white students at Hardin Junior College and may procure the desired instruction only by traveling 367 or 411 miles distant.  We are, of course, mindful of the fact that public schools cannot be brought to every man's door and must be located where they will do the greatest good for the greatest number.  Some differentiation in the enjoyment of public school facilities is inevitable.  However, manifest inequalities in the treatment of Negro students may not be condoned for under the clear mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment's substantial equality is required.  In Carter v. School Board of Arlington County, Va., 4 Cir., 182 F.2d 531, as in Corbin v. County School Board of Pulaski County, 4 Cir., 177 F.2d 924, and Pearson v. Murray, 169 Md. 478, 182 A. 590, 103 A.L.R. 706, the inconvenience and loss of time and money imposed upon Negro students by transportation to distant schools were pointed out as exacting a toll on such students and their parents which is real and severe.  We are in accord with these decisions and hold as did the District Judge, that the facts here show that the privilege of attending the defendant Hardin Junior College is much less expensive in both time and money for those who reside within the Wichita Falls Junior College District than for those who are forced to go from that District several hundred miles to a like institution; and that this is a discrimination which the law does not allow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Art.

Hardin Junior College at Wichita Falls is one of thirty-three public junior colleges in the State of Texas.  But there are no courses or educational facilities within the Wichita Falls Junior College District for qualified Negro junior college students which are equal or substantially equal to the courses and facilities offered and made available to non-Negro junior college students at the Hardin Junior College.  However, there has been established in Houston, Texas, an institution known as Texas Southern University; and at Prairie View, Texas, an institution known as Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College; both of which provide physical facilities equivalent in every respect to the physical facilities of Hardin Junior College.  The two last named institutions are maintained solely for Negroes and the course of instruction, the buildings, the length of term, the courses offered, and all other elements make them the equal of any junior college in Texas.  They each give a full four year course whereas the required curriculum of a junior college consists only of freshman and sophomore college work.  Art. 2815h, &#167; 12, Vernon's Ann.Civ.St. Texas Southern University is located 411 miles from Wichita Falls.  The fare from Wichita Falls to Houston by train is $10.32 and $9.37 by bus.  Prairie View Agricultural and Mechanical College is 367 miles from Wichita Falls and the fare therefrom to Prairie View by train is $10.15 and by bus $8.57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The facts and circumstances being as related, the narrow question presented for our determination is whether discrimination in the treatment accorded to persons of different races similarly situated prevails when colored students are denied courses which are given to white students at Hardin Junior College and may procure the desired instruction only by traveling 367 or 411 miles distant.  We are, of course, mindful of the fact that public schools cannot be brought to every man's door and must be located where they will do the greatest good for the greatest number.  Some differentiation in the enjoyment of public school facilities is inevitable.  However, manifest inequalities in the treatment of Negro students may not be condoned for under the clear mandate of the Fourteenth Amendment's substantial equality is required.  In Carter v. School Board of Arlington County, Va., 4 Cir., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"225191\"><a href=\"/opinion/225191/carter-v-school-board-of-arlington-county-virginia/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">531</span></a></span>, as in Corbin v. County School Board of Pulaski County, 4 Cir., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1507346\"><a href=\"/opinion/1507346/corbin-v-county-school-board-of-pulaski-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">924</span></a></span>, and Pearson v. Murray, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3483035\"><a href=\"/opinion/3485184/university-v-murray/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Md.</span> <span class=\"page\">478</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3483035\"><a href=\"/opinion/3485184/university-v-murray/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.L.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></span>, the inconvenience and loss of time and money imposed upon Negro students by transportation to distant schools were pointed out as exacting a toll on such students and their parents which is real and severe.  We are in accord with these decisions and hold as did the District Judge, that the facts here show that the privilege of attending the defendant Hardin Junior College is much less expensive in both time and money for those who reside within the Wichita Falls Junior College District than for those who are forced to go from that District several hundred miles to a like institution; and that this is a discrimination which the law does not allow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Art.
