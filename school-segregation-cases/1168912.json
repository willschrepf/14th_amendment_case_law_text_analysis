Lilly, Jr., Sanford &amp; Lilly, a Law Corp., Gibsland, for defendants-appellees.</p>\n<p>Before BOWES, WICKER and CANNELLA, JJ.</p>\n<p>WICKER, Judge.</p>\n<p>This matter comes before us on appeal by Monsanto Company, which owns a chemical plant in St. Charles Parish. Monsanto sued the St. Charles Parish School Board and the board's Director of Tax Collections (who are responsible for the collection of all parish sales and use taxes) for refund of sales taxes paid under protest by Monsanto. Monsanto also sought recovery of the penalties and interest it paid on those taxes. The trial court found the taxes were properly assessed and dismissed Monsanto's suit. We affirm, for the reasons that follow.</p>\n<p>Monsanto contends the Director erred in assessing sales taxes on payments Monsanto received from Texaco, Inc. pursuant to a contract between the companies. At issue is whether Monsanto was selling \"wet CO2\" (a carbon dioxide waste byproduct of ammonia production) or \"dry CO2\" (purified carbon dioxide that has been compressed and had the moisture removed), and whether the services provided by Monsanto in processing the wet CO2 into dry CO2 were part of the sale.</p>\n<p>Texaco needed large quantities of dry CO2 for use in recovery of crude oil. Under the contract Texaco built a gathering/compression/dehydration facility within Monsanto's St. Charles chemical plant, at which Monsanto processed wet CO2 into dry CO2 for sale to Texaco. Monsanto's monthly invoices to Texaco listed separately the amounts for administrative services (termed by Monsanto a \"commodity charge\"), operating expense, electricity expense, and volume of CO2 sold at a fixed price per thousand-cubic-foot unit (kcf). Monsanto charged Texaco sales tax on the charges for CO2 sold, but not on the amounts for commodity charges, operating expenses, or electricity.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Following an audit the Director notified Monsanto that additional taxes, plus penalties and interest, had been assessed. The amounts in question were assessed for periods from June 1983 through May 1986 and totalled $329,304, comprising $211,658 in taxes, $52,915 in penalties, and $64,731 in interest. The Director's position is that the raw material and the manufacturing costs incurred in producing the finished product should be part of the tax base. Monsanto contends the Director erroneously included those amounts in the taxable base for sales made by Monsanto during the tax period.</p>\n<p>The trial judge reached the following conclusions in her written reasons for judgment:</p>\n<blockquote>[U]ntil completion of the compression process and delivery into Texaco's pipeline at the inlet of Texaco's metering facility, Monsanto bore all risks, control and responsibilities for the material. Texaco did not acquire title and risk until the wet CO2 was converted into dry CO2. It was not until that point that both title and risks <span class=\"star-pagination\">*259</span> passed to Texaco. The court finds it was at this point that the sale was complete. Therefore, the sale was for dry carbon dioxide, and the sales price included all of the components of the process.</blockquote>\n<p>On appeal Monsanto contends the trial court erred in the following respects: (1) in treating the business transaction at issue as a single contract rather than as a multifaceted agreement containing multiple contracts; (2) in failing to find costs incurred by Texaco in processing the wet CO2 into dry CO2 are not part of the sales price for wet CO2; (3) in failing to find that the price for the CO2 was a fixed price on a unit basis, whether the sale was of wet CO2 or dry CO2, and the fixed price did not include labor, electricity, and commodity charges; (4) in failing to characterize the transaction consistent with the trial judge in the state case; and (5) in finding that the sale transaction occurred when the dry CO2 left Texaco's facility. Alternatively, Monsanto argues that no sales tax may be imposed on the charges for electricity.</p>\n<p>The St. Charles Parish sales tax ordinance imposes a sales tax of one-percent of the sales price upon the retail sale of tangible personal property. <i>See</i> Appendix, Excerpts from St. Charles Parish Sales Tax Ordinance, Section 2.01. Under the ordinance, a \"sale at retail\" is a sale of tangible personal property or a sale of services (Section 1.16); a \"sale\" means any transfer of title or possession, or both, of tangible personal property for a consideration (Section 1.18); \"sales price\" means the total amount for which tangible personal property is sold, including any services that are part of the sale valued in money, including the cost of material used, labor or service costs (Section 1.19); \"tangible personal property\" includes any personal property that \"may be seen, weighed, measured, felt or touched, or is in any other manner perceptible to the senses\" (Section 1.21). The ordinance specifically exempts from the sales tax the sale at retail, use or consumption of electric power or energy. Section 3.01(4).</p>\n<p>The substance of a contract, not its wording nor the splitting or dividing it up by the contracting parties, is controlling for determination of sales-and-use tax liability. <i>McNamara v. Electrode Corp.,</i> 418 So.2d 652, 662 (La.App. 1st Cir.), <i>writ denied</i> 420 So.2d 986 (La.1982). The taxpayer cannot defeat collection of sales taxes by either the wording, form, or label of a contract. <i>Id.</i> We must examine the \"By-Product Sales Agreement\" between Monsanto and Texaco to determine when sales took place within the meaning of the sales tax ordinance.</p>\n<p>Paragraph 1.6 of the By-Product Sales Agreement defines \"Delivery Point\" as \"the inlet of Buyer's metering facilities....\" (Exh. P-2, p. 2.) Paragraph 7.1 provides, \"Deliveries of Material hereunder shall be made F.O.B. the Delivery Point. Title and risk of loss to the Material shall pass to Buyer at the Delivery Point.\" (Exh. P-2, p-20.) Paragraph 11.3 states,</p>\n<blockquote>Seller shall not be liable for, and Buyer assumes liability for, all personal injury and property damage connected with the handling, possession, transportation, processing, further manufacture, other use, resale or other disposition of the Material after title passes to the Buyer, whether the Material is used alone or in combination with any other material.</blockquote>\n<p>(Exh. P-2, p. 25.)</p>\n<p>As the trial judge found, the evidence establishes that the CO2 was measured (metered) near the outlet from the compression/dehydration facility into Texaco's pipeline, after it had been processed into \"dry\" CO2. Under the definitions in the contract between the parties, title and risk of loss passed to Texaco at the point of delivery, which was the inlet of the metering facilities. Because Texaco did not obtain title to the CO2 until after it had been compressed and dehydrated, under the definition of \"sale\" in the ordinance the sale did not take place until the point at which Texaco took title. The sales tax is imposed on sales as defined in the ordinance; therefore, the tax was properly imposed on the CO2 after it had been processed.</p>\n<p>The additional question to be answered, however, is whether the commodity charges and the charges for operating and electrical expenses are part of the sales price, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> as defined in the ordinance, so as to be subject to the tax.</p>\n<p>The definition of \"sales price\" encompasses any services that are part of the sale valued in money, including the cost of labor or service costs. See Ordinance, Section 1.19. Accordingly, the operating expenses and commodity charges must be considered taxable. Further, although Section 3.01(4) of the ordinance exempts from sales tax the retail sale, use or consumption of electricity, the charges for electrical expense are taxable here because the electricity was part of the process used to manufacture the dry CO2.</p>\n<p>It is undisputed that the ordinance was copied substantially from the state's sales tax statutes, La.R.S. 47:301 et seq., and that ordinances of a sales tax district and school board which were copied from the state's sales and use tax statute may be deemed to have incorporated interpretations of the state statutes on which they were based. <i>See </i><i>Sales Tax Dist. No. 1 Lafourche Parish v. Express Boat Co., Inc.,</i> 500 So.2d 364 (La.1987). However, there is no prior binding jurisprudence interpreting the portions of the statutes corresponding to the ordinance here.</p>\n<p>Monsanto relies on unpublished rulings of a Baton Rouge district judge and the First Circuit which applied the state sale tax statutes to this same contract between Monsanto and Texaco. In <i>Monsanto Company v. Shirley McNamara,</i> No. 318,112 (19th Jud. Distr.Ct., Apr. 9, 1991), the district court concluded that the agreement for the processing of the CO2 was not a taxable item under the state statute. That ruling was affirmed in an unpublished opinion by the court of appeal, on the basis that \"the evidence supports the facts found and the reasons assigned by the trial judge.\" <i>Monsanto Company v. Shirley McNamara, Secretary, Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation,</i> No. CA 91 0970 (La.App. 1st Cir. June 29, 1992).</p>\n<p>Those decisions are not precedent for this Court, however, nor do we find them persuasive. A court of appeal is not bound to follow decisions of another circuit. <i>Daigle v. Clemco Industries,</i> 593 So.2d 1282, 1286 n. 4 (La.App. 1st Cir.1991); <i>Nungesser v. Nungesser,</i> 558 So.2d 695, 700 (La.App. 1st Cir.), <i>writ denied,</i> 560 So.2d 30 (La.1990). Under the \"law of the circuit\" rule a decision by one circuit is not binding upon another circuit, but rather is persuasive only. <i>Wilson v. A-1 Industries, Inc.,</i> 451 So.2d 1251, 1253 (La. App. 4th Cir.), <i>writ denied,</i> 457 So.2d 14 (La.1984). <i>See also, </i><i>Woodard v. George Cole Chevrolet, Inc.,</i> 444 So.2d 1367, 1370 (La.App. 2nd Cir.1984).</p>\n<p>Further, under Uniform RulesCourts of Appeal, Rule 2-16.3, unpublished opinions \"shall not be cited, quoted, or referred to by any counsel, or in any argument, brief or other materials presented to the court, except in continuing or related litigation.\" <i>See </i><i>State v. Bridges,</i> 617 So.2d 515 (La.App. 4 Cir.1993). This case is not a continuance of the <i>Monsanto v. McNamara</i> case; nor is it a related case, because it involves different defendants and the parish sales tax ordinance rather than the state sales tax statutes.</p>\n<p>We find no merit to Monsanto's argument that the trial judge should have treated the \"business transaction\" between the parties as multiple contracts rather than a single contract. As mentioned above, this Court must apply the ordinance to the substance of the contract. We have done so. Under the various definitions set out not only in the ordinance but also in the contract itself, there was no sale until the product entered the meter as dry CO2. The commodity charges and operating/manufacturing expenses are part of the sales price regardless of Monsanto's attempts to segregate them.</p>\n<p>Further, we find irrelevant Monsanto's arguments regarding what would happen if it had been Texaco workers rather than Monsanto workers who ran the processing facility. In fact, it was Monsanto employees who operated and maintained the facility and provided administrative services for it, Monsanto charged for their services, and those services must be considered part of the sales price and subject to sales tax.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. Costs of this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*261</span> appeal are assessed against Monsanto Company.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<p>BOWES, J., dissents with reasons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>APPENDIX</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>EXCERPTS FROM ST.

Therefore, at the outset, these facts are very persuasive to me for the position that I take here. It seems most illogical to me to make a finding that Texaco, with its immense financial strength and its sophisticated knowledge and expertise, would contract to purchase the dry CO2 at a higher cost after having constructed a multi-million dollar facility at its own expense on another's property for conversion of the wet CO2 into dry CO2.</p>\n<p>The majority opinion relies on the provision of the contract which provides that risk and title passes from Monsanto to Texaco at the point of <i>delivery</i> which is <i>after</i> the substance has been processed into dry CO2. However, my conclusion, after a reading of the contract as a <i>whole</i> and applying thereto the basic precepts of Louisiana law governing contracts, is that in this case, each sale is perfected and title is transferred <i>prior</i> to the conversion process. Louisiana law is unmistakably clear that a sale occurs when there is an <i>agreement</i> as to the thing to be sold, the price therefore and the consent of the parties, according to LSA-C.C. art. 2439 which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>The contract of sale is an <i>agreement</i> by which one gives a thing for a price in current money, and the other gives the price in order to have the thing itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Three circumstances concur to the perfection of the contract, to wit: the thing sold, the price and the consent. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, LSA-C.C. 2456 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>The sale is considered to be perfect between the parties, and the property is of right <i>acquired</i> to the purchaser with regard to the seller, as soon as there exists an <i>agreement</i> for the object and for the price thereof, <i>although the object has not yet been delivered, nor the price paid.</i> (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, it is clear to me that, by operation of law, the sale is complete and Texaco obtains a right in and to the <i>wet</i> CO2 prior to the conversion process, although it is incapable of measurement at that time. In my interpretation of the contract, the only purpose of the provisions thereof relied upon by the majority is for the purpose of allowing the substance to be <i>measured</i> and <i>delivered</i> to the Texaco plant. Furthermore, in my view, the fact that Monsanto retains \"some\" risk of loss at this point, does not change the nature of the contract at issue.</p>\n<p>This Court has already held that the <i>substance</i> of a contract, and not the <i>form,</i> is controlling for the determination of sales and/or use taxes. See <i>Louisiana Paving v. St. Charles,</i> 604 So.2d 593 (La.App. 5 Cir. 1992). A review of the document at issue entitled \"By-Product Sales Agreement\" reflects that it contains <i>several</i> contractual agreements among the parties, only one of them being for the sale of wet CO2.</p>\n<p>In addition, and very importantly, I note that our brethren in the First Circuit are in agreement with my interpretation of the issue before us now, although I am well aware that this Court is not bound by the decision of another circuit, especially an unpublished one. However, even though I do not rely on the opinion of the judges of the First Circuit, I do find persuasive their thinking in a case involving the identical issue with the identical contract and the state sales tax statute with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*263</span> virtually identical language as the tax ordinance before us here.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I conclude that the trial court erred in finding that the contract herein was for the sale of dry CO2 and that sales tax is due on the total amount expended by Texaco for the purchase of <i>wet</i> CO2, and not for the costs of converting that substance into dry CO2; or stated in another way, I conclude that Texaco should only pay sales tax on the value of the wet CO2 before it is converted into dry CO2.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The following is typical of format of the monthly invoices:\n</p>\n<p>\"For CO2 purchased and received during the month of October, 1983:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\nCommodity Charge                     $ 25,000\nOperating Expense for month           109,629\nElectricity Expense (36,100 ckwh)    $169,915\n657,648 kcf @ 25¢/kcf            164,412\nSales Tax on CO2 Delivered                9,865\nSpare Parts                                 0\n                                      _______\n TOTAL                                478,821\"\n</pre>\n\n</div>",

The taxpayer cannot defeat collection of sales taxes by either the wording, form, or label of a contract. <i>Id.</i> We must examine the \"By-Product Sales Agreement\" between Monsanto and Texaco to determine when sales took place within the meaning of the sales tax ordinance.</p>\n<p>Paragraph 1.6 of the By-Product Sales Agreement defines \"Delivery Point\" as \"the inlet of Buyer's metering facilities....\" (Exh. P-2, p. 2.) Paragraph 7.1 provides, \"Deliveries of Material hereunder shall be made F.O.B. the Delivery Point. Title and risk of loss to the Material shall pass to Buyer at the Delivery Point.\" (Exh. P-2, p-20.) Paragraph 11.3 states,</p>\n<blockquote>Seller shall not be liable for, and Buyer assumes liability for, all personal injury and property damage connected with the handling, possession, transportation, processing, further manufacture, other use, resale or other disposition of the Material after title passes to the Buyer, whether the Material is used alone or in combination with any other material.</blockquote>\n<p>(Exh. P-2, p. 25.)</p>\n<p>As the trial judge found, the evidence establishes that the CO2 was measured (metered) near the outlet from the compression/dehydration facility into Texaco's pipeline, after it had been processed into \"dry\" CO2. Under the definitions in the contract between the parties, title and risk of loss passed to Texaco at the point of delivery, which was the inlet of the metering facilities. Because Texaco did not obtain title to the CO2 until after it had been compressed and dehydrated, under the definition of \"sale\" in the ordinance the sale did not take place until the point at which Texaco took title. The sales tax is imposed on sales as defined in the ordinance; therefore, the tax was properly imposed on the CO2 after it had been processed.</p>\n<p>The additional question to be answered, however, is whether the commodity charges and the charges for operating and electrical expenses are part of the sales price, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> as defined in the ordinance, so as to be subject to the tax.</p>\n<p>The definition of \"sales price\" encompasses any services that are part of the sale valued in money, including the cost of labor or service costs. See Ordinance, Section 1.19. Accordingly, the operating expenses and commodity charges must be considered taxable. Further, although Section 3.01(4) of the ordinance exempts from sales tax the retail sale, use or consumption of electricity, the charges for electrical expense are taxable here because the electricity was part of the process used to manufacture the dry CO2.</p>\n<p>It is undisputed that the ordinance was copied substantially from the state's sales tax statutes, La.R.S. 47:301 et seq., and that ordinances of a sales tax district and school board which were copied from the state's sales and use tax statute may be deemed to have incorporated interpretations of the state statutes on which they were based. <i>See </i><i>Sales Tax Dist. No. 1 Lafourche Parish v. Express Boat Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1708493\"><a href=\"/opinion/1708493/sales-tax-d-1-lafourche-par-v-exp-boat-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span> (La.1987). However, there is no prior binding jurisprudence interpreting the portions of the statutes corresponding to the ordinance here.</p>\n<p>Monsanto relies on unpublished rulings of a Baton Rouge district judge and the First Circuit which applied the state sale tax statutes to this same contract between Monsanto and Texaco. In <i>Monsanto Company v. Shirley McNamara,</i> No. 318,112 (19th Jud. Distr.Ct., Apr. 9, 1991), the district court concluded that the agreement for the processing of the CO2 was not a taxable item under the state statute. That ruling was affirmed in an unpublished opinion by the court of appeal, on the basis that \"the evidence supports the facts found and the reasons assigned by the trial judge.\" <i>Monsanto Company v. Shirley McNamara, Secretary, Louisiana Department of Revenue and Taxation,</i> No. CA 91 0970 (La.App. 1st Cir. June 29, 1992).</p>\n<p>Those decisions are not precedent for this Court, however, nor do we find them persuasive. A court of appeal is not bound to follow decisions of another circuit. <i>Daigle v. Clemco Industries,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1089964\"><a href=\"/opinion/1089964/daigle-v-clemco-industries/\"><span class=\"volume\">593</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1282</span></a></span>, 1286 n. 4 (La.App. 1st Cir.1991); <i>Nungesser v.

Under the \"law of the circuit\" rule a decision by one circuit is not binding upon another circuit, but rather is persuasive only. <i>Wilson v. A-1 Industries, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1869478\"><a href=\"/opinion/1869478/wilson-v-ai-industries-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1251</span></a></span>, 1253 (La.

This case is not a continuance of the <i>Monsanto v. McNamara</i> case; nor is it a related case, because it involves different defendants and the parish sales tax ordinance rather than the state sales tax statutes.</p>\n<p>We find no merit to Monsanto's argument that the trial judge should have treated the \"business transaction\" between the parties as multiple contracts rather than a single contract. As mentioned above, this Court must apply the ordinance to the substance of the contract. We have done so. Under the various definitions set out not only in the ordinance but also in the contract itself, there was no sale until the product entered the meter as dry CO2. The commodity charges and operating/manufacturing expenses are part of the sales price regardless of Monsanto's attempts to segregate them.</p>\n<p>Further, we find irrelevant Monsanto's arguments regarding what would happen if it had been Texaco workers rather than Monsanto workers who ran the processing facility. In fact, it was Monsanto employees who operated and maintained the facility and provided administrative services for it, Monsanto charged for their services, and those services must be considered part of the sales price and subject to sales tax.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. Costs of this <span class=\"star-pagination\">*261</span> appeal are assessed against Monsanto Company.</p>\n<p><i>AFFIRMED.</i></p>\n<p>BOWES, J., dissents with reasons.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>APPENDIX</i></h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2><i>EXCERPTS FROM ST.

Therefore, at the outset, these facts are very persuasive to me for the position that I take here. It seems most illogical to me to make a finding that Texaco, with its immense financial strength and its sophisticated knowledge and expertise, would contract to purchase the dry CO2 at a higher cost after having constructed a multi-million dollar facility at its own expense on another's property for conversion of the wet CO2 into dry CO2.</p>\n<p>The majority opinion relies on the provision of the contract which provides that risk and title passes from Monsanto to Texaco at the point of <i>delivery</i> which is <i>after</i> the substance has been processed into dry CO2. However, my conclusion, after a reading of the contract as a <i>whole</i> and applying thereto the basic precepts of Louisiana law governing contracts, is that in this case, each sale is perfected and title is transferred <i>prior</i> to the conversion process. Louisiana law is unmistakably clear that a sale occurs when there is an <i>agreement</i> as to the thing to be sold, the price therefore and the consent of the parties, according to LSA-C.C. art. 2439 which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>The contract of sale is an <i>agreement</i> by which one gives a thing for a price in current money, and the other gives the price in order to have the thing itself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>Three circumstances concur to the perfection of the contract, to wit: the thing sold, the price and the consent. (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, LSA-C.C. 2456 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote>The sale is considered to be perfect between the parties, and the property is of right <i>acquired</i> to the purchaser with regard to the seller, as soon as there exists an <i>agreement</i> for the object and for the price thereof, <i>although the object has not yet been delivered, nor the price paid.</i> (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p>Thus, it is clear to me that, by operation of law, the sale is complete and Texaco obtains a right in and to the <i>wet</i> CO2 prior to the conversion process, although it is incapable of measurement at that time. In my interpretation of the contract, the only purpose of the provisions thereof relied upon by the majority is for the purpose of allowing the substance to be <i>measured</i> and <i>delivered</i> to the Texaco plant. Furthermore, in my view, the fact that Monsanto retains \"some\" risk of loss at this point, does not change the nature of the contract at issue.</p>\n<p>This Court has already held that the <i>substance</i> of a contract, and not the <i>form,</i> is controlling for the determination of sales and/or use taxes. See <i>Louisiana Paving v. St. Charles,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1702500\"><a href=\"/opinion/1702500/louisiana-paving-co-inc-v-st-charles-parish-pub-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">604</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></a></span> (La.App. 5 Cir. 1992). A review of the document at issue entitled \"By-Product Sales Agreement\" reflects that it contains <i>several</i> contractual agreements among the parties, only one of them being for the sale of wet CO2.</p>\n<p>In addition, and very importantly, I note that our brethren in the First Circuit are in agreement with my interpretation of the issue before us now, although I am well aware that this Court is not bound by the decision of another circuit, especially an unpublished one. However, even though I do not rely on the opinion of the judges of the First Circuit, I do find persuasive their thinking in a case involving the identical issue with the identical contract and the state sales tax statute with <span class=\"star-pagination\">*263</span> virtually identical language as the tax ordinance before us here.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I conclude that the trial court erred in finding that the contract herein was for the sale of dry CO2 and that sales tax is due on the total amount expended by Texaco for the purchase of <i>wet</i> CO2, and not for the costs of converting that substance into dry CO2; or stated in another way, I conclude that Texaco should only pay sales tax on the value of the wet CO2 before it is converted into dry CO2.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, I respectfully dissent from the opinion.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The following is typical of format of the monthly invoices:\n</p>\n<p>\"For CO2 purchased and received during the month of October, 1983:</p>\n<p></p>\n<pre>\nCommodity Charge                     $ 25,000\nOperating Expense for month           109,629\nElectricity Expense (36,100 ckwh)    $169,915\n657,648 kcf @ 25¢/kcf            164,412\nSales Tax on CO2 Delivered                9,865\nSpare Parts                                 0\n                                      _______\n TOTAL                                478,821\"\n</pre>\n\n</div>",
