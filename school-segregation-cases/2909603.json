See Cal. R. Ct. 8.548. The resolution of any one\nof these questions could determine the outcome of this appeal\nand no controlling California precedent exists. See id. We are\naware of the California Supreme Court’s demanding caseload\nand recognize that our request adds to that load. But we feel\ncompelled to request certification because this case raises dif-\nficult questions of state constitutional law with potentially\nbroad implications for California citizens’ civil and religious\nliberties. Considerations of comity and federalism favor the\nresolution of such questions by the State’s highest court rather\nthan this court.\n\n                   I.   Questions Certified\n\n   The Desert Pacific Council, a nonprofit corporation char-\ntered by the Boy Scouts of America, leases land from the City\nof San Diego in Balboa Park and Mission Bay Park. The\nCouncil pays no rent for the Mission Bay property and one\ndollar per year in rent for the Balboa Park property. In return,\nthe Council operates Balboa Park’s campground and Mission\nBay Park’s Youth Aquatic Center. The campground and the\nAquatic Center are public facilities, but the Council maintains\nits headquarters on the campground, and its members exten-\nsively use both facilities. The Boy Scouts of America — and\nin turn the Council — prohibit atheists, agnostics, and homo-\nsexuals from being members or volunteers and require mem-\nbers to affirm a belief in God.\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA          6589\n   The plaintiffs are users of the two Parks who are, respec-\ntively, lesbians and agnostics. They would use the land or\nfacilities leased by the Desert Pacific Council but for the\nCouncil’s and Boy Scouts’ discriminatory policies.\n\n  We certify to the California Supreme Court the following\nquestions:\n\n   1. Do the leases interfere with the free exercise and\nenjoyment of religion by granting preference for a religious\norganization in violation of the No Preference Clause in arti-\ncle I, section 4 of the California Constitution?\n\n  2. Are the leases “aid” for purposes of the No Aid Clause\nof article XVI, section 5 of the California Constitution?\n\n  3. If the leases are aid, are they benefitting a “creed” or\n“sectarian purpose” in violation of the No Aid Clause?\n\n   The California Supreme Court is not bound by this court’s\npresentation of the questions. We will accept a reformulation\nof the questions and will accept the Supreme Court’s decision.\nTo aid the Supreme Court in deciding whether to accept the\ncertification, we provide the following statement of facts,\njurisdictional analysis, and explanation.\n\n                  II.   Statement of Facts\n\n  Because the district court granted summary judgment\nagainst it, we take the facts in the light most favorable to the\nnon-moving party, the Desert Pacific Council. See Olsen v.\nIdaho State Bd. of Med., 363 F.3d 916, 922 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n  A.   The Parties\n\n  The Desert Pacific Council (the “Council”) is a nonprofit\ncorporation chartered by The Boy Scouts of America to\nadminister Scouting programs in the San Diego area. Con-\n\f6590        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\ngress chartered the Boy Scouts of America “to promote . . .\nthe ability of boys to do things for themselves and others . . .\nand to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kin-\ndred virtues.” 36 U.S.C. § 30902 (2006). While Scouting\nfocuses primarily on outdoor activity, the Boy Scouts’ rules\ninclude a prohibition against allowing youths or adults who\nare atheists, agnostics, or homosexuals to be members or vol-\nunteers. Cf. Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 659-61\n(2000) (holding that the Boy Scouts have a constitutional\nright to exclude homosexuals). These rules bind the Council.\nThe Boy Scouts maintain that agnosticism, atheism, and\nhomosexuality are inconsistent with their goals and with the\nobligations of their members. See Randall v. Orange County\nCouncil, Boy Scouts of Am., 17 Cal. 4th 736, 742 (1998)\n(reciting that, in defending its right to exclude atheists, the\nBoy Scouts introduced “evidence intended to establish that\nrequiring the inclusion of nonbelievers . . . would interfere\nwith the organization’s efforts to convey its religious mes-\nsage”).\n\n   The Boy Scouts do not require scouts to affiliate with any\nreligious organization, and the Boy Scouts style themselves\n“absolutely nonsectarian.” [ER 309 (75:7-8), 1580, art. IX\n§ 1, cl. 1; see also, e.g., ER 1527; ER 54 ¶ 185, ER 2007 ¶ 185.]1\nThe San Diego Boy Scouts are “not a house of worship like\na church or synagogue.” [ER 54 ¶ 185; ER 2007 ¶ 185.] Still,\nthe organization has a religious element. All members and\nvolunteers take an oath to “do my best . . . [t]o do my duty\nto God and my country” and to remain “morally straight.”\n[ER 2005 ¶ 176.] The organization’s mission is “to prepare\nyoung people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by\ninstilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.” [ER\n  1\n   The bracketed citations of ER and SER refer, respectively, to the\nExcerpts of Record and the Supplemental Excerpts of Record filed by the\nparties in this court. The references are included in this Order for the con-\nvenience of the California Supreme Court, should it choose to request this\ncourt to furnish those Excerpts. See Cal. R. Ct. 8.548(c).\n\f           BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA               6591\n2003 ¶ 162.] Duty to God is placed first in the Oath as “the\nmost important of all Scouting values.” [ER 2004 ¶ 170.]\nMembers also must agree to uphold the “Scout Law,” which\nprovides that a Scout is “faithful in his religious duties.” [ER\n2005 ¶ 177.] Membership and leadership applications contain\na “Declaration of Religious Principle,” which explains that\n“no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without\nrecognizing an obligation to God.” [ER 1535.] The Boy\nScouts instruct leaders to “be positive in their religious influ-\nence and [to] encourage Scouts to earn the religious emblem\nof their faith.” [ER 1527.]\n\n   The plaintiffs Barnes-Wallaces are a lesbian couple and the\nplaintiffs Breens are agnostics. Because of their sexual and\nreligious orientations, they cannot be Boy Scout volunteers.\nBoth couples have sons old enough to join the Boy Scouts,\nand they would like their sons to use the leased facilities, but\nthe parents refuse to give the approval required for member-\nship. As part of the membership application, a parent must\npromise to assist his or her son “in observing the policies of\nthe Boy Scouts of America . . . [to] serve as his adult partner\nand participate in all meetings and approve his advancement.”\n[Id. 1533.] The application also includes the Scout Law and\nthe Declaration of Religious Principle. The Barnes-Wallaces\nand the Breens believe that the Boy Scouts’ policies are dis-\ncriminatory, and they refuse to condone such practices by\nallowing their children to join the Boy Scouts.\n\n  B.    The Leases\n\n   In accord with its long history of “encourag[ing] nonprofit\norganizations to develop cultural, educational, and recre-\national programs” on the City property, the plaintiffs’ home\ntown of San Diego has leased 123 public properties to various\nnonprofit organizations.2 [SER 10, 36.] One of these organiza-\n  2\n   These organizations include religious organizations (e.g., San Diego\nCalvary Korean Church, Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church,\n\f6592        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\ntions is the Desert Pacific Council, which leases, occupies,\nand operates portions of two popular city parks. Other por-\ntions of those parks are extensively used by the plaintiff fami-\nlies. Under the original lease, the Council paid one dollar per\nyear in rent. In 2002 the parties entered into a new twenty-\nfive-year lease, which requires the Desert Pacific Council to\npay one dollar in annual rent and a $2,500 annual administra-\ntion fee.\n\n   The City negotiated this lease with the Council on an exclu-\nsive basis, as it sometimes does with groups, religious or sec-\nular, that it deems to be appropriate operators of a particular\npiece of City property. [ER 843-44, 850 (132:8-23); SER 433-\n34, 592 (135:7-20), 1168, 1172-73, 1175, 1182-83, 1185-86,\n1189.] Other organizations receive similar terms. Some\nninety-six of the City’s leases to non-profits (including nine-\nteen leases to youth-oriented recreational non-profits) require\nno rent or rent less than the $2,500 fee the Council pays, and\nfifty of them have terms twenty-five years or longer. [SER\n12-15, 27-29.] Although they produce little to no revenue,\nthese leases save the City some money by placing the costs\nof maintenance and improvement upon the lessee organiza-\ntions. [SER 204-05.] The City spends nothing on the proper-\nties leased to the Council. [SER 3 ¶ 9, 5 ¶ 17.]\n\n  The Council leases from the City sixteen acres in Balboa\nPark known as Camp Balboa. Camp Balboa offers a “unique”\nurban camping opportunity in the “heart of the City.” [ER\n1966 ¶ 7.] The site includes campgrounds, a swimming pool,\nan amphitheater, a program lodge, a picnic area, a ham radio\nroom, restrooms and showers, and a camp ranger office. The\n\nJewish Community Center, Salvation Army), organizations concerned\nwith children or the elderly (e.g., Camp Fire, Girl Scouts, ElderHelp, Little\nLeague), organizations that limit their membership or services on the basis\nof race or ethnicity (e.g., Vietnamese Federation of San Diego, Black\nPolice Officers Association), and art museums and similar institutions\n(e.g., San Diego Art Institute, Old Globe Theater) [SER 11, 14, 27-29].\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA          6593\nlease requires the Council to maintain the property and to\nexpend at least $1.7 million for capital improvements over\nseven years. [ER 820.] The Boy Scouts have landscaped, con-\nstructed recreational facilities, and installed water and power\non the property. [SER 217 ¶ 17.]\n\n   Similarly, under the Fiesta Island lease, the Boy Scouts\nspent approximately $2.5 million to build the Youth Aquatic\nCenter [SER 215 ¶ 10, 1084 ¶ 19]. The facility offers the use\nof kayaks, canoes, sail and row boats, and classroom space to\nother youth groups at inexpensive rates. [SER 215-16 ¶¶ 10-\n11.]\n\n  C.   Occupancy of the Land\n\n   The Desert Pacific Council makes exclusive use of portions\nof Balboa Park for its own benefit. The Council has its head-\nquarters on park property. From this facility it oversees its\n$3.7 million budget, manages its thirty employees, and pro-\ncesses applications for membership and leadership positions.\nThe Council also has a print shop on park land that it uses to\nprint literature for its members. These portions of the park are\nunavailable for public use.\n\n   Other portions of Camp Balboa and the Youth Aquatic\nCenter are available for use by non-member groups, but the\nCouncil manages reservations of these recreational facilities.\nCampsites at Camp Balboa are available on a first-come, first-\nserved basis. [SER 295, 307, 617-18.] Thus, if the plaintiffs\nwere to use the land, they would have to do so subject to the\nCouncil’s oversight. The Council can declare the camp\n“closed,” determine how many people are going to attend the\ncamps, and then open up only the unreserved facilities to the\npublic. Nonetheless, numerous other groups have camped in\nthe campsites while camp was in session, and the San Diego\nBoy Scouts have not turned any non-Scout group away from\nCamp Balboa during that time. [SER 291 (171:3-6); see also\nSER 624 (156:16-157:16); 291 (170:13-15)]. The Camp\n\f6594      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\ncharges a small fee for camping, but the revenue from fees is\ninsufficient to cover the cost of maintaining the camp facili-\nties. [SER 218].\n\n   The Council also leases land from the City on Fiesta Island\nin Mission Bay Park. In 1987, the City entered into a twenty\nfive-year, rent-free lease with the Desert Pacific Council for\none-half acre of waterfront property on Fiesta Island. The City\nentered into this lease after the Desert Pacific Council\napproached it about building and operating an aquatic center\non the island. The Council was awarded the lease on the con-\ndition that it expend $1.5 million to build the Youth Aquatic\nCenter. At a price of about $2.5 million [SER 1084 ¶ 19], the\nCouncil built and now operates the Aquatic Center, which\noffers boating, sailing, canoeing, and kayaking to San Diego\nyouth.\n\n   As at Camp Balboa, reservations to use the Youth Aquatic\nCenter are made through the Council. The Aquatic Center has\na formal first-come, first-served policy, but the policy has\nexceptions for Scout members. The Desert Pacific Council is\npermitted to reserve up to 75% of the facilities seven days in\nadvance. The Council also hosts a members-only camp for\nfour weeks each summer. The reservation books during camp\nsay “YAC Closed for Summer Camp,” although the Boy\nScouts’ use of the Aquatic Center during those weeks is not\nexclusive. [SER 216-17, 317.] While the public cannot use the\nAquatic Center during summer camp for water-based activi-\nties, it can reserve dormitories or other facilities the Scouts\nare not using. In practice, non-members often use portions of\nthe facilities more than members do. [SER 216-18.] The San\nDiego Boy Scouts have not turned away any non-Scout group\nwhile Scouting is in session, either at Camp Balboa or at the\nAquatic Center. [SER 291 (170:13-15, 171:3-6), 315 (227:11-\n14).] The Center charges fees for use, but there is no evidence\nthat the fees equal or exceed the cost of maintaining the facili-\nties.\n\f             BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                  6595\n   There are no religious symbols either at Camp Balboa or at\nthe Youth Aquatic Center.\n\n  D.      The Plaintiffs’ Injury\n\n   The plaintiffs never applied to use the Youth Aquatic Cen-\nter or Camp Balboa; there is no evidence that the Council\nactively excluded them. [SER 235-36 (104:24-106:10), 244\n(91:25-93:23), 251-52 (33:2-35:10).] Rather, they testified\nthat the Council’s occupation and control of the land deterred\nthem from using the land at all. The plaintiffs desired to make\nuse of the recreational facilities at Camp Balboa and the\nYouth Aquatic Center, but not under the Council’s authority.\nAs a result, they actively avoided the land. They refused to\ncondone the Boy Scouts’ exclusionary policies by seeking\npermission from the Boy Scouts to use the leased facilities or\nby using the leased facilities subject to the Boy Scouts’ own-\nership and control. [ER 85, 370-71; SER 252 (35:12-15; 36:2-\n5).] They had an aversion to the facilities and felt unwelcome\nthere because of the Boy Scouts’ policies that discriminated\nagainst people like them. [ER 369; SER 254 (74:4-10)].\n\n   The plaintiff families brought this action against the City of\nSan Diego, the Boy Scouts, and the Desert Pacific Council,\nalleging that leasing public land to an organization that\nexcludes persons because of their religious and sexual orienta-\ntions violates the federal Establishment Clause, the California\nConstitution’s No Preference3 and No Aid4 Clauses, the fed-\n  3\n   This Clause provides, in relevant part:\n      Free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or\n      preference are guaranteed. This liberty of conscience does not\n      excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent with the peace or\n      safety of the State. The Legislature shall make no law respecting\n      an establishment of religion.\nCal. Const. art. I, sec. 4.\n  4\n    This Clause states:\n\f6596        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\neral and state Equal Protection Clauses, the San Diego Human\nDignity Ordinance, and state contract law. The district court\nfound the plaintiffs had standing as municipal taxpayers and\nthen allowed them to file an amended complaint. Both parties\nsought summary judgment. The court found that the leases\nviolated the federal Establishment Clause and the California\nNo Aid and No Preference Clauses and granted summary\njudgment in the plaintiffs’ favor. Barnes-Wallace v. Boy\nScouts of Am., 275 F. Supp. 2d 1259, 1276-80 (S.D. Cal.\n2003). In the amended final judgment, the court enjoined the\nBalboa Park and Fiesta Island leases. The City then notified\nthe Council that under the terms of the 2002 Balboa Park\nlease, the term tenancy was terminated and converted to a\nmonth-to-month tenancy. The plaintiffs have since settled\nwith the City. The Scout defendants appealed the district\ncourt’s ruling.\n\n                   III.   Jurisdictional Analysis\n\n   Before proceeding further, we must satisfy ourselves that\nwe have jurisdiction over this appeal. We have statutory juris-\ndiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, but the par-\nties have presented challenges to the existence of a case or\ncontroversy that is essential to our constitutional jurisdiction\nunder Article III. See Harrison W. Corp. v. United States, 792\nF.2d 1391, 1392 (9th Cir. 1986). We address these issues as\nthreshold matters.\n\n  A.    Mootness\n\n  The plaintiffs argue that the appeal is moot as to the Balboa\nPark lease because the City terminated the lease after the dis-\n\n    Neither the legislature, nor any county, city and county, town-\n    ship, school district, or other municipal corporation, shall ever\n    make an appropriation, or pay from any public fund whatever, or\n    grant anything to or in aid of any religious sect, church, creed, or\n    sectarian purpose . . . .\nCal. Const. art. XVI, sec. 5.\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA            6597\ntrict court’s final judgment. The appeal is not moot because\nthe Desert Pacific Council still has “a legally cognizable inter-\nest for which the courts can grant a remedy.” Alaska Ctr. for\nthe Env’t v. U.S. Forest Service, 189 F.3d 851, 854 (9th Cir.\n1999). The City did not terminate the Desert Pacific Council’s\ntenancy, but rather converted it to a month-to-month, hold-\nover tenancy. The Council still occupies Camp Balboa, and\nthe permissibility of its tenancy remains at issue in this\nappeal. Moreover, the City’s notice terminating the lease indi-\ncated that, if the district court’s judgment is reversed, the ter-\nmination notice will be of no effect. The controversy with\nregard to the Balboa Park lease is not moot.\n\n  B.   Standing\n\n   The Boy Scouts challenge the standing of plaintiffs to bring\nthis action. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555,\n560 (1992) (explaining that standing is a component of the\ncase-or-controversy requirement). Because the case was\ndecided on summary judgment in the district court, the plain-\ntiffs had the burden of showing by uncontroverted facts that\nthey had standing to challenge the leases. See id. at 561. We\nconclude that the plaintiffs have sustained that burden, but we\nbase standing on a different ground from that adopted by the\ndistrict court.\n\n   The Barnes-Wallaces and the Breens have standing to pur-\nsue their claims because uncontroverted evidence shows that\nthey suffered injury-in-fact traceable to the Scout defendants’\nconduct, and that a favorable decision is likely to redress their\ninjuries. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61. The Barnes-Wallaces\nand the Breens submitted declarations asserting, without con-\ntradiction by the Scout defendants, that they would like to use\nCamp Balboa and the Aquatic Center, but that they avoid\ndoing so because they are offended by the Boy Scouts’ exclu-\nsion, and publicly expressed disapproval, of lesbians, atheists\nand agnostics. The plaintiffs also object to the Boy Scouts’\ncontrol of access to the facilities, noting that their use of the\n\f6598      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nland would require “go[ing] through” the Boy Scouts and\npassing by symbols of its presence and dominion.\n\n   We have held that comparable restrictions on plaintiffs’ use\nof land constitute redressable injuries for the purposes of Arti-\ncle III standing. Our Establishment Clause cases have recog-\nnized an injury-in-fact when a religious display causes an\nindividual such distress that she can no longer enjoy the land\non which the display is situated. In Buono v. Norton, the\nplaintiff, a practicing Roman Catholic, was so offended by the\n“establishment” of a cross on public land that he avoided\npassing through or visiting the land. 371 F.3d 543, 546-47\n(9th Cir. 2004). We concluded that Buono’s “inability to\nunreservedly use public land” constituted an injury-in-fact,\nreasoning that Buono’s avoidance of the land was a personal\ninjury suffered “as a consequence of the alleged constitutional\nerror.” Id. at 547 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nEllis v. La Mesa, 990 F.2d 1518, 1523 (9th Cir. 1993) (finding\nstanding where plaintiffs avoided using land on which cross\nwas displayed).\n\n   Similarly, the Breens and Barnes-Wallaces have avoided\nCamp Balboa and the Aquatic Center because they object to\nthe Boy Scouts’ presence on, and control of, the land: They\ndo not want to view signs posted by the Boy Scouts or interact\nwith the Boy Scouts’ representatives in order to gain access\nto the facilities. As in Buono, they have alleged injuries\nbeyond “the psychological consequence presumably produced\nby observation of conduct with which [they] disagree[ ],”\nbecause their inhibition interferes with their personal use of\nthe land. Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Am. United for Sepa-\nration of Church & State, 454 U.S. 464, 485 (1982). Indeed,\nthe plaintiffs’ emotional injuries are stronger than those of the\nCatholic plaintiff in Buono, because they belong to the very\ngroups excluded and disapproved of by the Boy Scouts, and\nbecause they would be confronted with symbols of the Boy\nScouts’ belief system if they used or attempted to gain access\nto Balboa Park and the Aquatic Center.\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA           6599\n   We also have found standing, in environmental cases, when\nplaintiffs’ enjoyment of land would suffer because of treat-\nment of the land or events occurring on the land. See Alaska\nWildlife Alliance v. Jensen, 108 F.3d 1065, 1068 (9th Cir.\n1997) (plaintiffs “demonstrate aesthetic and recreational harm\nthat will support standing” when noise, trash, and wakes of\nvessels in national park diminished plaintiffs’ enjoyment of\nthe land); Ocean Advocates v. U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs,\n402 F.3d 846, 860 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that plaintiff orga-\nnization suffered injury from increased risk of oil spill that\nwould impair its aesthetic or recreational enjoyment of a\nstretch of Alaskan coastline). The plaintiffs’ enjoyment of the\nCouncil-operated facilities is similarly threatened by the Boy\nScouts’ presence and activities. The plaintiffs are faced with\nthe choice of not using Camp Balboa and the Aquatic Center,\nwhich they wish to use, or making their family excursions\nunder the dominion of an organization that openly rejects\ntheir beliefs and sexual orientation. This is not a case where\nthe plaintiffs have no plan to use the land in question. See\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (requiring “concrete plans” to visit\nplace of environmental harm for a finding of actual and immi-\nnent injury). The plaintiffs accordingly have alleged a con-\ncrete recreational loss.\n\n   We conclude that, even with the facts construed favorably\nto the Scout defendants, the plaintiffs have shown both per-\nsonal emotional harm and the loss of recreational enjoyment,\nresulting from the Boy Scouts’ use and control of Camp Bal-\nboa and the Aquatic Center. These injuries, which are likely\nto be redressed by a favorable decision, satisfy the standing\nrequirements of Article III of the Constitution.\n\n   The Scout defendants argue that, as in Valley Forge, the\nplaintiffs’ alleged injuries are based on abstract “feelings” and\n“beliefs” about the Boy Scouts, and therefore are inadequate\nto confer standing. We conclude that Valley Forge does not\ncontrol this case. The Valley Forge plaintiffs, who resided in\nMaryland and Virginia, learned through a news release of a\n\f6600        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\ntransfer of federal land in Pennsylvania to a sectarian college.\nThey attempted to challenge the transfer in federal court. Val-\nley Forge, 454 U.S. at 487. They did not purport to have an\ninterest in using the land at issue. See id. at 486 (“We simply\ncannot see that respondents have alleged an injury of any\nkind, economic or otherwise, sufficient to confer standing.”)\n(emphasis in original). In contrast, the Breens and Barnes-\nWallaces reside in San Diego, where Camp Balboa and the\nAquatic Park are located, and have expressed a desire to make\npersonal use of the facilities operated by the Council. They\ncan hardly be characterized as individuals who “roam the\ncountry in search of governmental wrongdoing.” Id. at 487;\nsee also Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 755-56 (1984).5 More-\nover, the plaintiffs here are lesbians and agnostics, members\nof the classes of individuals excluded and publicly disap-\nproved of by the Boy Scouts. They are not bystanders\nexpressing ideological disapproval of the government’s con-\nduct. The plaintiffs’ personal interest in the land at issue, and\nthe personal nature of their objection to the Scout defendants’\nuse of the land, take this case outside of the scope of Valley\nForge.6\n  5\n     In Allen, the Supreme Court held that a stigmatic injury caused by\nracial discrimination could support standing only if the plaintiffs person-\nally had been or were likely to be subject to the challenged discrimination.\nAllen, 468 U.S. at 755-56. The injury of which the Barnes-Wallaces and\nBreens complain is the offensiveness of having to deal with the Boy\nScouts in order to use park facilities that they wish to use, and would use,\nbut for the control of the Boy Scouts over those facilities. We conclude\nthat this injury is sufficiently immediate to these plaintiffs to permit stand-\ning under the rationale of Allen.\n   6\n     The dissent to this order points out that we originally rejected this the-\nory of standing on the ground that no obvious religious displays were pres-\nent at the Camp or Aquatic Center. The majority of the panel concludes,\nhowever, that the earlier reasoning was incorrect. Psychological injury can\nbe caused by symbols or activities other than large crosses. See Heckler\nv. Mathews, 465 U.S. 728, 739-40 (1984) (holding that stigma of discrimi-\nnation confers standing even though remedy may confer no material bene-\nfit). Here, the psychological injury is generated primarily not by plaintiffs’\nown beliefs but by the Boy Scouts’ disapproval of the plaintiffs and people\n\f            BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                   6601\n  C.    The Plaintiffs’ Alternative Theories of Standing\n\n   We reject the plaintiffs’ other theories of standing: the the-\nory that they have standing as taxpayers and the theory that\nthey suffered injury from the Council’s policy of preferential\naccess to the leased property. We disagree with the district\ncourt and conclude that the plaintiffs do not have standing as\nmunicipal taxpayers because they have not suffered a “direct\ndollars-and-cents injury.” Doremus v. Bd. of Educ. of Haw-\nthorne, 342 U.S. 429, 434 (1952). The plaintiffs characterize\nthe nominal-rent leases as tax expenditures, but the Supreme\nCourt recently made clear that a government’s forgoing of\nrevenue is not the equivalent of an expenditure. Daimler-\nChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, 126 S. Ct. 1854, 1862 (2006).7 The\nCourt rested its holding in part on the fact that the plaintiff\ntaxpayers’ injury was not “actual or imminent” because the\ntax break—designed to stimulate the economy—would not\nnecessarily lower government revenues. Id. at 1862. Simi-\nlarly, this court has held that municipal taxpayers must show\nan expenditure of public funds to have standing. Doe v. Madi-\nson Sch. Dist. No. 321, 177 F.3d 789, 793-97 (9th Cir. 1999);\nCammack v. Waihee, 932 F.2d 765, 770 (9th Cir. 1991). The\nplaintiffs’ injury is not actual or imminent because it is\nunclear whether San Diego loses money by charging nominal\nrent but requiring lessees to maintain and improve the leased\nproperty.\n\n   The leases are more reasonably characterized as a potential\nloss of municipal revenues, but even this loss is not definite\n\nlike them. As Buono points out, the problem with standing in Valley Forge\nwas not the nature of the psychological injury but “the absence of any per-\nsonal injury at all.” Buono, 371 F.3d at 547. A psychological injury that\nis generated by demeaning actions directed at the plaintiffs and that causes\nthe plaintiff to avoid a public area that he wishes to use is sufficient to\novercome that problem and confer standing. See id.\n   7\n     The district court did not have the benefit of DaimlerChrysler at the\ntime it ruled that the plaintiffs had taxpayer standing.\n\f6602      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nenough to create municipal taxpayer standing. There is no evi-\ndence that, if the leases were invalidated, the City would use\nthe land to generate revenue. See DaimlerChrysler, 126 S. Ct.\nat 1862 (finding the plaintiff taxpayers’ alleged injury too\nconjectural because it depended on legislators’ responses to\nthe tax breaks in question). For example, the City’s Director\nof Real Estate testified that “[t]he City would likely seek\nanother lessee to operate a recreational facility . . . under simi-\nlar terms and conditions in the existing [Youth Aquatic Cen-\nter] lease . . . [because the] City Council has never had a\npolicy of using the [Youth Aquatic Center] property in a man-\nner that maximizes the revenue that potentially could be gen-\nerated by this site.” [SER 4 ¶ 12.] More generally, the\nDirector stated that “the City has not historically sought to\nobtain market rent from nonprofit lessees of dedicated park-\nland.” Without a definite expenditure of municipal funds,\nplaintiffs do not have standing as municipal taxpayers. Daim-\nlerChrysler, 126 S. Ct. at 1862; Cammack, 932 F.2d at 770-\n71.\n\n   Nor can the plaintiffs claim standing on the basis of the\nCouncil’s policy of granting preferential access to the Boy\nScouts. Even if the Council excludes other groups in favor of\nBoy Scouts—a disputed fact here—the plaintiffs cannot show\ninjury from this policy. The plaintiffs have insisted that they\nwould not use the facilities while the Boy Scouts are lessees.\nThe plaintiffs never contacted the Boy Scouts about using the\nfacilities, and they admitted they knew little or nothing about\nthe Boy Scouts’ policies regarding access to the facilities.\nWithout any plans to apply for access, the plaintiffs cannot\nshow actual and imminent injury from a discriminatory policy\nof denying access. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564.\n\n   Moreover, the injury that we have concluded the plaintiffs\ndid suffer cannot be redressed by correcting this access pol-\nicy. As long as the Council as an organization maintains poli-\ncies that exclude from participation and demean people in the\nplaintiffs’ position, no amount of evenhanded access to the\n\f            BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                   6603\nleased facilities will redress the plaintiffs’ injury: emotional\nand recreational harm arising out of the Council’s control and\nadministration of public land that the plaintiffs wish to use. It\nis this injury, and not the alleged Boy Scouts’ policy of pref-\nerential access to the facilities it operates, that supports plain-\ntiffs’ standing to maintain their claims under the federal and\nstate religion clauses.8\n\n               IV.     Explanation of Certification\n\n  A. The Need to Avoid Federal Constitutional\n  Questions\n\n   “[F]ederal courts should not decide federal constitutional\nissues when alternative grounds yielding the same relief are\navailable.” See Kuba v. 1-A Agric. Assoc., 387 F.3d 850, 856\n(9th Cir. 2004). If the California Constitution provides an\nindependent basis for relief, then there is “no need for deci-\nsion of the federal issue.” City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Cas-\ntle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 295 (1982). Yet any interpretation by\nthis court of the State’s constitutional clauses, unlike an inter-\npretation by the California Supreme Court, cannot be authori-\ntative. See Bartoni-Corsi Produce, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A. (In re Bartoni-Corsi Produce, Inc.), 130 F.3d 857, 861\n(9th Cir. 1997).\n\n  B.    The Need for Certification\n\n   We certify three issues to the California Supreme Court\nbecause they require interpretation of the state constitution’s\nreligion clauses beyond that found in state or federal cases.\n  8\n   The dissent asserts that “[t]he Boy Scouts are entitled to gather\ntogether freely and reinforce the views they share.” The complaint, how-\never, does not challenge the right of the Boy Scouts to associate and share\nviews; it challenges only their entitlement to manage a portion of the\nCity’s parks. Our discussion here relates only to whether the plaintiffs can\nbring this challenge, not to whether their claim ultimately will be found\nmeritorious.\n\f6604      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nThese clauses affect the delicate relationship between the gov-\nernment and religion, and any interpretation of these clauses\nhas significant public policy ramifications.\n\n    1.   The No Preference Clause\n\n   The No Preference Clause states in part that “[f]ree exer-\ncise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or pref-\nerence are guaranteed.” Cal. Const. art. 1 § 4. The California\nSupreme Court “has never had occasion to definitively con-\nstrue” this clause. E. Bay Asian Local Dev. Corp. v. Califor-\nnia, 24 Cal. 4th 693, 719 (2000). Having not yet been faced\nwith a case that requires it “to declare the scope and proper\ninterpretation” of the clause, it has found no necessity to set\nthe boundaries of the clause. See Catholic Charities of Sacra-\nmento, Inc. v. Superior Court, 32 Cal. 4th 527, 562 (2004).\nWe therefore cannot accurately estimate from existing Cali-\nfornia Supreme Court cases how that Court would apply the\nNo Preference Clause to the case before us. It is true that, in\na case involving exemptions from a landmark preservation\nlaw for religious institutions, the California Supreme Court\nheld that, because the challenged action passed the federal\nEstablishment Clause test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403\nU.S. 602 (1971), it also complied with California’s No Prefer-\nence Clause. E. Bay Asian Local Dev. Corp., 24 Cal. 4th at\n719; see also Paulson v. Abdelnour, 145 Cal. App. 4th 400,\n434 (2006). It is not at all clear, however, whether the Boy\nScouts’ management of the park facilities complies with the\nLemon test, and we follow the rule of not deciding federal\nconstitutional questions when state law may be determinative.\nWe know of no authority compelling the California courts to\naddress the Lemon test in every challenge brought under the\nNo Preference Clause. Any independent determination of a\nNo Preference Clause issue by the California Supreme Court\nwould be conclusive on this court and this litigation.\n\n   Although state intermediate appellate courts have construed\nthe No Preference Clause, the unique facts of this case would\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA             6605\nrequire us to go beyond these decisions. See, e.g., Woodland\nHills Homeowners Org. v. Los Angeles Cmty. Coll. Dist., 218\nCal. App. 3d 79, 93-95 (1990); Okrand v. City of Los Angeles,\n207 Cal. App. 3d 566, 571-72 (1989); Bennett v. Livermore\nUnified Sch. Dist., 193 Cal. App. 3d 1012, 1016, 1024 (1987);\nFeminist Women’s Health Ctr., Inc. v. Philibosian, 157 Cal.\nApp. 3d 1076, 1092 (1984). For example, the plaintiff fami-\nlies challenge the process by which the leases were obtained,\nbut no California court has identified the perspective from\nwhich we should scrutinize these processes to determine\nwhether there has been a forbidden preference. The United\nStates Supreme Court adopts the perspective of a reasonable\nobserver when determining Establishment Clause questions,\nsee County of Allegheny v. ACLU, Greater Pittsburgh Chap-\nter, 492 U.S. 573, 635 (1989) (O’Connor, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in the judgment), but at least one Justice\nof the California Supreme Court has urged that courts inter-\npreting the No Preference Clause “view the issue from the\nperspective of the minority.” Sands v. Morongo Unified Sch.\nDist., 53 Cal. 3d 863, 915-16 (Cal. 1991) (Arabian, J., concur-\nring). Thus, we seek certification so that the California\nSupreme Court, rather than this federal court, can chart the\nproper course through these unresolved areas.\n\n    2.   The No Aid Clause\n\n  The absence of controlling precedent in regard to the No\nAid Clause presents us with an even greater problem, in part\nbecause that clause is without a parallel in the United States\nConstitution. The No Aid Clause prohibits the City from\n“mak[ing] an appropriation, or pay[ing] from any public fund\nwhatever, or grant[ing] anything to or in aid of any religious\nsect, church, creed, or sectarian purpose . . . .” Cal. Const. art.\nXVI § 5. To assess whether the leases violate the No Aid\nClause, we must determine whether the leases are aid and, if\nso, whether the City supports a creed or sectarian purpose by\ngranting the aid to the Boy Scouts. The California Supreme\nCourt has not been called upon to define “aid” in a manner\n\f6606      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nthat applies to the circumstances of this case. Nor has it been\nrequired to establish what is a “creed” or “sectarian purpose”\nto which aid cannot be given.\n\n   In its most recent decision construing the No Aid Clause,\nCalifornia Statewide Communities Development Auth. v. All\nPersons Interested in Validity of a Purchase Agreement, 152\nP.3d 1070 (Cal. 2007), the California Supreme Court held that\nthe clause did not invalidate a public bond program that facili-\ntated the raising of private money to benefit sectarian institu-\ntions. Id. at 1081. It had long been established that such aid\ncould be given to religiously affiliated colleges so long as the\nfunds were not used for religious purposes. The question for\ndecision in Statewide Communities was whether the same rule\napplied to institutions that were “pervasively sectarian.” Id. at\n1072. No definition of “pervasively sectarian” was required,\nbecause the parties assumed for purposes of the case that the\ninstitutions in question were pervasively sectarian. Id. For the\nsame reason, it was unnecessary to define precisely a “creed”\nor “sectarian purpose.” The bond arrangement was held not to\nviolate the No Aid Clause so long as the institutions did not\nuse the bond proceeds for sectarian purposes and met certain\nother requirements, including the offering of a sufficiently\nbroad curriculum of secular subjects. Id. at 1077, 1081. The\nStatewide Communities decision does not assist us, however,\nin determining whether the City’s leases to the Boy Scouts\nviolate the No Aid Clause, because the California Supreme\nCourt emphasized that no public funds or real estate passed to\nthe sectarian institutions. Id. at 1076. Statewide Communities\ntherefore does not affect the need for certification in this case.\n\n   The facts of this case also require us to go beyond the\nframework set forth in our own decision of Paulson v. City of\nSan Diego, 294 F.3d 1124 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc), for inter-\npreting the No Aid Clause. Paulson concerned a No Aid\nClause challenge to a municipal government’s sale of public\nland containing a cross to a sectarian organization. Paulson\nconcluded that the No Aid Clause “prohibits the government\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA          6607\nfrom (1) granting a benefit in any form (2) to any sectarian\npurpose (3) regardless of the government’s secular purpose\n(4) unless the benefit is properly characterized as indirect,\nremote, or incidental.” Id. at 1131. Whether the City granted\na benefit to the Scout defendants for the advancement of a\ncreed or sectarian purpose is a very different and more chal-\nlenging question than that presented in Paulson. Resolution of\nthis issue would require expanding our interpretation of Cali-\nfornia cases. An expansion or contraction of the definitions of\n“aid,” “creed,” or “sectarian purpose” could have a substantial\nimpact upon Californians’ liberties and the administration of\ntheir public lands. We are reluctant to embark on a refinement\nof the meaning of those terms without the authoritative assis-\ntance of the California Supreme Court. We thus ask that Court\nto exercise its discretion and decide whether the leases are aid\nand whether this aid benefits a creed or sectarian purpose.\n\n              V.

When she\nand other African-American citizens decided to boycott the\ncity’s bus lines, they did so because they would rather avoid\nthese public facilities than be forced to interact with an insti-\ntution that denigrated them and excluded them from full citi-\nzenship — while at the same time “tolerating” their presence\nin the back of the bus.\n\n    Yet, when some of those citizens then sued the city of\nMontgomery, there was no argument then made that they\nlacked standing because the only injuries they asserted were\nmerely the “psychological consequence [of] . . . observation\nof conduct with which one disagrees.” Valley Forge Christian\nColl. v. Ams. United for Separation of Church & State, 454\nU.S. 464, 485 (1982); compare Browder v. Gayle, 142 F.\nSupp. 707, 711 (M.D. Ala. 1956) (“[P]laintiffs, along with\nmost other Negro citizens of the City of Montgomery, have\n. . . refrained from making use of the transportation facilities\nprovided by Montgomery City Lines, Inc.”), aff’d, 352 U.S.\n903 (1956).\n\f6610        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n   Any comparison to the Jim Crow South may seem greatly\noverblown, and in most respects it certainly is. The Boy\nScouts do not express disdain for homosexuals and atheists\nanywhere near as graphically or concretely as the Jim Crow\nSouth did blacks, and the Boy Scouts are only one group, not\nan entire society and governmental structure. And, on the\nmerits, the issues here are entirely different from, and quite\nobviously nowhere near of the same magnitude of impact or\nhistoric significance as, those in the seminal desegregation\ncases.\n\n   But at this point — although the dissent carefully avoids so\nrecognizing in excoriating my comparison — we are con-\ncerned only with standing: whether the Barnes-Wallace and\nBreen families have suffered an injury allowing them to be\nheard in court. And in its nature, though certainly not its\ndegree, the injury that the Barnes-Wallace and Breen families\nclaim is much the same as that suffered by the plaintiffs in the\nbus desegregation cases. Just as African-Americans could ride\non Montgomery’s buses, but not in the front, the Scouts per-\nmit Plaintiffs to make use of Camp Balboa and the Mission\nBay Park Youth Aquatic Center, but do not allow them to be\nmembers of their organization and participate in the activities\nconducted at the camps for members. In either case, use of a\nvaluable public facility is made contingent on acceptance of\nimposed second class status within a controlling organiza-\ntion’s social hierarchy.\n\n  Judge Kleinfeld disagrees, viewing the injury Plaintiffs\nassert here as simply their “revulsion for [the] Boy Scouts”\nand “feelings of disagreement” with its beliefs. This assertion\nbetrays a rather skewed view of which direction the revulsion\nactually flows in this case, and to what effect.1 One only need\n  1\n   The dissent criticizes plaintiffs for bringing this case “under the guise\nthat their own feelings and disagreements make them feel excluded.” The\nsociological term for the tendency to attribute fault for injuries experi-\nenced by members of a subordinated group to the group itself is “blaming\n\f           BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                 6611\nlook at the Boy Scout Oath and Law — the dissent’s skepti-\ncism concerning the derogatory messages conveyed by parts\nof those liturgies notwithstanding — to see that requiring\nplaintiffs to deal with the Scouts in order to use Camp Balboa\nand the Mission Bay Park Youth Aquatic Center results in an\ninjury which, in fact, is very real.\n\n   The offense Plaintiffs suffer comes from having to interact\nwith a group that excludes them, on the basis of personal char-\nacteristics which that group denigrates and to which it\nascribes moral opprobrium. The Boy Scouts Oath and Law\ncontain many uplifting sentiments that contain no implicit\ncriticisms and are in no way exclusionary. But the Boy Scouts\nalso require their members to promise to be “morally straight”\n— and so exclude gays and lesbians, like the Barnes-\nWallaces, from participation in the organization because the\nScouts believe that homosexuality is incompatible with moral\nstraightness and cleanliness. See Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale,\n530 U.S. 640, 652 (2000) (quoting Scouts’ position that “ho-\nmosexual conduct is inconsistent with the requirement in the\nScout Oath that a Scout be morally straight and in the Scout\nLaw that a Scout be clean in word and deed”). The Scouts\nalso exclude atheists and agnostics, like the Breens, on the\nground that “no member can develop into the best kind of citi-\nzen without recognizing an obligation to God.” Randall v.\nOrange County Council, Boy Scouts of Am., 17 Cal. 4th 736,\n742 (1998) (citing the Scouts’ expectation that their leaders\nwill convey this position to their members).\n\n  So let us be clear about the source of the “disagreement”\nhere: The Scouts exclude people like the Breens and Barnes-\n\nthe victim.” See, e.g., William Ryan, Blaming the Victim (Vintage, 1976);\ncf. Hernandez v. Ashcroft, 345 F.3d 824, 836 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting that\n“lay understandings of [the causes of] domestic violence” are “frequently\ncomprised of myths, misconceptions, and victim blaming attitudes” (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted)).\n\f6612       BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nWallaces, because the Scouts believe them to possess charac-\nteristics that make them morally unclean and incapable of\nbeing the “best kind of citizen.” In other words, the reason the\nScouts exclude the Breens and Barnes-Wallaces is not simply\nthat they do not have the same beliefs or practice the same life\nstyles; the reason is that, to the Scouts, the Breens and\nBarnes-Wallaces hold beliefs and practice life styles that are\nreprehensible and subject to deeply held, adverse moral judg-\nments. To not take serious offense from such characteriza-\ntions would require a better sense of humor than most of us\npossess.2\n\n   More importantly, there is not merely offense here but\ninjury too. To use Camp Balboa and the Mission Bay Park\nYouth Aquatic Center, the Plaintiffs must not just observe the\npresence of the Boy Scouts, but also interact with, seek per-\nmission from, and, quite significantly, pay fees to, this same\norganization that believes them inferior in both morals and\ncitizenship. Plaintiffs allege that in order to avoid such a situ-\nation, they and their children forgo use of the site, thereby\ngiving up a basic interest that citizens possess in public land\n— the right to simply enter and enjoy its recreational environ-\nment. See, e.g., Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Lujan, 962 F.2d\n1391, 1396 (9th Cir. 1992). Our case law is quite clear, of\ncourse, that avoidance of public land that one would other-\nwise visit and use is an injury that gives rise to standing.\nBuono v. Norton, 371 F.3d 543, 546-47 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n  The absence of giant crosses or massive Boy Scout\nemblems in this case, of which the dissent makes much, is\nsimply a 51-foot tall red herring. To return to my historical\nanalogy, suppose that, during the civil rights movement era,\na municipality permitted a local White Citizens Council,\n  2\n   “I don’t care to belong to any club that will have me as a member.”\nArthur Sheekman, The Groucho Letters (1967) (quoting Groucho Marx);\nsee also Allen v. National Video, Inc., 610 F. Supp. 612, 617 (S.D.N.Y.\n1985) (paraphrasing same).\n\f            BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                   6613\nwhich opposed desegregation and extension of voting rights\nto blacks, to operate on public land a recreation center, which\nAfrican-American families could, for a fee paid to the Coun-\ncil, get permission from the Council to use. Would those fam-\nilies lack an injury-in-fact if they avoided using those\nfacilities in order to avoid this direct interaction with an orga-\nnization whose policy, otherwise, is to exclude and demean\nthem? And would the answer differ depending on whether or\nnot the Council erected a billboard on the property endorsing\n“Segregation Forever”?3\n\n   The obviousness of the answer to this question is reflected\nin the long series of First Amendment cases illustrating that,\nwhen plaintiffs are required to choose between either paying\na fee to an organization with which they disagree or forgoing\nan interest to which they are entitled, the existence of an\ninjury-in-fact is simply taken as a given. See, e.g., Keller v.\nState Bar of Cal., 496 U.S. 1 (1990) (plaintiff required as a\ncondition of law practice to pay dues to state bar with whose\npolitical activities it disagreed); Abood v. Detroit Bd. of\nEduc., 431 U.S. 209 (1977) (plaintiff required as a condition\nof employment to pay dues to union with which it disagreed).\nAs here, the decisive element in those cases was the direct\ninjury to the plaintiff’s interests generated in part by the\nrequirement of interaction with a group with which one did\n  3\n    As this example suggests, Judge Kleinfeld’s complaint that it is inap-\npropriate to compare Boy Scout emblems to symbols of white supremacy\nmisses my point entirely: The absence or presence on public land of sym-\nbols of exclusion, whether racial, religious or otherwise, is not the focus\nof the standing issue in this case. Plaintiffs’ injury here comes from the\nrequirement of having to directly interact with, and pay fees to the Boy\nScouts — the actual excluders, themselves — in order to use this land.\nAnd the dissent’s representation to the contrary notwithstanding, Plain-\ntiffs’ avoidance of this land is not a reaction to what they “imagine the\nBoy Scouts feel about them.” Instead, it is a response to the Scouts’ actual\npolicy of excluding gays and atheists, which is a matter of legal record,\nnot bare speculation. See, e.g., Dale, 530 U.S. at 652; Randall, 17 Cal. 4th\nat 742 (1998).\n\f6614      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nnot want to associate, not the mere fact of a disagreement with\nthe defendant organization. True, these cases and others like\nthem ultimately concluded that there are circumstances in\nwhich mandatory association is permitted and devised limited\nremedies for those circumstances in which it is not. See, e.g.,\nAbood, 431 U.S. at 237-40. But for present purposes, the\nsalient point is that the legal system recognized the complaint\nof the plaintiffs in those cases — that they should not have to\nassociate with and pay fees to an organization with which\nthey disagreed to have access to commonly available benefits\n— as one which the plaintiffs were entitled to raise in court,\nand to which they were entitled a judicial answer.\n\n   For all these reasons, the dissent’s suggestion that our\ngranting standing in this case means that anyone who dis-\nagrees with the beliefs of any other group to which the City\nof San Diego leases property could bring similar litigation is\nentirely overblown. To succeed on the standing theory the\nmajority adopts, such would-be plaintiffs would have to show\n(1) that on the property leased to that group by the city there\nis some site or facility which the individual plaintiffs could\nhave and would have visited and used, were it not for (2) that\ngroup having an exclusionary policy that directly and person-\nally affects the plaintiffs, and (3) that use of the property\nwould require interaction with the group, such as paying fees\nfor use of the facility, and perception of its symbols. Cf. Allen\nv. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 756-57 & n.22 (1984). Moreover,\neven if standing were so established, to prevail in their suit the\nplaintiffs would still have to prove that the defendant group’s\nadherence to this policy means that the city’s leasing it the\nproperty violates the state or federal constitution.\n\n    I am entirely unconvinced that allowing such cases to be\nlitigated in court will, as the dissent suggests, “undermine free\nspeech and freedom of association.” Instead, providing the\nplaintiffs with their day in court will ensure that when govern-\nment turns the public’s property over to private groups, it\ndoes so in accordance with relevant constitutional require-\n\f           BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                 6615\nments. We certify the merits issues raised in this case to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court because the question of what the\nCalifornia Constitution requires in this case is one best\nanswered by the state’s Supreme Court. What I do not doubt,\nhowever, is that Plaintiffs here have demonstrated sufficient\nstanding to raise it.\n\n  Accordingly, I concur in the majority order.\n\n\n\nKLEINFELD, Circuit Judge:\n\n  I respectfully dissent.\n\n   We issued a previous order in this case.1 I dissented, on the\nground that the plaintiffs lacked standing.2 The Boy Scouts\npetitioned for rehearing, and the majority now issues an order\nwith a quite different standing analysis. Without standing,\nthere is no federal jurisdiction, and no authority to certify.\n\n   Surprisingly, the majority now bases standing on a theory\nthe majority expressly rejected the last time around. The new\ntheory is that the plaintiffs would like to use the parks but\n“avoid doing so because they are offended by the Boy Scouts’\nexclusion, and publicly expressed disapproval, of lesbians,\natheists and agnostics.”3 The theory is that the plaintiffs suffer\n“emotional harm and the loss of recreational enjoyment”4\nbecause they “do not want to view signs posted by the Boy\nScouts or interact with the Boy Scouts’ representatives in\norder to gain access to the facilities.”5\n  1\n    Barnes-Wallace v.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n   Perhaps I need say no more than that the majority expressly\nrejected this very theory the last time around, and rightly so.\nHere is what the majority said last time about the theory it\nadopts this time:\n\n      We reject the families’ other theories of standing.\n      The Breens’ and the Barnes-Wallaces’ purposeful\n      avoidance of the parklands leased by the Boy Scouts\n      as a protest against the Scouts’ exclusionary policies\n      is not a sufficient injury. We have held that people\n      can suffer a direct injury from the need to avoid\n      large religious displays, such as giant crosses or life-\n      size biblical scenes. See, e.g., Buono, 371 F.3d at\n      549 (five to eight-foot-tall cross); SCSC, 93 F.3d at\n      619 (fifty-one-foot-tall cross); Ellis, 990 F.2d at\n      1520 (thirty-six-foot and forty-three-foot-tall\n      crosses); Kreisner v. City of San Diego, 1 F.3d 775,\n      777 (9th Cir.1993) (ten by fourteen-foot displays\n      containing life-size statuary of biblical scenes). But\n      there are no displays in either Camp Balboa or the\n      Aquatic Center that would be so overwhelmingly\n      offensive that families who do not share the Scouts’\n      religious views must avoid them. See Valley Forge\n      Christian Coll. v. Americans United for Separation\n      of Church & State, Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 485, 102\n      S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (requiring the\n      plaintiffs to show a personal injury suffered “as a\n      consequence of the alleged constitutional error”)\n      (emphasis omitted).6\n\nThat was correct and that should be the end of the case. To\nassist the reader, I will speak a little more extensively than the\nmajority did last time on why the psychological theory is mis-\ntaken, and the cases distinguished last time were correctly dis-\ntinguished.\n  6\n   Barnes-Wallace, 471 F.3d at 1045-46.\n\f           BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                6617\n   The overarching authority for this standing issue is the\nSupreme Court decision in Valley Forge Christian College v.\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State, Inc.7\nThe Court granted certiorari in that case to reject “the unusu-\nally broad and novel view of standing” that the lower court\nhad applied in Establishment Clause cases.8 In Valley Forge,\nadvocacy groups challenged a government decision to give\nexcess government real estate for free to the Assemblies of\nGod to operate a Christian college. The Court expressly\nrejected the psychological injury theory argued in that case\nand ours. The Court held that “psychological” injury caused\nby “observation” of “conduct with which one disagrees” is\n“not an injury sufficient to confer standing under Art. III,”9\n\n     They fail to identify any personal injury suffered by\n     them as a consequence of the alleged constitutional\n     error, other than the psychological consequence pre-\n     sumably produced by observation of conduct with\n     which one disagrees. That is not an injury sufficient\n     to confer standing under Art. III, even though the\n     disagreement is phrased in constitutional terms.10\n\nIt is not enough, under controlling authority, that plaintiffs\nhave an interest in the conduct they challenge. For them to\nhave standing, they need a “legally protected interest.”11\nUnder Valley Forge, “psychological consequence,”12 even\nwhen strongly felt, is not what Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife\ncalls a “legally protected interest”13 and “standing is not mea-\n  7\n    Valley Forge Christian College v.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nsured by the intensity of the litigant’s interest or the fervor of\nhis advocacy.”14\n\n   The majority now distinguishes Valley Forge on the theory\nthat the plaintiffs in that case did not want to use the land and\nthe plaintiffs in this case do.15 The ratio decidendi of Valley\nForge does not support this distinction. Valley Forge holds\nthat “psychological” injury caused by “observation” of “con-\nduct with which one disagrees” is not a concrete injury to a\nlegally protected interest sufficient to confer standing, and\nthat is what the plaintiffs allege. Thus being there and seeing\nthe offending conduct does not confer standing.\n\n   In Valley Forge, the Court saw no significance to the fact\nthat one of the advocacy groups objecting to this giveaway of\nfederal land near Philadelphia had members who lived in Penn-\nsylvania.16 But suppose that the distinction would make a dif-\nference, as when environmental advocacy groups have\nstanding or not depending on whether they have members\nwho use the land affected by the proposed federal action.17\nThere still needs to be a concrete injury to a legally protected\ninterest, and in our case there is nothing but avoidance of a\nplace because of people there who hold different views.\n\n  The authorities the majority relies on today (having distin-\nguished them last time) are our gigantic cross cases, primarily\nBuono v. Norton18 and Ellis v. City of La Mesa.19 Buono\napplied Separation of Church & State Committee v.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                6619\ncross on the crest of a hill in a city park violated the Establish-\nment Clause.21 In Buono the cross in Mojave National Pre-\nserve was five to eight feet tall on a prominent rock\noutcropping rising 15 to 20 feet above grade. It appeared\n“likely that the Sunrise Rock cross will project a message of\ngovernment endorsement to a reasonable observer” of a par-\nticular religious belief.22 The plaintiff had standing because he\nregularly visited the preserve and took an inconvenient road\nto avoid viewing the prominent cross on government property.23\n\n   Buono holds that the “inhibition” from using public land\n“as a consequence of the alleged constitutional error” created\nby the cross goes beyond a mere psychological injury. This\nholding has boundaries, among them the facts of Buono and\nthe holding in Valley Forge. Buono distinguishes “the psycho-\nlogical consequence presumably produced by observation of\nconduct with which it disagrees,” and a psychological conse-\nquence is all plaintiffs establish in this case.24\n\n   In Ellis, there were three crosses, one 36 feet high on top\nof a mountain, one 43 feet high in a city park, and a picture\nof the mountaintop cross on the city insignia.25 The plaintiffs\navoided the locations, missed the spectacular view from the\nmountaintop, and one claimed that he declined to invite busi-\nness clients to the city because the cross offended them. We\nheld that the plaintiffs who would have visited the public\nareas but for the crosses had standing because their access to\npublic property was interfered with by the crosses. The major-\nity applies the same theory here. Applying these cases,\nthough, to a case where there is no gigantic cross, is an unjus-\ntified extension of their holdings.\n  21\n     Id. at 618.\n  22\n     Buono, 371 F.3d at 549.\n  23\n     Id. at 547.\n  24\n     Buono, 371 F.3d at 547 (quoting Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 485).\n  25\n     Ellis, 990 F.2d at 1520.\n\f6620       BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n   The majority was correct the last time, when it distin-\nguished the gigantic cross cases. Previously, it held that “[t]he\nBreens’ and the Barnes-Wallaces’ purposeful avoidance of\nthe parklands leased by the Boy Scouts as a protest against the\nScouts’ exclusionary policies is not a sufficient injury . . .\n[because] there are no displays in either Camp Balboa or the\nAquatic Center that would be so overwhelmingly offensive\nthat families who do not share the Scouts’ religious views\nmust avoid them.” I agree.\n\n   In our gigantic cross cases, the government maintained\nwhat amounted to a shrine for a particular religion on public\nland. Since time immemorial, shrines have been erected on\nhills and mountaintops.26 A huge cross on a hill or mountain-\ntop would appear to a reasonable objective observer to be a\nshrine. People not sharing the religious views represented by\nthe cross become visitors to another religion’s shrine. On pub-\nlic lands, we are all owners, none of us are mere guests. Even\nif the Boy Scout emblem were 51 feet tall, illuminated by\nneon, and at the crest of a hill (none of which is true), no rea-\nsonable observer would think that the Boy Scout emblem cre-\nated a shrine to a major religion or sexual preference. A\ngigantic cross on a mountaintop carries religious significance\nthat a herd of 11 year old boys camping out and swimming\ndoes not.\n\n   Unlike a cross, neither a Boy Scout, nor the Boy Scout\nemblem (an eagle with a shield on a fleur-de-lis), nor a sign\nsaying “Boy Scouts,” is the central symbol of any religion or\nsexual preference. One would have no idea that the Boy\nScouts even had any views about religion or sex without\ndoing research. And even if one did, one would, as the peti-\ntion for rehearing demonstrates, learn that sex and religion are\nbut an incidental part of scouting. If one reads the Boy Scout\nHandbook to find out whether the Boy Scouts are primarily\noriented around sexual and religious teachings, one will be\n  26\n    See, e.g., 1 Samuel 9:9-13; 1 Kings 3:2.\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA          6621\ndisappointed to find that there are more pages about knot\ntying than sex and religion combined, and that most of what\nBoy Scouts learn about and do involves camping, boating,\nhiking, swimming, and charitable activities.\n\n  Here is the Boy Scout oath that the Barnes-Wallaces say\nmakes them “feel degraded.”\n\n    Scout Oath or Promise\n    On my honor I will do my best\n    To do my duty to God and my country\n    and to obey the Scout Law;\n    To help other people at all times;\n    To keep myself physically strong,\n    mentally awake, and morally straight.\n\nThose who disagree with religion of any sort, patriotism,\naltruism, physical fitness, mental alertness, or honesty as vir-\ntues would not want to take this oath, but no one has to take\nthe oath or know what it says to use the park. Here is the Boy\nScout Law that generations of Scouts have been required to\nmemorize, and that the Breens swear makes them feel “dis-\nturbed” and “offended,”\n\n    Scout Law\n    A Scout is trustworthy, loyal,\n    helpful, friendly, courteous, kind,\n    obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave,\n    clean, and reverent.\n\nOne who rejects any of these as virtues, not just reverence,\nwould not want to follow the Boy Scout Law, but no one has\nto honor or even know of the oath in order to use the park.\nMany generations of Boy Scouts have committed the whole\noath to memory, as they must to get their Tenderfoot badge.\nWithout memorizing the Scout Law or looking it up, one\nwould not even know that it included a non-sectarian refer-\nence to religion. By contrast, a gigantic cross on a mountain-\n\f6622        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\ntop requires no research to let the visitor know that he is\nvisiting a Christian shrine.\n\n   There is a distinction between a prominent display of an\nunambiguous religious symbol on public land and groups with\nmyriad viewpoints working with government to facilitate pub-\nlic use of lands. San Diego, like many municipalities, leases\nproperty to many non-profit groups: San Diego Calvary\nKorean Church, Point Loma Community Presbyterian\nChurch, the Jewish Community Center, the Vietnamese Fed-\neration, the Black Police Officers Association, and ElderHelp.\nNo doubt people can be found in San Diego who do not like\nKoreans, Presbyterians, Jews, Vietnamese, Blacks, and old\npeople, and who disagree with the beliefs people in these\ngroups share. Their feelings of disagreement or dislike should\nnot be treated as the “concrete injury” that is “an invasion of\na legally protected interest” required for standing.27\n  27\n     Judge Berzon almost concedes that her “comparison to the Jim Crow\nSouth may seem greatly overblown.” Indeed it does. Comparing the feel-\nings of lesbians or atheists in San Francisco who object to the Boy Scouts\nmanaging a municipal facility, even though they have full, open, and\ntotally nondiscriminatory access, to the treatment of black people in the\nJim Crow South is worse than overblown. It is obscene.\n   It is beyond me how anyone old enough to recall when they separated\nus in Delaware on the train from New York to Washington, D.C., can use\nthe Jim Crow laws as an analogy to the Boy Scouts managing facilities in\nBalboa Park. Black people were not allowed access, generally south of the\nDelaware-Pennsylvania state line, to diners, restaurants, water fountains,\nthe front of the bus, and the front of railroad cars until the civil rights\nmovement awakened America to the injustice of racial exclusion in the\n1950’s and 1960’s. Gays, lesbians and atheists have access identical to\neveryone elses’ in the public spaces at issue in this case. They just don’t\nwant to use it because of their offended feelings.\n   Judge Berzon concedes in footnote 3 that “[t]he absence or presence on\npublic land of symbols of exclusion, whether racial, religious or otherwise,\nis not the focus of the standing issue in this case,” yet the only standing\ncase she cites in her concurrence, Buono v. Norton, 371 F.3d 543 (9th Cir.\n2004), turns precisely on the presence of a cross on public land. Judge\nBerzon’s other case citations, Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Lujan, 962 F.2d\n\f            BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                   6623\n   There is a distinction important to our liberties between\nhaving a legally protected interest and having an interest in\nnot being offended. Some people may feel “degraded” or “of-\nfended” because of the Boy Scouts’ positions on reverence\nand sexuality but so long as their access is unimpaired, the\nfeeling is no stronger a basis for standing than the feelings\nothers may have about atheists or lesbians managing the facil-\nity. By treating the Barnes-Wallaces and Breens revulsion for\nBoy Scouts and consequent avoidance of a place the Boy\nScouts manage as conferring standing, we extend standing to\na claim that precedent does not support. And we assist in a\ncampaign to destroy by litigation an association of people\nbecause of their viewpoints. A feeling of revulsion for others\nwho have different beliefs, so strong that one feels degraded\nor excluded if they are present, does not confer standing.\n\n   Granting standing to the Barnes-Wallaces and the Breens\nundermines freedom of speech and freedom of association.\nThe Boy Scouts are entitled to gather together freely and rein-\nforce the views they share. The Barnes-Wallaces and the\nBreens can use the facilities that the Boy Scouts manage with-\nout agreeing to the Boy Scouts’ views, and without the quiet\nand respectful politeness we all exercise in the presence of\nanother religion’s shrines.\n\n1391, 1396 (9th Cir. 1992), Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1\n(1990), Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, 431 U.S. 209, 240 (1977),\nand Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 756-57 and n. 22 (1984), are also ill-\nfitting, as any intrepid scholar will discover.\n   It is crucial to the majority’s argument to call the Boy Scouts “the\nexcluders,” but at Balboa Park, they do not exclude. The exclusion, to con-\nfer standing, must be from a facility to which one desires access. The Pres-\nbyterian Church, would, I should think, exclude me from employment as\na minister, because I am Jewish, but if they managed a recreational facility\nopen to all without discrimination as the Boy Scouts do, their ministry\nexclusion would not give me standing to challenge their park management\ncontract. Exclusion from something else entirely, employment as a minis-\nter, does not confer standing to challenge any relationship the government\nhas with the organization.\n\f6624      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n   One virtue not in the Boy Scout law, doubtless because in\na free society it is taken for granted, is tolerance. The Boy\nScouts must and do display tolerance for gay, lesbian, atheist,\nand agnostic users of the facilities that they manage for the\ncity. A free country requires that groups with differing views,\nsuch as the plaintiffs and the Boy Scouts, nevertheless have\nto display tolerance for each other. Granting standing to one\nbecause the presence of the other revolts them, under the\nguise that their own feelings and disagreements make them\nfeel excluded, threatens all our liberties.\n\f\f                             PRINTED FOR\n                   ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE—U.S. COURTS\n                BY THOMSON REUTERS/WEST—SAN FRANCISCO\n\nThe summary, which does not constitute a part of the opinion of the court, is copyrighted\n                          © 2008 Thomson Reuters/West.\n\f",

See Cal. R. Ct. 8.548. The resolution of any one\nof these questions could determine the outcome of this appeal\nand no controlling California precedent exists. See id. We are\naware of the California Supreme Court’s demanding caseload\nand recognize that our request adds to that load. But we feel\ncompelled to request certification because this case raises dif-\nficult questions of state constitutional law with potentially\nbroad implications for California citizens’ civil and religious\nliberties. Considerations of comity and federalism favor the\nresolution of such questions by the State’s highest court rather\nthan this court.\n\n                   I.   Questions Certified\n\n   The Desert Pacific Council, a nonprofit corporation char-\ntered by the Boy Scouts of America, leases land from the City\nof San Diego in Balboa Park and Mission Bay Park. The\nCouncil pays no rent for the Mission Bay property and one\ndollar per year in rent for the Balboa Park property. In return,\nthe Council operates Balboa Park’s campground and Mission\nBay Park’s Youth Aquatic Center. The campground and the\nAquatic Center are public facilities, but the Council maintains\nits headquarters on the campground, and its members exten-\nsively use both facilities. The Boy Scouts of America — and\nin turn the Council — prohibit atheists, agnostics, and homo-\nsexuals from being members or volunteers and require mem-\nbers to affirm a belief in God.\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA          6589\n   The plaintiffs are users of the two Parks who are, respec-\ntively, lesbians and agnostics. They would use the land or\nfacilities leased by the Desert Pacific Council but for the\nCouncil’s and Boy Scouts’ discriminatory policies.\n\n  We certify to the California Supreme Court the following\nquestions:\n\n   1. Do the leases interfere with the free exercise and\nenjoyment of religion by granting preference for a religious\norganization in violation of the No Preference Clause in arti-\ncle I, section 4 of the California Constitution?\n\n  2. Are the leases “aid” for purposes of the No Aid Clause\nof article XVI, section 5 of the California Constitution?\n\n  3. If the leases are aid, are they benefitting a “creed” or\n“sectarian purpose” in violation of the No Aid Clause?\n\n   The California Supreme Court is not bound by this court’s\npresentation of the questions. We will accept a reformulation\nof the questions and will accept the Supreme Court’s decision.\nTo aid the Supreme Court in deciding whether to accept the\ncertification, we provide the following statement of facts,\njurisdictional analysis, and explanation.\n\n                  II.   Statement of Facts\n\n  Because the district court granted summary judgment\nagainst it, we take the facts in the light most favorable to the\nnon-moving party, the Desert Pacific Council. See Olsen v.\nIdaho State Bd. of Med., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785719\"><a href=\"/opinion/785719/lorna-a-olsen-v-idaho-state-board-of-medicine-idaho-state-board-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">363</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 922 (9th Cir. 2004).\n\n  A.   The Parties\n\n  The Desert Pacific Council (the “Council”) is a nonprofit\ncorporation chartered by The Boy Scouts of America to\nadminister Scouting programs in the San Diego area. Con-\n\f6590        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\ngress chartered the Boy Scouts of America “to promote . . .\nthe ability of boys to do things for themselves and others . . .\nand to teach them patriotism, courage, self-reliance, and kin-\ndred virtues.” 36 U.S.C. § 30902 (2006). While Scouting\nfocuses primarily on outdoor activity, the Boy Scouts’ rules\ninclude a prohibition against allowing youths or adults who\nare atheists, agnostics, or homosexuals to be members or vol-\nunteers. Cf. Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118384\"><a href=\"/opinion/118384/boy-scouts-of-america-v-dale/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">640</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 659-61\n(2000) (holding that the Boy Scouts have a constitutional\nright to exclude homosexuals). These rules bind the Council.\nThe Boy Scouts maintain that agnosticism, atheism, and\nhomosexuality are inconsistent with their goals and with the\nobligations of their members. See Randall v. Orange County\nCouncil, Boy Scouts of Am., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1186290\"><a href=\"/opinion/1186290/randall-v-orange-county-council/\"><span class=\"volume\">17</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">736</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 742 (1998)\n(reciting that, in defending its right to exclude atheists, the\nBoy Scouts introduced “evidence intended to establish that\nrequiring the inclusion of nonbelievers . . . would interfere\nwith the organization’s efforts to convey its religious mes-\nsage”).\n\n   The Boy Scouts do not require scouts to affiliate with any\nreligious organization, and the Boy Scouts style themselves\n“absolutely nonsectarian.” [ER 309 (75:7-8), 1580, art. IX\n§ 1, cl. 1; see also, e.g., ER 1527; ER 54 ¶ 185, ER 2007 ¶ 185.]1\nThe San Diego Boy Scouts are “not a house of worship like\na church or synagogue.” [ER 54 ¶ 185; ER 2007 ¶ 185.] Still,\nthe organization has a religious element. All members and\nvolunteers take an oath to “do my best . . . [t]o do my duty\nto God and my country” and to remain “morally straight.”\n[ER 2005 ¶ 176.] The organization’s mission is “to prepare\nyoung people to make ethical choices over their lifetimes by\ninstilling in them the values of the Scout Oath and Law.” [ER\n  1\n   The bracketed citations of ER and SER refer, respectively, to the\nExcerpts of Record and the Supplemental Excerpts of Record filed by the\nparties in this court. The references are included in this Order for the con-\nvenience of the California Supreme Court, should it choose to request this\ncourt to furnish those Excerpts. See Cal. R. Ct. 8.548(c).\n\f           BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA               6591\n2003 ¶ 162.] Duty to God is placed first in the Oath as “the\nmost important of all Scouting values.” [ER 2004 ¶ 170.]\nMembers also must agree to uphold the “Scout Law,” which\nprovides that a Scout is “faithful in his religious duties.” [ER\n2005 ¶ 177.] Membership and leadership applications contain\na “Declaration of Religious Principle,” which explains that\n“no member can grow into the best kind of citizen without\nrecognizing an obligation to God.” [ER 1535.] The Boy\nScouts instruct leaders to “be positive in their religious influ-\nence and [to] encourage Scouts to earn the religious emblem\nof their faith.” [ER 1527.]\n\n   The plaintiffs Barnes-Wallaces are a lesbian couple and the\nplaintiffs Breens are agnostics. Because of their sexual and\nreligious orientations, they cannot be Boy Scout volunteers.\nBoth couples have sons old enough to join the Boy Scouts,\nand they would like their sons to use the leased facilities, but\nthe parents refuse to give the approval required for member-\nship. As part of the membership application, a parent must\npromise to assist his or her son “in observing the policies of\nthe Boy Scouts of America . . . [to] serve as his adult partner\nand participate in all meetings and approve his advancement.”\n[Id. 1533.] The application also includes the Scout Law and\nthe Declaration of Religious Principle. The Barnes-Wallaces\nand the Breens believe that the Boy Scouts’ policies are dis-\ncriminatory, and they refuse to condone such practices by\nallowing their children to join the Boy Scouts.\n\n  B.    The Leases\n\n   In accord with its long history of “encourag[ing] nonprofit\norganizations to develop cultural, educational, and recre-\national programs” on the City property, the plaintiffs’ home\ntown of San Diego has leased 123 public properties to various\nnonprofit organizations.2 [SER 10, 36.] One of these organiza-\n  2\n   These organizations include religious organizations (e.g., San Diego\nCalvary Korean Church, Point Loma Community Presbyterian Church,\n\f6592        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\ntions is the Desert Pacific Council, which leases, occupies,\nand operates portions of two popular city parks. Other por-\ntions of those parks are extensively used by the plaintiff fami-\nlies. Under the original lease, the Council paid one dollar per\nyear in rent. In 2002 the parties entered into a new twenty-\nfive-year lease, which requires the Desert Pacific Council to\npay one dollar in annual rent and a $2,500 annual administra-\ntion fee.\n\n   The City negotiated this lease with the Council on an exclu-\nsive basis, as it sometimes does with groups, religious or sec-\nular, that it deems to be appropriate operators of a particular\npiece of City property. [ER 843-44, 850 (132:8-23); SER 433-\n34, 592 (135:7-20), 1168, 1172-73, 1175, 1182-83, 1185-86,\n1189.] Other organizations receive similar terms. Some\nninety-six of the City’s leases to non-profits (including nine-\nteen leases to youth-oriented recreational non-profits) require\nno rent or rent less than the $2,500 fee the Council pays, and\nfifty of them have terms twenty-five years or longer. [SER\n12-15, 27-29.] Although they produce little to no revenue,\nthese leases save the City some money by placing the costs\nof maintenance and improvement upon the lessee organiza-\ntions. [SER 204-05.] The City spends nothing on the proper-\nties leased to the Council. [SER 3 ¶ 9, 5 ¶ 17.]\n\n  The Council leases from the City sixteen acres in Balboa\nPark known as Camp Balboa. Camp Balboa offers a “unique”\nurban camping opportunity in the “heart of the City.” [ER\n1966 ¶ 7.] The site includes campgrounds, a swimming pool,\nan amphitheater, a program lodge, a picnic area, a ham radio\nroom, restrooms and showers, and a camp ranger office. The\n\nJewish Community Center, Salvation Army), organizations concerned\nwith children or the elderly (e.g., Camp Fire, Girl Scouts, ElderHelp, Little\nLeague), organizations that limit their membership or services on the basis\nof race or ethnicity (e.g., Vietnamese Federation of San Diego, Black\nPolice Officers Association), and art museums and similar institutions\n(e.g., San Diego Art Institute, Old Globe Theater) [SER 11, 14, 27-29].\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA          6593\nlease requires the Council to maintain the property and to\nexpend at least $1.7 million for capital improvements over\nseven years. [ER 820.] The Boy Scouts have landscaped, con-\nstructed recreational facilities, and installed water and power\non the property. [SER 217 ¶ 17.]\n\n   Similarly, under the Fiesta Island lease, the Boy Scouts\nspent approximately $2.5 million to build the Youth Aquatic\nCenter [SER 215 ¶ 10, 1084 ¶ 19]. The facility offers the use\nof kayaks, canoes, sail and row boats, and classroom space to\nother youth groups at inexpensive rates. [SER 215-16 ¶¶ 10-\n11.]\n\n  C.   Occupancy of the Land\n\n   The Desert Pacific Council makes exclusive use of portions\nof Balboa Park for its own benefit. The Council has its head-\nquarters on park property. From this facility it oversees its\n$3.7 million budget, manages its thirty employees, and pro-\ncesses applications for membership and leadership positions.\nThe Council also has a print shop on park land that it uses to\nprint literature for its members. These portions of the park are\nunavailable for public use.\n\n   Other portions of Camp Balboa and the Youth Aquatic\nCenter are available for use by non-member groups, but the\nCouncil manages reservations of these recreational facilities.\nCampsites at Camp Balboa are available on a first-come, first-\nserved basis. [SER 295, 307, 617-18.] Thus, if the plaintiffs\nwere to use the land, they would have to do so subject to the\nCouncil’s oversight. The Council can declare the camp\n“closed,” determine how many people are going to attend the\ncamps, and then open up only the unreserved facilities to the\npublic. Nonetheless, numerous other groups have camped in\nthe campsites while camp was in session, and the San Diego\nBoy Scouts have not turned any non-Scout group away from\nCamp Balboa during that time. [SER 291 (171:3-6); see also\nSER 624 (156:16-157:16); 291 (170:13-15)]. The Camp\n\f6594      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\ncharges a small fee for camping, but the revenue from fees is\ninsufficient to cover the cost of maintaining the camp facili-\nties. [SER 218].\n\n   The Council also leases land from the City on Fiesta Island\nin Mission Bay Park. In 1987, the City entered into a twenty\nfive-year, rent-free lease with the Desert Pacific Council for\none-half acre of waterfront property on Fiesta Island. The City\nentered into this lease after the Desert Pacific Council\napproached it about building and operating an aquatic center\non the island. The Council was awarded the lease on the con-\ndition that it expend $1.5 million to build the Youth Aquatic\nCenter. At a price of about $2.5 million [SER 1084 ¶ 19], the\nCouncil built and now operates the Aquatic Center, which\noffers boating, sailing, canoeing, and kayaking to San Diego\nyouth.\n\n   As at Camp Balboa, reservations to use the Youth Aquatic\nCenter are made through the Council. The Aquatic Center has\na formal first-come, first-served policy, but the policy has\nexceptions for Scout members. The Desert Pacific Council is\npermitted to reserve up to 75% of the facilities seven days in\nadvance. The Council also hosts a members-only camp for\nfour weeks each summer. The reservation books during camp\nsay “YAC Closed for Summer Camp,” although the Boy\nScouts’ use of the Aquatic Center during those weeks is not\nexclusive. [SER 216-17, 317.] While the public cannot use the\nAquatic Center during summer camp for water-based activi-\nties, it can reserve dormitories or other facilities the Scouts\nare not using. In practice, non-members often use portions of\nthe facilities more than members do. [SER 216-18.] The San\nDiego Boy Scouts have not turned away any non-Scout group\nwhile Scouting is in session, either at Camp Balboa or at the\nAquatic Center. [SER 291 (170:13-15, 171:3-6), 315 (227:11-\n14).] The Center charges fees for use, but there is no evidence\nthat the fees equal or exceed the cost of maintaining the facili-\nties.\n\f             BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                  6595\n   There are no religious symbols either at Camp Balboa or at\nthe Youth Aquatic Center.\n\n  D.      The Plaintiffs’ Injury\n\n   The plaintiffs never applied to use the Youth Aquatic Cen-\nter or Camp Balboa; there is no evidence that the Council\nactively excluded them. [SER 235-36 (104:24-106:10), 244\n(91:25-93:23), 251-52 (33:2-35:10).] Rather, they testified\nthat the Council’s occupation and control of the land deterred\nthem from using the land at all. The plaintiffs desired to make\nuse of the recreational facilities at Camp Balboa and the\nYouth Aquatic Center, but not under the Council’s authority.\nAs a result, they actively avoided the land. They refused to\ncondone the Boy Scouts’ exclusionary policies by seeking\npermission from the Boy Scouts to use the leased facilities or\nby using the leased facilities subject to the Boy Scouts’ own-\nership and control. [ER 85, 370-71; SER 252 (35:12-15; 36:2-\n5).] They had an aversion to the facilities and felt unwelcome\nthere because of the Boy Scouts’ policies that discriminated\nagainst people like them. [ER 369; SER 254 (74:4-10)].\n\n   The plaintiff families brought this action against the City of\nSan Diego, the Boy Scouts, and the Desert Pacific Council,\nalleging that leasing public land to an organization that\nexcludes persons because of their religious and sexual orienta-\ntions violates the federal Establishment Clause, the California\nConstitution’s No Preference3 and No Aid4 Clauses, the fed-\n  3\n   This Clause provides, in relevant part:\n      Free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or\n      preference are guaranteed. This liberty of conscience does not\n      excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent with the peace or\n      safety of the State. The Legislature shall make no law respecting\n      an establishment of religion.\nCal. Const. art. I, sec. 4.\n  4\n    This Clause states:\n\f6596        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\neral and state Equal Protection Clauses, the San Diego Human\nDignity Ordinance, and state contract law. The district court\nfound the plaintiffs had standing as municipal taxpayers and\nthen allowed them to file an amended complaint. Both parties\nsought summary judgment. The court found that the leases\nviolated the federal Establishment Clause and the California\nNo Aid and No Preference Clauses and granted summary\njudgment in the plaintiffs’ favor. Barnes-Wallace v. Boy\nScouts of Am., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2463270\"><a href=\"/opinion/2463270/barnes-wallace-v-boy-scouts-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1259</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1276-80 (S.D. Cal.\n2003). In the amended final judgment, the court enjoined the\nBalboa Park and Fiesta Island leases. The City then notified\nthe Council that under the terms of the 2002 Balboa Park\nlease, the term tenancy was terminated and converted to a\nmonth-to-month tenancy. The plaintiffs have since settled\nwith the City. The Scout defendants appealed the district\ncourt’s ruling.\n\n                   III.   Jurisdictional Analysis\n\n   Before proceeding further, we must satisfy ourselves that\nwe have jurisdiction over this appeal. We have statutory juris-\ndiction over the appeal under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, but the par-\nties have presented challenges to the existence of a case or\ncontroversy that is essential to our constitutional jurisdiction\nunder Article III. See Harrison W. Corp. v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"471617\"><a href=\"/opinion/471617/harrison-western-corporation-v-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">792</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1391</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1392 (9th Cir. 1986). We address these issues as\nthreshold matters.\n\n  A.    Mootness\n\n  The plaintiffs argue that the appeal is moot as to the Balboa\nPark lease because the City terminated the lease after the dis-\n\n    Neither the legislature, nor any county, city and county, town-\n    ship, school district, or other municipal corporation, shall ever\n    make an appropriation, or pay from any public fund whatever, or\n    grant anything to or in aid of any religious sect, church, creed, or\n    sectarian purpose . . . .\nCal. Const. art. XVI, sec. 5.\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA            6597\ntrict court’s final judgment. The appeal is not moot because\nthe Desert Pacific Council still has “a legally cognizable inter-\nest for which the courts can grant a remedy.” Alaska Ctr. for\nthe Env’t v. U.S. Forest Service, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765936\"><a href=\"/opinion/765936/alaska-center-for-the-environment-alaska-wildlife-alliance-v-us-forest/\"><span class=\"volume\">189</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 854 (9th Cir.\n1999). The City did not terminate the Desert Pacific Council’s\ntenancy, but rather converted it to a month-to-month, hold-\nover tenancy. The Council still occupies Camp Balboa, and\nthe permissibility of its tenancy remains at issue in this\nappeal. Moreover, the City’s notice terminating the lease indi-\ncated that, if the district court’s judgment is reversed, the ter-\nmination notice will be of no effect. The controversy with\nregard to the Balboa Park lease is not moot.\n\n  B.   Standing\n\n   The Boy Scouts challenge the standing of plaintiffs to bring\nthis action. See Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112747\"><a href=\"/opinion/112747/lujan-v-defenders-of-wildlife/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n560 (1992) (explaining that standing is a component of the\ncase-or-controversy requirement). Because the case was\ndecided on summary judgment in the district court, the plain-\ntiffs had the burden of showing by uncontroverted facts that\nthey had standing to challenge the leases. See id. at 561. We\nconclude that the plaintiffs have sustained that burden, but we\nbase standing on a different ground from that adopted by the\ndistrict court.\n\n   The Barnes-Wallaces and the Breens have standing to pur-\nsue their claims because uncontroverted evidence shows that\nthey suffered injury-in-fact traceable to the Scout defendants’\nconduct, and that a favorable decision is likely to redress their\ninjuries. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560-61. The Barnes-Wallaces\nand the Breens submitted declarations asserting, without con-\ntradiction by the Scout defendants, that they would like to use\nCamp Balboa and the Aquatic Center, but that they avoid\ndoing so because they are offended by the Boy Scouts’ exclu-\nsion, and publicly expressed disapproval, of lesbians, atheists\nand agnostics. The plaintiffs also object to the Boy Scouts’\ncontrol of access to the facilities, noting that their use of the\n\f6598      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nland would require “go[ing] through” the Boy Scouts and\npassing by symbols of its presence and dominion.\n\n   We have held that comparable restrictions on plaintiffs’ use\nof land constitute redressable injuries for the purposes of Arti-\ncle III standing. Our Establishment Clause cases have recog-\nnized an injury-in-fact when a religious display causes an\nindividual such distress that she can no longer enjoy the land\non which the display is situated. In Buono v.

We concluded that Buono’s “inability to\nunreservedly use public land” constituted an injury-in-fact,\nreasoning that Buono’s avoidance of the land was a personal\ninjury suffered “as a consequence of the alleged constitutional\nerror.” Id. at 547 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also\nEllis v.

As in Buono, they have alleged injuries\nbeyond “the psychological consequence presumably produced\nby observation of conduct with which [they] disagree[ ],”\nbecause their inhibition interferes with their personal use of\nthe land.

Indeed,\nthe plaintiffs’ emotional injuries are stronger than those of the\nCatholic plaintiff in Buono, because they belong to the very\ngroups excluded and disapproved of by the Boy Scouts, and\nbecause they would be confronted with symbols of the Boy\nScouts’ belief system if they used or attempted to gain access\nto Balboa Park and the Aquatic Center.\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA           6599\n   We also have found standing, in environmental cases, when\nplaintiffs’ enjoyment of land would suffer because of treat-\nment of the land or events occurring on the land. See Alaska\nWildlife Alliance v.

U.S. Army Corps of Eng’rs,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789731\"><a href=\"/opinion/789731/ocean-advocates-a-non-profit-organization-fuel-safe-washington-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 860 (9th Cir. 2005) (holding that plaintiff orga-\nnization suffered injury from increased risk of oil spill that\nwould impair its aesthetic or recreational enjoyment of a\nstretch of Alaskan coastline). The plaintiffs’ enjoyment of the\nCouncil-operated facilities is similarly threatened by the Boy\nScouts’ presence and activities. The plaintiffs are faced with\nthe choice of not using Camp Balboa and the Aquatic Center,\nwhich they wish to use, or making their family excursions\nunder the dominion of an organization that openly rejects\ntheir beliefs and sexual orientation. This is not a case where\nthe plaintiffs have no plan to use the land in question. See\nLujan, 504 U.S. at 564 (requiring “concrete plans” to visit\nplace of environmental harm for a finding of actual and immi-\nnent injury). The plaintiffs accordingly have alleged a con-\ncrete recreational loss.\n\n   We conclude that, even with the facts construed favorably\nto the Scout defendants, the plaintiffs have shown both per-\nsonal emotional harm and the loss of recreational enjoyment,\nresulting from the Boy Scouts’ use and control of Camp Bal-\nboa and the Aquatic Center. These injuries, which are likely\nto be redressed by a favorable decision, satisfy the standing\nrequirements of Article III of the Constitution.\n\n   The Scout defendants argue that, as in Valley Forge, the\nplaintiffs’ alleged injuries are based on abstract “feelings” and\n“beliefs” about the Boy Scouts, and therefore are inadequate\nto confer standing. We conclude that Valley Forge does not\ncontrol this case. The Valley Forge plaintiffs, who resided in\nMaryland and Virginia, learned through a news release of a\n\f6600        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\ntransfer of federal land in Pennsylvania to a sectarian college.\nThey attempted to challenge the transfer in federal court. Val-\nley Forge, 454 U.S. at 487. They did not purport to have an\ninterest in using the land at issue. See id. at 486 (“We simply\ncannot see that respondents have alleged an injury of any\nkind, economic or otherwise, sufficient to confer standing.”)\n(emphasis in original). In contrast, the Breens and Barnes-\nWallaces reside in San Diego, where Camp Balboa and the\nAquatic Park are located, and have expressed a desire to make\npersonal use of the facilities operated by the Council. They\ncan hardly be characterized as individuals who “roam the\ncountry in search of governmental wrongdoing.” Id. at 487;\nsee also Allen v. Wright, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111258\"><a href=\"/opinion/111258/allen-v-wright/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">737</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 755-56 (1984).5 More-\nover, the plaintiffs here are lesbians and agnostics, members\nof the classes of individuals excluded and publicly disap-\nproved of by the Boy Scouts. They are not bystanders\nexpressing ideological disapproval of the government’s con-\nduct. The plaintiffs’ personal interest in the land at issue, and\nthe personal nature of their objection to the Scout defendants’\nuse of the land, take this case outside of the scope of Valley\nForge.6\n  5\n     In Allen, the Supreme Court held that a stigmatic injury caused by\nracial discrimination could support standing only if the plaintiffs person-\nally had been or were likely to be subject to the challenged discrimination.\nAllen, 468 U.S. at 755-56. The injury of which the Barnes-Wallaces and\nBreens complain is the offensiveness of having to deal with the Boy\nScouts in order to use park facilities that they wish to use, and would use,\nbut for the control of the Boy Scouts over those facilities. We conclude\nthat this injury is sufficiently immediate to these plaintiffs to permit stand-\ning under the rationale of Allen.\n   6\n     The dissent to this order points out that we originally rejected this the-\nory of standing on the ground that no obvious religious displays were pres-\nent at the Camp or Aquatic Center. The majority of the panel concludes,\nhowever, that the earlier reasoning was incorrect. Psychological injury can\nbe caused by symbols or activities other than large crosses. See Heckler\nv. Mathews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111114\"><a href=\"/opinion/111114/heckler-v-mathews/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">728</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 739-40 (1984) (holding that stigma of discrimi-\nnation confers standing even though remedy may confer no material bene-\nfit). Here, the psychological injury is generated primarily not by plaintiffs’\nown beliefs but by the Boy Scouts’ disapproval of the plaintiffs and people\n\f            BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                   6601\n  C.    The Plaintiffs’ Alternative Theories of Standing\n\n   We reject the plaintiffs’ other theories of standing: the the-\nory that they have standing as taxpayers and the theory that\nthey suffered injury from the Council’s policy of preferential\naccess to the leased property. We disagree with the district\ncourt and conclude that the plaintiffs do not have standing as\nmunicipal taxpayers because they have not suffered a “direct\ndollars-and-cents injury.” Doremus v. Bd. of Educ. of Haw-\nthorne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104971\"><a href=\"/opinion/104971/doremus-v-board-of-ed-of-hawthorne/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">429</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 434 (1952). The plaintiffs characterize\nthe nominal-rent leases as tax expenditures, but the Supreme\nCourt recently made clear that a government’s forgoing of\nrevenue is not the equivalent of an expenditure. Daimler-\nChrysler Corp. v. Cuno, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145658\"><a href=\"/opinion/145658/daimlerchrysler-corp-v-cuno/\"><span class=\"volume\">126</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1854</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1862 (2006).7 The\nCourt rested its holding in part on the fact that the plaintiff\ntaxpayers’ injury was not “actual or imminent” because the\ntax break—designed to stimulate the economy—would not\nnecessarily lower government revenues. Id. at 1862. Simi-\nlarly, this court has held that municipal taxpayers must show\nan expenditure of public funds to have standing. Doe v. Madi-\nson Sch. Dist. No. 321, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764211\"><a href=\"/opinion/764211/no-97-35642/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">789</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 793-97 (9th Cir. 1999);\nCammack v.

The\nplaintiffs’ injury is not actual or imminent because it is\nunclear whether San Diego loses money by charging nominal\nrent but requiring lessees to maintain and improve the leased\nproperty.\n\n   The leases are more reasonably characterized as a potential\nloss of municipal revenues, but even this loss is not definite\n\nlike them. As Buono points out, the problem with standing in Valley Forge\nwas not the nature of the psychological injury but “the absence of any per-\nsonal injury at all.” Buono, 371 F.3d at 547. A psychological injury that\nis generated by demeaning actions directed at the plaintiffs and that causes\nthe plaintiff to avoid a public area that he wishes to use is sufficient to\novercome that problem and confer standing. See id.\n   7\n     The district court did not have the benefit of DaimlerChrysler at the\ntime it ruled that the plaintiffs had taxpayer standing.\n\f6602      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nenough to create municipal taxpayer standing. There is no evi-\ndence that, if the leases were invalidated, the City would use\nthe land to generate revenue. See DaimlerChrysler, 126 S. Ct.\nat 1862 (finding the plaintiff taxpayers’ alleged injury too\nconjectural because it depended on legislators’ responses to\nthe tax breaks in question). For example, the City’s Director\nof Real Estate testified that “[t]he City would likely seek\nanother lessee to operate a recreational facility . . . under simi-\nlar terms and conditions in the existing [Youth Aquatic Cen-\nter] lease . . . [because the] City Council has never had a\npolicy of using the [Youth Aquatic Center] property in a man-\nner that maximizes the revenue that potentially could be gen-\nerated by this site.” [SER 4 ¶ 12.] More generally, the\nDirector stated that “the City has not historically sought to\nobtain market rent from nonprofit lessees of dedicated park-\nland.” Without a definite expenditure of municipal funds,\nplaintiffs do not have standing as municipal taxpayers. Daim-\nlerChrysler, 126 S. Ct. at 1862; Cammack, 932 F.2d at 770-\n71.\n\n   Nor can the plaintiffs claim standing on the basis of the\nCouncil’s policy of granting preferential access to the Boy\nScouts. Even if the Council excludes other groups in favor of\nBoy Scouts—a disputed fact here—the plaintiffs cannot show\ninjury from this policy. The plaintiffs have insisted that they\nwould not use the facilities while the Boy Scouts are lessees.\nThe plaintiffs never contacted the Boy Scouts about using the\nfacilities, and they admitted they knew little or nothing about\nthe Boy Scouts’ policies regarding access to the facilities.\nWithout any plans to apply for access, the plaintiffs cannot\nshow actual and imminent injury from a discriminatory policy\nof denying access. See Lujan, 504 U.S. at 564.\n\n   Moreover, the injury that we have concluded the plaintiffs\ndid suffer cannot be redressed by correcting this access pol-\nicy. As long as the Council as an organization maintains poli-\ncies that exclude from participation and demean people in the\nplaintiffs’ position, no amount of evenhanded access to the\n\f            BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                   6603\nleased facilities will redress the plaintiffs’ injury: emotional\nand recreational harm arising out of the Council’s control and\nadministration of public land that the plaintiffs wish to use. It\nis this injury, and not the alleged Boy Scouts’ policy of pref-\nerential access to the facilities it operates, that supports plain-\ntiffs’ standing to maintain their claims under the federal and\nstate religion clauses.8\n\n               IV.     Explanation of Certification\n\n  A. The Need to Avoid Federal Constitutional\n  Questions\n\n   “[F]ederal courts should not decide federal constitutional\nissues when alternative grounds yielding the same relief are\navailable.” See Kuba v. 1-A Agric. Assoc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788193\"><a href=\"/opinion/788193/alfredo-kuba-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v-1-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">850</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 856\n(9th Cir. 2004). If the California Constitution provides an\nindependent basis for relief, then there is “no need for deci-\nsion of the federal issue.” City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Cas-\ntle, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110649\"><a href=\"/opinion/110649/city-of-mesquite-v-aladdins-castle-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">455</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">283</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 295 (1982). Yet any interpretation by\nthis court of the State’s constitutional clauses, unlike an inter-\npretation by the California Supreme Court, cannot be authori-\ntative. See Bartoni-Corsi Produce, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank,\nN.A. (In re Bartoni-Corsi Produce, Inc.), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"748803\"><a href=\"/opinion/748803/in-re-bartoni-corsi-produce-inc-debtor-richard-j-spear-trustee-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">857</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 861\n(9th Cir. 1997).\n\n  B.    The Need for Certification\n\n   We certify three issues to the California Supreme Court\nbecause they require interpretation of the state constitution’s\nreligion clauses beyond that found in state or federal cases.\n  8\n   The dissent asserts that “[t]he Boy Scouts are entitled to gather\ntogether freely and reinforce the views they share.” The complaint, how-\never, does not challenge the right of the Boy Scouts to associate and share\nviews; it challenges only their entitlement to manage a portion of the\nCity’s parks. Our discussion here relates only to whether the plaintiffs can\nbring this challenge, not to whether their claim ultimately will be found\nmeritorious.\n\f6604      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nThese clauses affect the delicate relationship between the gov-\nernment and religion, and any interpretation of these clauses\nhas significant public policy ramifications.\n\n    1.   The No Preference Clause\n\n   The No Preference Clause states in part that “[f]ree exer-\ncise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or pref-\nerence are guaranteed.” Cal. Const. art. 1 § 4. The California\nSupreme Court “has never had occasion to definitively con-\nstrue” this clause. E. Bay Asian Local Dev. Corp. v. Califor-\nnia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2585351\"><a href=\"/opinion/2585351/east-bay-asian-local-deveopment-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">693</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719 (2000). Having not yet been faced\nwith a case that requires it “to declare the scope and proper\ninterpretation” of the clause, it has found no necessity to set\nthe boundaries of the clause. See Catholic Charities of Sacra-\nmento, Inc. v. Superior Court, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639069\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639069/catholic-charities-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">527</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 562 (2004).\nWe therefore cannot accurately estimate from existing Cali-\nfornia Supreme Court cases how that Court would apply the\nNo Preference Clause to the case before us. It is true that, in\na case involving exemptions from a landmark preservation\nlaw for religious institutions, the California Supreme Court\nheld that, because the challenged action passed the federal\nEstablishment Clause test set forth in Lemon v. Kurtzman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108380\"><a href=\"/opinion/108380/lemon-v-kurtzman/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">602</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971), it also complied with California’s No Prefer-\nence Clause. E. Bay Asian Local Dev. Corp., 24 Cal. 4th at\n719; see also Paulson v. Abdelnour, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2247604\"><a href=\"/opinion/2247604/paulson-v-abdelnour/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">400</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n434 (2006). It is not at all clear, however, whether the Boy\nScouts’ management of the park facilities complies with the\nLemon test, and we follow the rule of not deciding federal\nconstitutional questions when state law may be determinative.\nWe know of no authority compelling the California courts to\naddress the Lemon test in every challenge brought under the\nNo Preference Clause. Any independent determination of a\nNo Preference Clause issue by the California Supreme Court\nwould be conclusive on this court and this litigation.\n\n   Although state intermediate appellate courts have construed\nthe No Preference Clause, the unique facts of this case would\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA             6605\nrequire us to go beyond these decisions. See, e.g., Woodland\nHills Homeowners Org. v. Los Angeles Cmty. Coll.

For example, the plaintiff fami-\nlies challenge the process by which the leases were obtained,\nbut no California court has identified the perspective from\nwhich we should scrutinize these processes to determine\nwhether there has been a forbidden preference. The United\nStates Supreme Court adopts the perspective of a reasonable\nobserver when determining Establishment Clause questions,\nsee County of Allegheny v. ACLU, Greater Pittsburgh Chap-\nter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112331\"><a href=\"/opinion/112331/allegheny-county-v-greater-pittsburgh-aclu/\"><span class=\"volume\">492</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">573</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 635 (1989) (O’Connor, J., concurring in\npart and concurring in the judgment), but at least one Justice\nof the California Supreme Court has urged that courts inter-\npreting the No Preference Clause “view the issue from the\nperspective of the minority.” Sands v. Morongo Unified Sch.\nDist., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1196385\"><a href=\"/opinion/1196385/sands-v-morongo-unified-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">53</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">863</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 915-16 (Cal. 1991) (Arabian, J., concur-\nring). Thus, we seek certification so that the California\nSupreme Court, rather than this federal court, can chart the\nproper course through these unresolved areas.\n\n    2.   The No Aid Clause\n\n  The absence of controlling precedent in regard to the No\nAid Clause presents us with an even greater problem, in part\nbecause that clause is without a parallel in the United States\nConstitution. The No Aid Clause prohibits the City from\n“mak[ing] an appropriation, or pay[ing] from any public fund\nwhatever, or grant[ing] anything to or in aid of any religious\nsect, church, creed, or sectarian purpose . . . .” Cal. Const. art.\nXVI § 5. To assess whether the leases violate the No Aid\nClause, we must determine whether the leases are aid and, if\nso, whether the City supports a creed or sectarian purpose by\ngranting the aid to the Boy Scouts. The California Supreme\nCourt has not been called upon to define “aid” in a manner\n\f6606      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nthat applies to the circumstances of this case. Nor has it been\nrequired to establish what is a “creed” or “sectarian purpose”\nto which aid cannot be given.\n\n   In its most recent decision construing the No Aid Clause,\nCalifornia Statewide Communities Development Auth. v. All\nPersons Interested in Validity of a Purchase Agreement, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2635249\"><a href=\"/opinion/2635249/cscda-v-all-persons-interested/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1070</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal. 2007), the California Supreme Court held that\nthe clause did not invalidate a public bond program that facili-\ntated the raising of private money to benefit sectarian institu-\ntions. Id. at 1081. It had long been established that such aid\ncould be given to religiously affiliated colleges so long as the\nfunds were not used for religious purposes. The question for\ndecision in Statewide Communities was whether the same rule\napplied to institutions that were “pervasively sectarian.” Id. at\n1072. No definition of “pervasively sectarian” was required,\nbecause the parties assumed for purposes of the case that the\ninstitutions in question were pervasively sectarian. Id. For the\nsame reason, it was unnecessary to define precisely a “creed”\nor “sectarian purpose.” The bond arrangement was held not to\nviolate the No Aid Clause so long as the institutions did not\nuse the bond proceeds for sectarian purposes and met certain\nother requirements, including the offering of a sufficiently\nbroad curriculum of secular subjects. Id. at 1077, 1081. The\nStatewide Communities decision does not assist us, however,\nin determining whether the City’s leases to the Boy Scouts\nviolate the No Aid Clause, because the California Supreme\nCourt emphasized that no public funds or real estate passed to\nthe sectarian institutions. Id. at 1076. Statewide Communities\ntherefore does not affect the need for certification in this case.\n\n   The facts of this case also require us to go beyond the\nframework set forth in our own decision of Paulson v. City of\nSan Diego, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778159\"><a href=\"/opinion/778159/philip-k-paulson-v-city-of-san-diego-mt-soledad-memorial-association/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc), for inter-\npreting the No Aid Clause. Paulson concerned a No Aid\nClause challenge to a municipal government’s sale of public\nland containing a cross to a sectarian organization. Paulson\nconcluded that the No Aid Clause “prohibits the government\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA          6607\nfrom (1) granting a benefit in any form (2) to any sectarian\npurpose (3) regardless of the government’s secular purpose\n(4) unless the benefit is properly characterized as indirect,\nremote, or incidental.” Id. at 1131. Whether the City granted\na benefit to the Scout defendants for the advancement of a\ncreed or sectarian purpose is a very different and more chal-\nlenging question than that presented in Paulson. Resolution of\nthis issue would require expanding our interpretation of Cali-\nfornia cases. An expansion or contraction of the definitions of\n“aid,” “creed,” or “sectarian purpose” could have a substantial\nimpact upon Californians’ liberties and the administration of\ntheir public lands. We are reluctant to embark on a refinement\nof the meaning of those terms without the authoritative assis-\ntance of the California Supreme Court. We thus ask that Court\nto exercise its discretion and decide whether the leases are aid\nand whether this aid benefits a creed or sectarian purpose.\n\n              V.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n   Any comparison to the Jim Crow South may seem greatly\noverblown, and in most respects it certainly is. The Boy\nScouts do not express disdain for homosexuals and atheists\nanywhere near as graphically or concretely as the Jim Crow\nSouth did blacks, and the Boy Scouts are only one group, not\nan entire society and governmental structure. And, on the\nmerits, the issues here are entirely different from, and quite\nobviously nowhere near of the same magnitude of impact or\nhistoric significance as, those in the seminal desegregation\ncases.\n\n   But at this point — although the dissent carefully avoids so\nrecognizing in excoriating my comparison — we are con-\ncerned only with standing: whether the Barnes-Wallace and\nBreen families have suffered an injury allowing them to be\nheard in court. And in its nature, though certainly not its\ndegree, the injury that the Barnes-Wallace and Breen families\nclaim is much the same as that suffered by the plaintiffs in the\nbus desegregation cases. Just as African-Americans could ride\non Montgomery’s buses, but not in the front, the Scouts per-\nmit Plaintiffs to make use of Camp Balboa and the Mission\nBay Park Youth Aquatic Center, but do not allow them to be\nmembers of their organization and participate in the activities\nconducted at the camps for members. In either case, use of a\nvaluable public facility is made contingent on acceptance of\nimposed second class status within a controlling organiza-\ntion’s social hierarchy.\n\n  Judge Kleinfeld disagrees, viewing the injury Plaintiffs\nassert here as simply their “revulsion for [the] Boy Scouts”\nand “feelings of disagreement” with its beliefs. This assertion\nbetrays a rather skewed view of which direction the revulsion\nactually flows in this case, and to what effect.1 One only need\n  1\n   The dissent criticizes plaintiffs for bringing this case “under the guise\nthat their own feelings and disagreements make them feel excluded.” The\nsociological term for the tendency to attribute fault for injuries experi-\nenced by members of a subordinated group to the group itself is “blaming\n\f           BARNES-WALLACE v.

The Boy Scouts Oath and Law\ncontain many uplifting sentiments that contain no implicit\ncriticisms and are in no way exclusionary. But the Boy Scouts\nalso require their members to promise to be “morally straight”\n— and so exclude gays and lesbians, like the Barnes-\nWallaces, from participation in the organization because the\nScouts believe that homosexuality is incompatible with moral\nstraightness and cleanliness.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nWallaces, because the Scouts believe them to possess charac-\nteristics that make them morally unclean and incapable of\nbeing the “best kind of citizen.” In other words, the reason the\nScouts exclude the Breens and Barnes-Wallaces is not simply\nthat they do not have the same beliefs or practice the same life\nstyles; the reason is that, to the Scouts, the Breens and\nBarnes-Wallaces hold beliefs and practice life styles that are\nreprehensible and subject to deeply held, adverse moral judg-\nments. To not take serious offense from such characteriza-\ntions would require a better sense of humor than most of us\npossess.2\n\n   More importantly, there is not merely offense here but\ninjury too. To use Camp Balboa and the Mission Bay Park\nYouth Aquatic Center, the Plaintiffs must not just observe the\npresence of the Boy Scouts, but also interact with, seek per-\nmission from, and, quite significantly, pay fees to, this same\norganization that believes them inferior in both morals and\ncitizenship. Plaintiffs allege that in order to avoid such a situ-\nation, they and their children forgo use of the site, thereby\ngiving up a basic interest that citizens possess in public land\n— the right to simply enter and enjoy its recreational environ-\nment.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                   6613\nwhich opposed desegregation and extension of voting rights\nto blacks, to operate on public land a recreation center, which\nAfrican-American families could, for a fee paid to the Coun-\ncil, get permission from the Council to use.

And would the answer differ depending on whether or\nnot the Council erected a billboard on the property endorsing\n“Segregation Forever”?3\n\n   The obviousness of the answer to this question is reflected\nin the long series of First Amendment cases illustrating that,\nwhen plaintiffs are required to choose between either paying\na fee to an organization with which they disagree or forgoing\nan interest to which they are entitled, the existence of an\ninjury-in-fact is simply taken as a given.

Plaintiffs’ injury here comes from the\nrequirement of having to directly interact with, and pay fees to the Boy\nScouts — the actual excluders, themselves — in order to use this land.\nAnd the dissent’s representation to the contrary notwithstanding, Plain-\ntiffs’ avoidance of this land is not a reaction to what they “imagine the\nBoy Scouts feel about them.” Instead, it is a response to the Scouts’ actual\npolicy of excluding gays and atheists, which is a matter of legal record,\nnot bare speculation. See, e.g., Dale, 530 U.S. at 652; Randall, 17 Cal. 4th\nat 742 (1998).\n\f6614      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\nnot want to associate, not the mere fact of a disagreement with\nthe defendant organization. True, these cases and others like\nthem ultimately concluded that there are circumstances in\nwhich mandatory association is permitted and devised limited\nremedies for those circumstances in which it is not. See, e.g.,\nAbood, 431 U.S. at 237-40. But for present purposes, the\nsalient point is that the legal system recognized the complaint\nof the plaintiffs in those cases — that they should not have to\nassociate with and pay fees to an organization with which\nthey disagreed to have access to commonly available benefits\n— as one which the plaintiffs were entitled to raise in court,\nand to which they were entitled a judicial answer.\n\n   For all these reasons, the dissent’s suggestion that our\ngranting standing in this case means that anyone who dis-\nagrees with the beliefs of any other group to which the City\nof San Diego leases property could bring similar litigation is\nentirely overblown. To succeed on the standing theory the\nmajority adopts, such would-be plaintiffs would have to show\n(1) that on the property leased to that group by the city there\nis some site or facility which the individual plaintiffs could\nhave and would have visited and used, were it not for (2) that\ngroup having an exclusionary policy that directly and person-\nally affects the plaintiffs, and (3) that use of the property\nwould require interaction with the group, such as paying fees\nfor use of the facility, and perception of its symbols.

Moreover,\neven if standing were so established, to prevail in their suit the\nplaintiffs would still have to prove that the defendant group’s\nadherence to this policy means that the city’s leasing it the\nproperty violates the state or federal constitution.\n\n    I am entirely unconvinced that allowing such cases to be\nlitigated in court will, as the dissent suggests, “undermine free\nspeech and freedom of association.” Instead, providing the\nplaintiffs with their day in court will ensure that when govern-\nment turns the public’s property over to private groups, it\ndoes so in accordance with relevant constitutional require-\n\f           BARNES-WALLACE v.

Without standing,\nthere is no federal jurisdiction, and no authority to certify.\n\n   Surprisingly, the majority now bases standing on a theory\nthe majority expressly rejected the last time around. The new\ntheory is that the plaintiffs would like to use the parks but\n“avoid doing so because they are offended by the Boy Scouts’\nexclusion, and publicly expressed disapproval, of lesbians,\natheists and agnostics.”3 The theory is that the plaintiffs suffer\n“emotional harm and the loss of recreational enjoyment”4\nbecause they “do not want to view signs posted by the Boy\nScouts or interact with the Boy Scouts’ representatives in\norder to gain access to the facilities.”5\n  1\n    Barnes-Wallace v.

BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                6619\ncross on the crest of a hill in a city park violated the Establish-\nment Clause.21 In Buono the cross in Mojave National Pre-\nserve was five to eight feet tall on a prominent rock\noutcropping rising 15 to 20 feet above grade. It appeared\n“likely that the Sunrise Rock cross will project a message of\ngovernment endorsement to a reasonable observer” of a par-\nticular religious belief.22 The plaintiff had standing because he\nregularly visited the preserve and took an inconvenient road\nto avoid viewing the prominent cross on government property.23\n\n   Buono holds that the “inhibition” from using public land\n“as a consequence of the alleged constitutional error” created\nby the cross goes beyond a mere psychological injury. This\nholding has boundaries, among them the facts of Buono and\nthe holding in Valley Forge. Buono distinguishes “the psycho-\nlogical consequence presumably produced by observation of\nconduct with which it disagrees,” and a psychological conse-\nquence is all plaintiffs establish in this case.24\n\n   In Ellis, there were three crosses, one 36 feet high on top\nof a mountain, one 43 feet high in a city park, and a picture\nof the mountaintop cross on the city insignia.25 The plaintiffs\navoided the locations, missed the spectacular view from the\nmountaintop, and one claimed that he declined to invite busi-\nness clients to the city because the cross offended them. We\nheld that the plaintiffs who would have visited the public\nareas but for the crosses had standing because their access to\npublic property was interfered with by the crosses. The major-\nity applies the same theory here. Applying these cases,\nthough, to a case where there is no gigantic cross, is an unjus-\ntified extension of their holdings.\n  21\n     Id. at 618.\n  22\n     Buono, 371 F.3d at 549.\n  23\n     Id. at 547.\n  24\n     Buono, 371 F.3d at 547 (quoting Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 485).\n  25\n     Ellis, 990 F.2d at 1520.\n\f6620       BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n   The majority was correct the last time, when it distin-\nguished the gigantic cross cases. Previously, it held that “[t]he\nBreens’ and the Barnes-Wallaces’ purposeful avoidance of\nthe parklands leased by the Boy Scouts as a protest against the\nScouts’ exclusionary policies is not a sufficient injury . . .\n[because] there are no displays in either Camp Balboa or the\nAquatic Center that would be so overwhelmingly offensive\nthat families who do not share the Scouts’ religious views\nmust avoid them.” I agree.\n\n   In our gigantic cross cases, the government maintained\nwhat amounted to a shrine for a particular religion on public\nland. Since time immemorial, shrines have been erected on\nhills and mountaintops.26 A huge cross on a hill or mountain-\ntop would appear to a reasonable objective observer to be a\nshrine. People not sharing the religious views represented by\nthe cross become visitors to another religion’s shrine. On pub-\nlic lands, we are all owners, none of us are mere guests. Even\nif the Boy Scout emblem were 51 feet tall, illuminated by\nneon, and at the crest of a hill (none of which is true), no rea-\nsonable observer would think that the Boy Scout emblem cre-\nated a shrine to a major religion or sexual preference. A\ngigantic cross on a mountaintop carries religious significance\nthat a herd of 11 year old boys camping out and swimming\ndoes not.\n\n   Unlike a cross, neither a Boy Scout, nor the Boy Scout\nemblem (an eagle with a shield on a fleur-de-lis), nor a sign\nsaying “Boy Scouts,” is the central symbol of any religion or\nsexual preference. One would have no idea that the Boy\nScouts even had any views about religion or sex without\ndoing research. And even if one did, one would, as the peti-\ntion for rehearing demonstrates, learn that sex and religion are\nbut an incidental part of scouting. If one reads the Boy Scout\nHandbook to find out whether the Boy Scouts are primarily\noriented around sexual and religious teachings, one will be\n  26\n    See, e.g., 1 Samuel 9:9-13; 1 Kings 3:2.\n\f          BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA          6621\ndisappointed to find that there are more pages about knot\ntying than sex and religion combined, and that most of what\nBoy Scouts learn about and do involves camping, boating,\nhiking, swimming, and charitable activities.\n\n  Here is the Boy Scout oath that the Barnes-Wallaces say\nmakes them “feel degraded.”\n\n    Scout Oath or Promise\n    On my honor I will do my best\n    To do my duty to God and my country\n    and to obey the Scout Law;\n    To help other people at all times;\n    To keep myself physically strong,\n    mentally awake, and morally straight.\n\nThose who disagree with religion of any sort, patriotism,\naltruism, physical fitness, mental alertness, or honesty as vir-\ntues would not want to take this oath, but no one has to take\nthe oath or know what it says to use the park. Here is the Boy\nScout Law that generations of Scouts have been required to\nmemorize, and that the Breens swear makes them feel “dis-\nturbed” and “offended,”\n\n    Scout Law\n    A Scout is trustworthy, loyal,\n    helpful, friendly, courteous, kind,\n    obedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave,\n    clean, and reverent.\n\nOne who rejects any of these as virtues, not just reverence,\nwould not want to follow the Boy Scout Law, but no one has\nto honor or even know of the oath in order to use the park.\nMany generations of Boy Scouts have committed the whole\noath to memory, as they must to get their Tenderfoot badge.\nWithout memorizing the Scout Law or looking it up, one\nwould not even know that it included a non-sectarian refer-\nence to religion. By contrast, a gigantic cross on a mountain-\n\f6622        BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\ntop requires no research to let the visitor know that he is\nvisiting a Christian shrine.\n\n   There is a distinction between a prominent display of an\nunambiguous religious symbol on public land and groups with\nmyriad viewpoints working with government to facilitate pub-\nlic use of lands. San Diego, like many municipalities, leases\nproperty to many non-profit groups: San Diego Calvary\nKorean Church, Point Loma Community Presbyterian\nChurch, the Jewish Community Center, the Vietnamese Fed-\neration, the Black Police Officers Association, and ElderHelp.\nNo doubt people can be found in San Diego who do not like\nKoreans, Presbyterians, Jews, Vietnamese, Blacks, and old\npeople, and who disagree with the beliefs people in these\ngroups share. Their feelings of disagreement or dislike should\nnot be treated as the “concrete injury” that is “an invasion of\na legally protected interest” required for standing.27\n  27\n     Judge Berzon almost concedes that her “comparison to the Jim Crow\nSouth may seem greatly overblown.” Indeed it does. Comparing the feel-\nings of lesbians or atheists in San Francisco who object to the Boy Scouts\nmanaging a municipal facility, even though they have full, open, and\ntotally nondiscriminatory access, to the treatment of black people in the\nJim Crow South is worse than overblown. It is obscene.\n   It is beyond me how anyone old enough to recall when they separated\nus in Delaware on the train from New York to Washington, D.C., can use\nthe Jim Crow laws as an analogy to the Boy Scouts managing facilities in\nBalboa Park. Black people were not allowed access, generally south of the\nDelaware-Pennsylvania state line, to diners, restaurants, water fountains,\nthe front of the bus, and the front of railroad cars until the civil rights\nmovement awakened America to the injustice of racial exclusion in the\n1950’s and 1960’s. Gays, lesbians and atheists have access identical to\neveryone elses’ in the public spaces at issue in this case. They just don’t\nwant to use it because of their offended feelings.\n   Judge Berzon concedes in footnote 3 that “[t]he absence or presence on\npublic land of symbols of exclusion, whether racial, religious or otherwise,\nis not the focus of the standing issue in this case,” yet the only standing\ncase she cites in her concurrence, Buono v. Norton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786531\"><a href=\"/opinion/786531/frank-buono-allen-schwartz-v-gale-norton-secretary-of-the-interior-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">543</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n2004), turns precisely on the presence of a cross on public land. Judge\nBerzon’s other case citations, Fund for Animals, Inc. v. Lujan, 962 F.2d\n\f            BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA                   6623\n   There is a distinction important to our liberties between\nhaving a legally protected interest and having an interest in\nnot being offended. Some people may feel “degraded” or “of-\nfended” because of the Boy Scouts’ positions on reverence\nand sexuality but so long as their access is unimpaired, the\nfeeling is no stronger a basis for standing than the feelings\nothers may have about atheists or lesbians managing the facil-\nity. By treating the Barnes-Wallaces and Breens revulsion for\nBoy Scouts and consequent avoidance of a place the Boy\nScouts manage as conferring standing, we extend standing to\na claim that precedent does not support. And we assist in a\ncampaign to destroy by litigation an association of people\nbecause of their viewpoints. A feeling of revulsion for others\nwho have different beliefs, so strong that one feels degraded\nor excluded if they are present, does not confer standing.\n\n   Granting standing to the Barnes-Wallaces and the Breens\nundermines freedom of speech and freedom of association.\nThe Boy Scouts are entitled to gather together freely and rein-\nforce the views they share. The Barnes-Wallaces and the\nBreens can use the facilities that the Boy Scouts manage with-\nout agreeing to the Boy Scouts’ views, and without the quiet\nand respectful politeness we all exercise in the presence of\nanother religion’s shrines.\n\n1391, 1396 (9th Cir. 1992), Keller v.

The exclusion, to con-\nfer standing, must be from a facility to which one desires access. The Pres-\nbyterian Church, would, I should think, exclude me from employment as\na minister, because I am Jewish, but if they managed a recreational facility\nopen to all without discrimination as the Boy Scouts do, their ministry\nexclusion would not give me standing to challenge their park management\ncontract. Exclusion from something else entirely, employment as a minis-\nter, does not confer standing to challenge any relationship the government\nhas with the organization.\n\f6624      BARNES-WALLACE v. BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n   One virtue not in the Boy Scout law, doubtless because in\na free society it is taken for granted, is tolerance. The Boy\nScouts must and do display tolerance for gay, lesbian, atheist,\nand agnostic users of the facilities that they manage for the\ncity. A free country requires that groups with differing views,\nsuch as the plaintiffs and the Boy Scouts, nevertheless have\nto display tolerance for each other. Granting standing to one\nbecause the presence of the other revolts them, under the\nguise that their own feelings and disagreements make them\nfeel excluded, threatens all our liberties.\n\f\f                             PRINTED FOR\n                   ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICE—U.S. COURTS\n                BY THOMSON REUTERS/WEST—SAN FRANCISCO\n\nThe summary, which does not constitute a part of the opinion of the court, is copyrighted\n                          © 2008 Thomson Reuters/West.\n\f</pre>",
