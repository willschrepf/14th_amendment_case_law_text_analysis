No. C9925466)\n\n         v.\n\nSYLVESTER FRANK WILLIAMS,\n\n         Defendant and Appellant.\n\n\n         The Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (hereafter the Act or Proposition 36)\ncreated a post conviction release proceeding for third strike offenders serving\nindeterminate life sentences for crimes that are not serious or violent felonies. If such an\ninmate meets the criteria enumerated in Penal Code section 1170.126, subdivision (e), 1\nhe or she will be resentenced as a second strike offender unless the court determines such\nresentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (§ 1170.126,\nsubd. (f); People v. Yearwood (2013) 213 Cal.App.4th 161, 168.)\n         On November 26, 2012, after the Act went into effect, defendant Sylvester Frank\nWilliams,2 an inmate serving a term of 25 years to life following conviction of a felony\n(§ 314.1) that was not violent as defined by section 667.5, subdivision (c) or serious as\n\n\n\n\n         1\n         All further statutory references are to the Penal Code unless otherwise indicated.\n         2\n         In all his filings with the court defendant uses the name Sylester Williams.\nHowever, most of the court documents associated with defendant’s case use the name\nSylvester Williams.\n\fdefined by section 1192.7, subdivision (c), filed a petition for recall of sentence and\nrequest for resentencing under the Act.3\n       Subsequently, on February 7, 2014, finding defendant “poses an unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety” should he be resentenced, the trial court denied defendant’s\npetition.\n       Defendant filed a timely notice of appeal.4\n       In essence, defendant claims that the lower court overrode the voters’ intent in\ndenying his petition because Proposition 36 reversed the presumption that the original\nthree strikes law created—life sentences—in favor of second-strike sentences; that equal\nprotection principles forbid the heightened standard applied to already sentenced\nthird-strike prisoners; that Proposition 36 creates a mandatory presumption in favor of a\nsentence reduction, which the prosecution must rebut by proving an unreasonable risk of\nviolence; and that under Apprendi,5 the risk assessment hearing must be in accordance\nwith the rules of evidence and a jury must find dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt.\nWe are not persuaded by any of defendant’s arguments and affirm the lower court’s\ndecision denying defendant’s petition for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n          Defendant submitted an informal request dated November 19, 2012, seeking\nvarious documents in which he requested resentencing under the provisions of\nsection 1170.126. The lower court construed his request, which was filed on\nNovember 26, 2012, as a petition brought under the authority of section 1170.126. The\nlower court found that defendant “may qualify for resentencing under the provisions of\nthe Three Strikes Reform Act.” Accordingly, the court appointed the public defender to\nrepresent defendant and set a briefing schedule.\n        4\n          In Teal v. Superior Court (2014) 60 Cal.4th 595, our Supreme Court held that\nthe denial of a motion for recall and resentencing is an appealable postconviction order.\n(Id. at pp. 599-601.)\n        5\n          Apprendi v. New Jersey (2000) 530 U.S. 466.\n                                              2\n\f                                        Background\n\n\t      In an unpublished opinion, this court summarized the facts of defendant’s\nconviction for indecent exposure.6 We explained that following a court trial defendant\nwas convicted of a felony violation of section 314. The court found true allegations that\ndefendant had suffered five prior felony convictions or strikes within the meaning of\nsections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12 and had served two prison terms\nwithin the meaning of section 667 subdivision (b). The lower court denied defendant’s\nmotion to strike his prior conviction allegations and sentenced defendant to 25 years to\nlife in prison plus a two-year consecutive term.7\n       According to the transcript of the sentencing hearing, defendant’s five prior\nconvictions were for five robberies.\n       As to the facts underlying defendant’s crime of indecent exposure, we explained\nthat defendant exposed himself to three young girls by a closed restroom at Arbuckle\nElementary School. Defendant motioned for the girls to come to him; he was fully\nclothed except his penis was sticking out of his pants. Defendant’s hands were on his\npenis and he was moving them up and down. Defendant lived one-half mile from the\nschool. After his arrest he told the police that he was familiar with the school and that if\nhe had exposed himself it was because he was drunk or high on drugs. He admitted that\nhe had been using alcohol and cocaine for a while before the offense and that alcohol and\ncocaine increased his sex drive and caused him to do “stupid stuff.”\n       We noted that in 1993, defendant had been convicted of two misdemeanor counts\nof annoying or molesting a child under the age of 18 and in 1994 was convicted of a\n\n\n\n       6\n         We have taken judicial notice of (People v. Williams (May 7, 2002, H021986)\n[nonpub. opn.]).\n       7\n         The court imposed the two-year term for the two prior prison terms he had\nserved (§ 667.5, subd. (b)).\n                                              3\n\ffelony count of annoying or molesting a child and a misdemeanor count of indecent\nexposure.8\n                                    Proceedings Below\n        On September 23, 2013, counsel for defendant filed a motion to grant defendant’s\npetition on the basis of eligibility alone—that is without a risk assessment hearing9—or in\nthe alternative to order a jury trial on the issue of dangerousness. On the same date,\ndefendant’s counsel asked the court to make in limine rulings regarding the procedural\nrules for the section 1170.126 hearing. Counsel argued that the proceeding should be an\nevidentiary hearing, as opposed to a sentencing hearing, in which the state has the burden\nof proving that defendant was not entitled to relief for which he was statutorily eligible\nand the rules of evidence should apply.\n        On October 11, 2013, the People filed their opposition to defendant’s motion for a\njury trial.\n        On October 18, 2013, the court held a hearing to address defendant’s motions.\nThe court denied both defendant’s motion for a jury trial and his motion for resentencing\nwithout a risk assessment hearing. The court determined that the rules of evidence do not\napply at a section 1170.126 hearing.\n        On October 30, 2013, the People filed their opposition to defendant’s request for\nresentencing. Attached to the opposition as exhibits were police records and the\nprobation officer’s report in defendant’s indecent exposure case, the transcript of the\nsentencing hearing at which the court imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence, this court’s\nunpublished opinion on appeal, a report documenting Dr. Vicky Campagna’s assessment\nof defendant as a result of interviews of defendant that were conducted in 1999, police\n\n\n        8\n         It was the previous violation of section 314 that elevated defendant’s crime to a\nfelony. (§ 314)\n       9\n         Defendant’s counsel relied on equal protection principles to argue that defendant\ncould not be subjected to the dangerousness evaluation.\n                                             4\n\freports documenting the facts underlying defendant’s crimes in 1993 for indecent\nexposure and child molestation, the probation officer’s report in that case, police reports\ndocumenting other indecent exposures by defendant, the probation officer’s report in\ndefendant’s grand theft and robbery case, and defendant’s prison file, which fills almost\ntwo volumes of the clerk’s transcript.\n       Defendant filed a response to the People’s opposition on February 5, 2014.\n       On February 7, 2014, the court conducted a hearing to determine whether\ndefendant’s petition for resentencing should be granted.10 The court indicated that the\nPeople had the burden of proof at the hearing. The court noted that defendant’s previous\nmotions requesting a jury trial and asking that the rules of evidence apply and that\ndefendant’s prison file or C file be excluded from evidence were preserved for appellate\nreview.\n       The People took the position that resentencing defendant would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to the community, “in particular young children, young\nfemales, and older female adults.” The People posited that “[i]f past conduct is a\npredictor of future conduct, releasing the defendant . . . would pose an unreasonable risk\nto the community. There was nothing . . . in the prison records or even in the defendant’s\nbrief to suggest that he is remorseful, that he has accepted responsibility for his conduct\nand that he was going to be willing or able to change his ways.”\n       The court noted that the People’s opposition to defendant’s request for\nresentencing had 11 exhibits attached; the court indicated that it was going to receive all\nthe exhibits into evidence over the objection of defendant’s counsel. The court admitted\na letter written by one of the victims from defendant’s most recent indecent exposure\ncase, again over counsel’s objection.\n\n       10\n           Defendant was not present in the courtroom; rather, through counsel he asked\nthe court if he could stay in the holding cell and listen to the proceedings via an audio\nsystem.\n                                              5\n\f         The People pointed out that defendant’s criminal history showed he was out of\ncustody for only a few months after his first conviction for indecent exposure and\nannoying or molesting a child before he committed another indecent exposure; and after\nhe was discharged from that prison commitment he committed another indecent\nexposure.\n         The People argued that there were no “rehabilitative efforts” in the prison records\nor in defendant’s briefs to suggest that defendant had changed. Further, defendant’s\nprison record showed that there had been “seven incidents of violence or threatened\nviolence.” The People noted, “there’s no demonstrated effort to comply with any work\norders that may have been done in prison to participate in any programming to\ndemonstrate that . . . he’s different from the person that Judge Fernandez sentenced in\n2000.”\n         Defendant’s counsel countered that defendant was “different. He is 52 years old\nnow. He’s very different. And more importantly perhaps is that the law is different.”\nDefendant’s counsel pointed out that defendant’s strikes were over 25 years old and were\n“[t]he most basic low level purse snatching you could . . . imagine” where defendant\n“rode up on a bike and steals a purse off the arm of a woman that was walking on the\nsidewalk.” Counsel went on to argue that defendant’s robberies all occurred within a\nthree-month period and “his RAP sheet is devoid of violence.”\n         As to defendant’s prison record, his counsel argued that although defendant had\n37 disciplinary infractions, he did not have “the most egregious prison record.” Counsel\nconceded that defendant had continued to expose himself in prison, and had engaged in\nfour mutual combat fights, but pointed out that all of his disciplinary infractions had to do\nwith his fear of having a cellmate.\n         The court told defendant’s counsel that what the court was most interested in was\ndefendant’s “apparent propensity to commit acts of indecent exposure.” In essence,\ndefendant’s counsel argued that because of his age defendant was less likely to reoffend\n                                               6\n\fand had not received the treatment in prison that he needed, but would be able to receive\nsuch treatment if he was released.\n       The court asked defendant’s counsel whether she was suggesting that if upon\nrelease defendant committed an indecent exposure, that would not constitute a risk of\ndanger to the public safety. Defendant’s counsel conceded that any crime is dangerous to\npublic safety; she believed, however, that the court had to consider whether “there is an\nincrease in risk of violence.”\n       The court indicated that it would recess to consider counsels’ presentations. After\nthe recess, the court ruled as follows: “First, the Court recognizes that the People have\nthe burden of proof and that the defendant is entitled to resentencing unless the People\npresent evidence that satisfies by a preponderance of the evidence the Court that a finding\nin its discretion that the defendant poses an unreasonable risk to public safety currently\nshould preclude him from entitlement to resentencing under our current law. [¶] The\nCourt believes first that with respect to the evidence before the Court, it is more likely\nthan not that the defendant poses a risk to public safety. The Court believes that the\ndefendant particularly poses a risk of committing additional acts of indecent exposure in\nviolation of Penal Code Section 314 if he were to be released from custody and even if he\nwere to continue to remain in custody. [¶] The Court believes that the evidence before it\nindicating a more than 20 year history of committing acts of indecent exposure an Axis I\ndiagnosis of exhibitionism, the relative recency of the commission of an act of indecent\nexposure while in custody, all lead the Court to believe that there is a risk that the\ndefendant will continue to commit such acts. The Court believes that a violation of Penal\nCode section 314 in an active indecent exposure is a crime that places public safety at\nrisk. Even in the abstract, particularly for a defendant[,] however[,] who has a prior\nconviction and the defendant has more than one, and is therefore, subject to a felony\nprosecution and is committing acts that the [L]egislature has deemed to be felonious.\n[¶] Penal Code Section 314 not only impacts the community and the victims of its\n                                              7\n\fcommission [sic] because of the emotional harm that it can cause to a victim of a\nviolation of Penal Code Section 314, but also to the disturbances it causes within our\ncommunity. The fear that a violation of Penal Code Section 314 instills in the\ncommunity when it is committed, the fear of victimization, the fear of sexual assault, the\nfear of child molest, all of this has caused the [L]egislature to deem a violation of Penal\nCode section 314 to be criminal, to be felonious if committed when there is a prior\nconviction or under other circumstances to be subject to sex offender registration. For all\nthese reasons the Court has no question that a violation of Penal Code section 314 is a\npublic safety concern. [¶] With respect to this particular defendant, . . . he has particular\ncharacteristics with respect to his commission of acts of Penal Code Section 314. His\nacts have been acts not simply of exposure, but have also included engaging in\nmasturbation, which is not necessary for violation of Penal Code Section 314, the\ndefendant’s history includes the victimization of children, has included performance of\nsuch acts in and around school grounds, and has continued despite his incarceration with\nthe evidence before the Court of 17 violations within the State Prison of acts amounting\nto or similar to violations of Penal Code Section 314.”\n       The court continued, “Based on the defendant’s repeated conduct, the extensive\npattern of conduct, his commission of additional acts of [indecent exposure] while\nincarcerated, his diagnosis of exhibitionism and the lack of persuasive evidence . . . that\nthere has been any particular progress toward a rehabilitation, the Court . . . believes that\nthe evidence . . . establishes that it is more likely than not that the defendant poses an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and that if he were to be resentenced and\nreleased, the high likelihood that he would continue to commit [indecent exposures] is so\ngreat that to ignore that risk would be unreasonable.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       The court discounted the argument by defendant’s counsel that defendant’s\nexhibitionism had decreased and would continue to decrease because of his age.11 The\ncourt stated that the “defendant’s likelihood of recidivism with respect to indecent\nexposure may be minimized given his age and the reference to the diagnostic and\nstatistics manual that has a very brief statement indicating that advanced or increasing\nage may suggest a decrease in incidents of indecent exposure for a person who has been\ndiagnosed with exhibitionism.” The court stated that it did not believe this to be\n“concrete scientific evidence.”\n       The court based its ruling “primarily” on the defendant’s propensity to commit\nacts of indecent exposure; however, the court stated that it could not ignore or discount\ndefendant’s strike priors and evidence “presented within the prison records of some acts\nof physical violence” by defendant while in prison. The court indicated that this evidence\nalone “would [not] necessarily form the basis of a denial” of resentencing, but that the\ncourt “does take it into consideration as part of the totality of the circumstances that the\nCourt must consider.”\n       Accordingly, as noted, the court found that defendant poses an unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety and denied his petition for resentencing.\n                                  Applicable Legal Principles\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second-strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126. “An inmate is eligible for resentencing if: [¶] (1) The inmate is\nserving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 for a conviction of a\nfelony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c)\n\n       11\n          In her response to the People’s opposition to resentencing, defendant’s counsel\nwrote that the “DSM” notes that “few arrests are made in the older age groups, which\nmay suggest that [exhibitionism] becomes less severe after age 40.”\n                                              9\n\fof Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7. [¶] (2) The inmate’s current\nsentence was not imposed for any of the offenses appearing in clauses (i) to (iii),\ninclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667 or\nclauses (i) to (iii), inclusive, of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12. [¶] (3) The inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses\nappearing in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of\nSection 667 or clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (e).)\n       If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second-strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate’s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate’s] disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n       The plain language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126 calls for an\nexercise of the sentencing court’s discretion. “ ‘Discretion is the power to make the\ndecision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Carmony (2004) 33 Cal.4th 367,\n375.) “Where, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its\nexercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed on appeal except on a showing that the\ncourt exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that\nresulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (People v.\nRodrigues (1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125; see People v. Williams (1998) 17 Cal.4th\n\n\n                                              10\n\f148, 162 [abuse of discretion review asks whether ruling in question falls outside bounds\nof reason under applicable law and relevant facts].)\n       As noted, the language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) expressly provides that\nthe petitioner shall be resentenced unless the court, in its discretion, makes a\ndetermination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger. The statute\ndoes not say the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing\nwould pose such a risk.\n       Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126, we\nconclude that the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, facts from which a determination that resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety can be made. The reasons that a trial court\nfinds resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, and the court’s weighing\nof evidence showing dangerousness versus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the\ncourt’s discretion. The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be\nsupported by facts established by a preponderance of the evidence, the trial court need\nnot itself find an unreasonable risk of danger by a preponderance of the evidence. (See\nIn re Robert L. (1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1065-1067 [discussing abuse of discretion\nand preponderance of the evidence standards].)\n       People v. Superior Court (Kaulick) (2013) 215 Cal.App.4th 1279 (Kaulick), found\nthe prosecution bears the burden of establishing “dangerousness” by a preponderance of\nthe evidence against a claim the Apprendi line of cases requires proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt. (Id. at pp. 1301-1302.) As a result, it had no real occasion to address\nthe interplay between the burden of proof and the trial court’s exercise of discretion, or to\nclarify whether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of\nfacts upon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination that resentencing a\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of\n                                             11\n\festablishing that determination itself. Nevertheless, we believe it supports our\ninterpretation of the standard of review.\n       In sum, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, that\nresentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\nbefore it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is the court’s\nultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its finding will be\nupheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within “the bounds of\nreason, all of the circumstances being considered. [Citations.]” (People v. Giminez\n(1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 72.) The facts or evidence upon which the court’s finding of\nunreasonable risk is based must be proven by the People by a preponderance of the\nevidence, however, and are themselves subject to our review for substantial evidence.\nIf a factor such as that the defendant recently committed a battery, or is violent due to\nrepeated instances of mutual combat, is not established by a preponderance of the\nevidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk. (See People v. Cluff\n(2001) 87 Cal.App.4th 991, 998 [trial court abuses its discretion when factual findings\ncritical to decision find no support in record]; cf. People v. Read (1990) 221 Cal.App.3d\n685, 689691 [where trial court erroneously determined defendant was statutorily\nineligible for probation, reviewing court was required to determine whether trial court\ngave sufficient other reasons, supported by facts of case, for probation denial].)\n       Such a conclusion is consistent with California’s noncapital sentencing scheme.\nUnder the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to Cunningham,12\n“three terms of imprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses. The trial\ncourt’s discretion in selecting among [those] options [was] limited by section 1170,\nsubdivision (b), which direct[ed] that ‘the court shall order imposition of the middle term,\nunless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.’ ” (People\n\n\n       12\n            Cunningham v. California (2007) 549 U.S. 270 (Cunningham).\n                                               12\n\fv. Black (2007) 41 Cal.4th 799, 808, fn. omitted.) Trial courts had “broad discretion” to\nimpose the lower or upper term instead of the middle term of imprisonment (People\nv. Scott (1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 349), and generally were required by the statutes and\nsentencing rules to state reasons for their discretionary sentencing choices (ibid.). Such\nreasons had to be “supported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record” and\nreasonably related to the particular sentencing determination. (Ibid.; see former\nCal. Rules of Court, rule 4.420(b).) Even after the DSL was reformed and amended in\nresponse to Cunningham13 so as to eliminate judicial fact finding in selection of the\nappropriate term when three possible prison terms are specified by statute, establishment\nof facts by a preponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect to certain\ndiscretionary sentencing decisions. (See In re Coley (2012) 55 Cal.4th 524, 557-558.)\n       In People v. Sandoval (2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 850-851, the California Supreme\nCourt stated that, in making its discretionary sentencing choices post-Cunningham, “the\ntrial court need only ‘state [its] reasons’ [citation]; it is not required to identify\naggravating and mitigating factors, apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, or\nspecify the ‘ultimate facts’ that ‘justify[ ] the term selected.’ [Citations.] Rather, the\ncourt must ‘state in simple language the primary factor or factors that support the exercise\nof discretion.’ [Citation.]” (Italics added.)\n       The trial court’s ultimate determination when considering a petition for\nresentencing under section 1170.126 is analogous to an evaluation of the relative weight\nof mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Such an evaluation “is not equivalent to a\n\n       13\n           After Cunningham concluded the DSL violated a defendant’s Sixth\nAmendment right to a jury trial (Cunningham, supra, 549 U.S. at p. 281), the Legislature\namended section 1170 so that now “(1) the middle term is no longer the presumptive term\nabsent aggravating or mitigating facts found by the trial judge; and (2) a trial judge has\nthe discretion to impose an upper, middle or lower term based on reasons he or she\nstates.” (People v. Wilson (2008) 164 Cal.App.4th 988, 992.) Subdivision (b) of section\n1170 states the court “shall select the term which, in the court’s discretion, best serves the\ninterests of justice.”\n                                                13\n\ffactual finding.” (People v. Black, supra, 41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) Accordingly, it\nfollows that the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, in\nthat it need not find that resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not, pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means more likely than not].)\n       With this in mind we turn to defendant’s arguments as to why the lower court\nabused its discretion.\n                                         Discussion\n       Defendant argues that the lower court overrode the voters’ intent by denying his\nresentencing petition. He bases this assertion on his belief that the original three strikes\nlaw created a presumption in favor of life sentences and that Proposition 36 has reversed\nthis presumption in favor of a second-strike sentence. He argues that with the Act the\nCalifornia electorate turned the sentencing scheme upside down by creating a strong\npresumption that defendants whose third strike was neither serious nor violent would not\nbe sentenced to life in prison.\n       In essence, defendant argues that sentence reduction under the Act is now the rule\nor the “ ‘norm[.]’ ” As such, he posits that the discretion of the court to refuse sentencing\nis “narrowly proscribed.” He asserts that case law under the old three strikes law now\nstrongly favors recall under Proposition 36 and People v. Superior Court (Romero)\n(1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 (Romero), should inform the construction and application of\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f), but with a crucial and substantial twist—a\ndiametrically opposite presumption now guides the sentencing court’s decision making.\nWe disagree.\n       In Romero, the California Supreme Court held that trial courts retain discretion to\nstrike, in furtherance of justice under section 1385, subdivision (a), prior felony\nconviction allegations in cases brought under the three strikes law. (Romero, supra, at\npp. 529-530.) Subsequently, the court clarified, however, that in deciding whether to do\n                                             14\n\fso, “the court in question must consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances\nof his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the\nparticulars of his background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed\noutside the scheme’s spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he\nhad not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.”\n(People v. Williams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 161.)\n       Since the three strikes law was intended to restrict trial courts’ discretion in\nsentencing repeat offenders, the state high court determined there were “stringent\nstandards” sentencing courts must follow in order to find a defendant should be treated as\nfalling outside the three strikes scheme. (People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at\np. 377.) The court explained: “[T]he three strikes law not only establishes a sentencing\nnorm, it carefully circumscribes the trial court’s power to depart from this norm and\nrequires the court to explicitly justify its decision to do so. In doing so, the law creates a\nstrong presumption that any sentence that conforms to these sentencing norms is both\nrational and proper. [¶] In light of this presumption, a trial court will only abuse its\ndiscretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited circumstances.\nFor example, an abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court was not ‘aware of its\ndiscretion’ to dismiss [citation], or where the court considered impermissible factors in\ndeclining to dismiss [citation]. Moreover, ‘the sentencing norms [established by the\nThree Strikes law may, as a matter of law,] produce[ ] an “arbitrary, capricious or\npatently absurd” result’ under the specific facts of a particular case. [Citation.] [¶] But\n‘[i]t is not enough to show that reasonable people might disagree about whether to strike\none or more’ prior conviction allegations. [Citation.] . . . Because the circumstances\nmust be ‘extraordinary . . . by which a career criminal can be deemed to fall outside the\nspirit of the very scheme within which he squarely falls once he commits a strike as part\nof a long and continuous criminal record, the continuation of which the law was meant to\nattack’ [citation], the circumstances where no reasonable people could disagree that the\n                                              15\n\fcriminal falls outside the spirit of the three strikes scheme must be even more\nextraordinary.” (Id. at p. 378.)\n       As the Fifth District Court of Appeal explained in People v. Blakely (2014) 225\nCal.App.4th 1042, the three strikes law has “been variously stated as being ‘ “to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses” ’ [citation] and ‘to\npromote the state’s compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in punishing\nrecidivism’ [citation]. Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].” (Id. at\np. 1054.) Since public safety remains a key purpose of the law under the Act, we reject\ndefendant’s assertion that a section 1170.126 decision must be subjected to the same\nrigorous scrutiny as the granting of a Romero motion.\n       Furthermore, we reject defendant’s argument that a second strike sentence is now\nthe “norm”; we are not persuaded that it is any such thing. As noted, the language of\nsubdivision (f) of section 1170.126 reads that a petitioner who meets the eligibility\ncriteria “shall be resentenced [as a second-strike offender] unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” It is not unreasonable to read this text to mean that a court\n“shall” impose a second strike sentence unless “at the discretion of the court” the\npetitioner’s original sentence of 25 years to life appears more appropriate because of an\nunreasonable risk of danger to the public. However, it is equally reasonable to read the\ntext to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties (a second strike sentence or\nthe original life sentence) in the exercise of its discretion, with no presumption in favor of\none or the other. “The latter reading accords with common usage. For example, if a\nteacher informed her students that ‘you must take a final exam or, at your discretion,\nwrite a term paper,’ it would be reasonable for the students to believe they were equally\nfree to pursue either option.” (People v. Gutierrez (2014) 58 Cal.4th 1354, 1371.)\n                                              16\n\fThe text of subdivision (f) of section 1170.126 does not plainly indicate that a second\nstrike sentence is the presumptive sentence.\n       In sum, we do not agree with defendant that Proposition 36 creates a presumption\nin favor of a second strike sentence. Such a conclusion comports with the plain language\nof the statute. Moreover, a conclusion resentencing to a second strike term is a generally\nmandatory presumption from which courts can depart only in extraordinary cases, would\nrun directly contrary to the intent of the voters in passing the Act.\n       Defendant argues that because a qualified prisoner already serving a determinate\nterm must surmount the risk assessment determination, but this does not exist for those\ndefendants yet to be sentenced, equal protection principles are violated. Thus, in essence,\ndefendant argues that equal protection requires the application of the same standard for\nrecalled sentences as defendants who are currently being sentenced. We reject his claim.\n       Defendant argues that two sentencing groups are similarly situated for purposes of\nProposition 36. Members of both groups have at least two prior convictions for serious\nand violent felonies as well as a current nonserious, nonviolent offense that would\npreviously have subjected them to a three strikes sentence of 25 years to life.\n       “The concept of equal protection recognizes that persons who are similarly\nsituated with respect to a law’s legitimate purposes must be treated equally. [Citation.]\nAccordingly, ‘ “[t]he first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection\nclause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more\nsimilarly situated groups in an unequal manner.” ’ [Citation.] ‘This initial inquiry is not\nwhether persons are similarly situated for all purposes, but “whether they are similarly\nsituated for purposes of the law challenged.” ’ [Citation.]” (People v. Brown (2012) 54\nCal.4th 314, 328; accord, People v. Wutzke (2002) 28 Cal.4th 923, 943.)\n       Defendant is not merely entering the prison system; rather, he has been confined\nthere for a substantial period of time. Nor is he someone who has completed his sentence\nand now is being subjected to additional confinement. “Instead, [defendant] was\n                                               17\n\fproperly sentenced to prison for an indefinite term because he was properly convicted\n(beyond a reasonable doubt, by a unanimous jury) of a third felony after he had\ncommitted two prior serious or violent felonies. It was his third felony conviction which,\npursuant to the law in effect at the time, subjected him to an indeterminate sentence.\nNow, due to the adoption of the Act, [defendant] may be entitled to a downward\nmodification of this indeterminate term to a determinate second strike sentence. That he\nmay be denied such downward modification due to a finding of dangerousness based on a\npreponderance of the evidence does not mean that he would be subjected to indefinite\nconfinement based on this finding. He is subject to the indeterminate term due to his\noriginal third strike sentence; the dangerousness finding would simply deny him a\ndownward modification. This process does not deny [defendant] his constitutional right\nto equal protection of the law.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1306, fn.omitted.)\n       The rational relationship test has been deemed appropriate to an equal protection\nchallenge such as this one. (People v. Floyd (2003) 31 Cal.4th 179, 187-188, 191; People\nv. Cruz (2012) 207 Cal.App.4th 664, 678-680.) Prisoners are not a suspect class. The\nstatus of being incarcerated is neither an immutable characteristic nor an invidious basis\nof classification. (People v. Cruz, supra, at pp. 675-676, fn. 11.) Under the rational\nrelationship test, “equal protection of the law is denied only where there is no ‘rational\nrelationship between the disparity of treatment and some legitimate governmental\npurpose.’ [Citation.]” (People v. Turnage (2012) 55 Cal.4th 62, 74.)\n       The discretionary public safety exception to second strike sentencing that is\npresent in section 1170.126, is rationally related to a legitimate state interest. “It\nincreases the likelihood that prisoners whose sentences are reduced or who are released\ndue to the Act will not pose an unreasonable risk of danger to the public.” (People v.\nYearwood, supra, 213 Cal.App.4th at p. 179.) Since there is a rational relationship\nbetween the disparate treatment and a legitimate governmental purpose, the distinction\ndrawn between felony offenders sentenced before and after the Act’s effective date does\n                                              18\n\fnot violate defendant’s state or federal equal protection rights. (Floyd, supra, 31 Cal.4th\nat pp. 188-191; see also People v. Cruz, supra, 207 Cal.App.4th at pp. 674-680.)\n         Defendant argues that Proposition 36 creates a mandatory presumption in favor of\na sentence reduction, which the prosecution must rebut by “proving an unreasonable risk\nof violence.” As noted ante, we disagree that Proposition 36 creates a mandatory\npresumption in favor of a sentence reduction. We disagree that the prosecution must\nprove an unreasonable risk of violence.\n         “ ‘In interpreting a voter initiative . . . , we apply the same principles that govern\nstatutory construction. [Citation.]’ [Citation.] ‘ “The fundamental purpose of statutory\nconstruction is to ascertain the intent of the lawmakers so as to effectuate the purpose of\nthe law. [Citations.]” ’ [Citation.]” (People v. Superior Court (Cervantes) (2014) 225\nCal.App.4th 1007, 1014 (Cervantes).) Thus, in the case of a provision adopted by the\nvoters, “their intent governs. [Citations.]” (People v. Jones (1993) 5 Cal.4th 1142,\n1146.)\n         To determine intent, “ ‘we look first to the words themselves. [Citations.]’ ”\n(Cervantes, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1014.) We give the statute’s words “ ‘a plain\nand commonsense meaning. [Citation.] We do not, however, consider the statutory\nlanguage “in isolation.” [Citation.] Rather, we look to “the entire substance of the\nstatute . . . in order to determine the scope and purpose of the provision . . . . [Citation.]”\n[Citation.] That is, we construe the words in question “ ‘in context, keeping in mind the\nnature and obvious purpose of the statute . . . .’ [Citation.]” [Citation.] We must\nharmonize “the various parts of a statutory enactment . . . by considering the particular\nclause or section in the context of the statutory framework as a whole.” [Citations.]’\n[Citation.]” (People v. Acosta (2002) 29 Cal.4th 105, 112.) We “[accord] significance, if\npossible, to every word, phrase and sentence in pursuance of the legislative purpose.\nA construction making some words surplusage is to be avoided.” (Dyna-Med, Inc. v.\nFair Employment & Housing Com. (1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387.) “[S]tatutes or\n                                                19\n\fstatutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and\nwith each other, to the extent possible. [Citations.]” (Ibid.)\n       Although one purpose of the Act was to save taxpayer dollars (People v. Osuna\n(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1037), “[i]t is clear the electorate’s intent was not to throw\nopen the prison doors to all third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for\nserious or violent felonies, but only to those who were perceived as nondangerous or\nposing little or no risk to the public.” (Id. at p. 1038, second italics added.)\n       The Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes law. That law, as originally\nenacted by the Legislature, was described by one of our sister courts as follows: “Under\nthe three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for their current offense but for\ntheir recidivism. Recidivism in the commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to\nsociety justifying the imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.]\nThe primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘. . . to deter repeat offenders and, at some\npoint in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses serious enough to be\npunished as felonies, to segregate that person from the rest of society for an extended\nperiod of time. This segregation and its duration are based not merely on that person’s\nmost recent offense but also on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of\ntime during which he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\ndividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will be deemed to\nhave demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount of time that the recidivist\nwill be isolated from society are matters largely within the discretion of the punishing\njurisdiction.’ [Citation.] [¶] By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature\nacknowledged the will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\nincapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate punishment for crimes.\nFurther, those goals were best achieved by ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater\npunishment’ for second and third ‘strikers.’ ” (People v. Cooper(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th\n815, 823-824.)\n                                              20\n\f       A few months before the November 6, 2012, election, the California Supreme\nCourt observed: “One aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is\nthat the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when . . . a\ndefendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies]\nis convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of\nany offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor. [Citations.]” (In re Coley, supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.)\n       Although the ballot materials concerning Proposition 36 focused on violent\ncriminals, section 7 of the Act provides: This act is an exercise of the public power of the\npeople of the State of California for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the\npeople of the State of California, and shall be liberally construed to effectuate those\npurposes. To condition resentencing denials upon the likelihood of future violence would\nrun contrary to the language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) and voters’ intent, and\nwould not effectuate the purposes of the Act. Nowhere, however, do the ballot materials\nfor the Act suggest voters intended essentially to open the prison doors to existing third\nstrike offenders in all but the most egregious cases, as would be the result if the definition\nof “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” were read to mean a court must find that\nthe petitioner poses an unreasonable risk of committing another violent crime. The Act\nwas added by the initiative process. Ballot pamphlet arguments have been recognized as\na proper extrinsic aid in construing voter initiatives adopted by popular vote. (People v.\nFloyd, supra, 31 Cal.4th at pp. 187-188.)\n       In sum, had voters intended to require a finding of an “unreasonable risk of\nviolence,” they would have said so in subdivision (f) of section 1170.126. Furthermore,\nthey would not have afforded the court the power to consider any evidence it determined\nto be relevant to the issue as they did in subdivision (g)(3) of section 1170.126. That a\ncrime (or criminal) can constitute a danger to public safety without being violent is too\n                                             21\n\fobvious to dispute. (See, e.g., People v. Hughes (2002) 27 Cal.4th 287, 355; People v.\nVillalobos (2006) 145 Cal.App.4th 310, 317.)\n       Finally, defendant argues that he has a right to a jury trial under the United States\nConstitution’s Sixth Amendment and a finding of dangerousness beyond a reasonable\ndoubt on downward resentencing. We disagree.\n       The United States Supreme Court has clarified that its opinions regarding a\ndefendant’s Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a\nreasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward sentence modifications. (Dillon v.\nUnited States (2010) 560 U.S. 817, 828 [taking the original sentence as given, any facts\nfound by a judge at a modification proceeding do not serve to increase the prescribed\nrange of punishment].) California appellate courts have applied this principle to petitions\nfor resentencing under Proposition 36 and more specifically to determinations of\neligibility for resentencing: “Apprendi and its progeny do not apply to a determination of\neligibility for resentencing under the Act.” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1039.)\n       Contrary to defendant’s argument, nothing in Alleyne v. United States (2013) 570\nU.S. __ [133 S.Ct. 2151] supports his views. As described by our Supreme Court, in\nAlleyne “the United States Supreme Court held that the federal Constitution’s Sixth\nAmendment entitles a defendant to a jury trial, with a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt\nstandard of proof, as to ‘any fact that increases the mandatory minimum’ sentence for a\ncrime.” (People v. Nunez & Satele (2013) 57 Cal.4th 1, 39, fn. 6.) The denial of a recall\npetition does not increase the mandatory minimum sentence for a defendant’s crime.\n       As the court explained in Kaulick, “[t]he retrospective part of the Act is not\nconstitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate. It does not\nprovide for wholesale resentencing of eligible petitioners. Instead, it provides for a\nproceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward. Any facts found at\nsuch a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues.\n                                              22\n\fThus, there is no constitutional requirement that the facts be established beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1304-1305.)\n       Simply put, a denial of an inmate’s petition does not increase the penalty to which\nthat inmate is already subject, but instead removes the inmate from the scope of an act of\nlenity on the part of the electorate to which he or she is not constitutionally entitled. That\nthe denial is based on a determination of dangerousness does not change that conclusion.\n       With all the foregoing in mind, we conclude that defendant has not met his burden\non appeal of establishing that the trial court’s ruling exceeds the bounds of reason. Thus,\nwe find no abuse of discretion.\n       The lower court found that defendant poses an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety because of the likelihood that he will continue to commit acts of indecent\nexposure. The court based this finding on defendant’s 20-year history of committing\nthese acts, some of which occurred while defendant was incarcerated. Defendant’s prison\nrecord is replete with rules violations for masturbation and indecent exposure, threats to\nkill other inmates, refusing to follow rules, and mutual combat. This record shows that\nthere has been no progress toward rehabilitation. Speculation that defendant could be\nhelped with therapy and proper oversight does not outweigh the People’s evidence that\neven while incarcerated defendant cannot and has not followed the rules.\n       It is quite apparent that the trial court was aware it was required to find defendant\ncurrently posed an unreasonable risk to public safety. The trial court’s ruling conveyed\nreasoning that established a nexus between the evidence before it and current\ndangerousness. The trial court’s ruling here was more than adequate for meaningful\nappellate review, and “the application of reasoned analysis” is apparent from its ruling.\n(In re Young (2012) 204 Cal.App.4th 288, 306.) Moreover, the court did not merely rely\non long-ago crimes, although defendant’s criminal record, which is extensive, certainly\nfigured into its determination. As the People point out, life outside of prison walls\nrequires a measure of self-control that defendant has never demonstrated he possesses\n                                             23\n\feither in or out of prison. The fact that defendant is now older and his crimes for robbery\nremote in time weighs in favor of defendant only if since those crimes were committed he\nhas been crime-free, in a cleansing period of rehabilitation after he has had the\nopportunity to reflect upon the error of his ways.

The court found true allegations that\ndefendant had suffered five prior felony convictions or strikes within the meaning of\nsections 667, subdivisions (b) through (i) and 1170.12 and had served two prison terms\nwithin the meaning of section 667 subdivision (b). The lower court denied defendant’s\nmotion to strike his prior conviction allegations and sentenced defendant to 25 years to\nlife in prison plus a two-year consecutive term.7\n       According to the transcript of the sentencing hearing, defendant’s five prior\nconvictions were for five robberies.\n       As to the facts underlying defendant’s crime of indecent exposure, we explained\nthat defendant exposed himself to three young girls by a closed restroom at Arbuckle\nElementary School. Defendant motioned for the girls to come to him; he was fully\nclothed except his penis was sticking out of his pants. Defendant’s hands were on his\npenis and he was moving them up and down. Defendant lived one-half mile from the\nschool. After his arrest he told the police that he was familiar with the school and that if\nhe had exposed himself it was because he was drunk or high on drugs. He admitted that\nhe had been using alcohol and cocaine for a while before the offense and that alcohol and\ncocaine increased his sex drive and caused him to do “stupid stuff.”\n       We noted that in 1993, defendant had been convicted of two misdemeanor counts\nof annoying or molesting a child under the age of 18 and in 1994 was convicted of a\n\n\n\n       6\n         We have taken judicial notice of (People v. Williams (May 7, 2002, H021986)\n[nonpub. opn.]).\n       7\n         The court imposed the two-year term for the two prior prison terms he had\nserved (§ 667.5, subd. (b)).\n                                              3\n\ffelony count of annoying or molesting a child and a misdemeanor count of indecent\nexposure.8\n                                    Proceedings Below\n        On September 23, 2013, counsel for defendant filed a motion to grant defendant’s\npetition on the basis of eligibility alone—that is without a risk assessment hearing9—or in\nthe alternative to order a jury trial on the issue of dangerousness. On the same date,\ndefendant’s counsel asked the court to make in limine rulings regarding the procedural\nrules for the section 1170.126 hearing. Counsel argued that the proceeding should be an\nevidentiary hearing, as opposed to a sentencing hearing, in which the state has the burden\nof proving that defendant was not entitled to relief for which he was statutorily eligible\nand the rules of evidence should apply.\n        On October 11, 2013, the People filed their opposition to defendant’s motion for a\njury trial.\n        On October 18, 2013, the court held a hearing to address defendant’s motions.\nThe court denied both defendant’s motion for a jury trial and his motion for resentencing\nwithout a risk assessment hearing. The court determined that the rules of evidence do not\napply at a section 1170.126 hearing.\n        On October 30, 2013, the People filed their opposition to defendant’s request for\nresentencing. Attached to the opposition as exhibits were police records and the\nprobation officer’s report in defendant’s indecent exposure case, the transcript of the\nsentencing hearing at which the court imposed a 25-year-to-life sentence, this court’s\nunpublished opinion on appeal, a report documenting Dr. Vicky Campagna’s assessment\nof defendant as a result of interviews of defendant that were conducted in 1999, police\n\n\n        8\n         It was the previous violation of section 314 that elevated defendant’s crime to a\nfelony. (§ 314)\n       9\n         Defendant’s counsel relied on equal protection principles to argue that defendant\ncould not be subjected to the dangerousness evaluation.\n                                             4\n\freports documenting the facts underlying defendant’s crimes in 1993 for indecent\nexposure and child molestation, the probation officer’s report in that case, police reports\ndocumenting other indecent exposures by defendant, the probation officer’s report in\ndefendant’s grand theft and robbery case, and defendant’s prison file, which fills almost\ntwo volumes of the clerk’s transcript.\n       Defendant filed a response to the People’s opposition on February 5, 2014.\n       On February 7, 2014, the court conducted a hearing to determine whether\ndefendant’s petition for resentencing should be granted.10 The court indicated that the\nPeople had the burden of proof at the hearing. The court noted that defendant’s previous\nmotions requesting a jury trial and asking that the rules of evidence apply and that\ndefendant’s prison file or C file be excluded from evidence were preserved for appellate\nreview.\n       The People took the position that resentencing defendant would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to the community, “in particular young children, young\nfemales, and older female adults.” The People posited that “[i]f past conduct is a\npredictor of future conduct, releasing the defendant . . . would pose an unreasonable risk\nto the community. There was nothing . . . in the prison records or even in the defendant’s\nbrief to suggest that he is remorseful, that he has accepted responsibility for his conduct\nand that he was going to be willing or able to change his ways.”\n       The court noted that the People’s opposition to defendant’s request for\nresentencing had 11 exhibits attached; the court indicated that it was going to receive all\nthe exhibits into evidence over the objection of defendant’s counsel. The court admitted\na letter written by one of the victims from defendant’s most recent indecent exposure\ncase, again over counsel’s objection.\n\n       10\n           Defendant was not present in the courtroom; rather, through counsel he asked\nthe court if he could stay in the holding cell and listen to the proceedings via an audio\nsystem.\n                                              5\n\f         The People pointed out that defendant’s criminal history showed he was out of\ncustody for only a few months after his first conviction for indecent exposure and\nannoying or molesting a child before he committed another indecent exposure; and after\nhe was discharged from that prison commitment he committed another indecent\nexposure.\n         The People argued that there were no “rehabilitative efforts” in the prison records\nor in defendant’s briefs to suggest that defendant had changed. Further, defendant’s\nprison record showed that there had been “seven incidents of violence or threatened\nviolence.” The People noted, “there’s no demonstrated effort to comply with any work\norders that may have been done in prison to participate in any programming to\ndemonstrate that . . . he’s different from the person that Judge Fernandez sentenced in\n2000.”\n         Defendant’s counsel countered that defendant was “different. He is 52 years old\nnow. He’s very different. And more importantly perhaps is that the law is different.”\nDefendant’s counsel pointed out that defendant’s strikes were over 25 years old and were\n“[t]he most basic low level purse snatching you could . . . imagine” where defendant\n“rode up on a bike and steals a purse off the arm of a woman that was walking on the\nsidewalk.” Counsel went on to argue that defendant’s robberies all occurred within a\nthree-month period and “his RAP sheet is devoid of violence.”\n         As to defendant’s prison record, his counsel argued that although defendant had\n37 disciplinary infractions, he did not have “the most egregious prison record.” Counsel\nconceded that defendant had continued to expose himself in prison, and had engaged in\nfour mutual combat fights, but pointed out that all of his disciplinary infractions had to do\nwith his fear of having a cellmate.\n         The court told defendant’s counsel that what the court was most interested in was\ndefendant’s “apparent propensity to commit acts of indecent exposure.” In essence,\ndefendant’s counsel argued that because of his age defendant was less likely to reoffend\n                                               6\n\fand had not received the treatment in prison that he needed, but would be able to receive\nsuch treatment if he was released.\n       The court asked defendant’s counsel whether she was suggesting that if upon\nrelease defendant committed an indecent exposure, that would not constitute a risk of\ndanger to the public safety. Defendant’s counsel conceded that any crime is dangerous to\npublic safety; she believed, however, that the court had to consider whether “there is an\nincrease in risk of violence.”\n       The court indicated that it would recess to consider counsels’ presentations. After\nthe recess, the court ruled as follows: “First, the Court recognizes that the People have\nthe burden of proof and that the defendant is entitled to resentencing unless the People\npresent evidence that satisfies by a preponderance of the evidence the Court that a finding\nin its discretion that the defendant poses an unreasonable risk to public safety currently\nshould preclude him from entitlement to resentencing under our current law. [¶] The\nCourt believes first that with respect to the evidence before the Court, it is more likely\nthan not that the defendant poses a risk to public safety. The Court believes that the\ndefendant particularly poses a risk of committing additional acts of indecent exposure in\nviolation of Penal Code Section 314 if he were to be released from custody and even if he\nwere to continue to remain in custody. [¶] The Court believes that the evidence before it\nindicating a more than 20 year history of committing acts of indecent exposure an Axis I\ndiagnosis of exhibitionism, the relative recency of the commission of an act of indecent\nexposure while in custody, all lead the Court to believe that there is a risk that the\ndefendant will continue to commit such acts. The Court believes that a violation of Penal\nCode section 314 in an active indecent exposure is a crime that places public safety at\nrisk. Even in the abstract, particularly for a defendant[,] however[,] who has a prior\nconviction and the defendant has more than one, and is therefore, subject to a felony\nprosecution and is committing acts that the [L]egislature has deemed to be felonious.\n[¶] Penal Code Section 314 not only impacts the community and the victims of its\n                                              7\n\fcommission [sic] because of the emotional harm that it can cause to a victim of a\nviolation of Penal Code Section 314, but also to the disturbances it causes within our\ncommunity. The fear that a violation of Penal Code Section 314 instills in the\ncommunity when it is committed, the fear of victimization, the fear of sexual assault, the\nfear of child molest, all of this has caused the [L]egislature to deem a violation of Penal\nCode section 314 to be criminal, to be felonious if committed when there is a prior\nconviction or under other circumstances to be subject to sex offender registration. For all\nthese reasons the Court has no question that a violation of Penal Code section 314 is a\npublic safety concern. [¶] With respect to this particular defendant, . . . he has particular\ncharacteristics with respect to his commission of acts of Penal Code Section 314. His\nacts have been acts not simply of exposure, but have also included engaging in\nmasturbation, which is not necessary for violation of Penal Code Section 314, the\ndefendant’s history includes the victimization of children, has included performance of\nsuch acts in and around school grounds, and has continued despite his incarceration with\nthe evidence before the Court of 17 violations within the State Prison of acts amounting\nto or similar to violations of Penal Code Section 314.”\n       The court continued, “Based on the defendant’s repeated conduct, the extensive\npattern of conduct, his commission of additional acts of [indecent exposure] while\nincarcerated, his diagnosis of exhibitionism and the lack of persuasive evidence . . . that\nthere has been any particular progress toward a rehabilitation, the Court . . . believes that\nthe evidence . . . establishes that it is more likely than not that the defendant poses an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety, and that if he were to be resentenced and\nreleased, the high likelihood that he would continue to commit [indecent exposures] is so\ngreat that to ignore that risk would be unreasonable.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\f       The court discounted the argument by defendant’s counsel that defendant’s\nexhibitionism had decreased and would continue to decrease because of his age.11 The\ncourt stated that the “defendant’s likelihood of recidivism with respect to indecent\nexposure may be minimized given his age and the reference to the diagnostic and\nstatistics manual that has a very brief statement indicating that advanced or increasing\nage may suggest a decrease in incidents of indecent exposure for a person who has been\ndiagnosed with exhibitionism.” The court stated that it did not believe this to be\n“concrete scientific evidence.”\n       The court based its ruling “primarily” on the defendant’s propensity to commit\nacts of indecent exposure; however, the court stated that it could not ignore or discount\ndefendant’s strike priors and evidence “presented within the prison records of some acts\nof physical violence” by defendant while in prison. The court indicated that this evidence\nalone “would [not] necessarily form the basis of a denial” of resentencing, but that the\ncourt “does take it into consideration as part of the totality of the circumstances that the\nCourt must consider.”\n       Accordingly, as noted, the court found that defendant poses an unreasonable risk\nof danger to public safety and denied his petition for resentencing.\n                                  Applicable Legal Principles\n       In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second-strike offender under the Act,\nthe inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of\nsection 1170.126. “An inmate is eligible for resentencing if: [¶] (1) The inmate is\nserving an indeterminate term of life imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (e) of Section 667 or subdivision (c) of Section 1170.12 for a conviction of a\nfelony or felonies that are not defined as serious and/or violent felonies by subdivision (c)\n\n       11\n          In her response to the People’s opposition to resentencing, defendant’s counsel\nwrote that the “DSM” notes that “few arrests are made in the older age groups, which\nmay suggest that [exhibitionism] becomes less severe after age 40.”\n                                              9\n\fof Section 667.5 or subdivision (c) of Section 1192.7.

[¶] (3) The inmate has no prior convictions for any of the offenses\nappearing in clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of\nSection 667 or clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of\nSection 1170.12.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (e).)\n       If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she “shall be\nresentenced [as a second-strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines\nthat resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public\nsafety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising this discretion, “the court may consider:\n[¶] (1) The [inmate’s] criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes\ncommitted, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and\nthe remoteness of the crimes; [¶] (2) The [inmate’s] disciplinary record and record of\nrehabilitation while incarcerated; and [¶] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its\ndiscretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in\nan unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.” (§ 1170.126, subd. (g).)\n       The plain language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126 calls for an\nexercise of the sentencing court’s discretion. “ ‘Discretion is the power to make the\ndecision, one way or the other.’ [Citation.]” (People v.

The statute\ndoes not say the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing\nwould pose such a risk.\n       Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126, we\nconclude that the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the\nevidence, facts from which a determination that resentencing the petitioner would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety can be made. The reasons that a trial court\nfinds resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, and the court’s weighing\nof evidence showing dangerousness versus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the\ncourt’s discretion. The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be\nsupported by facts established by a preponderance of the evidence, the trial court need\nnot itself find an unreasonable risk of danger by a preponderance of the evidence.

(Id. at pp. 1301-1302.) As a result, it had no real occasion to address\nthe interplay between the burden of proof and the trial court’s exercise of discretion, or to\nclarify whether the prosecution is required to establish “dangerousness” in the sense of\nfacts upon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination that resentencing a\npetitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of\n                                             11\n\festablishing that determination itself.

Nor is the court’s\nultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review.

Even after the DSL was reformed and amended in\nresponse to Cunningham13 so as to eliminate judicial fact finding in selection of the\nappropriate term when three possible prison terms are specified by statute, establishment\nof facts by a preponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect to certain\ndiscretionary sentencing decisions.

Accordingly, it\nfollows that the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, in\nthat it need not find that resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not, pose an\nunreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means more likely than not].)\n       With this in mind we turn to defendant’s arguments as to why the lower court\nabused its discretion.\n                                         Discussion\n       Defendant argues that the lower court overrode the voters’ intent by denying his\nresentencing petition. He bases this assertion on his belief that the original three strikes\nlaw created a presumption in favor of life sentences and that Proposition 36 has reversed\nthis presumption in favor of a second-strike sentence. He argues that with the Act the\nCalifornia electorate turned the sentencing scheme upside down by creating a strong\npresumption that defendants whose third strike was neither serious nor violent would not\nbe sentenced to life in prison.\n       In essence, defendant argues that sentence reduction under the Act is now the rule\nor the “ ‘norm[.]’ ” As such, he posits that the discretion of the court to refuse sentencing\nis “narrowly proscribed.” He asserts that case law under the old three strikes law now\nstrongly favors recall under Proposition 36 and People v. Superior Court (Romero)\n(1996) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1135929\"><a href=\"/opinion/1135929/people-v-superior-court-romero/\"><span class=\"volume\">13</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Romero), should inform the construction and application of\nsection 1170.126, subdivision (f), but with a crucial and substantial twist—a\ndiametrically opposite presumption now guides the sentencing court’s decision making.\nWe disagree.\n       In Romero, the California Supreme Court held that trial courts retain discretion to\nstrike, in furtherance of justice under section 1385, subdivision (a), prior felony\nconviction allegations in cases brought under the three strikes law. (Romero, supra, at\npp. 529-530.) Subsequently, the court clarified, however, that in deciding whether to do\n                                             14\n\fso, “the court in question must consider whether, in light of the nature and circumstances\nof his present felonies and prior serious and/or violent felony convictions, and the\nparticulars of his background, character, and prospects, the defendant may be deemed\noutside the scheme’s spirit, in whole or in part, and hence should be treated as though he\nhad not previously been convicted of one or more serious and/or violent felonies.”\n(People v. Williams, supra, 17 Cal.4th at p. 161.)\n       Since the three strikes law was intended to restrict trial courts’ discretion in\nsentencing repeat offenders, the state high court determined there were “stringent\nstandards” sentencing courts must follow in order to find a defendant should be treated as\nfalling outside the three strikes scheme. (People v. Carmony, supra, 33 Cal.4th at\np. 377.) The court explained: “[T]he three strikes law not only establishes a sentencing\nnorm, it carefully circumscribes the trial court’s power to depart from this norm and\nrequires the court to explicitly justify its decision to do so. In doing so, the law creates a\nstrong presumption that any sentence that conforms to these sentencing norms is both\nrational and proper. [¶] In light of this presumption, a trial court will only abuse its\ndiscretion in failing to strike a prior felony conviction allegation in limited circumstances.\nFor example, an abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court was not ‘aware of its\ndiscretion’ to dismiss [citation], or where the court considered impermissible factors in\ndeclining to dismiss [citation]. Moreover, ‘the sentencing norms [established by the\nThree Strikes law may, as a matter of law,] produce[ ] an “arbitrary, capricious or\npatently absurd” result’ under the specific facts of a particular case. [Citation.] [¶] But\n‘[i]t is not enough to show that reasonable people might disagree about whether to strike\none or more’ prior conviction allegations. [Citation.] . . . Because the circumstances\nmust be ‘extraordinary . . . by which a career criminal can be deemed to fall outside the\nspirit of the very scheme within which he squarely falls once he commits a strike as part\nof a long and continuous criminal record, the continuation of which the law was meant to\nattack’ [citation], the circumstances where no reasonable people could disagree that the\n                                              15\n\fcriminal falls outside the spirit of the three strikes scheme must be even more\nextraordinary.” (Id. at p. 378.)\n       As the Fifth District Court of Appeal explained in People v. Blakely (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1042</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, the three strikes law has “been variously stated as being ‘ “to ensure\nlonger prison sentences and greater punishment for those who commit a felony and have\nbeen previously convicted of serious and/or violent felony offenses” ’ [citation] and ‘to\npromote the state’s compelling interest in the protection of public safety and in punishing\nrecidivism’ [citation]. Although the Act ‘diluted’ the three strikes law somewhat\n[citation], ‘[e]nhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act’ [citation].” (Id. at\np. 1054.) Since public safety remains a key purpose of the law under the Act, we reject\ndefendant’s assertion that a section 1170.126 decision must be subjected to the same\nrigorous scrutiny as the granting of a Romero motion.\n       Furthermore, we reject defendant’s argument that a second strike sentence is now\nthe “norm”; we are not persuaded that it is any such thing. As noted, the language of\nsubdivision (f) of section 1170.126 reads that a petitioner who meets the eligibility\ncriteria “shall be resentenced [as a second-strike offender] unless the court, in its\ndiscretion, determines that resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of\ndanger to public safety.” It is not unreasonable to read this text to mean that a court\n“shall” impose a second strike sentence unless “at the discretion of the court” the\npetitioner’s original sentence of 25 years to life appears more appropriate because of an\nunreasonable risk of danger to the public. However, it is equally reasonable to read the\ntext to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties (a second strike sentence or\nthe original life sentence) in the exercise of its discretion, with no presumption in favor of\none or the other. “The latter reading accords with common usage. For example, if a\nteacher informed her students that ‘you must take a final exam or, at your discretion,\nwrite a term paper,’ it would be reasonable for the students to believe they were equally\nfree to pursue either option.” (People v.

Such a conclusion comports with the plain language\nof the statute. Moreover, a conclusion resentencing to a second strike term is a generally\nmandatory presumption from which courts can depart only in extraordinary cases, would\nrun directly contrary to the intent of the voters in passing the Act.\n       Defendant argues that because a qualified prisoner already serving a determinate\nterm must surmount the risk assessment determination, but this does not exist for those\ndefendants yet to be sentenced, equal protection principles are violated. Thus, in essence,\ndefendant argues that equal protection requires the application of the same standard for\nrecalled sentences as defendants who are currently being sentenced. We reject his claim.\n       Defendant argues that two sentencing groups are similarly situated for purposes of\nProposition 36. Members of both groups have at least two prior convictions for serious\nand violent felonies as well as a current nonserious, nonviolent offense that would\npreviously have subjected them to a three strikes sentence of 25 years to life.\n       “The concept of equal protection recognizes that persons who are similarly\nsituated with respect to a law’s legitimate purposes must be treated equally. [Citation.]\nAccordingly, ‘ “[t]he first prerequisite to a meritorious claim under the equal protection\nclause is a showing that the state has adopted a classification that affects two or more\nsimilarly situated groups in an unequal manner.” ’ [Citation.] ‘This initial inquiry is not\nwhether persons are similarly situated for all purposes, but “whether they are similarly\nsituated for purposes of the law challenged.” ’ [Citation.]” (People v.

It was his third felony conviction which,\npursuant to the law in effect at the time, subjected him to an indeterminate sentence.\nNow, due to the adoption of the Act, [defendant] may be entitled to a downward\nmodification of this indeterminate term to a determinate second strike sentence. That he\nmay be denied such downward modification due to a finding of dangerousness based on a\npreponderance of the evidence does not mean that he would be subjected to indefinite\nconfinement based on this finding. He is subject to the indeterminate term due to his\noriginal third strike sentence; the dangerousness finding would simply deny him a\ndownward modification. This process does not deny [defendant] his constitutional right\nto equal protection of the law.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1306, fn.omitted.)\n       The rational relationship test has been deemed appropriate to an equal protection\nchallenge such as this one.

Since there is a rational relationship\nbetween the disparate treatment and a legitimate governmental purpose, the distinction\ndrawn between felony offenders sentenced before and after the Act’s effective date does\n                                              18\n\fnot violate defendant’s state or federal equal protection rights.

That law, as originally\nenacted by the Legislature, was described by one of our sister courts as follows: “Under\nthe three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for their current offense but for\ntheir recidivism. Recidivism in the commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to\nsociety justifying the imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.]\nThe primary goals of recidivist statutes are: ‘. . . to deter repeat offenders and, at some\npoint in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses serious enough to be\npunished as felonies, to segregate that person from the rest of society for an extended\nperiod of time. This segregation and its duration are based not merely on that person’s\nmost recent offense but also on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of\ntime during which he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line\ndividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will be deemed to\nhave demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount of time that the recidivist\nwill be isolated from society are matters largely within the discretion of the punishing\njurisdiction.’ [Citation.] [¶] By enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature\nacknowledged the will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and\nincapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate punishment for crimes.\nFurther, those goals were best achieved by ensuring ‘longer prison sentences and greater\npunishment’ for second and third ‘strikers.’ ” (People v.

This is so even when the\ncurrent, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as\nrelatively minor.

To condition resentencing denials upon the likelihood of future violence would\nrun contrary to the language of section 1170.126, subdivision (f) and voters’ intent, and\nwould not effectuate the purposes of the Act. Nowhere, however, do the ballot materials\nfor the Act suggest voters intended essentially to open the prison doors to existing third\nstrike offenders in all but the most egregious cases, as would be the result if the definition\nof “unreasonable risk of danger to public safety” were read to mean a court must find that\nthe petitioner poses an unreasonable risk of committing another violent crime. The Act\nwas added by the initiative process. Ballot pamphlet arguments have been recognized as\na proper extrinsic aid in construing voter initiatives adopted by popular vote.

App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 317.)\n       Finally, defendant argues that he has a right to a jury trial under the United States\nConstitution’s Sixth Amendment and a finding of dangerousness beyond a reasonable\ndoubt on downward resentencing. We disagree.\n       The United States Supreme Court has clarified that its opinions regarding a\ndefendant’s Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a\nreasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward sentence modifications. (Dillon v.\nUnited States (2010) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"148795\"><a href=\"/opinion/148795/dillon-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">817</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828 [taking the original sentence as given, any facts\nfound by a judge at a modification proceeding do not serve to increase the prescribed\nrange of punishment].) California appellate courts have applied this principle to petitions\nfor resentencing under Proposition 36 and more specifically to determinations of\neligibility for resentencing: “Apprendi and its progeny do not apply to a determination of\neligibility for resentencing under the Act.” (People v. Osuna, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at\np. 1039.)\n       Contrary to defendant’s argument, nothing in Alleyne v. United States (2013) 570\nU.S. __ [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"903985\"><a href=\"/opinion/903985/alleyne-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">] supports his views. As described by our Supreme Court, in\nAlleyne “the United States Supreme Court held that the federal Constitution’s Sixth\nAmendment entitles a defendant to a jury trial, with a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt\nstandard of proof, as to ‘any fact that increases the mandatory minimum’ sentence for a\ncrime.” (People v. Nunez & Satele (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39, fn. 6.) The denial of a recall\npetition does not increase the mandatory minimum sentence for a defendant’s crime.\n       As the court explained in Kaulick, “[t]he retrospective part of the Act is not\nconstitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate. It does not\nprovide for wholesale resentencing of eligible petitioners. Instead, it provides for a\nproceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward. Any facts found at\nsuch a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues.\n                                              22\n\fThus, there is no constitutional requirement that the facts be established beyond a\nreasonable doubt.” (Kaulick, supra, 215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1304-1305.)\n       Simply put, a denial of an inmate’s petition does not increase the penalty to which\nthat inmate is already subject, but instead removes the inmate from the scope of an act of\nlenity on the part of the electorate to which he or she is not constitutionally entitled. That\nthe denial is based on a determination of dangerousness does not change that conclusion.\n       With all the foregoing in mind, we conclude that defendant has not met his burden\non appeal of establishing that the trial court’s ruling exceeds the bounds of reason. Thus,\nwe find no abuse of discretion.\n       The lower court found that defendant poses an unreasonable risk of danger to\npublic safety because of the likelihood that he will continue to commit acts of indecent\nexposure. The court based this finding on defendant’s 20-year history of committing\nthese acts, some of which occurred while defendant was incarcerated. Defendant’s prison\nrecord is replete with rules violations for masturbation and indecent exposure, threats to\nkill other inmates, refusing to follow rules, and mutual combat. This record shows that\nthere has been no progress toward rehabilitation. Speculation that defendant could be\nhelped with therapy and proper oversight does not outweigh the People’s evidence that\neven while incarcerated defendant cannot and has not followed the rules.\n       It is quite apparent that the trial court was aware it was required to find defendant\ncurrently posed an unreasonable risk to public safety. The trial court’s ruling conveyed\nreasoning that established a nexus between the evidence before it and current\ndangerousness. The trial court’s ruling here was more than adequate for meaningful\nappellate review, and “the application of reasoned analysis” is apparent from its ruling.\n(In re Young (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 306.) Moreover, the court did not merely rely\non long-ago crimes, although defendant’s criminal record, which is extensive, certainly\nfigured into its determination. As the People point out, life outside of prison walls\nrequires a measure of self-control that defendant has never demonstrated he possesses\n                                             23\n\feither in or out of prison. The fact that defendant is now older and his crimes for robbery\nremote in time weighs in favor of defendant only if since those crimes were committed he\nhas been crime-free, in a cleansing period of rehabilitation after he has had the\nopportunity to reflect upon the error of his ways. Defendant has done no such thing.\n       Since the trial court considered the statutory factors in section 1170.126,\nsubdivision (g) in exercising its discretion (trial court may consider petitioner’s criminal\nconviction history and the petitioner’s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation\nwhile incarcerated) and made a reasoned argument as to why the evidence did not support\nresentencing defendant, we must uphold the decision even if we might have exercised our\ndiscretion differently.\n       We reiterate that “[w]here, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in\nthe trial court, its exercise of that discretion ‘must not be disturbed on appeal except on a\nshowing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently\nabsurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]’\n[Citation.]” (People v. Rodrigues, supra, 8 Cal.4th at pp. 1124-1125, italics omitted.)\nWe cannot say that the lower court’s decision was arbitrary, capricious, or patently\nabsurd.\n                                         Disposition\n       The order denying defendant’s petition to recall his sentence (§ 1170.126) is\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                             24\n\f                                  _________________________________\n                                  ELIA, J.\n\n\nWE CONCUR:\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\nRUSHING, P.
