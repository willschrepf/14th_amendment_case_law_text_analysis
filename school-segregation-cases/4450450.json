In the\n\ncase of TCEQ, these are the regulations and statutes that are designed to protect\n\nour health and our environment.       Maintaining these safeguards as they were\n\nintended is important to the preserve Texans’ heath and natural resources. The\n\ndecisional process regarding these important issues would be significantly aided by\n\noral argument. Oral argument will bring clarity to the written arguments presented\n\nby the briefs and appreciably aid the Court in its consideration of the issues and in\n\ndetermining the correct result.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                               ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nI.    Issue 1\n\n      An agency is required to follow the clear, unambiguous language of its own\n\nregulations. TCEQ Rule 330.7(a) generally requires a permit for Municipal Solid\n\nWaste (“MSW”) facilities, but there are specific exceptions. Rule 330.9(b)(3)\n\nallows transfer stations that transfer 125 tons of municipal solid waste per day or\n\nless to qualify for registration, rather than requiring a permit. Rule 330.9(f) allows\n\ntransfer stations that include materials recovery operations to qualify for\n\nregistration, but only if certain requirements set forth in the rule are met. TCEQ\n\nissued a registration to a transfer station that includes a materials recovery facility,\n\nbut the facility does not meet the requirements of Rule 330.9(f). Did the trial court\n\nerr in its judgment upholding this registration when TCEQ failed to follow the\n\nclear, unambiguous language of its regulations?\n\nII.   Issue 2\n\n      TCEQ rules and the Solid Waste Act generally require a permit for an MSW\n\nfacility. The permitting process provides affected persons the opportunity for\n\nhearing.   On the other hand, the registration process does not provide an\n\nopportunity for hearing.     Plaintiffs assert that TCEQ acted in violation of its\n\npermitting requirement by utilizing a registration to authorize this Facility. Under\n\nthe permitting requirements, Plaintiffs would have had a statutory right to a hearing\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\fas affected persons. Did the trial court err in its judgment denying all claims that\n\ndue process rights were violated when there was no opportunity for hearing on this\n\nregistration authorization?\n\nIII.   Issue 3\n\n       The TCEQ publicly pronounced its policy regarding technical notices of\n\ndeficiency (NODs) in letters to the regulated entities, instructions to its staff\n\nmembers, communications with the public, and representations to the Texas\n\nlegislature. TCEQ’s stated policy is to allow no more than two (2) NODs before\n\nreturning an MSW registration application. In this case, TCEQ allowed six (6)\n\nNODs and two (2) extensions of time, which is far more than the two (2) NOD\n\nlimit. Did the trial court err in its judgment upholding this registration when more\n\nthan two (2) NODs were issued?\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f                           STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n\n       A.     Statutory and Regulatory Framework\n\n       The Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act (the “Act”) was enacted “to safeguard\n\nthe health, welfare, and physical property of the people and to protect the\n\nenvironment by controlling the management of solid waste.”17 The Act authorizes\n\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) to issue permits\n\ngoverning the construction, operation, and maintenance of solid waste facilities.18\n\nThe Act generally requires that a person apply for and obtain a separate permit for\n\neach solid waste facility.19\n\n       To implement its statutory authority under the Act, TCEQ promulgated rules\n\nfound in Title 30, Chapter 330 of the Texas Administrative Code (“TCEQ Rules”).\n\nThe TCEQ Rules generally require a permit for any storage, processing, or\n\ndisposal of any solid waste unless the activity is exempted from permitting\n\nrequirements and authorized through a less rigorous process.20 These less rigorous\n\nauthorization processes include registration, notification, and exemption of certain\n\nwaste management activities from permitting or registration.

Specifically, the Act allows\n\ncertain types of facilities to be authorized by a mere registration, rather than by a\n\npermit.26    An applicant seeking authorization by registration must file an\n\napplication, but unlike the permitting process, the registration process does not\n\ninclude an opportunity for a contested case hearing. Moreover, unlike permit\n\napproval, the Executive Director has exclusive authority to review and approve\n\nregistrations without a vote by TCEQ commissioners.27\n\n       In accordance with the Act’s provisions, TCEQ Rule 330.9 allows\n\nauthorization of certain specific and precisely defined types of facilities pursuant to\n\na registration, rather than a permit.28 Rule 330.9 was expressly promulgated “to\n\nlist all those MSW management activities that are exempt from permitting\n\nrequirements but that still require commission approval by registration.”29 Thus,\n\nan applicant for a registration must be seeking approval for one of the specific\n\ntypes of facilities specified in Rule 330.9 and must meet the applicable\n\nrequirements of 330.9 for that particular type of waste management activity.\n25\n   Tex.

The Proposed Solid Waste Complex\n\n       Pintail Landfill, LLC (“Applicant” or “Pintail”) wishes to construct and\n\noperate a large solid waste complex within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the\n\ncity of Hempstead.30 The complex would consist of two solid waste facilities: 1) a\n\n223-acre, 410-foot high landfill (the “Landfill”); and 2) a transfer station/material\n\nrecovery facility to be located at the same site as the Landfill.31 This appeal\n\npertains to the transfer station/material recovery facility, but information is\n\nprovided below relating to the larger proposed Landfill for context.\n\n       C.      The Pending Landfill Permit Application\n\n       The Applicant has filed an application for a Type I municipal solid waste\n\n(“MSW”) permit to authorize construction and operation of the proposed\n\nLandfill.32 The Applicant filed Parts I and II of the Landfill application on July 22,\n\n2011, and filed Parts III and IV of the Landfill application on January 20, 2012.33\n\nThe Landfill is proposed to be constructed and operated on top of the sandy\n\nrecharge zone of the regional aquifer that serves as the sole source of drinking\n\nwater for the citizens of the city of Hempstead and other nearby residents.34\n\n\n30\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 1, Item 1, (Registration Application for MSW Facility), at p.

The Registration\n\n\n\n35\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 8, Item 65 (CALH’s Reply to Responses to MTO’s).\n36\n   See e.g., APPENDIX E: R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 67 (Waller County’s Request for\nDetermination and Denial of Permit Application and Registration Application).\n37\n   APPENDIX E: R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 67, p. 4-10 (Waller County’s Request for\nDetermination and Denial of Permit Application and Registration Application).\n38\n   APPENDIX E: R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 67, pp. 1-4, 9 (Waller County’s Request for\nDetermination and Denial of Permit Application and Registration Application).\n\n                                           20\n\f       On August 2, 2011, the Applicant filed its application for MSW Facility\n\nRegistration No. 40259 (the “Registration Application”), requesting authority to\n\noperate a transfer station/materials recovery facility (the “Facility”).39 On the first\n\npage of its Registration Application, the Applicant explains that the Facility will\n\ntransfer and recycle waste at the same location as the proposed Landfill in order to\n\ninitiate a market for incoming waste materials.40                Claiming authority under\n\nRule 330.9(b)(3), the Applicant improperly utilized the registration process to\n\nauthorize its transfer station/materials recovery facility.41 Rule 330.9(b)(3) allows\n\nregistration for transfer station facilities that transfer less than 125 tons of waste or\n\nless per day. Rule 330.9(b)(3) expressly applies only to transfer station facilities\n\nonly, and does not authorize the registration of materials recovery, waste\n\nseparation, or recycling facilities.42\n\n       Importantly, Applicant did not claim to use Rule 330.9(f) to authorize its\n\nregistration.    That rule does apply to transfer stations that include materials\n\nrecovery operations, such as the facility proposed by the Applicant. The rule\n\nrequires “any new MSW Type V transfer station that includes a materials recovery\n\noperation” to meet two qualifications: (1) it must recover at least ten percent of the\n\nwaste stream for recycling, and (2) it must send the remaining waste to a landfill\n39\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 1, Item 1, (Registration Application for MSW Facility).\n40\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 1, Item 1, (Registration Application for MSW Facility).\n41\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 1, Item 1, p. 2 (Registration Application for MSW Facility).\n42\n   The terms “materials recovery facility,” “recycling facility,” and “waste separation facility”\nare used interchangeably in TCEQ rules. See 30 Tex. Admin. Code 330.3(174).\n\n                                               21\n\ffacility within 50 miles (the so-called “10/50 requirement”).43 It is undisputed that\n\nApplicant did not meet the 10/50 requirement. In Part II of the Registration\n\nApplication, Applicant openly fails to meet the requirement, stating (1) that\n\nmaterials will be recovered at a rate not to interfere with proper operations of the\n\nfacility, and (2) that waste materials will be transported to a landfill within 100\n\nmiles.44\n\n       During TCEQ’s registration review process, CALH commented that\n\nregistration was inappropriate for this facility because the recycling activities\n\nexceeded those authorized for registration, and therefore permitting was required.45\n\n       E.      TCEQ’s Extended Review of the Registration\n\n       During review of the Registration Application, the TCEQ allowed more than\n\ntwo (2) technical notices of deficiency (“NODs”) and afforded multiple extensions\n\nof time for the Applicant to respond to the deficiencies.46 This conduct violated\n\nTCEQ’s own repeatedly published policies.47 The six NOD’s and two letters\n\ngranting extensions were mailed to Pintail on August 15, 2011 (NOD), October 27,\n\n\n43\n   30 Tex.

Also, please be aware that a\n       third notice of technical deficiency will not be issued.49\n\nThe TCEQ’s policy banning more than two NOD’s was also published in its TCEQ\n\nSunset Evaluation Report dated October 2009.50 The policy is also described in\n\nTCEQ’s Municipal Solid Waste (“MSW”) Permit Application Review Process\n\ndocument for its staff.51 Finally, the policy specifically applicable to a registration\n\nrequest is dictated to TCEQ staff as follows:\n\n       Review the second NOD response.

Citizens Against the Landfill in Hempstead (“CALH”).\n\n       Citizens Against the Landfill in Hempstead (CALH)56 is an organization\n\ncreated to protest the Applicant’s proposed MSW complex near Hempstead, Texas,\n\nand to inform the public about the issues related to the proposed MSW facilities.\n\nCALH has over 400 members comprised of Waller County landowners, residents,\n\nbusiness owners, businesses, and many other affected parties who have legitimate\n\nreasons to oppose the proposed MSW complex. Several of CALH’s members own\n\nland, reside, and work adjacent to and near the proposed facility site, and would be\n\naffected in a manner distinct from members of the general public.                        Plaintiff\n\nMichael McCall is a resident of Waller County and lives less than a mile from the\n\n53\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 7, Item 55, p. 6 (MSW Registration No. 40259).\n54\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 7, Item 55, p. 6 (MSW Registration No. 40259).\n55\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 7, Item 55, p. 1 (MSW Registration No. 40259 (referring to the\nfacility as a Type V Transfer Station, but authorizing registrant to “store and process wastes, and\nto recycle recovered materials…”)).\n56\n   For purposes of this document, CALH also includes Appellants Michael McCall and Wayne\nKnox.\n\n                                                24\n\fproposed site of the Landfill. Plaintiff Wayne Knox is a resident of Waller County\n\nwho owns and operates Pipe and Valve. Pipe and Valve is located in Waller\n\nCounty directly across from the proposed Facility.\n\n      G.    The City of Hempstead.\n\n      The City of Hempstead (the “City”) is a home rule municipality with a\n\ngrowing and diverse population of approximately 5,800 residents located in\n\nnorthern Waller County, Texas. The proposed landfill complex would be located\n\nwithin the City’s extraterritorial jurisdiction and very near the important junction\n\nof State Highway 6 and U.S. Highway 290, which serves as the gateway into the\n\nCity. The City supplies water to its residents from wells located near the proposed\n\nlandfill complex.\n\n\n\n\n                                        25\n\f                         SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       This Court has held that rules must be followed. When an agency fails to\n\nfollow the clear, unambiguous language of its own regulation, the court must\n\nreverse the agency’s action. TCEQ did not follow its rules when it issued a\n\nregistration to this Facility, so the issuance must be reversed. At least four rules\n\nwere broken:57\n\n1)     30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.9(b)(3). This registration rule\n       expressly applies only to transfer stations, and TCEQ broke this rule by\n       applying it to a materials recovery, or recycling, facility.\n\n2)     30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.9(f). This registration rule applies to\n       transfer stations with materials recovery operations (i.e. this Facility).\n       TCEQ broke this rule by failing to apply it. It was not claimed as authority\n       for registration and its requirements (the “10/50 requirements”) were\n       ignored.\n\n3)     30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.3(157). This rule defines a transfer\n       station as a facility that transfers waste and does nothing more. TCEQ broke\n       this rule by treating a materials recovery facility as a transfer station.\n\n4)     30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.3(174). This rule defines materials\n       recovery, waste separation, and recycling facilities. TCEQ broke this rule\n       by treating a materials recovery facility as a transfer station.\n\n       If a facility does not qualify for registration (or any other permitting\n\nexemption), the law requires a permit and allows affected persons to request a\n\n57\n   Five rules were broken if Rule 330.7(a) is counted, which generally requires a permit. This\nrule states: “Except as provided in §§330.9, 330.11, 330.13, or 330.25 of this title (relating to\nRegistration Required; Notification Required; Waste Management Activities Exempt from\nPermitting, Registration, or Notification; and Relationship with County Licensing System), no\nperson may cause, suffer, allow, or permit any activity of storage, processing, removal, or\ndisposal of any solid waste unless such activity is authorized by a permit or other authorization\nfrom the commission.”\n\n                                               26\n\fhearing. By issuing this registration, TCEQ eviscerated the permit requirement of\n\nits rules. TCEQ impermissibly expanded the scope of 330.9(b), which expressly\n\napplies only to “transfer station facilities.” A transfer station is not a materials\n\nrecovery or recycling facility.        Therefore, TCEQ failed to follow the plain\n\nlanguage of its own rules. Accordingly, reversal is required.\n\n      The permitting process is important because it provides affected persons an\n\nopportunity for contested case hearing. The registration process does not. The\n\nopportunity for hearing invokes obligatory statutory protections that provide a\n\nmeaningful evidentiary hearing for affected persons. Plaintiffs affected by the\n\nimproperly registered solid waste facility and its larger landfill counterpart were\n\ndenied their opportunity for hearing by this registration issuance. Because a permit\n\nwas required and the permitting process provides opportunity for a hearing, the\n\naffected persons were denied their rights to due process. Accordingly, issuance of\n\nthe registration should be reversed.\n\n      Finally, the registration should be reversed because of excessive Notices of\n\nDeficiency (“NOD’s”). The TCEQ arbitrarily disregarded its publicly pronounced\n\npolicy that only two NOD’s are issued to applicants. According to the TCEQ own\n\nPublic Interest Counsel, the public must have confidence that the TCEQ applies its\n\nstated policies, including its two NOD policy, in a uniform manner. The TCEQ\n\nrepeatedly expressed its NOD policy to the legislature, its staff, applicants, and\n\n\n\n                                           27\n\faffected persons. The policy expressed is clear. Applications are required to be\n\nreturned after unsuccessful resolution of two (2) NOD’s.      The TCEQ acted\n\narbitrarily and unreasonably violated its publicly pronounced NOD policy when it\n\nissued six (6) NODs and two (2) extensions of time to respond to Applicant.\n\nTherefore, issuance of the registration should be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\f                                    ARGUMENT\n\nI.    THE REGISTRATION MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE TCEQ’S\n      APPROVAL OF APPLICANT’S REGISTRATION FAILED TO\n      FOLLOW THE CLEAR, UNAMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE OF ITS\n      REGULATIONS.\n\n      Issuance of this registration must be reversed because this Facility is not just\n\na transfer station. Rule 330(b)(3) only allows registration for transfer station\n\nfacilities that transfer less than 125 tons of waste per day. This Facility is not a\n\ntransfer station—it is a transfer station with a materials recovery operation.\n\nTherefore, the 10/50 requirements of Rule 330.9(f) apply. TCEQ and Applicant,\n\nhowever, ignored this rule and its requirements. As discussed further below, TCEQ\n\nfailed to follow the clear, unambiguous language of at least four of its regulations\n\nwhen it improperly issued a registration for Applicant’s transfer station/materials\n\nrecovery facility (the “Facility”) utilizing Rule 330.9(b)(3).58 Therefore, the Court\n\nmust reverse the agency’s action as arbitrary and capricious.59\n\n      Additionally, even if a rule is ambiguous or leaves room for policy\n\ndeterminations, a court may not defer to an agency’s interpretation that is plainly\n\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or its underlying statutes.60 TCEQ’s\n\nunauthorized interpretation of its rules is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with\n\n\n58\n   See 30 Tex.

Accordingly, the\n\nregistration of this Facility must be reversed.\n\n         A.     Standard of Review\n\n         In this appeal brought under Texas Health and Safety Code § 361.321(a), the\n\nissue is whether the action of TCEQ was invalid, arbitrary, or unreasonable.61 The\n\nThird Court of Appeals specifically addressed this standard of review in Smith v.\n\nHouston Chemical Services, Inc., opining that the issue of whether the action is\n\ninvalid, arbitrary, or unreasonable was intended to incorporate the provisions of\n\nAdministrative        Procedures      Act     (“APA”),      Texas    Government   Code\n\n§ 2001.174(2)(A)–(F).62 In accordance with these provisions, a reviewing court\n\nshall reverse or remand the case for further proceedings if substantial rights of the\n\nappellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences,\n\nconclusions, or decisions are:\n\n         (A) in violation of a constitutional or statutory provision;\n\n         (B) in excess of the agency's statutory authority;\n\n         (C) made through unlawful procedure;\n\n         (D) affected by other error of law;\n\n         (E) not reasonably supported by substantial evidence considering the\n\n61\n     Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.321(e) (West 2010).\n62\n     872 S.W.2d 252, 257 n 2 (Tex. App.—Austin 1994, writ denied).\n\n                                               30\n\f       reliable and probative evidence in the record as a whole; or\n\n       (F) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\n       unwarranted exercise of discretion.63\n\n       This case raises a question of rule construction, which courts review de\n\nnovo.64     Courts interpret administrative rules, like statutes, under traditional\n\nprinciples of statutory construction.65 When an agency fails to follow the clear,\n\nunambiguous language of its own regulation, the court must reverse the agency’s\n\naction as arbitrary and capricious.66         Furthermore, the agency’s decision is\n\nreversible upon a finding of any errors listed in Texas Government Code\n\n§ 2001.174(2)(A)–(F).67\n\n       B.     TCEQ’s Spontaneous Interpretation of 30 Texas Administrative\n              Code §§ 330.9(f) and 330.9(b)(3).\n\n       The first public pronouncement of TCEQ’s interpretation of 330.9(b)(3) was\n\nat the hearing on this appeal in district court. At that hearing, the district court\n\nasked the Applicant why it claimed it did not need to register under Rule 330.9(f)\n\nand satisfy the 10/50 requirements. For the first time, the Applicant presented a\n\nnew interpretation of Rule 330.9(f) and 330.9(b)(3) that was not asserted at the\n\nagency level, was not asserted in briefing, and flew in the face of TCEQ definitions\n\n\n\n63\n   Tex. Gov’t Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(A)–(F) (West 2008).\n64\n   CenterPoint, 408 S.W.3d at 916.\n65\n   Id.\n66\n   Gulf States Utilities, 809 S.W.2d at 207; CenterPoint, 408 S.W.3d at 917.\n67\n   United Copper v. Grissom, 17 S.W.3d 797, 801 (Tex. App.—Austin 2000, pet. dism’d).\n\n                                            31\n\fand the plain language of both rules.68 Even though 330.9(f) expressly applies to\n\nany transfer station that includes materials recovery operations, Applicant argued\n\nthat the 10/50 requirements of 330.9(f) only apply to transfer stations that include\n\nmaterial recovery operations if the facility exceeds the volume limitation of 125\n\ntons of waste per day that is imposed by Rule 330.9(b)(3). As discussed later, this\n\nreading plainly contradicts the rules.\n\n       At the same hearing, the court asked TCEQ’s attorneys to explain a guidance\n\ndocument appearing to apply the requirements of Rule 330.9(f) to transfer stations\n\nwith material recovery operations. After a brief deliberation among the TCEQ\n\nattorneys, they deferred to the Applicant’s interpretation of the rules. Thus, also\n\nfor the first time, TCEQ attorneys adopted the new interpretation that Rule 330.9(f)\n\nonly applies to transfer stations that include a material recovery operation if the\n\nfacility exceeds the waste volume limitation set forth in Rule 330.9(b)(3).\n\n       As discussed below, Applicant and TCEQ’s reading of the rules disregards\n\ntheir plain language and therefore is impermissible. Furthermore, Applicant and\n\nTCEQ’s position ignores relevant TCEQ guidance on the very rule at issue –\n\n330.9(f). Also as discussed below, TCEQ’s own guidance document69 emphasizes\n\nthat, to receive a registration, any transfer station that includes a materials recovery\n\n68\n  See C.R. at 512–14 (Plaintiff’s Joint Motion for New Trial at 8–10).\n69\n   See APPENDIX D: TCEQ Waste Permits Division Publication titled “Guidelines for\nUtilizing the Source-Separated Recycling Permit Exemption for Municipal Solid Waste Transfer\nFacilities.”\n\n                                            32\n\ffacility must meet the 10/50 rule requirements set forth in Rule 330.9(f). The\n\nguidance document further explains that this requirement is distinct from other\n\nprovisions for registration in Rule 330.9(b).70\n\n      C.     TCEQ Failed to Follow the Clear, Unambiguous Language of Its\n             Regulations.\n\n      When an agency fails to follow the clear, unambiguous language of its own\n\nregulation, the court must reverse the agency’s action as arbitrary and capricious.71\n\nA rule’s plain language must be followed unless it is ambiguous.72 If a rule is\n\nambiguous or leaves room for policy determinations, a court may not defer to an\n\nagency’s interpretation that is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\n\nor its underlying statutes.73\n\n      A court construes an administrative rule in the same manner it construes a\n\nstatute.74 The court’s primary objective is to give effect to the agency’s intent.75\n\nAs the Texas Supreme Court has explained, other than the plain language of the\n\nrule itself, the “best source” of an agency’s intent is found in the Texas Register,\n\nwhere the agency publishes its notice of the proposed rule and its “explanation of\n\n\n70\n   Id.\n71\n   Gulf States Utilities, 809 S.W.2d at 207 (Tex. 1991); CenterPoint, 408 S.W.3d at 917.\n72\n   CenterPoint, 408 S.W.3d at 916.\n73\n   Id.\n74\n    Rodriguez v.

First, TCEQ failed to\n\nfollow Rule 330.9(b)(3), the provision under which Applicant claimed authority\n\nfor registration.     This rule expressly applies only to transfer station facilities.\n\nSecond, TCEQ failed to follow Rule 330.9(f), which requires that any transfer\n\nstations facilities with materials recovery operations must meet the 10/50\n\nrequirements. It is undisputed that the Facility is a transfer station with materials\n\nrecovery operations, and that the 10/50 requirements were not met. Third, TCEQ\n\nfailed to follow the clear, unambiguous language of its own definitions. TCEQ\n\nrules specifically define both types of facilities at issue, transfer stations and waste\n\nseparation/recycling facilities (also referred to as a materials recovery facilities),\n\nand these facilities engage in different waste management activities. Because\n\nTCEQ failed to follow the plain language of its rules, the registration of this\n\nFacility must be reversed.\n\n\n\n76\n     Rodriguez, 997 S.W.2d at 254.\n77\n     APPENDIX C: 31 Tex. Reg. 2502 (March 24, 2006), at 2506 (emphasis added).\n\n                                             34\n\f               1.     TCEQ Failed to Follow the Clear, Unambiguous Language\n                      of 30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.9(b)(3).\n\n          TCEQ and Applicant have improperly claimed authority to register the\n\nFacility under Rule 330.9(b)(3), which applies only to transfer station facilities that\n\ntransfer less than 125 tons of waste per day. Applying this rule to other types of\n\nfacilities in addition to transfer stations controverts the plain language of the Rule\n\nitself.    Rule 330.9(b)(3) expressly applies to “transfer station facilities,” not\n\nrecycling facilities or any other types of waste management facilities.78 The rule\n\nstates that “[a] registration is required for an MSW transfer station facility that is\n\nused in the transfer of MSW to a solid waste processing or disposal facility….”79\n\nAs discussed below, transfer station facilities and recycling facilities are separately\n\ndefined in TCEQ regulations, each involing distinct waste management activities.\n\nTCEQ and reviewing courts are bound to construe these terms by their regulatory\n\ndefinitions only.80      Because TCEQ failed to follow the clear, unambiguous\n\nlanguage of its own regulation, the Court must reverse the agency’s action as\n\narbitrary and capricious.\n\n\n78\n   30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.9(b) (2014).\n79\n   30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.9(b) (2014).\n80\n   Tex. Dept. of Transp. V.

TCEQ Failed to Follow the Clear, Unambiguous Language\n                       of 30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.9(f).\n\n       TCEQ failed to follow Rule 330.9(f), which requires any new MSW Type V\n\ntransfer station that includes a materials recovery operation to meet two\n\nqualifications: (1) it must recover at least ten percent of the waste stream for\n\nrecycling, and (2) it must send the waste to a landfill within 50 miles (the so-called\n\n“10/50 requirement”). It is undisputed that the Facility is not merely a transfer\n\nstation facility, but includes a material recover operation.81 Thus, the requirements\n\nof Rule 330.9(f) expressly apply to this Facility because they apply to “any new\n\nMSW Type V transfer station that includes a material recovery operation.”82\n\n       Even though this rule fits like a glove, the Applicant did not meet its\n\nrequirements. Indeed, in Part II of Applicant’s Registration Application, Applicant\n\nopenly states (1) that materials will be recovered at a rate not to interfere with\n\nproper operations of the facility, and (2) that waste materials will be transported to\n\na landfill within 100 miles.83 This fails to meet the applicable 10/50 requirements,\n\nand therefore, the registration must be reversed.\n\n       As previously discussed, TCEQ contended for the first time in hearing\n\nbefore the district court that the requirements of 330.9(f) were inapplicable to this\n81\n   C.R. at 509 (Plaintiff’s Joint Motion for New Trial, Note 10 and accompanying text).\n82\n   30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.9(f) (2014) (emphasis added).\n83\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 1, Item 1, p. II-3 (Registration Application) (“The facility will\nrecover recyclable materials at a rate not to interfere with proper operations of the facility. Non-\nrecyclable materials will be transported to a properly permitted Type I or Type IV landfill that is\nlocated within 100 miles of the proposed facility.”).\n\n                                                36\n\fFacility. This assertion fails because it conflicts with the plain language of the\n\nrule, which expressly applies to “any” Type V transfer station that includes a\n\nmaterial recovery operation.\n\n       Furthermore, this assertion is surprising because TCEQ’s published\n\nguidance on Rule 330.9(f)84 emphasizes that, to receive a registration, any transfer\n\nstation that includes a materials recovery facility must meet the 10/50 rule\n\nrequirements set forth in Rule 330.9(f). The guidance document explains that Rule\n\n330.9(f) is distinct from other provisions for registration of a transfer facility\n\nbased on the population of the area served, waste acceptance rate, and location\n\nwithin a permitted facility (30 TAC §330.9(b)).”85 Further, the guidance document\n\ndoes not suggest that applicants wishing to operate a materials recovery facility\n\nmay use Rule 330.9(b) if they self-impose waste acceptance limitations. On the\n\ncontrary, Rule 330.9(f) expressly applies to “any … station that includes a material\n\nrecovery operation,”86 regardless of waste acceptance rates.\n\n              3.     TCEQ Failed to Follow the Clear, Unambiguous Language\n                     of its Regulations Defining Transfer Station and Waste\n                     Separation/Recycling Facility.\n\n       Registration of this Facility violates the clear, unambiguous language of\n\nRules 330.3(157) and 330.3(174), which define transfer station and waste\n84\n    See APPENDIX D: TCEQ Waste Permits Division Publication titled “Guidelines for\nUtilizing the Source-Separated Recycling Permit Exemption for Municipal Solid Waste Transfer\nFacilities.”\n85\n   Id.\n86\n   30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.9(f) (2014).\n\n                                            37\n\fseparation/recycling facilities, respectively.87 When an agency’s rules expressly\n\ndefine a term, a court is bound to construe the term by that regulatory definition\n\nonly.88 The term “transfer station” in Rule 330.9(b) cannot include a material\n\nrecovery facility, because that would be inconsistent with the express definitions of\n\na “transfer station” and “material recovery facility” set forth in the TCEQ’s own\n\nrules.\n\n         The term “transfer station” is expressly defined in the TCEQ rules as “[a]\n\nfacility used for transferring solid waste from collection vehicles to long haul\n\nvehicles….”89 That definition is not ambiguous, and it plainly does not include a\n\n“material recovery facility,” which is also expressly defined in the rules and is a\n\ncompletely different kind of facility – i.e., one where “recyclable materials are\n\nremoved from the waste stream” for recycling.90 Moreover, since TCEQ expressly\n\nprovided different definitions for the term “transfer station” and the term “material\n\n\n87\n   30 Tex. Admin.

Admin. Code § 330.3(174) (“Waste-separation/recycling facility-\n-A facility, sometimes referred to as a material recovery facility, in which recyclable materials\nare removed from the waste stream for transport off-site for reuse, recycling, or other beneficial\nuse.”)\n88\n   Tex.

It does not mean a transfer station and a\n\nmaterial recovery facility.\n\n       D.      A Loophole Big Enough to Drive a Truck Through: Even if the\n               Regulations Were Ambiguous, TCEQ’s Interpretation Would Not\n               Be Entitled to Deference Because it is Plainly Erroneous or\n               Inconsistent with the Regulation or its Underlying Statutes.\n\n       Even if the regulations were ambiguous, the Facility registration must be\n\nreversed because TCEQ’s interpretation of §330.9(b)(3) is plainly erroneous and\n\ninconsistent with the regulation or its underlying statutes.92 TCEQ’s interpretation\n\nof 330.9(b)(3) is plainly erroneous because it leads to an absurd result. Reading\n\nthis rule to allow activities beyond the stated “transfer” activities would eviscerate\n\nthe Act and TCEQ Rules’ permitting requirement for many MSW storage,\n\nprocessing, and disposal facilities.                 Indeed, under TCEQ’s impromptu\n\ninterpretation, so long as a facility called itself a “transfer station” and transferred\n\nless than 125 tons per day of MSW, it would be able to perform any other MSW\n\n91\n   See Moore v. State, 739 S.W.2d 347, 349 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). Also, there is certainly\nnothing in the TCEQ rules that would support any suggestion that the term “transfer station” is\nan umbrella term encompassing various kinds of facilities, like, for example, the term “Type V\nFacility.”\n92\n   Gulf States, 809 S.W.2d at 207; CenterPoint, 408 S.W.3d at 917 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013,\npet. denied) (holding that if a rule is ambiguous or leaves room for policy determinations, a court\nmay not defer to an agency’s interpretation that is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\nregulation or its underlying statutes.).\n\n                                                39\n\fwaste management activities at that facility, including long-term storage,\n\nprocessing activities such as recycling, and even land disposal. This cannot be the\n\nstate of law, and is plainly erroneous.\n\n       As discussed at length above, TCEQ’s interpretation is inconsistent with its\n\nregulations. Furthermore, the interpretation is also inconsistent with the Act. The\n\nstated purpose of the Act is “to safeguard the health, welfare, and physical property\n\nof the people and to protect the environment by controlling the management of\n\nsolid waste.”93     The Act authorizes TCEQ to issue permits governing the\n\nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of solid waste facilities,94 and the Act\n\ngenerally requires that a person apply for and obtain a separate permit for each\n\nsolid waste facility.95 Furthermore, the Act provides certain specific exceptions to\n\nthe general permitting requirement, which are reflected in the TCEQ Rules (as\n\ndiscussed above). Specifically, the Act allows certain types of facilities to be\n\nauthorized by a mere registration, rather than by a permit.96          The TCEQ’s\n\ninterpretation is inconsistent with the Act because it would result in registration of\n\nsolid waste management activities that should require a permit under the Act.\n\nII.    THE TCEQ DENIED AFFECTED PERSONS DUE PROCESS BY\n       AUTHORIZING THE FACILITY THROUGH REGISTRATION\n       RATHER THAN A PERMIT.\n\n93\n   Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.002(a) (West 2010).\n94\n   Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.061 (West 2010).\n95\n   Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.086(a) (West 2010).\n96\n   Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 361.0861, 361.111 (West 2010).\n\n                                            40\n\f       Circumventing the permitting requirements of the Act and the TCEQ Rules\n\nis not harmless error because it denies affected persons due process in the form of a\n\ncontested case hearing.97      CALH, the City, and other affected persons, were\n\nentitled to a contested case hearing prior to authorization of this Facility. This\n\nFacility is actually part of the proposed Landfill that has not been permitted, and\n\nwhich is the subject of an ongoing contested case hearing.               This registration\n\nimproperly denied these requestors their opportunity for hearing on the storage and\n\nrecycling component of the larger Landfill facility.\n\n       No one has disputed CALH or the City’s standing, and each is a party in the\n\nongoing contested case hearing for the Pintail Landfill at the same location as this\n\nFacility. CALH members and City of Hempstead have property interests that\n\nwould be affected by the proposed facility. For example, CALH has members that\n\nreside adjacent to the proposed location and rely on water wells as their sole source\n\nof domestic water, and the City supplies water to its residents from wells located\n\nnear the Facility. The legislature has determined that a contested case hearing is\n\nthe process that is due to protect the property interests of affected persons and has\n\ncodified the requirements in the Health and Safety Code.98 Where there is a\n\n97\n  Article 1, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution (due process).\n98\n   See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 361.088, 361.0665, 361.0666, 361.067, 361.079,\n361.0791, and 361.081 (relating to various application notice requirements, published notice\nrequirements, mailed notice requirements, hearing notice requirements, and contested case\nhearing requirements for MSW permit applications).\n\n                                            41\n\fstatutory right to a hearing and a right to a hearing under applicable rules, denial of\n\nthe hearing is a violation of procedural due process.99\n\n        CALH and the City’s interests should have been afforded the protection of\n\nthe permitting process. The permitting process, unlike the registration process,\n\ntriggers statutorily granted due process rights to notice and a contested case\n\nhearing by virtue of the Texas Health and Safety Code.100 Here, the issuance of a\n\nregistration when a permit was required denied members of CALH, the City, and\n\nall other affected persons their right to notice and a contested case hearing, as\n\nrequired under the Health and Safety Code for MSW permit applications.101\n\nIII.   THE REGISTRATION SHOULD BE REVERSED BECAUSE TCEQ\n       ALLOWED AN EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF NOTICES OF\n       DEFICIENCY WELL BEYOND ITS PUBLICLY PRONOUNCED\n       POLICY.\n\n       The TCEQ failed to follow its publicly stated policy controlling Notice of\n\nDeficiency (“NOD”) procedures. A NOD is sent by TCEQ to notify applicants of\n\ndeficiencies in their applications and allows them to submit additional information\n\nto address the deficiencies. TCEQ publicly represented that they employ a limit of\n\n\n99\n   County of Dallas v. Wiland, 216 S.W.3d 344, 347 (Tex. 2007) (holding that “the deputies were\ndischarged without the hearing before the civil service commission promised by system rules to\ndetermine whether just cause existed, and thus they were denied procedural due process.”)\n(emphasis added).\n100\n     See Tex. Health & Safety Code §§ 361.088, 361.0665, 361.0666, 361.067, 361.079,\n361.0791, and 361.081 (relating to various application notice requirements, published notice\nrequirements, mailed notice requirements, hearing notice requirements, and contested case\nhearing requirements for MSW permit applications).\n101\n    See id.\n\n                                              42\n\ftwo NOD’s. TCEQ should follow its own public policy pronouncements. Even\n\nTCEQ’s own Public Interest Counsel agrees, stating “the public must have\n\nconfidence that the TCEQ applies its stated policies, including the two NOD\n\npolicy, to all applicants in a uniform manner.”102\n\n       This Registration Application should have been returned to Pintail because\n\nexcessive Technical Notices of Deficiency (NOD’s) were allowed in violation of\n\nclearly established TCEQ Policy. During the review, Pintail was afforded at least\n\nsix (6) separate NOD’s and two (2) extensions of time to respond to the NOD’s\n\nfrom the TCEQ.103 This is in direct conflict with the TCEQ’s previous warnings to\n\nPintail and the TCEQ policies outlined in the MSW registration process\n\ndescription, which is located in the TCEQ Sunset Evaluation Report. In its First\n\nTechnical NOD dated October 27, 2011, the TCEQ flatly warned Pintail that the\n\nTCEQ did not “anticipate granting an extension of time to fulfill this request,” and\n\nthat a “third notice of technical deficiency will not be issued.”104 The public\n\nshould be entitled to rely on the clear and unambiguous policies and directives of\n\nthe TCEQ when the TCEQ evaluates applications that could have catastrophic\n\neffects on the health, safety, and financial well being of affected parties.\n\n\n\n\n102\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 8, Item 61, p. 3–4 (Office of Public Interest Counsel’s Response\nto MTO).\n103\n    See R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Index, Items 3, 13, 16, 22, 24, 27, 32, and 39.\n104\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 2, Item 13 (NOD Letter and Policy Notice to Pintail).\n\n                                               43\n\f       Instead, Pintail got at least eleven (11) bites at the apple to supply required\n\ninformation and respond to the numerous concerns outlined by the TCEQ staff\n\nregarding this “transfer station” and recycling facility.105 As stated in the MSW\n\nRegistration No. 40259 itself, the registration request was submitted on August 1,\n\n2011, and ten (10) additional revisions were submitted on August 8, 2011, August\n\n29, 2011; November 16, 2011; January 18, 2012; March 15, 2012; May 1, 2012;\n\nMay 31, 2012; July 20, 2012; September 14, 2012, and October 18, 2012.\n\n       In the initial Technical NOD106 dated October 27, 2011, the TCEQ reviewer\n\nof the Registration Application wrote, “we do not anticipate granting an extension\n\nof time to fulfill this request. Also, please be aware a third notice of technical\n\ndeficiency will not be issued.” (emphasis added).107 The reviewer also stated in\n\nthe same correspondence that “Failure to submit a satisfactory response to each of\n\nthe noted deficiencies may result in the application being returned due to technical\n\ndeficiencies.” These statements by staff are consistent with TCEQ policies, as\n\nrecently expressed in its TCEQ Sunset Evaluation Report.108 As stated in the\n\nreport, which contains a flowchart of the MSW registration review process,\n\n\n105\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 7, Item 55, p. 6 (MSW Registration No. 40259).\n106\n    Although this Technical NOD was labeled the First Technical NOD, there was actually\ncorrespondence from the TCEQ dated August 15, 2011 that was labeled “Preliminary Review”\nasking for information to be added to the original registration request.\n107\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 2, Item 13 (NOD Letter and Policy Notice to Pintail).\n108\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 8, Item 61, p. 3–4 (citing TCEQ Sunset Self-Evaluation Report,\nSec. VII, P. 248).\n\n                                              44\n\fregistration requests are returned to the applicant after an applicant unsuccessfully\n\nresolves the Second NOD.109\n\n       The registration review process documents from 2009-2010 and 2010-\n\nCurrent reveal a consistent TCEQ instruction to its staff, applicable to all\n\nregistrants:\n\n       “Review the second NOD response. If the application still has\n       significant deficiencies, prepare a letter for the Section Manager’s\n       signature returning the application with an explanation why the\n       application is being returned. If the deficiencies are very minor in\n       nature, work with the applicant/consultant to resolve them. There are\n       no third NODs.” (second emphasis added).110\n\n       According to the registration procedures, only very minor deficiencies may\n\nbe addressed, and there are no third NODs. A consultation between the reviewer\n\nand team leader to determine the next course of actions (i.e., whether the issues are\n\neasily addressed minor issues) is consistent with the stated procedure.\n\n       Regardless of these statements and the dissonance with applicable TCEQ\n\npolicies, on December 2, 2011, an extension was granted to allow Pintail additional\n\ntime to respond to the First NOD.111 Pintail did respond on January 18, 2012, but\n\nthe response was again inadequate, as the reviewer sent another request for\n\nadditional information on February 17, 2012.112 And, even though it is labeled\n\n109\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 8, Item 58, Ex. 2 at 248.\n110\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 8, Item 65, Ex. 1, p. 3 of registration procedures document\n(CALH’s Reply to Responses to Motion to Overturn).\n111\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 2, Item 16.\n112\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 4, Item 22.\n\n                                            45\n\f“First Technical Notice of Deficiency,” the letter is clearly an indication that\n\nPintail did not submit a satisfactory response to each of the noted deficiencies in\n\nthe first technical notice of deficiency.         As such, it appears the Registration\n\nApplication should have been returned at this time. However, not only was the\n\nApplication not returned, Pintail was granted yet another extension to respond to\n\nthe Third Technical NOD.113 Despite the statements from TCEQ staff that there\n\nwould not be more than two (2) NOD’s, this pattern continued for a total of at least\n\nsix (6) NOD’s.114\n\n       The registration should have been returned after Pintail’s failure to address\n\nTCEQ’s concerns in the Second NOD, in accordance with the TCEQ’s policy and\n\nthe TCEQ staff’s statements. Allowing Pintail to continue to inadequately respond\n\nto more than two (2) Technical NOD’s is a departure from the stated policy, and\n\nshould not be allowed by the Commission.                    For this reason alone, the\n\nCommission’s approval of MSW Registration No. 40259 is marred by abuse of\n\ndiscretion, unlawful procedure, and unreasonable errors of law.                Accordingly,\n\nissuance of the registration should be reversed.\n\n       The TCEQ has argued that it is entitled to publicly pronounce its policy\n\n\n113\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 5, Item 24. Interestingly, this Technical NOD was not given a\nnumber (nor were the two subsequent NODs of June 25, 2012 and August 16, 2012, given a\nnumber), but by our count it is actually the Fourth NOD when you count the “Preliminary\nReview”.\n114\n    See R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Index, Items 3, 13, 16, 22, 24, 27, 32, and 39.\n\n                                             46\n\fcontrolling NOD procedures, yet not follow that policy because it is not\n\nincorporated into TCEQ rules.115 Appellants respectfully disagree. The TCEQ\n\nshould be bound to follow its public pronouncements.                            Without such a\n\nrequirement, the public will lose trust in their state environmental regulators. Here,\n\nthe Registration Application should have been returned to Pintail after the\n\nunsuccessful resolution of the Second NOD. Instead, Pintail received six (6)\n\nseparate NOD’s resulting in eleven (11) different versions of the Registration\n\nApplication. The TCEQ’s refusal to follow its own publicly pronounced NOD\n\npolicy harmed CALH and its members, harmed the City, and harmed the public of\n\nTexas.       Such refusal was an abuse of discretion, unlawful procedure, and an\n\nunreasonable error of law, and accordingly, was invalid, arbitrary, or unreasonable.\n\nFor this reason, Appellants respectfully request that registration of this Facility be\n\nreversed by the Court.\n\n\n\n\n115\n      R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 7, Item 53, p. 8 (Response to Comment 10).\n\n                                                 47\n\f                                     PRAYER\n\n      TCEQ acted in violation of its own rules and policies, and in abrogation of\n\nthe due process rights of affected persons, in granting the Registration Application\n\nand issuing Registration No. 40259. Therefore, CALH and the City respectfully\n\npray that the trial court's Judgment affirming the TCEQ’s action be reversed, and\n\nthat Court reverse, or suspend and set aside, the Registration and remand this\n\nmatter to TCEQ for further proceedings consistent with this Court’s opinion.\n\nCALH and the City further pray for all other and further relief, both general and\n\nspecial, at law and in equity, to which they may be justly entitled.\n\n                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                       HANCE SCARBOROUGH, LLP\n                                       400 W. 15th Street, Ste. 950\n                                       Austin, TX 78701\n                                       Telephone: (512) 479-8888\n                                       Facsimile: (512) 482-6891\n\n                                       By: _______________________\n                                         Terry L.

It\n                  is not a storage facility such as one where individual\n                  residents can dispose of their wastes in bulk storage\n                  containers that are serviced by collection vehicles.\n        Transfer facilities offer an alternative when the landfill is so far away\n        that it is not economical for each waste-collection vehicle to make\n        round trips. Transfer stations allow local waste haulers to temporarily store.\n        waste and then use large-volume trucks to haul waste to the distant landfill.\n        Though transfer stations save money, they have their uwn operating\n        expenses. It is important to determine whether a transfer facility would\n        be cost effective.

To qualify for this type of authorization, the\n          community must control the facility, comply with local ordinances, notify\n          adjacent landowners, and haul collected waste to a final disposal facility at\n          least weekly. A low-volume transfer station may store, at most, 40 cubic\n          yards of waste.\n         To start a low-volume transfer station, a local government\n         must submit a Notice ofintent to Operate a Low-Volume Transfer\n         Station (Form TCEQ-20370). TCEQ forms can be found at\n         <WWW. tceq.texas.gov/search_forms.html>.\n         Transfer stations that cannot meet the 40-cubic-yard limit vvill have to\n         obtain either a registration or a permit.

To have a successful event, you must plan each component of the\n                      cleanup-from acceptance to final disposal-well in advance.\n                      A permit, registration, notification, or other authorization is not required\n                      for a collection point for wastes collected and received in sealed plastic bags\n                      from such activities as periodic citywide cleanup campaigns and cleanup of\n                      rights-of-way or roadside parks.\n                       One of the major priorities of a public collection event is to arrange for final\n                       disposal of every waste stream before the collection date. If waste remains\n                       at the collection area for an extended period of time, it creates ai1 \"out-of-\n                       sight, out-of-mind'' mentality and promotes illegal dumping. Ideally, all\n                       wastes should be removed immediately following the event or as soon as\n                       possible to avoid the creation and maintenance of a nuisance, or the\n                       endangerment of human health or the environment. Options for final\n                       disposal include recycling, composting, and using landfills. With each\n                       option, you should consider several basic questions:\n\n...... .. . .......    Recycling\n                       ., What materials do we want to recycle?\n                       .. Who accepts these materials for recycling?\n                       ..

Although HHW can usually be\n                      legally disposed of in the normal trash, there are better disposal options that\n                      local governments can arrange.

Take special care to\n        recycle or properly dispose of all pesticides.\n\n        Empty Plastic Pesticide Containers\n        Plastic pesticide containers that have been triple rinsed or pressure washed\n        and rendered unusable are not considered hazardous waste, and can be\n        disposed of ill an MSW facility that is permitted to accept this special waste.\n        Not all landfills choose to accept pesticide containers, however, even if\n        the containers have been properly rinsed, and the landfills that do accept\n        them usually charge a fee. Instead of disposing of these containers,\n        consider recycling them.

Ifimproperly\n          managed, the cleanup and removal of storm debris can unnecessarily cost\n          thousands of dollars in transportation charges and disposal fees alone.\n          Table 1 (under \"Options for Material Diversion,\" below}, lists options for\n          recycling different materials.\n         In general, outdoor burning is prohibited in Texas. If your local government\n         would like an exception, you will need to meet specific requirements and\n         obtain approval from the appropriate TCEQ regional office before doing\n         any burning. You -will also need to check local ordinances or other\n         regulations about outdoor burning. If there is a burn ban in your county, the\n         TCEQ will not approve any exception to the rule. For additional information\n         concerning outdoor burning in Texas, :including a copy of the rule, consult\n         the TCEQ's Outdoor Burning in Texas (Pub. No. RG-049).\n         Note: It is strictly prohibited to burn any electrical insulation, treated\n         lumber, plastics, non-wooden construction or demolition materials, heavy\n         oils, asphaltic materials, potentially explosive materials, chemical wastes, or\n         items that contain natural or synthetic rubber (such as tires).\n\n\n\n  July 2013                                                                                                    430\n\fTraditional Municipal Solid Waste Di~posal: A Guide for Local Governments   TCEQ publication Pub.

Texas is a big state;\n        some options may not be practical for all areas. You should develop a plan\n        for the transport, storage, processing, and disposal of various forms of\n        storm debris. This should include identification of suitable sites to\n        temporarily store, segregate, or process large amounts of debris following a\n        disaster. You should consider requesting that residents set appliances,\n        household hazardous waste, brush, construction debris, and putrescible\n        wastes in separate piles for pickup after a storm. Tell contract haulers to\n        maintain separation of materials during the collection, transport, and\n        storage of storm debris to maximize your options for recycling waste and\n        minimize waste-disposal costs. Before designing your plan, you should\n         consider the following:\n\n        Available landfill space\n         \" Where is the closest landfill?\n         \" What is its disposal capacity?\n         \" What types of waste does it accept?\n\n         Recycling options\n         ..

The city or county often becomes responsible for the collection\n       and disposal of the trash left at an illegal dump site. The labor and disposal\n       costs associated-with these sites can eat away at a local government's\n       budget. To help combat illegal dumping in your community, see the TCEQ's\n       Prevent Illegal Dumping: A Guide for Local Governments (RG-455).\n\n\n Don't Mess with Texas Water\n          The Don't Mess -with Texas Water program offers local governments\n          another tool to help prevent illegal dumping.

Any liquids that\n        the facility produces must be disposed of in a manner that will not cause\n        surface water or groundwater pollution. You should determine how to\n        handle. any wastewater that your operation creates, such as vehicle wash\n        water or water that has come into contact with waste. With the wastewater\n        system's approval, your wastewater may be discharged to the local sanitary\n        sewer. To disch:n:ge directly into the waters of Texas, your facility must have\n        a TPDES permit.\n\n        Stormwater\n        To prevent stormwater from being contaminated with solid waste, landfills\n        must obtain a stormwater permit. You can get coverage through either the\n        Multi-Sector General Permit No. TXR.050000 or an individual permit. The\n        application process for the general permit is much simpler, less expensive,\n        and less time-consuming than that for an individual permit.\n        To apply for the general permit, you must:\n        o    develop a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3) and\n         e   file the Notice of Intent (Form TCEQ-10382) with the TCEQ.\n\n         Templates to help you develop an SWP3 are available online at\n        · <www;tceq.texas.gov/assistance/water/sw-industrial.html>\n         For assistance on obtaining coverage and meeting the requirements of the\n         permit, contact the TCEQ's Small Business and Local Government\n         Assistance Section at 800-447-2827.\n\n\n Ai!·~Pollution          Control\n         Landfill Air Authorizations\n         MSW facilities are required to have applicable air authorizations based on\n         the activities _at the site. There are three categories of air authorizations for\n         MSW sites: permit by rule (PBR), stand:n:d permit, or a new source review\n         case-by-case permit.\n         The simplest, least expensive, and least time-consuming air authorization to\n         obtain is the PBR106.534, Municipal Solid Waste Landfills and Transfer\n         Stations. This air authorization is for cell Oandfill-unit) construction and\n         activities related to waste disposal; it is not intended for other activities.

When claiming a PBR\n       106.534 air authorization, your facility must follow the requirements in 30\n       TAC 106.534 and 30 TAC 330, Subchapter U.\n       If a landfill operation cannot meet the requirements of PBR 106.534, then\n       the MSW air standard permit may be required. Depending on the level of\n       activity at the landfill, a general operating permit may be required. To\n       determine what level of permit is required for your facility, see the reference\n       guide for reviewers of air permits, Municipal Solid Waste Landfills\n       (MSWLF) and Transfer Stations (PDF), at\n       <wi..vw.tceq.state. tx.us/ goto /mswlf>.\n\n        Additional Air Authorizations\n        MSW facilities using PBR 106.534 may conduct activities that require\n        additional air authorizations.

For quarterly reporting, the waste accepted is reported as it was\n        recorded at the gate,. whether compacted/uncompacted tons or compacted/\n        uncompacted cubic yards. For annual reporting, the total waste accepted\n        must be reported in tons; if you use volumetric measurements in your\n        facility's records, you can convert them to short tons.\n\n        Small Community Equivalent Factor\n        If your landfill or h·ansfer station serves. fewer than 5,000 people, you may\n        use a population-equivalent factor instead of mail!]:aining records of the\n        actual amount of waste deposited. Under this system, the amount of waste\n        is calculated as 1 ton per person a year. The report must document the\n        population served by the facility and reflect any changes in population since\n        the previous report.\n\n        Quarterly Report:\n        You must submit a quarterly solid-waste summary report to the TCEQ no\n        later than 20 days following the end of each fiscal quarter.

It explains what the exemption is, what is\nneeded to qualify, and how owners or operators of facilities may apply for and utilize the exemption.\nSeveral examples are also presented. Terms used in this document have the meanings assigned by\nTexas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 361, and 30 TAC Chapters              33.Q, and·™·\n\n\nWhat is the Source-Separated Recycling Permit Exemption?\n\nThe source-separated recycling permit exemption, described in                        allows qualifying\nMSW transfer facilities to operate under a registration instead of a permit. It was established by\na rule amendment, published in the April 9, 2004, issue of the Texas Register, volume 29,\npages 3634-3640. This provision to operate under a registration instead of a permit is distinct\nfrom other provisions for registration of a transfer facility based on the population of the area\nserved, waste acceptance rate, and location within a permitted facility (30 TAC ;:>J.~:.;::Ll_~J\n\nWhat Are the Basic Eligibility Requirements for the Exemption?\n\nMaterials Recovery\n\n30 TAC            allows owners and operators of MSW Type V transfer facilities to register their\noperations instead of permitting them, provided:\n\n          •    The transfer facility recovers 10 percent or more by weight or weight equivalent of the\n               incoming waste stream for reuse or recycling;\n\n          •    Incoming waste has already been reduced by at least 10 percent through a\n               source-separation recycling program; or\n\n          e    The transfer facility owner and/or operator also operate(s) one or more source-separation\n               recycling programs in the county where the transfer facility is located and those\n               source-separation recycling programs manage a total weight or weight equivalent of\n               recyclable materials equal to 10 percent or more by weight or weight equivalent of the total\n               incoming waste stream to all transfer facilities that the person owns or operates under the\n               exemption.\n\nDistance to Landfill\n\nThe owner or operator of the transfer facility must demonstrate in the registration application that\nit will transfer the remaining nonrecyclable waste to a landfill not more than 50 miles from the\nfacility.\n\n\nGuidelines for Source-Separated Recycling Permit Exemption (rev. 06/19/06)                      Page 1 of 5\n\n                                                                                                              443\n\fWhat Other Requirements Apply to a Facility Operating under the Exemption?\n\nOperational Requirements\n\nA Type V transfer facility operating under the exemption must comply with applicable operational\nrequirements for MSW storage and processing units detail in 30 TAC Chapter 330, Subchapter E.\n\nDocumentation (Recordkeeping)\n\nAfter transfer facility operations commence, documentation of the recycling or recovery of at least\n10 percent of waste material from the waste stream (at the transfer facility, and/ or by the\nsource-separation recycling program(s)), must be annually updated and maintained at the transfer\nfacility for records inspection. Failure to maintain the standard of at least 10 percent recovery of\nmaterials shall be grounds for revocation of the registration.\n\nReporting\n\nA Type V transfer facility operating under the exemption must also provide reports in accordance\nwith 30 TAC §330.671(b)(3).\n\nRecycling and Composting Facilities\n\nAll recycling and composting facilities must comply with applicable requirements of 30 TAC\nChapter 328 (Waste Minimization and Recycling) and Chapter 332 (Composting), as well as all\nother applicable laws and regulations, including maintaining records to demonstrate that the\nmaterials recovered (including compost derived from those materials) were reused or recycled.\n\nHow May Owners or Operators of Facilities Apply for and Utilize the Exemption?\n\nOwners or operators wishing to utilize the exemption must register their facilities in accordance\nwith 30 TAC Chapter 330,                 (relating to Permit and Registration Application\nProcedures).\n\nAn applicant must demonstrate in a registration application the methods that will be used to\nmeasure amounts of waste and recycled materials handled and to assure and document that the\nrecycling requirement is achieved. The procedures and methods should be contained in the Site\nOperating Plan (SOP) or placed in a Recycling Plan as an attachment to the SOP. Owners or\noperators of existing registered facilities may modify the facility SOP pursuant to 30 TAC\nChapter 305, §305.70, to include the methods and procedures needed to utilize the exemption,\nprovided there is no increase in the daily maximum limit of waste acceptance.

A facility expects to receive 5,000 tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) in an\n             average month from a combination of residential and commercial customers.\n\n             The owner or operator of this facility also operates a curbside, source-separation\n             recycling program in the same county in which the transfer facility is located, but\n             not necessarily within any part of the area served by the exempt transfer station.\n             The curbside recycling program takes in about 300 tons of glass and plastic bottles,\n             metals cans, and newspapers that are sold to a recycling company, and 500 tons of\n             yard trimmings that are taken to a compost facility where they are processed. The\n             finished compost is used in mulching oflandscape in and around municipal facilities,\n             given free to customers of the waste service operator, and the rest sold to others.\n\n             The 300 + 500 = 800 tons of materials taken in by the curbside recycling program\n             and sold to a recycler or delivered to a compost facility (and compost used)\n             represents 800 / 5000, or 16 percent (by weight) of the waste stream incoming to the\n             exempt transfer facility.

Tex. Health & Safely Code § 363.002.

Piiitail apparently has not responded to this\n\n      latest \"Notice of Deficiency. See http://wwv,:.biggsandmathews,corn/pennits.php. Accordingly .\n\n      nearly one year after filing its initial Transfer Station Registration Application, Pintail has still\n\n      not submitted an Dpplication that meets the roJevant statutory and ad.ministrntive criteria. As\n\n      sr1ch, the Exerntive Director cannot cletennine the application is tech11foally complete and cannot\n\n      take action 011 it. Therefore, Pintail still has not filed a Transfer Station registration application\n\n      that is ac1;ually pending before the Commission.\n\n                                                               rrr.\n                             Pintail's Proposed Applications Should be Denied\n\n              For tl1e .reasons stated above, it is undisputed that Pintail was unprepared to file\n\n      administratively or technically complete applications for the Proposed Laudfi!J permit or\n\n      Transfer Station registration at the time ihat the Waller County Commissioners Court enacted its\n\n      solid waste Ordinance. Pintail sought to initiate the bifurcated permit application, after it became\n\n       aware that the Waller Cotmiy Commissioners Court was considering enacting an ordina11ce that\n\n       would prohibit solid waste processing and disposal at its proposed site.                        Pintail hoped that it\n\n       could claim that it had a pennit \"app!icaiion\" pending before the Commission when Waller\n\n       Cmmty's Ordinance was enacted. \"Nevertheless, this effort to subvet1 Waller Cotmty's statutory\n\n       authority to regi.tlate solid waste processing aud disposal was un.successfol.\n\n              Pintail did not submit its proposed.

As stich, Piniail had no application pending before the\n\n     Commission when the Ordimu1ce became effective. It is, thus, tmlawfol to operate such' facilities\n\n     in the aieas proposed by Pi11tail. Therefore, the Commission may not grant any applications\n\n     from Pintail to process or dispose of municipal or indt1strial solid waste Jn Waller County at the\n\n     proposed site,\n\n             The Texas Health and Safety Code, Section 363.112 of the Comprehensive Solid Waste\n\n     Act and Section 364.012 of the County Solid Waste Control Act, crumot be construed to prohibit\n\n     a couniy from enacting solid waste legislation where a :person simply mails an incomplete solid\n\n     waste application to tlie Commission. Such a detennination would be contrary to tl1e plain\n\n      language of the applicable statutes and adrnin.islrative code prnvisions. Such prov:isi ons provide\n\n     that a partial applicaiion for a land-use detemrinatfon does not constitute a request that ilie\n\n      Commission autliorize a permit for the operation of a municipal solid waste facUiiy. It merely\n\n      requests the Commission to determine whether such a facility would be acceptable at a particular\n\n      location, on the basis of land-use only. Any response from the Commission in response to the\n\n      partial applicaii.on would be merely prelimimuy to the filing of 111<:i full application.         A\n\n      substantive review of a perrnlt application cl!llnot begin until all parts of the application are\n\n      st1bmitted and detennined by the ExeclltiVe Director to be admllustmtive]y complete, Further, the\n\n      Commission's rules provide that the Executive Director cannot take action on any application\n\n      un(i] he has determined that they are tech11icaDy complete.\n\n             Construing a partial application for a land-use only determination or a deficient Transfer\n\n      Station registration application as an actual pe1mit application pending before the Co=nssion\n\n      would also contravene the rules of statutory construction. Jn enacting Sections 363.112 and\n\n      364.012, it is presmned that a just and reasonable result is i11teuded, and tl1at public interest is\n\n      favored over any private interest. Tex.

As !h\\s is a matter of\n\n      public   intere~t,   the statutes prescribe that solid waste ordinan,aes be publicized and that public\n\n      interest be considered before they are enacted. The provisions h1 these statutes limiting solid\n\n      waste prohibitions in areas where permit applications are pen.diDg before the Commission do not\n\n      favor a private i!1terest over a public interest.                Consequently, these statutes should not be\n\n      construed to allow a private aDtor to subvert the legislative authority of a commissioners 0011rt by\n\n      filing documents with the Commission that in substance are merely a request for a deterrn.ination\n\n      about land-use, and wholly fail to meet the relevant statutory and administrative criteria for an\n\n      application for a solid waste facility. The consequence of such a constructiou would endorse the\n\n      filing of sham applications in efforts to avoid the rule of law.\n\n                                                                IV.\n                                                          Conclusion\n               For these reasons, Waller County requests 1l1at the Executive Director determine that the\n\n      Waller County Commissioners Court enacted its Ordinance on August 26, 2011, exercising the\n\n      foll authority confon·ed on !he County under Sections 363.112 and 364.012 of the Texail Health\n\n       and Safety Code, to prohibit the processing and disposal of solid waste in oortain areas of Waller\n\n       Count9. At the time the Ordinance was enacted, Pintail did not have a permit application for its\n\n       Proposed Landfill or a registration application for its proposed Tral)sfer Station pending before\n\n       Commission.

Waller\n          County requested an expedited decision on this Request. On July 31, 2012, we received a letter from\n          the Chief Clerk, Bridget C. Bohac, stating that \"our comments will be considered by the staff prior to\n          the final decision on the application.\"\n                   As previously requested, we seek a determination that the Waller County Ordinance prohibits\n          the processing aµd disposal of solid waste at tbe proposed Pintail site. Further, we request that YDL!\n          detem1ine that Pintail failed to submit applications that met the relevant statL~tory and administrative\n          criteria before the adoption of the county ordinance. Therefore, further considoration of these\n          applications by the TCEQ is unnecessary as Pintail cannot obtain the requisite permit and\n          registration, as a matter oflaw. Waller County re-Urges its request for an expedited decision on these\n          matters.\n                  Thank you for your time and attention to the matter.

Introduction\n\n          Our firm represents Citizens Against the Landfill in Hempstead (\"CALH\") in\n\nthe above-referenced matters.          CALH is an organization with over 400 members\n\ncomprised of Waller County landowners, residents, business owners, and many\n\nother affected parties who have legitimate reasons to oppose the above-referenced\n\nregistration as well as the larger proposed landfill facility that encompasses the\n\nproposed transfer and recycling facility.          Several of CALH's members own land,\n\nreside, and work adjacent to the proposed \"transfer station\" .and landfill site. We\n\nunderstand that the application of Pintail Landfill, L.L.C. for TCEQ Type I MSW\n\nFacility Proposed Permit No. 2377 (landfill permit) is also under review by the\n\n\n\n     111 Congress Avenue, Suite 500 ·Austin, TX 78701- Tel: (512) 479-8888 ·Fax: (512) 482-6891\n                                   Other Offices - Washington, D.C.\n\fPage2\n\n\n        TCEQ, which proposes to include the Type V transfer station registration and\n\n        recycling center within the landfill facility.\n\n               Thousands of comments and hearing requests have already been filed\n\n        regarding the landfill permit and this registration. We hereby include and reiterate\n\n        all other comments in opposition to the landfill application and transfer station\n\n        registration stated in the TCEQ records for both matters, and on behalf of CALH\n\n        and its members, we hereby formally request the Type V transfer station\n\n        registration (New Municipal Solid Waste Facility Registration Application No.\n\n        40259) be denied. In the alternative, we respectfully request that the matter be\n\n        consolidated with the consideration of the proposed Pintail Landfill Permit\n\n        Application for the MSW facility that is to be located at the same site as the facility\n\n        that is the subject of this registration (J\\1SW Facility Proposed Permit No. 2377).\n\n              As adjacent landowners and neighboring businesses, CALH's members will\n\n        be adversely affected by the proposed landfill and transfer station in a manner not\n\n        common to members of the general public. Due to their close proximity, these\n\n        individuals and families will be adversely impacted by the increased truck traffic\n\n        traveling to and from the proposed trash facilities, will be impacted by the nuisance\n\n        odors and wind-blown trash emanating from the trash operations, and will face a\n\n        real threat to quantity and quality of their drinking water that comes from the\n\n        shallow aquifer that lies beneath the proposed facilities. These members rely on\n\n        this aquifer as their sole source of drinking water, and the trash facilities are\n\n        proposed to be situated on the sandy recharge zone of this aquifer. Additionally,\n\fPage 3\n\n\n\n         those members of CALH living downstream from the proposed trash facilities on\n\n         Clear Creek will be impacted by the pollution and potential flooding caused by the\n\n         increased runoff containing contaminants from the trash facilities.\n\n         II.    Summary\n\n                In summary, CALH comments that the proposed Transfer Station must be\n\n         permitted, not just registered, under the applicable rules.                 The registration\n\n         application plainly states that the applicant is not just requesting a transfer\n\n         station, but rather, is seeking a recycling facility. 1 Therefore, a mere registration is\n\n         inadequate and TCEQ should deny the registration application. Even if TCEQ were\n\n         to consider the application, a registration for a waste separation/recycling facility\n\n         can only be considered after a final decision is rendered on the pending Pintail\n\n         MSW landfill application at the same location.             Therefore, consideration of the\n\n         registration application at this time is premature,. and would violate TCEQ rules.\n\n         Additionally, the Applicant failed to supplement its application with the crucial fact\n\n         that there is a County Ordinance prohibiting disposal of waste at the proposed\n\n         location. The County Ordinance was passed soon afterthe registration application\n\n         was filed, and Pintail has failed to satisfy the obligation to supplement its\n\n         application to correct this inaccuracy. Finally, this registration application should\n\n         have already been returned to the applicant. Even with all the above-referenced\n\n         defects, the Applicant has been afforded five (5) separate Technical Notices of\n\n\n         1 \"Pintail Landfill, LLC expects to begin a C&D waste recycling and transfer operation prior to\n         commencement of landfill operations.\" See Exhibit 1: Registration Application, Part 1 Fmm - Part\n         I, page I-1.\n\fPage 4\n\n\n         Deficiency (NODs) and two (2) extensions of time to respond to the NO D's from the\n\n         TCEQ. This is in direct conflict with the TCEQ's previous warnings to the applicant\n\n         and the TCEQ policies outlined in the MSW Registration Application Process\n\n         description, which is located in the TCEQ Sunset Evaluation Report. In its First\n\n         Technical NOD dated October 27, 2011, the TCEQ flatly warned the applicant that\n\n         the TCEQ did not \"anticipate granting an extension of time to fulfill this request\",\n\n         and that a \"third notice of technical deficiency will not be issued.\" How many bites\n\n         of the apple does Pintail get to adequately respond to the numerous concerns\n\n         outlined by the TCEQ staff regarding this proposed \"transfer station\" and recycling\n\n         facility?   For these reasons, and for all other reasons raised by commenters on the\n\n         Pintail Transfer Facility Registration Application and the Pintail Landfill\n\n         Application,   we respectfully request that the TCEQ summarily deny the\n\n         registration application.   In the alternative, we request that the TCEQ consolidate\n\n         this registration request with the consideration of the pending landfill permit\n\n         application, and abstain from considering this registration until after a final\n\n         decision is rendered on the pending Pintail MSW landfill application at the same\n\n         location, in accordance with TCEQ rules.\n\n         HI.    A Permit (Not a Mere Registration) Is Required to Operate the\n                Proposed \"Transfer Facility,\" Which Is Actually A Recycling\n                Processing Facility. Because No Permit Application Was Filed,\n                TCEQ Should Deny the Registration Application.\n\n                30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.7 requires a permit for any activity of storage,\n\n         processing, removal, or disposal of any solid waste, except as provided by § 330.9\n\fPage 5\n\n\n         (and a few other sections that do not apply here). A recycling facility may .only be\n\n         authorized through registration at a permitted MSVV facility owned by the permitee.\n\n         30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.9(c).             In other words, a recycling facility reqmres a\n\n         separate permit when there is no existing MSW permit.\n\n                 In this case, the Applicant seeks a registration for a recycling facility when\n\n         there is no existing MSW permit. 2 Such an application is illegal under TCEQ rules.\n\n         Under the applicable rule, § 330.9(c), the Applicant is required to seek a permit for\n\n         a processing facility that performs waste-separation/recycling activities.\n\n                 Making matters worse, the Applicant seeks to circumvent the required\n\n         permitting process by incorporating its unauthorized recycling application into a\n\n         registration for a transfer facility.s          Transfer facilities, recycling facilities, and\n\n         waste-separation/recycling facilities are each different under the rules. 4 Each type\n\n         of facility presents different environmental challenges and consequences.\n\n\n\n         z The registration application states, \"A permit application for the Pintail Landfill (Proposed Permit\n         No. MSW-2377) has been filed with TCEQ and is currently pending. Requests for authorizations to\n         operate the composting and C&D facilities in conjunction with the Pintail Landfill will be submitted.\n         However, in order to meet expected demand and to initiate a market for incoming C&D waste\n         materials, Pintail Landfill, LLC expects to begin a C&D waste recycling and transfer operation prior\n         to coniniencenient of landfill operations. This registration application, is being subniitted to obtain\n         authorization for this initial phase C&D waste recycling and transfer operation to be conducted on\n         the same site on which the Pintail Landfill will eventually be developed. It is anticipated that the\n         C&D waste recycling and transfer facility will operate for no more than five years pursuant to this\n         registration and that subsequent C&D waste processing and recycling will be conducted under\n         further authorizations.\" See Exhibit 1: Registration Application, Part 1 Form - Part I, page I-1\n         (emphasis added).\n         ' See id.; see also 30 Tex.

This type of\n\n         transfer operation is not what the Applicant seeks, as described in the application.\n\n                 There are real-life environmental consequences when the permitting process\n\n         is circumvented.       The process exists to protect the environment and the public.\n\n         Here, it is the members of CALH and the environment that stand to lose if this\n\n         registration application is granted. The rules are clear-a permit is required. The\n\n         Applicant impermissibly seeks to operate an unpermitted recycling facility under\n\n         the registration process. For this reason alone, the TCEQ should summarily deny\n\n         the Transfer Station Application, which is illegal under applicable rules.\n\n         IV.    If TCEQ Considers Applicant's Illegal Registration Application, the\n                MSW Landfill Application Must Be Considered Before Taking Action\n                on the Registration Application\n\n                As previously discussed, waste separation/recycling facilities require a\n\n         separate permit when there is no existing MSW permit. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §\n\n         330.7 (requiring a permit); 30 Tex. Admin.

Therefore, the Pintail Registration\n\n         Application, which includes recycling activities, cannot be considered without first\n\n         making a final determination on Pintail's MSW Application.        The TCEQ should\n\n         flatly deny the improper recycling registration because no MSW permit exists.\n\n         However, if the registration application is to be considered, the TCEQ must at least\n\n         refrain from considering it until a final decision is rendered on the pending Pintail\n\n         MSW landfill application at the same location.\n\n         V.     Applicant Failed to Supplement Its Application With the County\n                Ordinance Prohibiting a Landfill at the Location\n\n                Applicant has failed to uphold its duty to supplement its application by\n\n         neglecting to inform the TCEQ that a County ordinance exists prohibiting disposal\n\n         at the location.     The Applicant has a duty to supplement information that is\n\n         incorrect. Indeed, the affidavit attached to the application is a statement by the\n\n         preparer that the information is \"true, accurate, and complete.\" Furthermore, every\n\n         MS'.V permit recognizes this duty with a standard permit condition-\"[w]here the\n\n         perrnittee becomes aware that it failed to submit any relevant facts in a permit\n\n         application, or submitted incorrect information in an application, or in any report to\n\n         the executive director, it shall promptly submit such facts or information.\" 6 This\n\n         duty makes sense. Permits should not be granted upon false information.\n\n                The registration application was filed on 8/2/2011 and stated that no County\n\n         ordinance existed prohibiting disposal at the location. See Exhibit 2: Registration\n\n\n\n         s 30 Tex. Admin. Code§ 305.125(19).\n\fPage 8\n\n\n         Application Excerpt (Denial that County Ordinance Exists):                         However, Waller\n\n         County Ordinance No. 2011-001 was passed less than a month later, on August 26,\n\n         2011.      Furthermore, Applicant regularly attends Waller County Commissioners'\n\n         meetings and has met with the County Commissioners on multiple occasions. Yet,\n\n         Applicant chose not to abide by its duty to supplement its application. Applicant\n\n         chose not to disclose the County ordinance that prohibits disposal at its proposed\n\n         location.\n\n                 Under 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.57(d), the application should have been\n\n         returned for incomplete information.7 Now, more than one year later, there has still\n\n         been no supplement by Applicant.                Therefore, the application should be denied\n\n         because the assertion that no County ordinance prohibits disposal at the location is\n\n         false and Applicant knew better. 8\n\n         VI.     Applicant Received Five Technical Notices of Deficiency and Two\n                 Extensions to Respond, when Initially Informed there Would be No\n                 Extensions and Only 2 NOD's\n\n                 In the initial Technical NOD9 dated October 27, 2011, the TCEQ reviewer of\n\n         the registration wrote, \"we do not anticipate granting an extension of time to fulfill\n\n         this request. Also, please be aware a third notice of technical deficiency will not be\n\n         issued.\"     The reviewer also stated in the same correspondence that \"Failure to\n\n\n         130 Tex. Admin. Code§ 330.57(d) (\"Failure of the owner or operator to provide complete information\n         as required by this chapter may be cause for the executive director to return the application without\n         further action ...\" \"Submission of false information shall constitute grounds for denial of the permit or\n         registration application.\")\n         8Jd.\n         9 Although this Technical NOD was labeled the First Technical NOD, there was actually\n         correspondence from the TCEQ dated August 15, 2011 that was labeled \"Preliminary Review\" asking\n         for information to be added to the original registration request.\n\f                                                                                                  ---------\n\n\n\n\nPage 9\n\n\n         submit a satisfactory response to each of the noted deficiencies may result in the\n\n         application being returned due to technical deficiencies.\" These statements by staff\n\n         are consistent with TCEQ policies, as recently expressed in its TCEQ Sunset\n\n         Evaluation Reportrn As stated in the report, which is a flowchart of the MSW\n\n         Registration Application Process, applications are returned to the applicant after an\n\n         applicant unsuccessfully resolves the Second NOD.\n\n                Regardless of these statements and the dissonance with applicable TCEQ\n\n         policies, on December 2, 2011, an extension was granted to allow Pintail additional\n\n         time to respond to the First NOD. Pintail did respond on January 18, 2012, but the\n\n         response was again inadequate, as the reviewer sent another request for additional\n\n         information on February 17, 2012. And, even though it is labeled \"First Technical\n\n         Notice of Deficiency\", the letter is clearly an indication that Pintail did not submit a\n\n         satisfactory response to each of the noted deficiencies in the first technical notice of\n\n         deficiency. As such, it appears the application should have been returned at this\n\n         time. However, not only was the registration not returned, Pintail was granted yet\n\n         another extension to respond to the Third Technical NOD.11 Despite the statements\n\n         from TCEQ staff that there would not be more two (2) NODs, this pattern continued\n\n         for a total of six (6) NODs.\n\n\n\n\n         10 See Exhibit 4: MSW Registration Application Process, TCEQ Sunset Evaluation Report, October\n         2009, SFR-089 (contemplating only two (2) Notices of Deficiency (NODs) before retmning an\n         application for an MSW registration).\n         11 Interestingly, this Technical NOD was not given a number (nor were the two subsequent NODs of\n\n         June 25, 2012 and August 16, 2012, given a number), but by our count it is actually the Fourth NOD\n         when you count the \"Preliminary Review\".\n\f----   -----------                                                                     - - - - - - - - - -- - - - -\n\n\n\n\n       Page 10\n\n\n                   The application should have been returned after the Second NOD, in\n\n             accordance with the TCEQ's policy and the TCEQ staffs statements. Allow:iJ.1g the\n\n             Applicant to continue to inadequately respond to more than two (2) Technical\n\n             NOD's is a departure from normal policy, and should not be allowed by the\n\n             Commission. For this reason alone, the transfer and recycling facility registration\n\n             application should be denied.\n\n             VIII. Conclusion\n\n                   The proposed \"Transfer Station\" must be permitted, not merely registered,\n\n             under the applicable rules.     It is not a transfer station, but a recycling facility.\n\n             Therefore, a mere registration is inadequate and TCEQ should deny the\n\n             registration application.     Even if TCEQ were to consider the application, a\n\n             registration for a waste separation/recycling facility can only be considered after a\n\n             final decision is rendered on the pending Pintail MSW Landfill Application at the\n\n             same location. Therefore, consideration of the registration application at this time\n\n             is premature, and approval would violate TCEQ rules. Additionally, the Applicant\n\n             failed to supplement its application with the crucial fact that there is a County\n\n             Ordinance prohibiting disposal of waste at the proposed location.         Finally, this\n\n             registration application should have already been returned to the applicant. the\n\n             Applicant has been afforded five (5) separate Technical Notices of Deficiency\n\n             (NODs) and two (2) extensions of time to respond to the NOD's from the TCEQ.\n\n             This is in direct conflict with the TCEQ's previous warnings to the applicant and\n\f                                                                 -----------------\n\n\n\n\nPage 11\n\n\n      the TCEQ policies outlined in the MS\\V Registration Application Process, and\n\n      should result in denial of the registration application.\n\n            For these reasons, and for all other reasons raised by commenters opposed to\n\n      the Pintail Transfer Facility Registration Application and the Pintail Landfill\n\n      Application, we respectfully request that the TCEQ summarily deny the\n\n      registration application.    In the alternative, we request that the TCEQ abstain\n\n      from considering this matter until after a final decision is rendered on the pending _\n\n      Pintail MSW landfill application at the same location.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Michael L.

A permit application for the Pintail Landfill\n{Proposed Permit No. MSW-2377) has been filed with TCEQ and is currently pending.\nRequests for authorizations to operate the composting and C&D facilities in conjunction\nwith the Pintail Landfill will be submitted. However, in order to meet expected demand\nand to initiate a market for incoming C&D waste materials, Pintail Landfill, LLC expects\nto begin a C&D waste recycling and transfer operation prior to commencement of landfill\noperations. This registration application is being submitted to obtain authorization for\nthis initial phase C&D waste recycling and transfer operation to be conducted on the\nsame site on which the Pintail Landfill will eventually be developed. It is anticipated that\nthe C&D waste recycling and transfer facility will operate for no more than five years\npursuant to this registration and that subsequent C&D waste processing and recycling\nwill be conducted under further authorizations.\n\nPintail Landfill, LLC intends to register and operate a Type V municipal solid waste\ntransfer station in northwest Waller County off State Highway 6. The Pintail Landfill\nTransfer Station will be a Type V municipal solid waste transfer facility that will accept\nonly construction and demolition wastes. The site entrance will be located about 1 mile\nnorth of the intersection of State Highway 6 and US Highway 290 off of Wendt Road, on\nthe east side of State Highway 6. The proposed facility is intended to provide transfer\nand recycling capabilities for construction and demolition. waste for the City of\nHempstead, Waller County, and the surrounding areas. The facility will be designed to\nprotect the health and safety of the people in the region.\n\nThis application has been prepared consistent with 30 TAC Chapter 330 Municipal Solid\nWaste Management Regulations {MSWMR) adopted by the Texas Commission on\nEnvironmental Quality (TCEQ), effective March 27, 2006 and May 29, 2008.\n\nIt is intended that this registration be processed in accordance with §330.9(b){3), which\nallows for a transfer station facility to be registered if the facility will transfer 125 tons per\nday or less. The proposed Pintail Landfill Transfer Station will transfer less than 125\ntons per day.\n\nPart I of this registration application contains information about the site and the applicant\nas required in 30 TAC §§281.5, 305.45, and 330.59. Part II of the registration\napplication describes the existing conditions and character of the facility and\nsurrounding area as required in §330.61.

Policy; Findings\n\n   (a) It is this state's policy and the purpose of this chapter to safeguard the health, welfare, and physical property of\nthe people and to protect the environment by controlling the management of solid waste, including accounting for haz-\nardous waste that is generated.\n    (b) The storage, processing, and disposal of hazardous waste at municipal solid waste facilities pose a risk to public\nhealth and the environment, and in order to protect the environment and to provide measures for adequate protection of\npublic health, it is in the public interest to require hazardous waste to be stored, processed, and disposed of only at per-\nmitted hazardous industrial solid waste facilities.\n\nHISTORY: Enacted by Acts 1989, 71st Leg., ch. 678 (H.B. 2136), § 1, effective September 1, 1989; am.

Substantial evidence in the record supported the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's finding that a\nlandfill owner's expansion application was administratively and technically complete because the owner had included\nall necessary information in the application, and while some witnesses could not independently verify particular docu-\nments or exhibits, there was nothing in the record that cast doubt upon the information, and the opponents to the appli-\ncation did not introduce any contrary exhibits to demonstrate that the limited evidence was altered or falsified. Because\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 2\n                                          Tex.

Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission was performing its duty under Tex. Health and Safety Code Ann.\n§ 361.002(b) of the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act, Tex. Health and Safety Code Ann. §§ 361.001, et seq., by carefully\nscrutinizing every aspect of a company's process denying a company's application for hazardous wastes disposal per-\nmits. Hunter Indus. Facilities v. Texas Natural Resource Conservation Comm'n, 910 S.W.2d 96, 1995 Tex. App. LEXIS\n2515 (Tex. App. Austin 1995).\n\n\n\n4. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's findings did not conflict with its decision to grant a landfill permit,\nthe company complied with rule requirements of the rule, and conclusions that the proposed groundwater-monitoring\nsystem would adequately monitor the groundwater and will protect the groundwater, human health, and the environment\nwas also arbitrary or capricious. City of Jacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex.\nApp. Austin Feb. 10 2012).\n\n5. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) was required to make findings that supported its determina-\ntions that the statutory requirements, for purposes of Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.002 and Tex. Gov't Code\nAnn. § 2001.141(b), (d), for approving a permit application had been met, and TCEQ made 200 findings supporting its\ndecision to grant the permit; given this, and that substantial evidence supported a finding that there were no springs near\nthe proposed landfill, the court would have subjected the order to a hypertechnical standard of review if the court found\nthe order to be arbitrary and capricious because TCEQ failed to make a negative finding of fact concerning the existence\nof springs. City of Jacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 10\n2012).\n\n\n\n6. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's (TCEQ) interpretation of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.56(f)(4)(A)(iv)\nto require an analysis of stormwater discharge impact only at the permit boundary did not conflict with Tex. Health &\nSafety Code Ann. § 361.002(a) because it was reasonable, not in conflict with the rule's plain language, and concerned a\nmatter within the administrative expertise of the TCEQ. Heritage v.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's (TCEQ) interpretation of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.56(f)(4)(A)(iv)\ndid not conflict with Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.002(a) because the TCEQ's interpretation of its rule as re-\nquiring consideration of discharge impact only at the permit boundary did not conflict with the TCEQ's statutory man-\ndate to safeguard the health, welfare, and physical property of the people and to protect the environment.

Group's substantial rights were not prejudiced by the addition of the special provision to the landfill application,\nbecause the appellate court could not see how the group had been harmed by the Texas Commission on Environmental\nQuality adopting a permit that provided more groundwater monitoring than was required by the administrative rules,\nwhen the permit not only satisfied the rules' requirements that groundwater from the uppermost aquifer be monitored, as\nit must, but it also provided for extra monitoring of groundwater that the evidence showed was not in the uppermost\naquifer.

Review Under Substantial Evidence Rule or Undefined Scope of Review\n\n   If the law authorizes review of a decision in a contested case under the substantial evidence rule or if the law does\nnot define the scope of judicial review, a court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the state agency on\nthe weight of the evidence on questions committed to agency discretion but:\n        (1) may affirm the agency decision in whole or in part; and\n       (2) shall reverse or remand the case for further proceedings if substantial rights of the appellant have been preju-\ndiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions are:\n          (A) in violation of a constitutional or statutory provision;\n          (B) in excess of the agency's statutory authority;\n           (C) made through unlawful procedure;\n           (D) affected by other error of law;\n           (E) not reasonably supported by substantial evidence considering the reliable and probative evidence in the\nrecord as a whole; or\n           (F) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discre-\ntion.\n\nHISTORY: Enacted by Acts 1993, 73rd Leg., ch. 268 (S.B. 248), § 1, effective September 1, 1993.\n\nLexisNexis (R) Notes:\n\n\n\nCASE NOTES\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 2\n                                               Tex.

Texas Railroad Commission's rejection of a gas company's fee assessment against residents of outlying areas was not\nsupported by substantial evidence because the Commission's order did not satisfy requirements for findings of fact.\nCenterPoint Energy Entex v. R.R. Comm'n, 213 S.W.3d 364, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 3518 (Tex. App. Austin 2006).\n\n\n\n2. In an appeal arising from a dispute over a highway construction contract between a contractor and the Texas Depart-\nment of Transportation, the decision of the Department's executive director to reject an administrative law judge's\n(ALJ's) proposed findings based on credibility was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion where the ALJ,\nnot the executive director, heard the testimony and observed the demeanor of the witnesses, and where the executive\ndirector failed to comply with Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 201.112(c) by not providing a written statement for each indi-\nvidual change to the ALJ's findings of fact and conclusions of law that explained his rationale for each change, and his\nchanges to particular findings and conclusions proposed by the ALJ suggested he was acting as the Department's fact-\nfinder, despite the legislature having delegated that responsibility to the ALJ in § 201.112(b). By failing to comply with\nthe requirement to provide a written statement containing the reason and legal basis for changing the ALJ's findings and\nconclusions, the executive director's decision in his final order raised serious due process concerns, and without know-\ning on what facts the executive director relied to make his finding of credible evidence, there was no rational connection\nbetween the facts and his decision. Jordan Paving Corp. v. Tex. DOT, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 3878 (Tex. App. Austin\nJune 3 2009).\n\n\n\n3. Trial court erred in finding that a notice of an enforcement action hearing before the Texas Alcoholic Beverage\nCommission (TABC) was ineffective because evidence that the TABC sent the notice to the licensee at the address in-\ndicated in the TABC's records and that it received a signed green card in return was substantial evidence under Tex.\nAlco. Bev. Code Ann. § 11.67(b) and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2) for the TABC's finding that the licensee had\nactual notice; the agency was entitled to resolve conflicts in the evidence, and, here, the evidence could have supported\na finding either way. The trial court impermissibly substituted its judgment for that of the agency as the agency's resolu-\ntion of the issues of any \"address problems\" and the green card signature was not unreasonable. Tex. Alcoholic Bev.\nComm'n v. Aga Trading, Inc., 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 7842 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. Oct. 8 2009).\n\n4. Substantial evidence in the record supported the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's finding that a\nlandfill owner's expansion application was administratively and technically complete because the owner had included\nall necessary information in the application, and while some witnesses could not independently verify particular docu-\nments or exhibits, there was nothing in the record that cast doubt upon the information, and the opponents to the appli-\ncation did not introduce any contrary exhibits to demonstrate that the limited evidence was altered or falsified. Because\nthe application was determined to be administratively and technically complete prior to the contested case hearing, the\nowner was not required to establish at the contested-case hearing that its application complied with each administrative\nand technical requirement because it had already done so prior to the hearing. Citizens Against Landfill Location v. Tex.\nComm'n on Envtl. Quality, 169 S.W.3d 258, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 3583 (Tex. App. Austin 2005).\n\n5. Trial court did not err in reversing the county civil service commission's holding that the suspended employee could\nbe suspended as the constable's failure to show up at a hearing implicated the suspended employee's substantial rights\nand prejudiced him; suspended employee was entitled to have an order entered, pursuant to the civil service commis-\nsion's own rules, nullifying the entire action against him. Bexar County Civ. Serv. Comm'n v. Casals, 63 S.W.3d 57,\n2001 Tex. App. LEXIS 6561 (Tex. App. San Antonio 2001).\n\n6. Substantial evidence existed to support administrative law judge's findings that widow was excluded from receiving\nbenefits under insurance policy when evidence showed her dead husband was driving truck that overturned, killing\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 3\n                                               Tex.

App. LEXIS 4997 (Tex. App. Austin 2001).\n\n\n\n7. Pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(F), the Board of Trustees for the Employees Retirement System of\nTexas (ERS) acted arbitrarily and capriciously and abused its discretion in terminating a disability retiree's occupational\ndisability retirement benefits, resulting in the retiree's substantial rights being prejudiced, because due process and fun-\ndamental principals of fairness dictated that the Board should have provided meaningful notice to the retiree before ap-\nplying its new 80 percent threshold standard in 34 Tex. Admin. Code § 73.17, which construed Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\n814.208(d), to his post disability earnings to terminate his benefits; being advised of the Board's construction of \"com-\nparable pay\" to include its 80 percent threshold standard at the hearing was not sufficient notice to satisfy due process\nconcerns, and a 2005 letter advising the retiree that his benefits had been terminated similarly was not sufficient, and,\nthus, prior to his hearing, the retiree did not have meaningful notice that earning 80 percent of his adjusted final annual\nstate salary could cause his benefits to be terminated. Patton v. Employees Ret. Sys. of Tex., 2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 9901\n(Tex. App. Austin Dec. 19 2007).\n\n\n\n8. Granting of a certificate of convenience and necessity to the power and light company was proper where the applica-\ntion adequately addressed the factors of probable improvement of service or lowering of costs to consumers; further, the\nevidence supported that the individuals had notice of ex parte communications and an opportunity to address them, Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. §§ 2001.061, 2001.174.

In an appeal arising from a dispute over a highway construction contract between a contractor and the Texas Depart-\nment of Transportation, the decision of the Department's executive director to reject an administrative law judge's\n(ALJ's) proposed findings based on credibility was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion where the ALJ,\nnot the executive director, heard the testimony and observed the demeanor of the witnesses, and where the executive\ndirector failed to comply with Tex.

Jordan Paving Corp. v. Tex. DOT, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 3878 (Tex. App. Austin\nJune 3 2009).\n\n\n\n10. By expressly excluding a decision on a disqualification for a foul from appeal, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 179e, §\n3.08(b) makes other decisions on disqualification of racehorses appealable by implication; thus, an owner whose horses\nwere disqualified for wearing the wrong saddle cloth numbers had a right to an administrative appeal, and his request\nfor declaratory relief under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.004 fell within the ultra vires exception to sovereign\nimmunity. The trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to make further rulings on the merits until the owner ex-\nhausted administrative remedies as provided in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 179e, §§ 3.02, 3.08 and Tex. Gov't Code\nAnn. § 2001.174. Tex. Racing Comm'n v. Marquez, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6653 (Tex. App. Austin Aug. 19 2011).\n\n11. Agency was in violation of takings clause when it ordered what amounted to a physical taking of appellant's cables\nand facilities; the order was beyond the authority of the agency, thus the court was statutorily required under Tex. Gov't\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 4\n                                                 Tex.

R.R. Comm'n, 213 S.W.3d 364, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 3518 (Tex. App. Austin 2006).\n\n\n\n13. Text of 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.56(d)(4)(J) is clear, but even if the court found that the text of this rule was am-\nbiguous, the court had to to give serious deference to the agency's reasonable interpretation. City of Jacksboro v. Two\nBush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 10 2012).\n\n14. 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 25.263(l)(3) was held to be invalid as it was inconsistent with the legislature's intent, ex-\npessed in Tex. Util. Code Ann. ch. 39 of the Texas Public Utility Regulatory Act, that utilities could fully recover their\nnet, verifiable, nonmitigable stranded costs incurred in purchasing power and providing electric generation service, that\nexisted on the last day of the freeze period (December 31, 2001). A two- or three-year gap in recovery of carrying costs\nwould not have permitted the companies full recovery of their stranded costs as the legislature envisioned. Centerpoint\nEnergy, Inc. v. PUC of Tex., 2004 Tex. LEXIS 540, 47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 672 (Tex. 2004), opinion withdrawn by, substi-\ntuted opinion at 143 S.W.3d 81, 2004 Tex. LEXIS 881, 47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1156 (Tex. 2004).\n\n\n\n15. Enforced suspension of appellee's pharmacist license by the Texas State Board of Pharmacy concurrently with the\nsuspension of her North Carolina license resulted from the improper application of a \"rule\" as that term was defined in\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.003(6). The Board's informally announced re-\nciprocal-sanctions policy was invalid under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2), because it not adopted in accordance\nwith the APA's rulemaking procedures. Tex. State Bd. of Pharm. v. Witcher, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 5482 (Tex. App.\nAustin May 3 2013).\n\n\n\n16. Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 1051.703(a) of the Architecture Practice Act did not categorically preclude licensed engi-\nneers from preparing comprehensive building plans and specifications for the class of public works projects identified in\nthat section, nor did Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 1051.601 categorically exempt licensed engineers from the Act's require-\nments. Instead, the enforcement matter at issue depended on whether preparation of the engineers' particular building\nplans and specifications was within the scope and practice of engineering as defined by the Engineering Practice Act;\nbecause the record was insufficiently developed to determine that issue as a matter of law, summary disposition was not\nappropriate, and therefore the district court did not abuse its discretion in reversing the Board's decision and remanding\nthe case for further proceedings. Winton v. Tex. Bd. of Architectural Examiners (in re Rogers), 390 S.W.3d 377, 2011\nTex. App. LEXIS 6110 (Tex. App. Austin 2011).\n\n17. Basis of the business owner's declaratory-judgment action was simply that the Texas Department of Licensing and\nRegulation (Department) had no authority to regulate eyebrow threading because eyebrow threading did not constitute\nthe practice of cosmetology, and although she presented several constitutional arguments as to how the Department's\nactions affected her individually, she made no broad constitutional challenge to the entire statutory scheme; her consti-\ntutional arguments could be asserted under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and because the relief the owner\nsought under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act would be considered \"redundant\" of her APA judicial-review\nclaim, she failed to invoke the district court's subject-matter jurisdiction to grant such relief, and the district court should\nhave dismissed those claims. Kuntz v. Khan, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 7252 (Tex. App. Austin Aug. 31 2010).\n\n18. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 expressly authorizes courts reviewing agency decisions to affirm in whole or in\npart, and requires courts to reverse or remand for further proceedings when an agency's errors deprive a party of sub-\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 5\n                                               Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\nstantial rights; an affirmance in part with a remand necessarily implies that the issues affirmed are resolved and that the\nremaining issues will be disposed of in some other way; otherwise, if a remand to an agency necessarily meant that all\nissues were subject to being re-litigated, there would be no point in the court affirming any portion of the agency ruling\nand no reason for the legislature to have included affirmance in part as an option for the court. Freightliner Corp. v.\nMotor Vehicle Bd. of the Tex. DOT, 255 S.W.3d 356, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 3191 (Tex. App. Austin 2008).\n\n19. While Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2) requires a reviewing court to reverse or remand a case for further pro-\nceedings in the face of agency error, it must be read in conjunction with Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(1); reading\nthese two sections together, a court does not construe Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2) as a limitation on the court's\nability in Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(1) to affirm an agency decision in whole or in part; instead, a reviewing\ncourt may affirm part of an agency's order while also reversing part of that same order. Granek v. Tex. State Bd. of Med.\nExaminers, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 2025 (Tex. App. Austin Mar. 19 2008).\n\n20. Remand for further administrative proceedings was proper under the primary jurisdiction doctrine after a trial court\nerred in denying a manufacturer's plea to the jurisdiction in a dealership transfer case; however, the remand order could\nnot require the agency to act. Ford Motor Co. v. Butnaru, 157 S.W.3d 142, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 465 (Tex. App. Austin\n2005).\n\n21. Pursuant to Tex. Water Code Ann. §§ 11.021(a), 11.022, 11.121, and 11.046(c), the Texas Commission on Envi-\nronmental Quality incorrectly concluded that the city's effluent remained private groundwater that could be diverted\nwithout an appropriation permit; notwithstanding the city's stated intent not to abandon its effluent, the physical reality\nof the city's reuse project was that the effluent was abandoned to the public domain once the city discharged it into the\nSan Marcos River where it was admittedly commingled and diluted by that state watercourse. City of San Marcos v.\nTex. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, 128 S.W.3d 264, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 96 (Tex. App. Austin 2004).\n\n22. In applying Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(D), the parties agreed that the reviewing court based its decision on\nan event which occurred after the ALJ rendered her decision. The statute encompassed events occurring after rendition\nof the ALJ's decision. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Story, 115 S.W.3d 588, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6040 (Tex. App. Waco\n2003).\n\n23. According to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2), if the reviewing court finds any of the six categories of error\nlisted and determines that such error prejudiced the substantial rights of the party seeking review, the court must reverse\nor remand the case for further proceedings; this means that the reviewing court may reverse the administrative law\njudge's decision and render judgment in favor of the party seeking review, or reverse the ALJ's decision and remand the\ncause for further proceedings. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Story, 115 S.W.3d 588, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6040 (Tex.\nApp. Waco 2003).\n\n24. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(D) provides a catchall ground for reversal or remand to provide a remedy for\none who has suffered an adverse administrative determination affected by some legal error other than those described in\nthe other subcategories; such other error could conceivably occur during the administrative proceedings or afterward.\nTex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Story, 115 S.W.3d 588, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6040 (Tex. App. Waco 2003).\n\n25. Trial court remanded for reconsideration the penalty of cancelling a bar's mixed beverage and late hours permits\nbecause two of the grounds for revocation of the license were not supported by substantial evidence, the determination\ndid not require further evidence, and the appellate court found that the agency did not abuse its discretion in denying an\nevidentiary hearing pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2). Allen-Burch, Inc. v. Tex. Alcoholic Bev. Comm'n,\n104 S.W.3d 345, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 3945 (Tex. App. Dallas 2003).\n\n26. Trial court was not authorized to reverse and vacate the public utilities commission's order where the commission\nexceeded its statutory authority in conducting transmission cost of service proceedings; rather, the trial court should\nhave reversed and remanded the commission's order.

Code Ann. § 37.004\nagainst state agency regarding practicing cosmetology without a license as the owner had already sought judicial review\nof the agency decision under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174; the remedy would be redundant as the basis for both\nclaims was that eyebrow threading did not fall within the definition of cosmetology in Tex. Occ. Code Ann. §\n1602.002(a), a proper basis for a claim for judicial review under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(A) & (B). Kuntz v.\nKhan, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 446 (Tex. App. Austin Jan. 21 2011).\n\n\n\n28. Declaratory judgment action against the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy claiming that the Board's stand-\nards and principles were so unconstitutionally vague that they did not sufficiently identify what constituted a violation\nwas redundant as auditors, who had their professional certificates revoked or suspended, had filed an administrative\nappeal under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 901.556(a). Tex. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy v. Bass, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 294\n(Tex. App. Austin Jan. 14 2011).\n\n29. By refusing to strike the Edwards Aquifer Authority's jury demand and setting landowners' appeal of the Authority's\npermitting decision for a jury trial, a trial court failed to apply the law correctly and fundamentally altered the nature of\nthe judicial review prescribed by statute because the Authority had a clear right to proceed to a final determination\nwithout a jury, pursuant to Tex. Water Code Ann. § 36.253 and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 and Tex. Gov't Code\nAnn. § 2001.175(e). In re Edwards Aquifer Auth., 217 S.W.3d 581, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 8934 (Tex. App. San Antonio\n2006).\n\n30. Tex. Water Code Ann. § 36.253 expressly incorporates Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 and makes it applicable to\nappeals from orders made by groundwater districts. In re Edwards Aquifer Auth., 217 S.W.3d 581, 2006 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 8934 (Tex. App. San Antonio 2006).\n\n31. Under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the appellate court had to reverse when a substantial right had been preju-\ndiced because the administrative decision was affected by an error of law; the administrative law judge erred in apply-\ning the law to the facts as she found them where no necessity justification existed at the time of the driver's arrest be-\ncause his drive back to the scene was not in avoidance of any imminent harm. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Moore, 175\nS.W.3d 270, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 4401 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2004).\n\n\n\n32. In a medical license suspension case, the court erred by denying a doctor's motion for rehearing because the doctor\ntimely filed a motion for rehearing giving the Board fair notice that he was dissatisfied with its conclusions that he\nfailed to practice medicine in a manner consistent with public health and welfare and failed to treat a patient according\nto the generally accepted standard of care. Johnson v. Tex. Med. Bd., 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 845 (Tex. App. Austin Feb.\n5 2010).\n\n\n\n33. Examiner's recommendations constitute a part of 'the record as a whole\" that is the object of judicial review when a\ncourt considers substantial-evidence questions under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, and may be considered in light\nof the pertinent evidence; but such recommendations are only entitled to such value as they intrinsically command when\nagency decisionmakers depart from them. Exxon Corp. v. Railroad Comm'n, 993 S.W.2d 704, 1999 Tex. App. LEXIS\n1818, 142 Oil & Gas Rep. 165 (Tex. App. Austin 1999).\n\n34. Pursuant to the former Texas Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. §\n19(e)(5), the evidence was sufficient for the Texas Water Commission (Commission) to deny applicant permits to con-\nstruct and operate a hazardous waste facility, where the applicant proposed to store hazardous slurry in a salt dome cav-\nern, where the applicant could not guarantee that the slurry would maintain proper contact with the cavern walls, where\nthe salt dome was structurally unstable, and where tow aquifers were located above the salt dome. United Resource Re-\ncovery, Inc. v. Water Comm'n, 815 S.W.2d 797, 1991 Tex. App. LEXIS 2034 (Tex.

Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\n\n\n35. Trial court's provision of the alcohol permit application number in its judgment and finding that there was no late\nhours application did not constitute \"judgment\" within the meaning of former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13a\n(now Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174); the trial court's action did not constitute a substitution of its judgment for that\nof the County Judge, who had acted in an administrative capacity in reviewing an application for beer and wine licenses.\nAlegria v. Texas Alcoholic Beverage Comm'n., 731 S.W.2d 723, 1987 Tex. App. LEXIS 7422 (Tex. App. Houston 14th\nDist. 1987).\n\n36. Though a suspension hearing for a dentist's license contained some irregularities, especially the in and out presence\nof the overseeing board's members who were involved in decision-making regarding the dentist's license, the appeals\ncourt upheld the board's determination to suspend the dentist's license for two years in the absence of a demonstration\nthat there was no substantial justice and fair play; former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13A, § 19(e) (now Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174) required reversal if there was unlawful procedure resulting in prejudice to substantial\nrights. Blankfield v. Texas State Bd. of Dental Exmrs., 1985 Tex. App. LEXIS 6216 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. Feb. 14\n1985).\n\n\n\n37. Because it was unclear whether Texas law would allow plaintiff landowners' inverse condemnation suit for a regu-\nlatory groundwater taking, and they had not pursued compensation in state court, their Fifth Amendment takings claim\nagainst defendant water district's directors was not ripe and was dismissed without prejudice. Coates v. Hall, 512 F.\nSupp. 2d 770, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17168 (W.D. Tex. 2007).\n\n\n\n38. In an appeal concerning a rate supervision order issued by the Texas Commissioner of Insurance, which revoked an\ninsurer's ability to file and use its insurance rates without prior approval from the Texas Department of Insurance, there\nwas nothing in the order to suggest that it was not a final, completed agency action, where the only means of challeng-\ning the Commissioner's supervision order was to seek judicial review of the order, and, accordingly, the appellate court\nand the district court had jurisdiction to address the insurer's claims under Tex. Ins. Code Ann. ch. 36. Furthermore,\nseveral of the insurer's claims--that the actions for which the Commissioner placed it under supervision were not \"rating\npractices,\" that the supervision order was arbitrary and capricious, that the Commissioner acted outside his authority in\nissuing the supervision order, and that its due process rights were violated--did not require review of an administrative\nrecord, and all were authorized grounds for reversal or remand of a decision under the Administrative Procedure Act,\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 2001.051-.178. Texas Dep't of Ins. v. State Farm Lloyds, 260 S.W.3d 233, 2008 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 5563 (Tex. App. Austin 2008).\n\n39. Remand for further administrative proceedings was proper under the primary jurisdiction doctrine after a trial court\nerred in denying a manufacturer's plea to the jurisdiction in a dealership transfer case; however, the remand order could\nnot require the agency to act. Ford Motor Co. v. Butnaru, 157 S.W.3d 142, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 465 (Tex. App. Austin\n2005).\n\n40. When providing an independent right to judicial review in Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.171 of the Texas Adminis-\ntrative Procedure Act, the legislature has necessarily understood that state agencies will be sued in court by persons ex-\nercising that right, that contested-case decisions of those agencies will be judicially reviewed under the standards set\nforth in Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, and that the challenged administrative decisions will be either affirmed, re-\nversed, or remanded as provided by § 2001.174. Therefore, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.171 provides a limited waiver\nof sovereign immunity. Tex. Dep't of Protective & Regulatory Servs. v. Mega Child Care, Inc., 145 S.W.3d 170, 2004\nTex. LEXIS 780, 47 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1116 (Tex. 2004).\n\n41. Reviewing court has no authority under former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13a § 19(e) or § 19(d)(2) (now\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174) to retain jurisdiction of an appeal after it has already determined that errors of the\nadministrative agency have substantially prejudiced the rights of the appellant. Railroad Comm'n. v. Home Transp. Co.,\n654 S.W.2d 432, 1983 Tex. LEXIS 326, 26 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 564 (Tex. 1983).\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 8\n                                               Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\n\n\n42. Though a suspension hearing for a dentist's license contained some irregularities, especially the in and out presence\nof the overseeing board's members who were involved in decision-making regarding the dentist's license, the appeals\ncourt upheld the board's determination to suspend the dentist's license for two years in the absence of a demonstration\nthat there was no substantial justice and fair play; former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13A, § 19(e) (now Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174) required reversal if there was unlawful procedure resulting in prejudice to substantial\nrights. Blankfield v. Texas State Bd. of Dental Exmrs., 1985 Tex. App. LEXIS 6216 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. Feb. 14\n1985).\n\n\n\n43. Because Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 prohibits a court from substituting its judgment for a state agency's\njudgment on the weight of the evidence on questions committed to agency discretion, the trial court did not have the\nauthority to reduce the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission's sanction suspending the bar's permit. CJSA, Ltd. v.\nTexas Alcoholic Bev. Comm'n, 2001 Tex. App. LEXIS 1674 (Tex. App. San Antonio Mar. 14 2001).\n\n44. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, specifically Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, a reviewing court acts in an\nappellate capacity and may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Cash Am. Int'l, Inc. v. Bennett, 35 S.W.3d\n12, 2000 Tex. LEXIS 82, 43 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1047 (Tex. 2000).\n\n\n\n45. There is no provision in Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2) for a reviewing court to render a different judgment\nfrom an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision or to modify an order of the ALJ. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Hud-\nson, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1148 (Tex. App. Dallas Feb. 13 2012).\n\n46. Group claimed, for purposes of Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E), that its substantial rights had been preju-\ndiced by the addition of extra groundwater monitoring wells, but the court did not see how the group was harmed by the\nadoption of a permit that provided more monitoring than was required; the company's groundwater-monitoring system\nas originally submitted, without additional monitoring, complied with 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.231(a). City of\nJacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 10 2012).\n\n47. Court could not see how a group's rights were prejudiced by the addition of extra groundwater-monitoring wells to\nmonitor a stratum that was not required to be monitored, and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has the\nauthority, under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 2001.060, 2001.062(d), 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 80.259, and case law, to add\nspecial provisions to municipal-solid-waste permits after the evidentiary hearing has concluded so long as the decision\nto add the special provisions does not prejudice substantial rights. City of Jacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group,\n2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 10 2012).\n\n48. Record contained evidence regarding groundwater flow that a reasonable mind could accept as supporting the con-\nclusion that the flow was north-northeast, and absent prejudice to the group's substantial rights, reversal of the order was\nnot warranted. City of Jacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb.\n10 2012).\n\n49. Driver's license suspension was proper because the facts established probable cause that the licensee was operating a\nmotor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated for purposes of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042; witnesses at an\naccident scene reported that a pickup had rear-ended another vehicle and driven away, a license plate at the scene was\nmatched to the licensee's pickup, which was later found abandoned with front end damage, and according to the licen-\nsee's wife, the licensee called her to pick him up near the site of the abandoned pickup. After the wife drive the licensee\nto the sheriff's office, a trooper and others observed the licensee and detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage on his\nbreath. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Allen, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 4268 (Tex. App. Amarillo June 3 2011).\n\n50. There was sufficient evidence for the administrative judge to uphold the suspension of the driver's license, because\nthe driver was speeding and veering back and forth, an odor of alcohol emanated from inside the car, the driver's eyes\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 9\n                                               Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\nwere bloodshot and glassy, the driver's speech was slurred, the driver was unable to complete the one-leg-stand test and\nhe exhibited six clues of intoxication on the walk-and-turn test, and the driver displayed clues of intoxication on the\nhorizontal gaze nystagmus test and the vertical nystagmus test. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Williams, 303 S.W.3d 356,\n2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 9708 (Tex. App. El Paso 2009).\n\n51. Court erred in agreeing with the Texas Department of Insurance that self-funded plans were not insurers under Tex-\nas law, because the stop-loss insurance was reinsurance, when the companies did not make coverage decisions with\nrespect to individuals insured by the plans and had no contractual relationship with the individuals insured by the plans\nand could not be sued by them, all losses were handled by the plans and then sent to the companies for indemnification,\nand since the stop-loss insurance sold to self-funded plans was reinsurance, 28 Tex. Admin. Code §§ 3.4002 and\n3.4004(e)(2)(J) and former Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art. 3.42 did not apply to the companies. Am. Nat'l Ins. Co. v. Tex. Dep't\nof Ins., 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 9647 (Tex. App. Austin Dec. 16 2009).\n\n52. For purposes of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042, there was substantial evidence to support the administrative law\njudge's findings that probable cause existed to stop and arrest a driver, that probable cause existed to believe that he was\noperating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated, and that he was placed under arrest and was requested to\nsubmit to the taking of a breath specimen and refused to do so; thus, the trial court erred to the extent it substituted its\njudgment for the administrative law judge on those matters, for purposes of Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, and the\nerror prejudiced the Texas Department of Public Safety's substantial rights. The court affirmed the suspension of the\ndriver's license by the administrative law judge. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Woods, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 6133 (Tex.\nApp. Austin Aug. 6 2009).\n\n53. Administrative suspension of an operator's license was not subject to reversal based on a clerical error made by an\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) because it did not affect an operator's substantial rights; the ALJ relied on an improper\ndate of arrest. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Gonzales, 276 S.W.3d 88, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 7985 (Tex. App. San Antonio\n2008).\n\n54. Motorist was incorrect that, because the trial court made no findings or conclusions, its decision had to be affirmed\non any theory finding support in the evidence. Reviewing courts reviewing administrative decisions, like the suspension\nof the motorist's license under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042, had to comply with Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174.\nTex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Perkins, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 10833 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. Dec. 2 2004).\n\n55. In connection with a hearing to review the suspension of a motorist's driver's license, the motorist failed to object to\nthe introduction of an officer's report on the ground that the officer was absent, and thus, the motorist waived this issue,\nbut assuming that a supervisor's report and intoxilyzer record were improperly admitted, the admission of the officer's\nreport rendered any such error harmless because the primary source of the evidence relevant to and supporting the fac-\ntual issues before the administrative law judge was the officer's report. Most of the information in the supervisor's report\nand intoxilyzer record was also reported in the officer's report, and thus the motorist was not prejudiced by the error, if\nany, pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174. Reisel v. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 8596 (Tex.\nApp. San Antonio Sept. 29 2004).\n\n56. Trial court did not err in limiting a state medical board of examiner's consideration to the administrative law judge\nrecord on remand; the instructions did not conflict with the provision of Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 of the Ad-\nministrative Procedure Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 2001.001-.902. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Examiners v. Dunn, 2003\nTex. App. LEXIS 9833 (Tex. App. Austin Nov. 20 2003).\n\n57. Because contested-case hearings before the Motor Vehicle Board of the Texas Department of Transportation are\nheard under the APA without a specified standard of review, the substantial evidence rule applies under Tex. Gov't Code\nAnn. § 2001.174. BMW of N. Am., L.L.C. v. Motor Vehicle Bd., 115 S.W.3d 722, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6923 (Tex. App.\nAustin 2003).\n\n58. Under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, an appellate court reviews the legal conclusions of the Motor Vehicle\nBoard of the Texas Department of Transportation for errors of law, and the court reviews the board's findings of fact for\nsupport by substantial evidence. BMW of N. Am., L.L.C. v. Motor Vehicle Bd., 115 S.W.3d 722, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS\n6923 (Tex.

Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\n\n\n59. Appellate review under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(f), ensures that an agency does not act arbitrarily or with-\nout regard to the facts. BMW of N. Am., L.L.C. v. Motor Vehicle Bd., 115 S.W.3d 722, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6923 (Tex.\nApp. Austin 2003).\n\n60. Administrative error will not be grounds for reversal or remand unless the appellant's substantive rights have been\nprejudiced under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2).. BMW of N. Am., L.L.C. v. Motor Vehicle Bd., 115 S.W.3d 722,\n2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6923 (Tex. App. Austin 2003).\n\n61. When the trial court entertains a suit for judicial review of a department of insurance decision that is brought under\nTex. Ins. Code Ann. §§ 36.201-.05 and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 2001.171,.174, the trial court is authorized to reverse\nthe case under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(A) and (D), if the agency's findings, inferences, conclusions, or de-\ncisions are characterized by abuse of discretion, in violation of a statutory provision, or affected by another error of law.\nServ. Lloyds Ins. Co. v. Montemayor, 108 S.W.3d 454, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 4318 (Tex. App. Austin 2003).\n\n62. To secure a reversal a party needs to show that the agency committed an error of law and relating prejudice to the\nappellant's substantial rights under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174; where there is an error of law, it does not neces-\nsarily follow that there is also demonstrable prejudice to substantial rights. DOT v. Jones Bros. Dirt & Paving Contrs.,\n24 S.W.3d 893, 2000 Tex. App. LEXIS 4920 (Tex. App. Austin 2000), reversed by 92 S.W.3d 477, 2002 Tex. LEXIS 101,\n45 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 937 (Tex. 2002).\n\n63. In reviewing administrative license suspension decisions under the substantial evidence standard in Tex. Transp.\nCode Ann. § 524.041 and Tex. Gov't. Code Ann. § 2001.174, the reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that\nof the agency. The issue for the court is not whether the agency's decision was correct, but only whether the record\ndemonstrates some reasonable basis for the agency's action as shown by a \"scintilla\" of evidence. Mireles v. Texas Dep't\nof Pub. Safety, 9 S.W.3d 128, 1999 Tex. LEXIS 125, 43 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 169 (Tex. 1999).\n\n64. The Administrative Procedure Act (Act), Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, which empowered the Board of Trustees\nof the Employees Retirement System of Texas to prepare coverage specifications made under the Act, was construed in\na manner that entitled the trustees' interpretation of policy exclusions to be given judicial respect regarding any uncer-\ntainty where the interpretation was reasonable; the finding that an optometrist's \"vision therapy treatments\" fell within\nthe policy exclusion of \"orthoptics or visual training\" was held to be reasonable. McMullen v. Employees Retirement\nSys., 935 S.W.2d 189, 1996 Tex. App. LEXIS 5142 (Tex. App. Austin 1996).\n\n\n\n65. Administrative law judge (ALJ) did not err in quashing the driver's subpoena of the arresting officer in the adminis-\ntrative license suspension proceeding, because the ALJ's application of the 150-mile limit in Tex. R. Civ. P. 176.3 was\nnot an abuse of discretion; the ALJ was expressly authorized to consider the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Hodge v.\nTex. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 10526 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. Dec. 20 2012).\n\n66. Because coalition members' property was along the creek in close proximity to the dairy in question, discharges into\nwater would impact them differently from the general public; to the extent the Texas Commission on Environmental\nQuality's denial of the coalition's hearing request was based on an implied determination that the dairy's contributions of\nwaste to the creek under the amended permit would have no impact on water quality, the denial was an abuse of discre-\ntion.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's conclusion that a coalition was not an affected person was made\nthrough improper procedure, was affected by error of law, and was an abuse of discretion under Tex.

Lloyds Ins. Co. v. Montemayor, 108 S.W.3d 454, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 4318 (Tex. App. Austin 2003).\n\n69. Since the Texas Legislature had expressed no intent that the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) be penalized\nfor the failure of an officer to submit a report within the five-day deadline of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.032(c)(4),\nthe failure of an officer to comply with the statute did not render the report inadmissible at an administrative hearing,\nand the judgment that the evidence was insufficient to authorize suspension of the driver's license was reversed and re-\nmanded because the erroneous exclusion of exhibits prejudiced the DPS's substantial rights since the administrative law\njudge denied the DPS the opportunity to satisfy its evidentiary burden at the license suspension hearing. Tex. Dep't of\nPub. Safety v. Kimbrough, 106 S.W.3d 747, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 3566 (Tex. App. Fort Worth 2003).\n\n70. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, specifically Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, a reviewing court acts in an\nappellate capacity and may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Cash Am. Int'l, Inc. v. Bennett, 35 S.W.3d\n12, 2000 Tex. LEXIS 82, 43 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1047 (Tex. 2000).\n\n\n\n71. Public Utility Commission was arbitrary and capricious in deciding not to allow rate-case expenses from earlier\nproceedings without prior Commissioner approval where it departed from prior Commission practice without explaining\nthe reason for its change in position, made findings of fact and conclusions of law without adequate support in the rec-\nord, and failed to give notice before the hearing of its intention to implement a new requirement. Oncor Elec. Delivery\nCo. Llc v. PUC of Tex., 406 S.W.3d 253, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 7334 (Tex. App. Austin 2013).\n\n72. Public Utility Commission of Texas' finding that it was appropriate to limit the amount that the telecommunications\nprovider should refund to the amount of overcharges to the county hospital district and order a partial refund was arbi-\ntrary and capricious, 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 26.27; l]this imitation prejudiced the substantial rights of the district, Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2). Harris County Hosp. Dist. v. PUC of Tex., 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 5707 (Tex. App. Aus-\ntin July 13 2012).\n\n73. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's findings did not conflict with its decision to grant a landfill permit,\nthe company complied with rule requirements of the rule, and conclusions that the proposed groundwater-monitoring\nsystem would adequately monitor the groundwater and will protect the groundwater, human health, and the environment\nwas also arbitrary or capricious. City of Jacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex.\nApp. Austin Feb. 10 2012).\n\n74. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) was required to make findings that supported its determina-\ntions that the statutory requirements, for purposes of Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.002 and Tex. Gov't Code\nAnn. § 2001.141(b), (d), for approving a permit application had been met, and TCEQ made 200 findings supporting its\ndecision to grant the permit; given this, and that substantial evidence supported a finding that there were no springs near\nthe proposed landfill, the court would have subjected the order to a hypertechnical standard of review if the court found\nthe order to be arbitrary and capricious because TCEQ failed to make a negative finding of fact concerning the existence\nof springs. City of Jacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 10\n2012).\n\n75. To the extent the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality denied a coalition's hearing request based on the\npremise that an amended permit would be more protective of the environment than the current one, the Commission\nacted arbitrarily by relying on a factor that was irrelevant to the standing of the coalition's to obtain a hearing. Bosque\nRiver Coalition v. Tex. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, 347 S.W.3d 366, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6043 (Tex. App. Austin\n2011).\n\n76. Because the court did not find that 28 Tex. Admin. Code § 134.1 was vague, the court overruled an operator's claims\nthat the application or misapplication of § 134.1 to its reimbursement claim caused the final order rejecting its claim to\nbe arbitrary and based on an error of law, for purposes of Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(D), (F). Vista Healthcare,\nInc. v. Tex. Mut. Ins. Co., 324 S.W.3d 264, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 7046 (Tex.

Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\n\n\n77. In a highway construction contract dispute, although Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 201.112 gave the executive director\nof the Texas Department of Transportation broad discretion to make changes to the proposed findings of fact and con-\nclusions of law of the administrative law judge (ALJ), the executive director could not ignore the evidence; where the\nALJ, and not the executive director, heard the testimony and observed the demeanor of the witnesses, and in the absence\nof independent evidence in the record to support the executive director's credibility choice, the executive director's deci-\nsion to reject the ALJ's findings based on credibility was arbitrary and capricious under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\n2001.174. State v. Mid-South Pavers, Inc., 246 S.W.3d 711, 2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 9905 (Tex. App. Austin 2007).\n\n78. Doctor's due process rights were not violated when the State Board of Medical Examiners revoked his license be-\ncause the record failed to show that the presence of two doctors that served on the disciplinary panel unduly influenced\nthe Board's final decision and there was no record that ex parte communications took place; further, the Board's conclu-\nsions were not arbitrary or capricious under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 where there was no evidence that the\nBoard based its decision on peer review evidence pursuant to Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 151.003(2) or that the doctor was\nharmed by such evidence under Tex. R. App. P. 44.1. Chalifoux v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 2006 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 9598 (Tex. App. Austin Nov. 1 2006).\n\n79. Decision of the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners to revoke a doctor's license was not arbitrary or capricious\nunder Tex. Gov't Code Ann § 2001.174(2)(F); there was no evidence that the Board considered peer-review evidence in\nreaching its final decision, and its conclusions were explicitly based on its findings and the evidence presented at the\nhearing. Chalifoux v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 4738 (Tex. App. Austin June 2 2006).\n\n80. Professional disciplinary action against a doctor, based on stale allegations of improper touching of a female pa-\ntient's breasts, resulted in a due process violation that caused actual prejudice to the doctor's substantial rights, and the\naction was therefore arbitrary and capricious under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(A); staleness was not a signifi-\ncant concern as to another patient's complaints, however, because contemporaneous documentary evidence of the com-\nplaints existed. Granek v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 172 S.W.3d 761, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 6954 (Tex. App. Aus-\ntin 2005).\n\n81. Appellate review under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(f), ensures that an agency does not act arbitrarily or with-\nout regard to the facts. BMW of N. Am., L.L.C. v. Motor Vehicle Bd., 115 S.W.3d 722, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6923 (Tex.\nApp. Austin 2003).\n\n82. Trial court was not free to substitute its judgment for the judgment of the prison, through its disciplinary commis-\nsion, on the weight of the evidence, and, thus, the disciplinary conviction and fine imposed on the inmate for the dam-\nage the inmate caused to state property during a riot had to be upheld because the hearing captain's finding the inmate\ncommitted the damage was not arbitrary or capricious. Warriner v. Tex. Dep't of Crim. Justice - Institutional Div., 2002\nTex. App. LEXIS 6410 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Aug. 29 2002).\n\n83. Appellate court must reverse an order of the Texas Railroad Commission if the commission's action was arbitrary,\ncapricious, or an abuse of discretion pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174. An agency decision is arbitrary when\nits final order denies parties due process of law or fails to demonstrate a connection between the agency decision and\nthe factors that are made relevant to that decision by the applicable statutes and regulations; a court reviewing a decision\nfor arbitrariness should consider all relevant factors and may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Occi-\ndental Permian, Ltd. v. R.R. Comm'n, 47 S.W.3d 801, 2001 Tex. App. LEXIS 3583, 149 Oil & Gas Rep. 321 (Tex. App.\nAustin 2001).\n\n84. Under the Administrative Procedure Act, specifically Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, a reviewing court acts in an\nappellate capacity and may not substitute its judgment for that of the agency. Cash Am. Int'l, Inc. v. Bennett, 35 S.W.3d\n12, 2000 Tex. LEXIS 82, 43 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 1047 (Tex. 2000).\n\n85. Under the Texas Administrative Procedures Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2), the trial court has the author-\nity to reverse an agency determination if it finds that the substantive rights of the appellant are prejudiced due to a con-\nstitutional or statutory violation, the decision was made unlawfully or affected by an error of law, not supported by sub-\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 13\n                                                 Tex.

Sept. 23 1999).\n\n86. Courts are entitled to review agency decisions under the former Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act,\nTex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13a § 19 (e), and may reverse an administrative order if it lacks substantial evidence\nsupporting it or if it is arbitrary and capricious. City of Alvin v. Public Util. Comm'n, 876 S.W.2d 346, 1993 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 2381 (Tex. App. Austin 1993).\n\n87. Order of the Texas Railroad Commission, directing appellant company to backfill and compact certain sludge pits\nand to dispose of all oil or oil by-products located in them, was not arbitrary and capricious under former Tex. Rev. Civ.\nStat. Ann. art. 6252-13a, § 19(e)(6) because the fact that appellant controlled the pits for 23 years was not legally irrel-\nevant, nor was it inherently arbitrary to proceed against only appellant even though other potentially liable parties ex-\nisted; while the pits had been conveyed to appellant by a corporation that had disposed of sludge in the pits, and appel-\nlant subsequently had released its interest in the pits to another party, the harm caused by the joint tortfeasors was indi-\nvisible, and thus the Commission could choose to proceed against only one of them. Lone Star Salt Water Disposal Co.\nv. Railroad Comm'n, 800 S.W.2d 924, 1990 Tex. App. LEXIS 3123, 115 Oil & Gas Rep. 166 (Tex. App. Austin 1990).\n\n88. Utility commission's failure to set forth findings of fact and conclusions of law in its rate order, as required by the\nAdministrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 16(b), constituted an arbitrary and ca-\npricious omission. Consumers Water, Inc. v. Public Util. Comm'n., 774 S.W.2d 719, 1989 Tex. App. LEXIS 2127 (Tex.\nApp. Austin 1989).\n\n89. Trial court erred by reversing dentistry board's order revoking dentist license because the members of the board\nwere in a better position to determine the relevance and materiality of the State's expert witness than the reviewing\njudge unendowed with evaluation evidence or expertise. Board of Dental Exmrs. v. Silagi, 766 S.W.2d 280, 1989 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 207 (Tex. App. El Paso 1989).\n\n\n\n90. While the Administrative Procedures Act is deferential toward agency decisions and expressly prohibits a reviewing\ncourt from substituting its own judgment for the decision of the state agency on questions committed to agency discre-\ntion, questions of law are not left to agency discretion and are therefore subject to de novo review under Tex. Gov't\nCode Ann. § 2001.174 DOT v. Jones Bros. Dirt & Paving Contrs., 24 S.W.3d 893, 2000 Tex. App. LEXIS 4920 (Tex.\nApp. Austin 2000), reversed by 92 S.W.3d 477, 2002 Tex. LEXIS 101, 45 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 937 (Tex. 2002).\n\n\n\n91. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality violated Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.0832(f) and exceeded\nits statutory authority by failing to explain in its order why it rejected the administrative law judge's findings that all of\nthe landfill's operations be conducted during the recommended operating hours, Heritage on the San Gabriel Home-\nowners Ass?n v. Tex. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, 393 S.W.3d 417, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 10767 (Tex. App. Austin 2012).\n\n92. Basis of the business owner's declaratory-judgment action was simply that the Texas Department of Licensing and\nRegulation (Department) had no authority to regulate eyebrow threading because eyebrow threading did not constitute\nthe practice of cosmetology, and although she presented several constitutional arguments as to how the Department's\nactions affected her individually, she made no broad constitutional challenge to the entire statutory scheme; her consti-\ntutional arguments could be asserted under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and because the relief the owner\nsought under the Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act would be considered \"redundant\" of her APA judicial-review\nclaim, she failed to invoke the district court's subject-matter jurisdiction to grant such relief, and the district court should\nhave dismissed those claims. Kuntz v. Khan, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 7252 (Tex. App. Austin Aug. 31 2010).\n\n\n\n93. Under the administrative rule, the company's programs, including those funded with the settlement money, were\nprograms implemented under that rule, and the Public Utility Commission, by limiting the company's bonus based on\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 14\n                                               Tex.

Centerpoint Energy Houston Elec., Llc v. PUC of Tex., 408 S.W.3d 910, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS\n10363 (Tex. App. Austin 2013).\n\n\n\n94. Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation complied with Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.058(e) by specifying\nthe reason and legal basis for its modifications to the ALJ's findings and conclusions and its decision was supported by\nsubstantial evidence and made through lawful procedure. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 2001.058(e), .174; the Commission\nexpressly addressed and made findings in its decisions to the statutory factors in the Occupation Code. Tex. Dep't of\nLicensing & Regulation v. Thompson, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 8832 (Tex. App. Austin July 18 2013).\n\n\n\n95. In an administrative license suspension proceeding, substantial evidence supported the judge's decision that a troop-\ner had reasonable suspicion to stop the driver's vehicle because he was committing a traffic offense by driving a vehicle\nwhose taillamps failed to illuminate the rear license plate. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Flanagan, 2014 Tex. App. LEXIS\n1713 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 14 2014).\n\n96. Substantial evidence supported the decision of the Texas Insurance Commissioner revoking an insurance agent's\nlicense, because he engaged in fraudulent acts or practices with regard to the sale of universal leases and unauthorized\nannuity transactions. Zaal v. Tex. Dep't of INS., 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 13296 (Tex. App. Austin Oct. 29 2013).\n\n97. Administrative Procedure Act provisions governing substantial-evidence did not authorize monetary relief sought by\na workers' compensation insurance carrier against a health care provider relating to stop-loss reimbursement, and mon-\netary relief had not been awarded incident to reversing and remanding an administrative order. Vista Med. Ctr. Hosp. v.\nTex. Mut. INS. Co., 416 S.W.3d 11, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 12172 (Tex. App. Austin 2013).\n\n98. ALJ's administrative decision was supported by substantial evidence and the record demonstrated some reasonable\nbasis for the ALJ's action. and the County Court at Law improperly re-weighed the evidence and substituted its judg-\nment for that of the ALJ when the driver appealed from the ALJ's administrative determination. Tex. Dep't of Pub.\nSafety v. Castro, 406 S.W.3d 782, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 9107 (Tex. App. El Paso 2013).\n\n99. Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission properly suspended the licensee's alcoholic beverage permit and license for\nfive days, because substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the third party was an employee, agent, or servant\nfor purposes of establishing a violation of Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. § 104.01(4), when the focus was whether there was\nsubstantial evidence to support the determination that the third party was an employee, agent, or servant for purposes of\nestablishing a violation. Villatoro v. Tex. Alcoholic Bev. Comm'n, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 6780 (Tex. App. Dallas June 3\n2013).\n\n100. Administrative law judge's finding that the deputy had reasonable suspicion to stop the driver was not reasonably\nsupported by substantial evidence and therefore it erred by suspending the driver's license under Tex. Transp. Code Ann.\n§§ 524.022, .041, because the evidence only showed that the driver was observed driving slowly on a highway at 1:40\na.m; the record was silent regarding the deputy's training and experience and was silent as to the characteristics of the\narea in which the driver was observed driving. In addition, there was no evidence that the deputy stopped the driver be-\ncause he was concerned for her safety, as there was no evidence she was alone in her vehicle, that there were any other\nvehicles sharing the roadway with the driver, or that driving slowly was inherently unsafe; the deputy stated in his re-\nport that he had reasonable suspicion to contact that driver only because he observed her vehicle traveling 40 m.p.h. in a\n65 m.p.h. posted zone. Peters v. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 404 S.W.3d 1, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 2798 (Tex. App. Hou-\nston 1st Dist. 2013).\n\n101. In a case relating to the revocation of a doctor's license, a finding that a kyphoplasty constituted a \"spine surgery\"\nwas reasonably supported by substantial evidence where there was testimony from other physicians that the procedure\nconstituted a surgery. The doctor's performance of this procedure violated an agreed order whereby he was prohibited\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 15\n                                               Tex.

Trial court erred by reversing the administrative decision allowing the suspension of the driver's license because\nsubstantial evidence supported that decision, as the officer testified multiple times that he saw the driver on the road and\nthen enter the parking lot and that he saw the driver in the vehicle's driver's seat when it was parked under a light in the\nparking lot; when the driver approached the officer, he saw that the driver was intoxicated and therefore had reasonable\nsuspicion or probable cause to detain the driver and administer field sobriety tests. The officer's report, which bore the\nseal and signature of the Texas Department of Public Safety's custodian of records, corroborated the officer's testimony\nthat the driver did not provide a breath sample on request and that he refused to provide a post-arrest breath sample. Tex.\nDep't of Pub. Safety v. Perez, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 659 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Jan. 24 2013).\n\n103. Where a subcontractor filed a claim alleging that unforeseen conditions caused it to incur additional costs to com-\nplete foundation drilling work on a highway construction contract, substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\n2001.174(2)(E) supported the Texas Department of Transportation's decision that (1) the site conditions were not sig-\nnificantly different; (2) the contract provided that casing was required to prevent caving and water intrusion; and there-\nfore, (3) the subcontractor was not entitled to damages. Granite Constr. Co. v. Tex. DOT, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 9706\n(Tex. App. Austin Nov. 20 2012).\n\n104. Agreed Final Judgment purported to find facts (that the city had met the criteria for issuance of a permit) and to\nrender judgment granting a permit, and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 did not empower courts to take such action,\nwhich went beyond their limited authority in a substantial-evidence review, and having concluded that there was error\nprejudicing substantial rights of the city's, the court's only options were to reverse or remand the case for further pro-\nceedings; accordingly, the district court's Agreed Final Judgment, which had the effect of rendering a specific judgment,\ncontravened the direct restriction on the special statutory jurisdiction delegated to the court in its substantial-evidence\nreview, and because the judgment violated the separation-of-powers doctrine of the Texas Constitution, Tex. Const. art.\nII, § 1, it was void and its rendition was fundamental error. Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v. City of Kyle, 382 S.W.3d\n540, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 7548 (Tex. App. Austin 2012).\n\n105. Group's substantial rights were not prejudiced by the addition of the special provision to the landfill application,\nbecause the appellate court could not see how the group had been harmed by the Texas Commission on Environmental\nQuality adopting a permit that provided more groundwater monitoring than was required by the administrative rules,\nwhen the permit not only satisfied the rules' requirements that groundwater from the uppermost aquifer be monitored, as\nit must, but it also provided for extra monitoring of groundwater that the evidence showed was not in the uppermost\naquifer. City of Jacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 5243 (Tex. App. Austin June 28\n2012).\n\n106. Trial court exceeded its authority when it modified an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision that a driver's li-\ncense was suspended for 2 years under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.035(a) and stated that the suspension was for 180\ndays. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Hudson, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1148 (Tex. App. Dallas Feb. 13 2012).\n\n107. Both the administrative law judge and the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality agreed that an aquifer was\na regional one, and the conclusion was supported by substantial evidence. City of Jacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action\nGroup, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 10 2012).\n\n108. There was sufficient evidence for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to find that a company met the\nrequirements in its search for springs and there were none in the landfill's vicinity. City of Jacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty.\nAction Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 10 2012).\n\n109. Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) was required to make findings that supported its determina-\ntions that the statutory requirements, for purposes of Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.002 and Tex. Gov't Code\nAnn. § 2001.141(b), (d), for approving a permit application had been met, and TCEQ made 200 findings supporting its\ndecision to grant the permit; given this, and that substantial evidence supported a finding that there were no springs near\nthe proposed landfill, the court would have subjected the order to a hypertechnical standard of review if the court found\nthe order to be arbitrary and capricious because TCEQ failed to make a negative finding of fact concerning the existence\n\f                                                                                                                  Page 16\n                                               Tex.

Although a group was correct that a company did not raise adding a special provision to its groundwater monitor-\ning plan until after the proposal for decision had been submitted, and thus the company did not formally introduce the\nprovision, the court's task was to review the order of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to see if substan-\ntial evidence supported the order, considering the evidence in the record as a whole, for purposes of Tex. Gov't Code\nAnn. § 2001.174(2)(E); the administrative law judge considered the provision in reaching findings and conclusions,\nsuch that the provision was part of the record as a whole under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.060(1), (2), (5), (6). City of\nJacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 10 2012).\n\n111. Even if the court assumed the record contained no evidence regarding a special provision, the court could reverse\non substantial-evidence grounds if a group's substantial rights were prejudiced under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\n2001.174(2), but the group failed to show this. City of Jacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 10 2012).\n\n112. Insurance agent's license was properly revoked because the insurance agent's statement to clients that when they\nwanted out of a universal lease program, a leasing agent would buy back the timeshare for the amount of the investment\nproved to be untrue; substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E) supported the finding that the\ninsurance agent acted recklessly with respect to the truth or falsity of the representations. Meyer v. Tex. Dep't of Ins.,\n2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 9270 (Tex. App. Austin Nov. 23 2011).\n\n113. Legislature granted the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) the power to protect the public interest by\nregulating those physicians who were granted the privilege of practicing medicine, Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 151.003; the\nlegislature also provided that the Board's decision to revoke a physician's license was subject to the substantial-evidence\nstandard of review, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, and the lack of a trial de novo (either a bench or jury trial) for\nlicense-revocation appeals by physicians was rationally related to the legitimate governmental purpose of conservation\nof judicial resources. Scally v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 351 S.W.3d 434, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6117 (Tex.\nApp. Austin 2011).\n\n114. Because a coalition never had the opportunity to develop an evidentiary record before the Texas Commission on\nEnvironmental Quality through contested-case or adjudicative processes, substantial-evidence review was inapplicable\nand unavailable. Bosque River Coalition v. Tex. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, 347 S.W.3d 366, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS\n6043 (Tex. App. Austin 2011).\n\n115. Court's use of the term \"substantial-evidence review\" in this opinion was intended in the narrower sense to refer\nonly to a determination of whether the agency order was reasonably supported by substantial evidence considering the\nreliable evidence as a whole. Bosque River Coalition v. Tex. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality, 347 S.W.3d 366, 2011 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 6043 (Tex. App. Austin 2011).\n\n116. Dismissal of the teacher's request for assault leave by the Texas Commissioner of Education was supported by\nsubstantial evidence, because the teacher submitted her request for assault leave under Tex. Educ. Code Ann. §\n22.003(b) 720 days after the date of the incident, and reasonable minds could have reached the same conclusion; since\nthe Texas Education Code did not expressly define the scope of judicial review of decisions made by the Texas Com-\nmissioner of Education, the substantial-evidence standard applied. Poole v. Karnack Indep. Sch. Dist., 344 S.W.3d 440,\n2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 3456 (Tex. App. Austin 2011).\n\n117. Substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 supported the administrative suspension of appellee's\ndriver's license under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §§ 724.035, 724.042, because he was stopped for speeding, had trouble\nmaintaining balance, refused to provide a breath or blood specimen, and admitted to ingesting hydrocodone, a con-\ntrolled substance.

Although the formal posture was an appeal of a transportation department order determining that its engineer did\nnot commit gross error in denying a company additional compensation, to which the court applied the substantial evi-\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 17\n                                                Tex.

App. LEXIS 1587 (Tex. App. Austin Mar. 2 2011).\n\n119. Where a deputy observed a pickup truck make a right turn so wide that it caused the front driver's side tire to go\nonto the grassy area of the road, the deputy had reasonable suspicion to stop appellee's vehicle because he committed a\ntraffic violation under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §§ 545.051(a), 545.101(a); based on the strong odor of an alcoholic bev-\nerage emitting from appellee, his admission that he was drinking beer, and his poor performance on field sobriety tests,\nthe deputy had probable cause to arrest appellee for driving while intoxicated. Because the requirements of Tex. Transp.\nCode Ann. § 524.035(a)(1), (2) were met, the Texas Department of Public Safety's decision to suspend appellee's driv-\ner's license was supported by substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v.\nGarza, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 9523 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Dec. 2 2010).\n\n120. Trial court erred in overturning an administrative decision suspending appellee's driver's license based on appel-\nlee's refusal to submit a breath specimen; the administrative law judge chose to credit the statements by the arresting\nofficer in the officer's report over the testimony of appellee, and there was sufficient evidence in the record to support\nthe findings as reasonable and supported by substantial evidence. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Gutierrez, 2010 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 7567 (Tex. App. San Antonio Sept. 15 2010).\n\n121. Suspension of a driver's license for refusal to submit to a breath test under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.035 was\nsupported by substantial evidence because even if the officer's sworn report was inadmissible under Tex. R. Evid. 803(8)\nbased on a lack of a signature, the admissible evidence demonstrated the four elements required to uphold the suspen-\nsion; that evidence included the DIC-24 form, under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.032, which indicated refusal to sub-\nmit to the breath test and was signed by the driver. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Guajardo, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 6000\n(Tex. App. Corpus Christi July 29 2010).\n\n122. Substantial evidence supported the suspension of the minor's driver's license, because the minor was properly ad-\nvised of the consequences set forth under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.015 and he voluntarily refused to submit a\nspecimen at the officer's request, and since the officer was not required to give the minor the notice of suspension before\nrequesting a specimen, any irregularity on the notice of suspension did not affect the voluntariness of the minor's refusal\nto submit a specimen for purposes of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Henson, 2010 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 3478 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. May 11 2010).\n\n123. Motorist argued that at least one half of the license plate was working and that the officer could see the license\nplate when he turned on his headlights, and while the court could concede the rear license plate was barely illuminated,\nnothing suggested the plate was clearly legible at a distance of 50 feet from the rear under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §\n547.322(f); the court does not rewrite the statute to say the plate must be legible if a police officer is driving behind a\nsuspect with his lights on because the statute's purpose may also be to ensure officers on foot and potential witnesses are\nable to see the license plate, and in any event, even had the motorist presented conflicting evidence on this point, the\ncourt would still have been unable to disregard the administrative law judge's factual determinations, for purposes of\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Eller, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 8473 (Tex. App. Texarkana\nNov. 4 2009).\n\n124. Trial court erred in finding that a notice of an enforcement action hearing before the Texas Alcoholic Beverage\nCommission (TABC) was ineffective because evidence that the TABC sent the notice to the licensee at the address in-\ndicated in the TABC's records and that it received a signed green card in return was substantial evidence under Tex.\nAlco. Bev. Code Ann. § 11.67(b) and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2) for the TABC's finding that the licensee had\nactual notice; the agency was entitled to resolve conflicts in the evidence, and, here, the evidence could have supported\na finding either way. The trial court impermissibly substituted its judgment for that of the agency as the agency's resolu-\ntion of the issues of any \"address problems\" and the green card signature was not unreasonable. Tex. Alcoholic Bev.\nComm'n v. Aga Trading, Inc., 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 7842 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. Oct. 8 2009).\n\n125. Driver was parked in his usual parking space behind the building where he worked, he did not have a foot on the\nbrake and had not turned on the headlights, and the car was in park and the front seat was reclined to better accommo-\ndate him sleeping, and this would have made it difficult if not impossible for the driver to enable the vehicle's use for its\nintended purpose of driving, rather than a source of air conditioning; thus, the driver did not take an action to affect the\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 18\n                                               Tex.

Transp. Code Ann. §\n724.042, was not supported by substantial evidence, for purposes of Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2), and the court\naffirmed the reversal of the suspension of the driver's license under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.035. Tex. Dep't of\nPub. Safety v. Allocca, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 7039 (Tex. App. Austin Aug. 31 2009).\n\n126. Final order of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which reconciled an electric utility company's eligible fuel\nexpenses and revenues for a certain time period, was upheld on appeal as a reasonable remedy within the Commission's\nstatutory authority; the Commission's final order was found to have reasonably required the utility company to account\nfor all revenues it collected after December 31, 2001, that were directly attributable to the generation of electricity\nthrough that date, and reasonably required it to reconcile all fuel revenues it received and expenses it incurred after that\ndate, to serve customers who were not yet switched to a retail electric provider; the Commission reconciliation method-\nology was found to have been proper and reasonably interpreted the Texas Legislature's directive to conduct a final\nreconciliation by accounting for all revenues associated with the expenses of providing bundled service during the rec-\nonciliation period; a reasonable basis existed for the Commission's decision to discount approximately $ 2.7 million in\nfuel costs and that the decision was supported by substantial evidence; and the Commission was found to have properly\ndelineated and applied its reasonableness or prudence standard of review, which took into account, among other things,\nchanges in the market.

Decision of an ALJ administratively suspending a driver's license was supported by substantial evidence, Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E), including that it took the driver more than 20 seconds to get his door open and exit\nthe car, he was swaying, had red, bloodshot eyes, had a strong odor of alcohol coming from his mouth, and admitted\ncoming from a bar where he had had eight or nine drinks. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Dishman, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS\n3052 (Tex. App. San Antonio May 6 2009).\n\n128. Under the substantial evidence standard of review, it was determined that driving privileges were properly sus-\npended because there was probable cause to believe that a driver was operating a motor vehicle in a public place under\nTex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042(2)(A); the public had unrestricted access to a private road, and it did not matter that\ntravelers were infrequent or that the road had not been converted to a county road. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Castro,\n2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 3198 (Tex. App. San Antonio Apr. 29 2009).\n\n129. Substantial evidence supported the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners' conclusion that the dentist practiced\ndentistry in a manner that constituted dishonorable conduct as defined in 22 Tex. Admin. Code Ann. § 108.9(6) where\nthe dentist offered to show a teenaged patient and her mother the scars on her breasts from surgery. Tex. State Bd. of\nDental Examiners v. Brown, 281 S.W.3d 692, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 2247 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi 2009).\n\n130. Texas State Board of Dental Examiners' conclusion that the dentist practiced dentistry in a manner that constituted\ndishonorable conduct as defined in 22 Tex. Admin. Code Ann. § 108.9(6) was supported by the administrative law\njudge's findings that the dentist allowed her non-dentist employees to adjust occlusion on a patient's teeth and failed to\nkeep adequate medical records where a patient's chart contained neither a written review of medical history, a medical\nexam, radiographs and findings, a treatment plan, or a written formal consent nor an explanation why that chart was\nincomplete. Tex. State Bd. of Dental Examiners v. Brown, 281 S.W.3d 692, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 2247 (Tex. App.\nCorpus Christi 2009).\n\n131. Substantial evidence supported the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners' order that the dentist pay restitution to\na patient as she improperly allowed her assistants to perform non-delegable dental work on the patient. The district court\nerred when it reversed the Board's restitution order because the Board did not make adjudicative findings contrary to the\nALJ's findings. Tex. State Bd. of Dental Examiners v. Brown, 281 S.W.3d 692, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 2247 (Tex. App.\nCorpus Christi 2009).\n\n132. Application approval did not violate both the laws of trespass and the constitutional restrictions against taking\nproperty without just compensation, because approving the application for authority to use a well to inject and dispose\nof salt water below the surface neither took property from the adjoining land owners nor authorized a trespass, and evi-\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 19\n                                               Tex.

App. Amarillo 2009).\n\n133. While bloodshot eyes, an odor of alcohol, and unsteady balance were all symptoms of intoxication, those facts did\nnot, without more, give rise to probable cause to believe the driver was driving while intoxicated. As the rest of the evi-\ndence did not support the conclusion that the driver was driving while intoxicated, the administrative law judge's deci-\nsion to suspend the driver's operator's license was not reasonably supported by substantial evidence. Tex. Dep't of Pub.\nSafety v. Gilfeather, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 1502 (Tex. App. Fort Worth Mar. 5 2009).\n\n134. Trial court erred in reversing an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision to suspend a motorist's driver's license\npursuant to Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.035, after the motorist refused to give a breath specimen test, because there\nwas substantial evidence supporting the administrative order as required by Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 524.041 and Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174; a court may not substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v.\nEscobedo, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 5651 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi July 29 2008).\n\n135. Judgment suspending driver's license for 180 days was affirmed where the totality of circumstances was substantial\nevidence of probable cause for the driver's arrest for driving while intoxicated. The record showed that the driver drove\npast a roadblock, that he had a strong alcoholic odor, that he had bloodshot eyes, that he admitted drinking an alcoholic\nbeverage, that he was extremely argumentative, and that he refused to take field sobriety tests.

Because the Texas Railroad Commission's final order was consistent with the statutes and rules authorizing the\nCommission to regulate oil and gas waste, including under Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. § 91.101 and Tex. Water Code\nAnn. § 26.131(a), and the Commission's final order finding a company's permit violation was supported by substantial\nevidence under Tex. Nat. Res. Code Ann. § 85.241 and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the court affirmed the judg-\nment affirming the Commission's final order. Osage Envtl. v. R.R. Comm'n of Tex., 2008 Tex.

There was substantial evidence in the record to support the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy's conclusion\nthat a certificate holder had presented himself as an accountant while his certificate was suspended; the record did not\nsupport the holder's claim that he misunderstood the effect of a 1999 order suspending his certificate to practice public\naccountancy; the holder had committed violations in the past, and he was found to be not fit to practice public account-\nancy under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 901.502(11). Rogers v. State Bd. of Pub. Accountancy, 310 S.W.3d 1, 2008 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 2961 (Tex. App. Austin 2008).\n\n138. District court erred in reversing the decision of the administrative law judge (ALJ), which revoked the driver's op-\nerating license for two years, because substantial evidence supported the ALJ's reasonable suspicion determination,\nwhen the ALJ was presented with evidence from the officer that the license plate light was not working when he pulled\nthe driver over and that the license plate was not clearly legible from fifty feet, and there was sufficient evidence to up-\nhold the decision of the ALJ that the officer had probable cause to believe that the driver was operating a motor vehicle\nin a public place while intoxicated; the officer noticed that the driver's license plate as not properly illuminated, the\ndriver admitted he had drunk four beers, and evidence presented at the administrative hearing included the officer's re-\nport stating that the driver had slurred speech, bloodshot eyes, and an odor of an alcoholic beverage on his person.

Revocation of a respiratory care practitioner's certificate for taking a drug from an intravenous bag for personal use\nwas properly upheld as an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision was supported by substantial evidence pursuant to\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(F), affirmative findings as to each 25 Tex. Admin. Code § 123.14(f)(4) factor were\nunnecessary, and a negative inference could be drawn from the practitioner's invoking the Fifth Amendment, which was\ndone improperly as a blanket assertion rather than in response to a particular question.

Where an officer initiated a traffic stop and smelled alcohol, appellee admitted that she had just left a bar where she\nhad consumed alcohol; in the license suspension proceeding, the judge's finding that the police had probable cause to\narrest appellee for DWI was supported by substantial evidence under Tex.

Trial court erred in reversing the suspension of a driver's license by an administrative law judge (ALJ) because\nsubstantial evidence supported the ALJ's finding under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042 that the driver voluntarily\nrefused to submit to a breath test; although the driver claimed he was misled about the consequences of refusal, the ALJ,\nas the sole trier of fact under Tex.

Trial court did not apply the law properly in setting review of an administrative permitting decision of the Edwards\nAquifer Authority under the substantial evidence de novo rule because Tex. Water Code Ann. § 36.253 required the\nAuthority's permitting decisions to be reviewed under the substantial evidence rule by a judge sitting without a jury;\njudicial review under the substantial evidence rule encompassed the constitutional issues raised by the landowners chal-\nlenging the Authority's decision.

Texas Racing Commission's decision to modify the ALJ's conclusion and impose the steward's initial penalty of\ndisqualifying the horse and the loss of the purse due the use of ipratropium, a prohibited Class 3 drug, was within the\nCommission's authority under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.058(e), and the \"loss of purse\" penalty was expressly au-\nthorized by the Texas Racing Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 179e, and the Commission's rules, guidelines, and ze-\nro-drug tolerance policy; further, the burden of proof was correctly placed on the owner and at the appropriate standard\nbecause nothing in the Tex.

Trial court did not err in affirming the suspension of the driver's license where although the ALJ found that the\ndriver had operated a watercraft while intoxicated, this was an obvious clerical error which did not negate the adminis-\ntrative order, and the decision was supported by substantial evidence, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174. Goldstein v.\nTex. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 11285 (Tex. App. San Antonio Oct. 11 2006).\n\n145. Trial court's conclusion that the state motor vehicle board's findings of fact that a motor vehicle distributor engaged\nin business as a dealer in Texas were not supported by substantial evidence, and that the board's conclusions of law that\nthe distributor violated statutory prohibitions, were affected by error of law, was upheld where the undisputed facts were\nthat, in response to a Texas city's solicitation, the distributor sold and delivered two buses to the city in New Mexico\nand that, from there, the city paid for the buses to be brought into Texas; there was no evidence that the distributor ever\nphysically crossed the New Mexico border into Texas related to the transaction, and, under Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann.\n§ 2.401, legal title to the buses passed in New Mexico because the agreement of the parties required the distributor to\ndeliver the buses in New Mexico. Motor Vehicle Bd. v.

Gov't Code Ann § 2001.174(2)(E) supported a finding that a doctor violated the\nstandard of care in assessing the possibility of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak because he had the patient lie down,\n\f                                                                                                                  Page 21\n                                              Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\nwhich minimized the possibility of the patient experiencing the classic symptoms of a CSF leak; his claim that his dis-\ncharge decision was not based solely on his observation of the patient after she was lying down for two hours was insuf-\nficient to overcome the presumption that the finding was supported by substantial evidence. Chalifoux v. Tex. State Bd.\nof Med. Exam'rs, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 4738 (Tex. App. Austin June 2 2006).\n\n149. Texas Railroad Commission's rejection of a gas company's fee assessment against residents of outlying areas was\nnot supported by substantial evidence because the Commission's order did not satisfy requirements for findings of fact.\nCenterPoint Energy Entex v. R.R. Comm'n, 213 S.W.3d 364, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 3518 (Tex. App. Austin 2006).\n\n150. License suspension was reinstated because the Texas Department of Public Safety produced more than a scintilla\nof evidence on the factors set forth in Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042, when the driver was properly stopped for vio-\nlation of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 545.104(a), and the officer smelled alcohol on the driver's breath, noticed that the\ndriver's eyes were bloodshot and his speech was slurred. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Shellberg, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS\n6644 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Aug. 18 2005).\n\n151. Trial court did not err in affirming an agency decision that found that no vacancy existed, for purposes of Tex. Nat.\nRes. Code Ann. § 51.172(5); the agency was free to consider evidence other than the evidence provided by two surveys,\nand substantial evidence supported the ruling pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E) of the Administrative\nProcedure Act. Dixon v. Dewhurst, 169 S.W.3d 515, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 6100 (Tex. App. Texarkana 2005).\n\n152. Texas State Board of Medical Examiners' conclusion that disciplinary grounds existed for a doctor's improper con-\ntact with a female patient was supported by its findings, conclusions and evidence, in accordance with Tex. Gov't Code\nAnn. § 2001.174(2)(E), where even though the patient was somewhat confused and inconsistent regarding the details of\nher surroundings when the incidents occurred, she testified unequivocally that the doctor touched her breasts despite her\nattempts to shield herself with magazines. The administrative law judge heard the patient's testimony firsthand, was able\nto observe her and her demeanor, and concluded that she made a credible witness, and the appellate court could not\nsecond-guess such credibility determinations in the guise of a substantial-evidence inquiry. Granek v. Tex. State Bd. of\nMed. Examiners, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 6232 (Tex. App. Austin Aug. 3 2005), substituted opinion at, opinion withdrawn\nby 172 S.W.3d 761, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 6954 (Tex. App. Austin 2005).\n\n153. Doctor's failure to attend a patient in the emergency room was properly found to be a failure to practice medicine\nin an acceptable professional manner consistent with public health and welfare, in violation of Tex. Occ. Code Ann. §\n164.051(a)(6), and unprofessional or dishonorable conduct that was likely to injure the public, in violation of Tex. Occ.\nCode Ann. §§ 164.051(a)(1), 164.052(a)(5), where the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners' expert testified that,\nbased on her review of relevant medical records, the doctor's care and treatment of the patient did not meet the standard\nof care and was a professional failure to practice medicine consistent with the public health and welfare, and where,\nbecause patients were considered members of the public, the expert's testimony, which was unchallenged on appeal,\nalso supported the Board's conclusion that the doctor committed unprofessional conduct that was likely to injure the\npublic. Furthermore, because the hospital's disciplinary action against the doctor was directed to the same conduct, there\nwas substantial evidence to support discipline under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 164.051(a)(7). Granek v. Tex. State Bd. of\nMed. Examiners, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 6232 (Tex.

Appellate court could not modify an order of the Motor Vehicle Board of the Texas Department of Transportation\nto include findings of fact and conclusions of law favorable to the dealer in its franchise dispute with a motor home\nmanufacturer because under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. §§ 2301.001, 2301.151, and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E),\nthe court could only review the order to determine if they are reasonably supported by substantial evidence. Further, the\norder complied with Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 2301.711(a). Buddy Gregg Motor Homes, Inc. v. Motor Vehicle Bd., 179\nS.W.3d 589, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 5952 (Tex. App. Austin 2005).\n\n155. Statute governing license suspension appeals is the touchstone in deciding which standard of review should apply:\nthe statute specifically requires the reviewing court to use the substantial evidence rule. Because a court applying the\nsubstantial evidence standard of review may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative law judge as to the\nweight of the evidence, the equally plausible but opposite inferences construct can not be part of the substantial evi-\ndence rule. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Hirschman, 169 S.W.3d 331, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 4579 (Tex. App. Waco 2005).\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 22\n                                                Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\n\n\n156. At the license suspension hearing, the arresting officer testified that the driver's vehicle was moving erratically, the\nofficer smelled alcohol coming from the interior of the vehicle, and the driver failed sobriety tests; there was substantial\nevidence to support the administrative finding that there was reasonable suspicion to stop and probable cause to arrest\nthe driver for driving while intoxicated. The trial court erred by reversing the administrative decision to suspend her\ndriver's license, because she refused to provide a breath sample. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Leath, 2005 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 3927 (Tex. App. Amarillo May 18 2005).\n\n157. Substantial evidence in the record supported the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's finding that a\nlandfill owner's expansion application was administratively and technically complete because the owner had included\nall necessary information in the application, and while some witnesses could not independently verify particular docu-\nments or exhibits, there was nothing in the record that cast doubt upon the information, and the opponents to the appli-\ncation did not introduce any contrary exhibits to demonstrate that the limited evidence was altered or falsified. Because\nthe application was determined to be administratively and technically complete prior to the contested case hearing, the\nowner was not required to establish at the contested-case hearing that its application complied with each administrative\nand technical requirement because it had already done so prior to the hearing. Citizens Against Landfill Location v. Tex.\nComm'n on Envtl. Quality, 169 S.W.3d 258, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 3583 (Tex. App. Austin 2005).\n\n158. Decision of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) to use the electric company's original overstated esti-\nmate of its transmission system capital costs for a particular interconnection project was not supported by substantial\nevidence as required by Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 15.001 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), Tex. Util. Code\nAnn. §§ 11.001-64.158, and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E). The electric company's witness had reduced his\nestimate on rebuttal due to the fact that new technology increased the capacity of existing transmission facilities and\neliminated the need to construct certain new projects; therefore no reasonable basis existed for the PUC's use of the\noriginal estimate. Reliant Energy, Inc. v. PUC, 153 S.W.3d 174, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 11280 (Tex. App. Austin 2004).\n\n159. Texas Department of Public Safety properly suspended an individual's driver's license for his refusal to give a\nbreath specimen after he was arrested for suspicion of DWI. On review, the county court ruled that substantial evidence\nexisted to affirm the administrative decision suspending his driver's license, and that the individual failed to prove that\nthe administrative decision prejudiced his substantial rights. Parks v. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS\n9365 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. Oct. 21 2004).\n\n160. Substantial evidence pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 supported an order of the Public Utility Com-\nmission of Texas that raised the fuel factor component of the price-to-beat for an affiliated retail electric provider\n(AREP) because the Commission linked the measurement of the adequacy of the fuel factor to reflect significant\nchanges in market price and the mechanism to correct inadequacies, and concluded that the New York Mercantile Ex-\nchange (NYMEX) was sufficient for both tasks, and because the Commission did not err in barring the order's oppo-\nnents from presenting relevant evidence under Tex. R. Evid. 401 where evidence regarding the AREP's purchase price\nand any windfall profits resulting from the fuel-factor adjustment did not bear on whether the NYMEX index had\nchanged the requisite amount. Furthermore, the fuel-factor increase did not violate a set limit on the price-to-beat under\nTex. Util. Code Ann. § 39.202 because the adjustments under § 39.202(l) were not limited by § 39.202(p). City of Alvin\nv. PUC of Tex., 143 S.W.3d 872, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 7685 (Tex. App. Austin 2004).\n\n161. Court rejected a motorist's claim that field sobriety tests were inadmissible in connection with the administrative\nsuspension of the motorist's license where, considering the standard of review under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 524.041\nand Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the court found that there was more than a scintilla of evidence to support an ad-\nministrative law judge's inference that the officer acted in the following order regardless of the time notations entered on\nthe officer's report: (1) that the officer stopped the motorist, (2) noticed signs of intoxication, (3) asked the motorist\nwhat and where the motorist had been drinking, (4) administered field sobriety tests, (5) arrested the motorist, and (6)\nthen read the motorist his Miranda rights.

The district court's judgment upholding the Board's second order was affirmed (1) suspending the doctor's medical\nlicense until he could show that he was safe and competent to practice medicine, (2) setting forth the minimum terms\nand conditions with which the doctor had to comply to make that showing, and (3) imposing an administrative penalty\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 23\n                                                Tex.

Revocation of a doctor's medical license was supported by substantial evidence where there was scientific evidence\nthat two of the doctor's urine samples tested positive for cocaine, and one expert witness definitively testified that the\ntests foreclosed the possibility of ingestion by inadvertent passive exposure. Hinkley v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs,\n140 S.W.3d 737, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 5078 (Tex. App. Austin 2004).\n\n164. Sufficient evidence supported a two-year administrative license suspension where the driver had prior offenses and\nthe officer's report indicated that the driver exhibited a number of traits consistent with intoxication. The officer's report\nwas properly admitted, even though his name was omitted from the introductory portion of the affidavit. Tex. Dep't of\nPub. Safety v. Salinas, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 4257 (Tex. App. San Antonio May 12 2004).\n\n165. Where substantial evidence supported the findings that an insurance licensee wrongfully paid premiums from an-\nother business account, paid bonuses or compensation for referring new business, offered to rebate premiums, and paid\nunlicensed persons for the services of an agent, revocation of an insurance license was proper. Murphy v. Comm'r of\nIns., 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 10156 (Tex. App. Austin Dec. 4 2003).\n\n166. Substantial evidence supported a decision by the Texas Racing Commission to impose penalties under Tex. Rev.\nCiv. Stat. Ann. art. 179e, § 3.07(b) on a horse owner and trainer whose racing horse tested positive for prohibited drug;\nalthough the Commission's rules did not set forth any procedures for handling a urine sample that was inadvertently\nreturned, the Commission acted reasonably in storing and resending the sample for testing, and the integrity of that\nsample had not been compromised. Keeton v. Tex. Racing Comm'n, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6925 (Tex. App. Austin Aug.\n14 2003).\n\n167. Because contested-case hearings before the Motor Vehicle Board of the Texas Department of Transportation are\nheard under the APA without a specified standard of review, the substantial evidence rule applies under Tex.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, an appellate court reviews the legal conclusions of the Motor Vehicle\nBoard of the Texas Department of Transportation for errors of law, and the court reviews the board's findings of fact for\nsupport by substantial evidence.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(f), the evidentiary test of a decision of the Motor Vehicle Board of the\nTexas Department of Transportation is whether the evidence in its entirety is sufficient that reasonable minds could\nhave reached the conclusion the agency must have reached to justify the disputed action. BMW of N. Am., L.L.C. v. Mo-\ntor Vehicle Bd., 115 S.W.3d 722, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6923 (Tex. App. Austin 2003).\n\n170. Appellate review under Tex.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the Commissioner's consideration of two\n25-year-old felony convictions that involved the defrauding of elderly victims through the sale of an unauthorized in-\nsurance product was not erroneous under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. §§ 53.021,.022 and substantial evidence existed demon-\nstrating that the applicant failed to make restitution and failed to provide letters of recommendation from prosecutors,\nlaw enforcement, and correctional officers, as required by Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 53.023(a)(6)(A) and (b); thus, there\nwas ample evidence in the record to support the Commissioner's decision denying the applicant a local recording agent's\nlicense. Smith v.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the district court's judgment affirming the Texas Commission on\nEnvironmental Quality's order granting the landfill operator a permit to build and operate a municipal landfill facility\nwas proper because there was substantial evidence to support the findings and conclusions that: (1) the operator's\ngroundwater-monitoring plan was sufficient; (2) a fault with displacement in the Holocene time did not exist within 200\nfeet of the proposed landfill; (3) the landfill liner's integrity would not be compromised; (4) the operator's floodplain\nanalysis provided an accurate delineation of the 100-year floodplain; (5) the operator adequately demonstrated the ef-\nfects of its proposed project on flood conditions with respect to soil-cover operations; and (6) the project would not sig-\nnificantly alter natural drainage.

Substantial evidence supported administrative law judge's decision to uphold the driver's suspension of the driver's\nlicense as the evidence showed the driver was driving while intoxicated, that reasonable suspicion supported the deten-\ntion of the driver to investigate the accident the driver had been in, that probable cause existed to arrest the driver for\ndriving while intoxicated, and that the suspension of his license was warranted.

Since statute making an inmate liable for intentional damage to state property did not specify a judicial standard of\nreview, the \"substantial evidence\" standard of review applied and dictated that disciplinary conviction and fine imposed\non inmate for property damage inmate caused during riot be supported by evidence that amounted to \"only more than a\nmere scintilla\" in order to uphold the prison's disciplinary action against the inmate.

Code Ann. § 2001.174, the court erred in reversing a license sus-\npension decision by the Texas Department of Public Safety; the administrative law judge did not err in finding, pursuant\nto Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 524.035(a)(2), that the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for driving while in-\ntoxicated. State Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Boeck, 2001 Tex. App. LEXIS 2785 (Tex.

Because a regional groundwater district was not a state agency with statewide jurisdiction, the Administrative Pro-\ncedures Act did not apply, except that the substantial evidence rule contained in Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 was\nmade applicable under Tex. Water Code Ann. § 36.253 for purposes of judicial review of district actions. S. Plains\nLamesa R.R. v.

Final orders of the Railroad Commission are deemed to be prima facie valid and subject to review under the sub-\nstantial evidence rule. An appellate court reviews the Commission's legal conclusions for errors of law and its findings\nof fact for support by substantial evidence. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174. H. G. Sledge, Inc. v.

Under the substantial evidence standard of review applied to final orders of the Railroad Commission pursuant to\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the proper test is whether the evidence in its entirety is sufficient that reasonable\nminds could have reached the conclusion that the Commission must have reached to justify the disputed action. The\nissue is whether the Commission acted arbitrarily and without regard to the facts. H. G. Sledge, Inc. v. Prospective Inv.\n& Trading Co., Ltd., 36 S.W.3d 597, 2000 Tex. App. LEXIS 7557, 151 Oil & Gas Rep. 265 (Tex. App. Austin 2000).\n\n186. Reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of a state agency on questions committed to agency dis-\ncretion. H.

When applying the substantial evidence standard of review under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E), a court\nmay not substitute its judgment for the agency; the issue is not whether the agency's decision was correct, but only\nwhether the record demonstrates some reasonable basis for the agency's action. Substantial evidence requires more than\na mere scintilla of evidence; the evidence may preponderate against the agency's decision and still be substantial evi-\ndence Texas Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Favela, 2000 Tex. App. LEXIS 6638 (Tex. App. Austin Oct. 5 2000).\n\n189. Under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. 2001.174 a reviewing court must reverse and remand for further administrative pro-\nceedings if substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, con-\nclusions, or decisions are not reasonably supported by substantial evidence considering the reliable and probative evi-\ndence in the record as a whole. Central Power & Light Co. v. PUC of Texas, 36 S.W.3d 547, 2000 Tex. App. LEXIS\n4905 (Tex. App. Austin 2000).\n\n190. Under the Texas Administrative Procedures Act, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2), the trial court has the au-\nthority to reverse an agency determination if it finds that the substantive rights of the appellant are prejudiced due to a\nconstitutional or statutory violation, the decision was made unlawfully or affected by an error of law, not supported by\nsubstantial evidence, or was found to be arbitrary or capricious. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Breazeale, 1999 Tex. App. LEX-\nIS 7131 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. Sept. 23 1999).\n\n191. The standard of review of an agency decision is set out in Tex. Gov't. Code Ann. § 2001.174; a court may reverse\nthe agency's decision only if the substantial rights of the appellant had been prejudiced; here, a railroad commission\ncould reasonably have concluded that a well operator received actual notice of the hearing and that his failure to appear\n\f                                                                                                                    Page 26\n                                               Tex.

App. Austin 1998).\n\n192. Where death benefits were denied by the Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas on the\nbasis that the death was not accidental and was caused by the decedent's intentional act, the decision was reviewed on\nthe basis of the substantial evidence standard pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 and Tex. Ins. Code Ann. art.\n3.50-2, § 4B(d). Butler v. Group Life & Health Ins. Co., 962 S.W.2d 296, 1998 Tex. App. LEXIS 858 (Tex. App. Austin\n1998).\n\n193. Where a decedent dry-fired a gun several times, someone then replaced the clip in the gun without the decedent's\nknowledge, and the decedent fired the gun again, killing himself, the decision of the Board of Trustees of the Employ-\nees Retirement System of Texas that decedent's death was not accidental and denying the beneficiary recovery under the\ninsurance policy was not supported by substantial evidence as required under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174. Butler\nv. Group Life & Health Ins. Co., 962 S.W.2d 296, 1998 Tex. App. LEXIS 858 (Tex. App. Austin 1998).\n\n194. Substantial evidence was before the Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas to support its\nfinding that air travel or flight caused decedent's runway accident and that this was a risk contemplated by the aviation\nexclusion in the accidental death benefits provision of the public employees life insurance plan; the standard of judicial\nreview of the board's order was that provided for cases of \"substantial evidence\" review under the terms of the Admin-\nistrative Procedures Act, specifically Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.174, and because its order was supported by substantial\nevidence and was not arbitrary or capricious, the district court erred in not affirming the decision of the board to deny\naccidental death benefits to decedent's spouse. Board of Trustees v. Benge, 942 S.W.2d 742, 1997 Tex. App. LEXIS 1519\n(Tex. App. Austin 1997).\n\n195. The Administrative Procedure Act (Act), Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, which empowered the Board of Trus-\ntees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas to prepare coverage specifications made under the Act, was con-\nstrued in a manner that entitled the trustees' interpretation of policy exclusions to be given judicial respect regarding any\nuncertainty where the interpretation was reasonable; the finding that an optometrist's \"vision therapy treatments\" fell\nwithin the policy exclusion of \"orthoptics or visual training\" was held to be reasonable. McMullen v. Employees Re-\ntirement Sys., 935 S.W.2d 189, 1996 Tex. App. LEXIS 5142 (Tex. App. Austin 1996).\n\n196. Under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E) the court was not required to reverse the Texas Department of Ag-\nriculture order imposing administrative penalties on an aerial crop-dusting service because the service's substantial\nrights were not prejudiced where the agency decision finding that the service had violated a regulation by spraying an\nautomobile with pesticide was reasonably supported by substantial evidence. Lauderdale v. Department of Agric., 923\nS.W.2d 834, 1996 Tex. App. LEXIS 2221 (Tex. App. Austin 1996).\n\n197. A decision of the Texas Railroad Commission was upheld on appeal where the decision was supported by substan-\ntial evidence because, under the substantial evidence standard of review pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.174, the\nreview of a decision of a state agency that fell within the agency's authority required the court to give significant defer-\nence to the agency in its field of expertise and did not allow the court to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\nRailroad Comm'n v. Torch Operating Co., 912 S.W.2d 790, 1995 Tex. LEXIS 162, 39 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 165, 131 Oil &\nGas Rep. 128 (Tex. 1995).\n\n198. Appellate court review is governed by 2001.174(2)(E) of the Administrative Procedure Act (\"APA\"), Tex. Gov't\nCode Ann. § 2001.174, under which appellate courts review for substantial evidence questions committed to an agency's\ndiscretion and challenged by the parties on appeal; in conducting a substantial evidence review, appellate courts deter-\nmine whether the evidence as a whole is such that reasonable minds could have reached the same conclusion as the\nagency in the disputed action.

Although there was evidence that doctor charged more than other doctors for the services rendered or that doctor\ncharged for services that other doctors would not charge for, the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of fla-\ngrant or persistent overcharging; the court held that doctor's evidence that he sent an enormous amount of time with the\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 27\n                                               Tex.

Birenbaum, 891 S.W.2d 333, 1995 Tex. App. LEXIS 44 (Tex. App. Austin 1995).\n\n200. In reviewing the findings of the hearings examiner, both the trial court and the appellate court must employ the\nsubstantial evidence standard; an appellant bears the burden to prove that the findings, inferences, conclusions, and de-\ncisions of the administrative agency are not supported by substantial evidence, and in making the determination, the trial\nand appellate courts must review all the evidence presented; to sustain the burden under this standard, the appellant\nmust show that no substantial evidence existed at the time of the hearing to support the order, and the court may not\nsubstitute its judgment for the agency's as to the weight of evidence on questions committed to the discretion of the\nagency but may reverse the decision if the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions 1) violate con-\nstitutional or statutory provisions, 2) exceed the statutory authority of the agency, 3) rely on unlawful procedure, 4) are\naffected by other error of law, 5) are not reasonably supported by substantial evidence in view of the reliable and proba-\ntive evidence in the record as a whole, or 6) are arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\nunwarranted exercise of discretion; substantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but may be less than a preponderance,\nand if reasonable minds could have reached the conclusion of the administrator, the court must uphold the decision.

Where the Texas State Board of Pharmacy revoked a pharmacist license held by an individual and his pharmacy,\nthe revocation was improper; the Board's conclusions of law were not fairly supported by its findings of underlying fact,\nas there was no evidence that filled prescriptions did not have a therapeutic purpose. State Bd. of Pharmacy v. Seely,\n764 S.W.2d 806, 1988 Tex. App. LEXIS 3416 (Tex. App. Austin 1988).\n\n205. Substantial evidence test under the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat.\nAnn. art. 6252-13a (now Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174) must be applied to judicial review of decisions of the Texas\nState Board of Dental Examiners to determine if there was some reasonable basis for petitioner' s action; on review the\nappellate court erroneously disregarded this test when it applied a test based on due process consideration. Texas State\nBd. of Dental Exmrs. v. Sizemore, 759 S.W.2d 114, 1988 Tex. LEXIS 80, 31 Tex. Sup. Ct. J. 537 (Tex. 1988).\n\n206. Pursuant to Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13a, § 19(e) (now Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174), a reviewing\ncourt is only allowed to reverse a Texas Board of Medical Examiners decision in the absence of substantial evidence\nand only if the absence had prejudiced the substantial rights of the physician.

Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13a, §\n19(e)(5) (now Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174), authorizes a reviewing court to test an agency's findings, inferences,\nconclusions, and decisions to determine whether they are reasonably supported by substantial evidence in view of the\nreliable and probative evidence in the record as a whole; in applying the test, a court is prohibited from substituting its\njudgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions committed to agency discretion; a review-\ning court may reverse an agency decision because of the absence of substantial evidence only if such absence has preju-\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 28\n                                                Tex.

Trial court's order sustaining a determination by the Texas Real Estate Commission suspending a real estate bro-\nker's license for breach of an alleged promise to a buyer to pay for the fencing of a lot if purchased was reversed where\nthe record did not support the requisite elements of fraud by substantial evidence as required by the Administrative\nProcedure and Texas Register Act, former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13a, § 19(e)(5) and ordinary breach of\ncontract did not constitute fraud. Texas Real Estate Comm'n. v. Hinde, 627 S.W.2d 537, 1982 Tex. App. LEXIS 3818\n(Tex.

Where respondent cancelled several permits to sell alcoholic beverages because petitioner had been intoxicated on\nthe licensed premises, the trial court abused its discretion when it set aside respondent's administrative decisions when\nrespondent's decision was supported by substantial evidence as required by former Tex.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality's conclusion that a coalition was not an affected person was made\nthrough improper procedure, was affected by error of law, and was an abuse of discretion under Tex.

App. Austin 2011).\n\n\n\n211. Agreed Final Judgment purported to find facts (that the city had met the criteria for issuance of a permit) and to\nrender judgment granting a permit, and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 did not empower courts to take such action,\nwhich went beyond their limited authority in a substantial-evidence review, and having concluded that there was error\nprejudicing substantial rights of the city's, the court's only options were to reverse or remand the case for further pro-\nceedings; accordingly, the district court's Agreed Final Judgment, which had the effect of rendering a specific judgment,\ncontravened the direct restriction on the special statutory jurisdiction delegated to the court in its substantial-evidence\nreview, and because the judgment violated the separation-of-powers doctrine of the Texas Constitution, Tex. Const. art.\nII, § 1, it was void and its rendition was fundamental error. Save Our Springs Alliance, Inc. v. City of Kyle, 382 S.W.3d\n540, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 7548 (Tex. App. Austin 2012).\n\n212. Although appellee acknowledged that appellant owned 100 percent of the leasehold oil and gas estate, and that he\nhad the right \"to inject saltwater under the tract produced from the tract\" to benefit that lease tract, resolution of appel-\nlant's complaint turned on construction of the deeds in appellee's chain of title--specifically, the parameters of the \"sur-\nface estate\" conveyed through those instruments. Thus, it was the sort of issue that was beyond the Texas Railroad\nCommission's jurisdiction under 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 3.9. Rosenthal v. R.R. Comm'n, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 6522\n(Tex. App. Austin Aug. 20 2009).\n\n\n\n213. Remand for further administrative proceedings was proper under the primary jurisdiction doctrine after a trial court\nerred in denying a manufacturer's plea to the jurisdiction in a dealership transfer case; however, the remand order could\nnot require the agency to act.

Redundant remedies doctrine did not bar challenges to licensing regulations by unlicensed individuals in the busi-\nness of eyebrow threading, even if some of them could seek substantive relief through the administrative process, be-\ncause there was no administrative action pending against one of the individuals.

Where one of the pooled unit's property owners sought to dissolve the gas pooling unit as moot, but, on appeal,\nfailed to provide a party, who was originally an intervenor but was a party under the definition provided for in Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.003(4), with service of a copy of the petition for judicial review, the complaining owner did not\nmeet a necessary condition on which its right to seek judicial review of the Texas Railroad Commission's order de-\npended and, thus, the complaining owner did not prove its right to the relief it sought from the trial court; pursuant to\nTex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the trial court had no choice but to affirm the order of the Commission denying the\ncomplaining owner's request to dissolve the pooling unit and it did affirm that order. Helton v. R.R. Comm'n, 126\nS.W.3d 111, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 4832, 164 Oil & Gas Rep. 1057 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2003).\n\n\n\n216. Business owner could not bring claims for declaratory relief under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.004\nagainst state agency regarding practicing cosmetology without a license as the owner had already sought judicial review\nof the agency decision under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174; the remedy would be redundant as the basis for both\nclaims was that eyebrow threading did not fall within the definition of cosmetology in Tex. Occ. Code Ann. §\n1602.002(a), a proper basis for a claim for judicial review under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(A) & (B). Kuntz v.\nKhan, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 446 (Tex. App. Austin Jan. 21 2011).\n\n217. Declaratory judgment action against the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy claiming that the Board's stand-\nards and principles were so unconstitutionally vague that they did not sufficiently identify what constituted a violation\nwas redundant as auditors, who had their professional certificates revoked or suspended, had filed an administrative\nappeal under Tex.

By refusing to strike the Edwards Aquifer Authority's jury demand and setting landowners' appeal of the Authori-\nty's permitting decision for a jury trial, a trial court failed to apply the law correctly and fundamentally altered the nature\nof the judicial review prescribed by statute because the Authority had a clear right to proceed to a final determination\nwithout a jury, pursuant to Tex.

App. P. 54(a) precluded appellate court from considering\na late-filed statement of facts, it did not require affirming a judgment as a matter of course because the statement of\nfacts was not mandatory for appeal under Tex. R. App. P. 50(a); the appellate court was obligated to address every issue\nunder Tex. R. App. P. 90(a), and some issues did not require reference to a statement of facts; and while an appellate\ncourt generally could not determine whether an agency finding was supported by \"substantial evidence\" without re-\nviewing the administrative record pursuant to Tex.

Where a driver was asked to provide a breath sample to the investigating officer, and attempted to do so, but her\nattempts were unsuccessful solely due to her intoxication, under Tex.

Administrative law judge's (ALJ) suspension of a driver's license was supported by substantial evidence where the\narresting officer surmised in his sworn report that the driver had been driving while intoxicated because he emitted a\nstrong odor of alcohol, had glassy eyes and slurred speech, and his movements were slowed and staggered, and where\nthe record revealed that the driver admitted to drinking a few beers before the accident. That gave the officer reasonable\nsuspicion to investigate the driver further, and the officer's reasonable suspicion evolved into probable cause when he\nobserved five out of the six points of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test and the driver refused to provide a breath\nspecimen. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Burrer, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 3534 (Tex. App. San Antonio May 11 2005).\n\n\n\n225. Professional disciplinary action against a doctor, based on stale allegations of improper touching of a female pa-\ntient's breasts, resulted in a due process violation that caused actual prejudice to the doctor's substantial rights, and the\naction was therefore arbitrary and capricious under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(A); staleness was not a signifi-\ncant concern as to another patient's complaints, however, because contemporaneous documentary evidence of the com-\nplaints existed.

At the license suspension hearing, the arresting officer testified that the driver's vehicle was moving erratically, the\nofficer smelled alcohol coming from the interior of the vehicle, and the driver failed sobriety tests; there was substantial\nevidence to support the administrative finding that there was reasonable suspicion to stop and probable cause to arrest\nthe driver for driving while intoxicated. The trial court erred by reversing the administrative decision to suspend her\ndriver's license, because she refused to provide a breath sample. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Leath, 2005 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 3927 (Tex. App. Amarillo May 18 2005).\n\n230. Administrative law judge's (ALJ) suspension of a driver's license was supported by substantial evidence where the\narresting officer surmised in his sworn report that the driver had been driving while intoxicated because he emitted a\nstrong odor of alcohol, had glassy eyes and slurred speech, and his movements were slowed and staggered, and where\nthe record revealed that the driver admitted to drinking a few beers before the accident. That gave the officer reasonable\nsuspicion to investigate the driver further, and the officer's reasonable suspicion evolved into probable cause when he\nobserved five out of the six points of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test and the driver refused to provide a breath\nspecimen.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2) for reversal of the suspension were\nnot met and that the holder failed to show that the suspension violated his substantive rights, given that he was free to\nrequest a continuance after receiving the documentation only two days before the suspension hearing.

Texas Department of Public Safety properly suspended an individual's driver's license for his refusal to give a\nbreath specimen after he was arrested for suspicion of DWI. On review, the county court ruled that substantial evidence\nexisted to affirm the administrative decision suspending his driver's license, and that the individual failed to prove that\nthe administrative decision prejudiced his substantial rights.

Code Ann. § 524.012(b)(1) because there was a reasonable suspicion to stop a vehi-\ncle based on a failure to stop at a red light, there was probable cause to arrest due to an odor of alcohol and signs of in-\ntoxication, and the driver's blood alcohol was above the legal limit.

Code Ann. §\n524.035(a), because (1) the officer could have reasonably concluded that the driver had committed a traffic offense each\ntime she traveled onto the shoulder, under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 545.058(a); (2) the officer could have reasonably\nconcluded that the driver's conduct in driving on the shoulder three times negated application of any of the seven statu-\ntory reasons permitting a one-time driving on the shoulder; and (3) conflicting evidence existed before the ALJ.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the appellate court had to reverse when a substantial right had been prej-\nudiced because the administrative decision was affected by an error of law; the administrative law judge erred in apply-\ning the law to the facts as she found them where no necessity justification existed at the time of the driver's arrest be-\ncause his drive back to the scene was not in avoidance of any imminent harm.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the trial court had no choice but to affirm the order of the Commission denying the\ncomplaining owner's request to dissolve the pooling unit and it did affirm that order.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the proper test is whether the evidence in its entirety is sufficient that reasonable\nminds could have reached the conclusion that the Commission must have reached to justify the disputed action. The\nissue is whether the Commission acted arbitrarily and without regard to the facts. H. G. Sledge, Inc. v. Prospective Inv.\n& Trading Co., Ltd., 36 S.W.3d 597, 2000 Tex.

Decision of the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) to use the electric company's original overstated esti-\nmate of its transmission system capital costs for a particular interconnection project was not supported by substantial\nevidence as required by Tex. Util. Code Ann. § 15.001 of the Public Utility Regulatory Act (PURA), Tex. Util. Code\nAnn. §§ 11.001-64.158, and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E). The electric company's witness had reduced his\nestimate on rebuttal due to the fact that new technology increased the capacity of existing transmission facilities and\neliminated the need to construct certain new projects; therefore no reasonable basis existed for the PUC's use of the\noriginal estimate.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 supported an order of the Public Utility Com-\nmission of Texas that raised the fuel factor component of the price-to-beat for an affiliated retail electric provider\n(AREP) because the Commission linked the measurement of the adequacy of the fuel factor to reflect significant\nchanges in market price and the mechanism to correct inadequacies, and concluded that the New York Mercantile Ex-\nchange (NYMEX) was sufficient for both tasks, and because the Commission did not err in barring the order's oppo-\nnents from presenting relevant evidence under Tex. R. Evid. 401 where evidence regarding the AREP's purchase price\nand any windfall profits resulting from the fuel-factor adjustment did not bear on whether the NYMEX index had\nchanged the requisite amount. Furthermore, the fuel-factor increase did not violate a set limit on the price-to-beat under\nTex. Util. Code Ann. § 39.202 because the adjustments under § 39.202(l) were not limited by § 39.202(p).

There are two requirements that the Texas Public Utility Commission must meet in order to consider a\nnon-unanimous settlement stipulation (NUS) as part of its final order; first, the commission must afford any\nnon-stipulating party the opportunity to be heard on the merits of the stipulation and, second, the commission must\nmake an independent finding, on the merits, that the terms of the stipulation are fair, just and reasonable, and are sup-\nported by evidence in the record; the second requirement reflects the rule that an agency's decision, whether or not\nbased on an NUS, must be supported by substantial evidence.

Texas Railroad Commission's adoption of a non-publicly traded gas utility's rate adjustment mechanism did not\nviolate the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act because the substantive aspects of the adjust-\nment mechanism were fully reviewed in a contested-case hearing, during which witnesses were permitted to, and did,\npresent testimony both in favor of and opposed to the adjustment mechanism.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality did not err in issuing an air quality permit to an applicant seeking to\nbuild a pulverized coal power plant because although opponents of the permit argued that an application had to be de-\nnied or that an offset had to be obtained when any downwind contribution was made to a national ambient air quality\nstandards (NAAQS) ozone exceedance, both the federal and state interpretation of the \"cause or contribute to\" standard\nfor a violation of NAAQS will tolerate some insignificant level of contribution to a downwind NAAQS ozone exceed-\nance.

An IGCC pro-\ncess was significantly different from the pulverized coal power plant proposed by the applicant, and because an oppo-\nnent of the application had offered no evidence that IGCC was a process that could be applied to the proposed pulver-\nized coal power plant, it had failed to meet its burden.

Pursuant to the former Texas Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. §\n19(e)(5), the evidence was sufficient for the Texas Water Commission (Commission) to deny applicant permits to con-\nstruct and operate a hazardous waste facility, where the applicant proposed to store hazardous slurry in a salt dome cav-\nern, where the applicant could not guarantee that the slurry would maintain proper contact with the cavern walls, where\nthe salt dome was structurally unstable, and where tow aquifers were located above the salt dome.

Order of the Texas Railroad Commission, directing appellant company to backfill and compact certain sludge pits\nand to dispose of all oil or oil by-products located in them, was not arbitrary and capricious under former Tex. Rev. Civ.\nStat. Ann. art. 6252-13a, § 19(e)(6) because the fact that appellant controlled the pits for 23 years was not legally irrel-\nevant, nor was it inherently arbitrary to proceed against only appellant even though other potentially liable parties ex-\nisted; while the pits had been conveyed to appellant by a corporation that had disposed of sludge in the pits, and appel-\nlant subsequently had released its interest in the pits to another party, the harm caused by the joint tortfeasors was indi-\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 38\n                                               Tex.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality did not abuse its discretion in approving the expansion of a munici-\npal solid-waste landfill to increase the height of allowable waste disposal by 50 to 75 feet from its existing height of 720\nfeet, despite odors affecting the neighbors, because odor was not a specifically delineated factor for\nland-use-compatibility determinations in 30 Tex.

Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) violated Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. § 361.0832 when\nit expanded a landfill's operating hours and overturned an administrative law judge's (ALJ) findings with no explanation\nof its reasoning or grounds for so deciding.

Heritage v. Tex. Comm'n on Envtl. Quality & Williamson County, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 6460 (Tex.\nApp. Austin July 31 2012).\n\n273. Substantial evidence in the record supported the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission's finding that a\nlandfill owner's expansion application was administratively and technically complete because the owner had included\nall necessary information in the application, and while some witnesses could not independently verify particular docu-\nments or exhibits, there was nothing in the record that cast doubt upon the information, and the opponents to the appli-\ncation did not introduce any contrary exhibits to demonstrate that the limited evidence was altered or falsified. Because\nthe application was determined to be administratively and technically complete prior to the contested case hearing, the\nowner was not required to establish at the contested-case hearing that its application complied with each administrative\nand technical requirement because it had already done so prior to the hearing.

Group's substantial rights were not prejudiced by the addition of the special provision to the landfill application,\nbecause the appellate court could not see how the group had been harmed by the Texas Commission on Environmental\nQuality adopting a permit that provided more groundwater monitoring than was required by the administrative rules,\nwhen the permit not only satisfied the rules' requirements that groundwater from the uppermost aquifer be monitored, as\nit must, but it also provided for extra monitoring of groundwater that the evidence showed was not in the uppermost\naquifer.

Texas Racing Commission's decision to modify the ALJ's conclusion and impose the steward's initial penalty of\ndisqualifying the horse and the loss of the purse due the use of ipratropium, a prohibited Class 3 drug, was within the\nCommission's authority under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.058(e), and the \"loss of purse\" penalty was expressly au-\nthorized by the Texas Racing Act, Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 179e, and the Commission's rules, guidelines, and ze-\nro-drug tolerance policy; further, the burden of proof was correctly placed on the owner and at the appropriate standard\nbecause nothing in the Tex.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2), the trial court has the au-\nthority to reverse an agency determination if it finds that the substantive rights of the appellant are prejudiced due to a\nconstitutional or statutory violation, the decision was made unlawfully or affected by an error of law, not supported by\nsubstantial evidence, or was found to be arbitrary or capricious.

Ann. art. 179e,\n§ 3.08(b) makes other decisions on disqualification of racehorses appealable by implication; thus, an owner whose\nhorses were disqualified for wearing the wrong saddle cloth numbers had a right to an administrative appeal, and his\nrequest for declaratory relief under Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem. Code Ann. § 37.004 fell within the ultra vires exception to\nsovereign immunity. The trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to make further rulings on the merits until the\nowner exhausted administrative remedies as provided in Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 179e, §§ 3.02, 3.08 and Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174. Tex. Racing Comm'n v. Marquez, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6653 (Tex. App. Austin Aug. 19\n2011).\n\n285. Substantial evidence supported a decision by the Texas Racing Commission to impose penalties under Tex. Rev.\nCiv. Stat. Ann. art. 179e, § 3.07(b) on a horse owner and trainer whose racing horse tested positive for prohibited drug;\nalthough the Commission's rules did not set forth any procedures for handling a urine sample that was inadvertently\nreturned, the Commission acted reasonably in storing and resending the sample for testing, and the integrity of that\nsample had not been compromised. Keeton v. Tex. Racing Comm'n, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6925 (Tex. App. Austin Aug.\n14 2003).\n\n\n\n286. Texas Commission of Licensing and Regulation complied with Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.058(e) by specifying\nthe reason and legal basis for its modifications to the ALJ's findings and conclusions and its decision was supported by\nsubstantial evidence and made through lawful procedure. Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§ 2001.058(e), .174; the Commission\nexpressly addressed and made findings in its decisions to the statutory factors in the Occupation Code. Tex.

Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission properly suspended the licensee's alcoholic beverage permit and license\nfor five days, because substantial evidence supported the conclusion that the third party was an employee, agent, or\nservant for purposes of establishing a violation of Tex. Alco. Bev. Code Ann. § 104.01(4), when the focus was whether\nthere was substantial evidence to support the determination that the third party was an employee, agent, or servant for\npurposes of establishing a violation.

Enforced suspension of appellee's pharmacist license by the Texas State Board of Pharmacy concurrently with the\nsuspension of her North Carolina license resulted from the improper application of a \"rule\" as that term was defined in\nthe Administrative Procedure Act (APA), Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.003(6). The Board's informally announced re-\nciprocal-sanctions policy was invalid under Tex.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2), by a re-\nhearing on the cancellation of its liquor license: a rehearing was not essential to due process in administrative proceed-\nings, and different treatment from other violators was insufficient to establish discrimination.

Order canceling a business's mixed beverage, late hours, and beverage cartage permits and denying its application\nto renew its food and beverage certificate did not prejudice the business's rights within the meaning of Tex.

Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\n\n\n291. In a medical license suspension case, the court erred by denying a doctor's motion for rehearing because the doctor\ntimely filed a motion for rehearing giving the Board fair notice that he was dissatisfied with its conclusions that he\nfailed to practice medicine in a manner consistent with public health and welfare and failed to treat a patient according\nto the generally accepted standard of care. Johnson v. Tex. Med. Bd., 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 845 (Tex. App. Austin Feb.\n5 2010).\n\n292. There was substantial evidence in the record to support the Texas State Board of Public Accountancy's conclusion\nthat a certificate holder had presented himself as an accountant while his certificate was suspended; the record did not\nsupport the holder's claim that he misunderstood the effect of a 1999 order suspending his certificate to practice public\naccountancy; the holder had committed violations in the past, and he was found to be not fit to practice public account-\nancy under Tex.

Trial court's conclusion that the state motor vehicle board's findings of fact that a motor vehicle distributor engaged\nin business as a dealer in Texas were not supported by substantial evidence, and that the board's conclusions of law that\nthe distributor violated statutory prohibitions, were affected by error of law, was upheld where the undisputed facts were\nthat, in response to a Texas city's solicitation, the distributor sold and delivered two buses to the city in New Mexico\nand that, from there, the city paid for the buses to be brought into Texas; there was no evidence that the distributor ever\nphysically crossed the New Mexico border into Texas related to the transaction, and, under Tex. Bus. & Com. Code Ann.\n§ 2.401, legal title to the buses passed in New Mexico because the agreement of the parties required the distributor to\ndeliver the buses in New Mexico. Motor Vehicle Bd. v. Prevost Car (US), Inc., 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 8461 (Tex. App.\nAustin Sept. 26 2006).\n\n294. Trial court erred by concluding that cancellation of a permittee's mixed beverage permits was an inappropriate\npenalty for a single violation where, in addition to the permittee's selling of an alcoholic beverage to a patron who ex-\nhibited obvious signs of intoxication, the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission had assessed administrative penalties\nagainst the permittee for seven separate violations of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Code (ABC); because the repeated\nviolations evidenced a disregard for the provisions of the ABC and the sanctions imposed by the Commission, the\nCommission had not acted arbitrarily or capriciously or abused its discretion by canceling the permittee's mixed bever-\nage and late night permits. Tex. Alcoholic Bev. Comm'n v. Quintana, 225 S.W.3d 200, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 9988 (Tex.\nApp. El Paso 2005).\n\n295. Texas State Board of Medical Examiners' conclusion that disciplinary grounds existed for a doctor's improper con-\ntact with a female patient was supported by its findings, conclusions and evidence, in accordance with Tex. Gov't Code\nAnn. § 2001.174(2)(E), where even though the patient was somewhat confused and inconsistent regarding the details of\nher surroundings when the incidents occurred, she testified unequivocally that the doctor touched her breasts despite her\nattempts to shield herself with magazines. The administrative law judge heard the patient's testimony firsthand, was able\nto observe her and her demeanor, and concluded that she made a credible witness, and the appellate court could not\nsecond-guess such credibility determinations in the guise of a substantial-evidence inquiry. Granek v. Tex. State Bd. of\nMed. Examiners, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 6232 (Tex. App. Austin Aug. 3 2005), substituted opinion at, opinion withdrawn\nby 172 S.W.3d 761, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 6954 (Tex.

Doctor's failure to attend a patient in the emergency room was properly found to be a failure to practice medicine\nin an acceptable professional manner consistent with public health and welfare, in violation of Tex. Occ. Code Ann. §\n164.051(a)(6), and unprofessional or dishonorable conduct that was likely to injure the public, in violation of Tex. Occ.\nCode Ann. §§ 164.051(a)(1), 164.052(a)(5), where the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners' expert testified that,\nbased on her review of relevant medical records, the doctor's care and treatment of the patient did not meet the standard\nof care and was a professional failure to practice medicine consistent with the public health and welfare, and where,\nbecause patients were considered members of the public, the expert's testimony, which was unchallenged on appeal,\nalso supported the Board's conclusion that the doctor committed unprofessional conduct that was likely to injure the\npublic. Furthermore, because the hospital's disciplinary action against the doctor was directed to the same conduct, there\nwas substantial evidence to support discipline under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 164.051(a)(7). Granek v. Tex. State Bd. of\nMed. Examiners, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 6232 (Tex.

Revocation of a doctor's medical license was supported by substantial evidence where there was scientific evidence\nthat two of the doctor's urine samples tested positive for cocaine, and one expert witness definitively testified that the\ntests foreclosed the possibility of ingestion by inadvertent passive exposure. Hinkley v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs,\n140 S.W.3d 737, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 5078 (Tex. App. Austin 2004).\n\n298. Trial court remanded for reconsideration the penalty of cancelling a bar's mixed beverage and late hours permits\nbecause two of the grounds for revocation of the license were not supported by substantial evidence, the determination\ndid not require further evidence, and the appellate court found that the agency did not abuse its discretion in denying an\nevidentiary hearing pursuant to Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2). Allen-Burch, Inc. v. Tex. Alcoholic Bev. Comm'n,\n104 S.W.3d 345, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 3945 (Tex. App. Dallas 2003).\n\n299. Contrary to the trial court's findings, the officer's testimony, that the driver admitted to drinking, had slurred\nspeech, blood shot eyes, an odor of intoxication, and unsteadiness, was sufficient to support the ALJ findings, and the\nappellate court ordered the suspension of the driver's license to be reinstated.

Motor vehicle board's decision to grant a new franchisee's application for an auto-dealer license was based on sub-\nstantial evidence within the meaning of Tex.

Texas State Board of Medical Examiner's decision to revoke doctor's license to practice was an abuse of discretion\nunder the Administrative Procedure and Texas Register Act, former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13a (now Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174), because it was not based on unlawful procedure. Board of Med. Exmnrs. v. Nacol, 696\nS.W.2d 687, 1985 Tex. App. LEXIS 7359 (Tex. App. Beaumont 1985).\n\n302. Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission exceeded its authority under former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art.\n6252-13a, § 19(e) (now Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174) when it declined to renew a liquor license pursuant to Tex.\nAlco. Bev.

Though a suspension hearing for a dentist's license contained some irregularities, especially the in and out presence\nof the overseeing board's members who were involved in decision-making regarding the dentist's license, the appeals\ncourt upheld the board's determination to suspend the dentist's license for two years in the absence of a demonstration\nthat there was no substantial justice and fair play; former Tex. Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 6252-13A, § 19(e) (now Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174) required reversal if there was unlawful procedure resulting in prejudice to substantial\nrights. Blankfield v. Texas State Bd. of Dental Exmrs., 1985 Tex. App. LEXIS 6216 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. Feb. 14\n1985).\n\n\n\n304. Pursuant to Tex. Water Code Ann. §§ 11.021(a), 11.022, 11.121, and 11.046(c), the Texas Commission on Envi-\nronmental Quality incorrectly concluded that the city's effluent remained private groundwater that could be diverted\nwithout an appropriation permit; notwithstanding the city's stated intent not to abandon its effluent, the physical reality\nof the city's reuse project was that the effluent was abandoned to the public domain once the city discharged it into the\nSan Marcos River where it was admittedly commingled and diluted by that state watercourse.

Texas State Board of Medical Examiners' conclusion that disciplinary grounds existed for a doctor's improper con-\ntact with a female patient was supported by its findings, conclusions and evidence, in accordance with Tex.

Furthermore, because the hospital's disciplinary action against the doctor was directed to the same conduct, there\nwas substantial evidence to support discipline under Tex. Occ.

In reviewing the administrative decision of the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners, the court used the sub-\nstantial evidence scope of review defined under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E), of the Administrative Proce-\ndure Act, Texas Bd. of Med. Exmrs. v. Scheffey, 949 S.W.2d 431, 1997 Tex. App. LEXIS 3458 (Tex. App. Austin 1997).\n\n\n\n308. Substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(E) supported the Texas State Board of Dental Exam-\niners' exercise of its authority under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. §§ 254.001, 263.002(a) to revoke a dentist's license for un-\nprofessional billing practices in violation of Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 259.008(1). Although an administrative law judge\nrecommended suspension, the Board was empowered to reject the recommendation and adequately explained its rea-\nsoning that the dentist's disciplinary history should have been given more weight as an aggravating factor. Froemming\nv. Tex. State Bd. of Dental Examiners, 380 S.W.3d 787, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 4406 (Tex. App. Austin 2012).\n\n309. Revocation of an osteopathic doctor's license to practice medicine in Texas by the State Board of Medical Exam-\niners was supported by substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 because the complaint provided\nproper notice under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 164.005 and the evidence showed specific allegations of wrongdoing. Chal-\nifoux v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 9598 (Tex. App. Austin Nov. 1 2006).\n\n\n\n310. Professional disciplinary action against a doctor, based on stale allegations of improper touching of a female pa-\ntient's breasts, resulted in a due process violation that caused actual prejudice to the doctor's substantial rights, and the\naction was therefore arbitrary and capricious under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(A); staleness was not a signifi-\ncant concern as to another patient's complaints, however, because contemporaneous documentary evidence of the com-\nplaints existed. Granek v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 172 S.W.3d 761, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 6954 (Tex. App. Aus-\ntin 2005).\n\n311. The district court's judgment upholding the Board's second order was affirmed (1) suspending the doctor's medical\nlicense until he could show that he was safe and competent to practice medicine, (2) setting forth the minimum terms\nand conditions with which the doctor had to comply to make that showing, and (3) imposing an administrative penalty\non the doctor where the record revealed ample evidence that the doctor over-administered anesthesia to the patient,\nfailed to properly monitor her while she was sedated, and failed to properly respond when the patient went into respira-\ntory arrest. Berezoski v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 6255 (Tex.

In a case relating to the revocation of a doctor's license, a finding that a kyphoplasty constituted a \"spine surgery\"\nwas reasonably supported by substantial evidence where there was testimony from other physicians that the procedure\nconstituted a surgery. The doctor's performance of this procedure violated an agreed order whereby he was prohibited\nfrom being present at or performing \"spine surgery.\" Baker v. Tex. Med. Bd., 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 1259 (Tex. App.\nAustin Feb. 6 2013).\n\n313. Substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(E) supported the Texas State Board of Dental Exam-\niners' exercise of its authority under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. §§ 254.001, 263.002(a) to revoke a dentist's license for un-\nprofessional billing practices in violation of Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 259.008(1).

Legislature granted the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) the power to protect the public interest by\nregulating those physicians who were granted the privilege of practicing medicine, Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 151.003; the\nlegislature also provided that the Board's decision to revoke a physician's license was subject to the substantial-evidence\nstandard of review, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, and the lack of a trial de novo (either a bench or jury trial) for\nlicense-revocation appeals by physicians was rationally related to the legitimate governmental purpose of conservation\nof judicial resources. Scally v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 351 S.W.3d 434, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 6117 (Tex.\nApp. Austin 2011).\n\n315. Substantial evidence supported the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners' conclusion that the dentist practiced\ndentistry in a manner that constituted dishonorable conduct as defined in 22 Tex. Admin. Code Ann. § 108.9(6) where\nthe dentist offered to show a teenaged patient and her mother the scars on her breasts from surgery. Tex. State Bd. of\nDental Examiners v. Brown, 281 S.W.3d 692, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 2247 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi 2009).\n\n316. Texas State Board of Dental Examiners' conclusion that the dentist practiced dentistry in a manner that constituted\ndishonorable conduct as defined in 22 Tex. Admin. Code Ann. § 108.9(6) was supported by the administrative law\njudge's findings that the dentist allowed her non-dentist employees to adjust occlusion on a patient's teeth and failed to\nkeep adequate medical records where a patient's chart contained neither a written review of medical history, a medical\nexam, radiographs and findings, a treatment plan, or a written formal consent nor an explanation why that chart was\nincomplete. Tex. State Bd. of Dental Examiners v. Brown, 281 S.W.3d 692, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 2247 (Tex. App.\nCorpus Christi 2009).\n\n317. Substantial evidence supported the Texas State Board of Dental Examiners' order that the dentist pay restitution to\na patient as she improperly allowed her assistants to perform non-delegable dental work on the patient. The district court\nerred when it reversed the Board's restitution order because the Board did not make adjudicative findings contrary to the\nALJ's findings. Tex. State Bd. of Dental Examiners v. Brown, 281 S.W.3d 692, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 2247 (Tex. App.\nCorpus Christi 2009).\n\n318. Texas State Board of Medical Examiners had a final order to enforce because (1) a district court did not reverse\nand remand the entire case to the Board, under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(1), because the district court reversed\nonly that portion of the amended final order imposing an administrative penalty against a doctor and affirmed the\nBoard's order in all other respects; (2) by affirming the Board's order in all other respects, the district court confirmed\nthat, with the exception of the administrative penalty, the Board's amended final order, which imposed a three-year\nprobated license suspension, was valid and remained in full force and effect; (3) because the Board chose to accept the\ndistrict court's judgment and take no further action regarding the administrative penalty, there was nothing for the Board\nto change; and (4) the Board could not have issued another final order even if it had wanted to do so because Tex. Gov't\nCode Ann. § 2001.1775 expressly precluded an agency from modifying its findings or decision in a contested case after\nproceedings for judicial review have begun. Granek v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 2025\n(Tex. App. Austin Mar. 19 2008).\n\n319. Revocation of a respiratory care practitioner's certificate for taking a drug from an intravenous bag for personal use\nwas properly upheld as an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision was supported by substantial evidence pursuant to\n\f                                                                                                                 Page 45\n                                              Tex.

Code § 123.14(f)(4) factor were\nunnecessary, and a negative inference could be drawn from the practitioner's invoking the Fifth Amendment, which was\ndone improperly as a blanket assertion rather than in response to a particular question. Andrews v. Tex. Dep't of Health,\n2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 1129 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 15 2007).\n\n320. Revocation of an osteopathic doctor's license to practice medicine in Texas by the State Board of Medical Exam-\niners was supported by substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 because the complaint provided\nproper notice under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 164.005 and the evidence showed specific allegations of wrongdoing. Chal-\nifoux v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 9598 (Tex. App. Austin Nov. 1 2006).\n\n321. Doctor's due process rights were not violated when the State Board of Medical Examiners revoked his license be-\ncause the record failed to show that the presence of two doctors that served on the disciplinary panel unduly influenced\nthe Board's final decision and there was no record that ex parte communications took place; further, the Board's conclu-\nsions were not arbitrary or capricious under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 where there was no evidence that the\nBoard based its decision on peer review evidence pursuant to Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 151.003(2) or that the doctor was\nharmed by such evidence under Tex. R. App. P. 44.1. Chalifoux v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Examiners, 2006 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 9598 (Tex. App. Austin Nov. 1 2006).\n\n322. \"Substantial evidence\" under Tex. Gov't Code Ann § 2001.174(2)(E) supported a finding that a doctor violated the\nstandard of care by discharging a patient from the hospital when she had suffered a postsurgery seizure and had other\npreseizure symptoms, and her Dilantin level was 3.9 at the time of her discharge; the doctor admitted the Dilantin level\nwas sub-therapeutic, and another doctor testified that the treatment fell below the standard of care. Chalifoux v. Tex.\nState Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 4738 (Tex. App. Austin June 2 2006).\n\n323. \"Substantial evidence\" under Tex. Gov't Code Ann § 2001.174(2)(E) supported a finding that a doctor violated the\nstandard of care in assessing the possibility of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak because he had the patient lie down,\nwhich minimized the possibility of the patient experiencing the classic symptoms of a CSF leak; his claim that his dis-\ncharge decision was not based solely on his observation of the patient after she was lying down for two hours was insuf-\nficient to overcome the presumption that the finding was supported by substantial evidence. Chalifoux v. Tex. State Bd.\nof Med. Exam'rs, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 4738 (Tex. App. Austin June 2 2006).\n\n324. Decision of the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners to revoke a doctor's license was not arbitrary or capri-\ncious under Tex. Gov't Code Ann § 2001.174(2)(F); there was no evidence that the Board considered peer-review evi-\ndence in reaching its final decision, and its conclusions were explicitly based on its findings and the evidence presented\nat the hearing. Chalifoux v. Tex. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 4738 (Tex. App. Austin June 2 2006).\n\n\n\n325. Where substantial evidence supported the findings that an insurance licensee wrongfully paid premiums from an-\nother business account, paid bonuses or compensation for referring new business, offered to rebate premiums, and paid\nunlicensed persons for the services of an agent, revocation of an insurance license was proper. Murphy v. Comm'r of\nIns., 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 10156 (Tex. App. Austin Dec. 4 2003).\n\n326. In reviewing the Texas Commissioner of Insurance's decision denying the applicant a local recording agent's li-\ncense under the substantial evidence rule, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the Commissioner's consideration of two\n25-year-old felony convictions that involved the defrauding of elderly victims through the sale of an unauthorized in-\nsurance product was not erroneous under Tex. Occ. Code Ann. §§ 53.021,.022 and substantial evidence existed demon-\nstrating that the applicant failed to make restitution and failed to provide letters of recommendation from prosecutors,\nlaw enforcement, and correctional officers, as required by Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 53.023(a)(6)(A) and (b); thus, there\nwas ample evidence in the record to support the Commissioner's decision denying the applicant a local recording agent's\nlicense. Smith v. Montemayor, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 5099 (Tex.

In a case in which the Commissioner of the Texas Department of Insurance upheld a decision of the Texas Medical\nLiability Insurance Underwriting Association (JUA) that informed an orthopedic surgeon that he had to pay a surcharge\nin order to renew his professional liability insurance policy, the Commissioner's order was supported by substantial ev-\nidence because, by basing the calculation of a surcharge on a policyholder's claim history, the JUA's schedule produced\nrates that reflected an increase in the risk of insuring a particular policyholder, which was consistent with the statutory\nrequirements that individualized rates be based on plans measuring variations in hazards or expenses. Scheffey v. Gees-\nlin, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 1137 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 15 2008), review denied by Scheffey v. Geeslin, 2008 Tex. LEX-\nIS 684 (Tex. 2008).\n\n\n\n329. In an appeal concerning a rate supervision order issued by the Texas Commissioner of Insurance, which revoked\nan insurer's ability to file and use its insurance rates without prior approval from the Texas Department of Insurance,\nthere was nothing in the order to suggest that it was not a final, completed agency action, where the only means of chal-\nlenging the Commissioner's supervision order was to seek judicial review of the order, and, accordingly, the appellate\ncourt and the district court had jurisdiction to address the insurer's claims under Tex. Ins. Code Ann. ch. 36. Further-\nmore, several of the insurer's claims--that the actions for which the Commissioner placed it under supervision were not\n\"rating practices,\" that the supervision order was arbitrary and capricious, that the Commissioner acted outside his au-\nthority in issuing the supervision order, and that its due process rights were violated--did not require review of an ad-\nministrative record, and all were authorized grounds for reversal or remand of a decision under the Administrative Pro-\ncedure Act, Tex.

Where a decedent dry-fired a gun several times, someone then replaced the clip in the gun without the decedent's\nknowledge, and the decedent fired the gun again, killing himself, the decision of the Board of Trustees of the Employ-\nees Retirement System of Texas that decedent's death was not accidental and denying the beneficiary recovery under the\ninsurance policy was not supported by substantial evidence as required under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174. Butler\nv. Group Life & Health Ins. Co., 962 S.W.2d 296, 1998 Tex. App. LEXIS 858 (Tex. App. Austin 1998).\n\n\n\n332. Substantial evidence existed to support administrative law judge's findings that widow was excluded from receiv-\ning benefits under insurance policy when evidence showed her dead husband was driving truck that overturned, killing\nhimself and a passenger, and, if husband had survived, he would have been charged with manslaughter.

Substantial evidence was before the Board of Trustees of the Employees Retirement System of Texas to support its\nfinding that air travel or flight caused decedent's runway accident and that this was a risk contemplated by the aviation\nexclusion in the accidental death benefits provision of the public employees life insurance plan; the standard of judicial\nreview of the board's order was that provided for cases of \"substantial evidence\" review under the terms of the Admin-\nistrative Procedures Act, specifically Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.174, and because its order was supported by substantial\nevidence and was not arbitrary or capricious, the district court erred in not affirming the decision of the board to deny\naccidental death benefits to decedent's spouse. Board of Trustees v. Benge, 942 S.W.2d 742, 1997 Tex. App. LEXIS 1519\n(Tex. App. Austin 1997).\n\n\n\n334. In a former employee's action for disability benefits, substantial evidence, as required by Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §§\n815.511(f), 2001.174 supported a determination that the employee was not entitled to a waiver of a preexist-\ning-condition exclusion because the evidence showed that the employee was not \"actively at work\" during the relevant\ntime period. Medical records indicated that the employee had surgery at the beginning of the relevant time period and\nby the end was interpreting only one or two hours a week; there was no evidence showing whether the employee took\npaid vacation time or sick leave in the months after the surgery. Schneider v. Employees Ret. Sys. of Tex., 2009 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 2276 (Tex. App. Austin Apr. 3 2009).\n\n335. In a case involving an exception to a preexisting-condition exclusion, substantial evidence, as required by Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. §§ 815.511(f), 2001.174 supported interpreting the exclusion to require that an employee be actively at\nwork for six consecutive months after disability coverage began, rather than for six consecutive months at any time be-\nfore becoming disabled. Schneider v. Employees Ret. Sys. of Tex., 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 2276 (Tex. App. Austin Apr. 3\n2009).\n\n\n\n336. Application for occupational disability retirement benefits was properly denied where a reasonable basis existed\nfor the conclusion of the Employees Retirement System of Texas Board of Trustees (Board) that the applicant's at-work\ninjury was not the primary cause of his disability; the Board's order and the relevant findings and conclusions that the\napplicant was not entitled to benefits because his preexisting condition was the primary cause of his disability were\nsupported by substantial evidence because: (1) the applicant had reported problems with his lower back prior to the\nat-work injury; (2) the applicant had repeated problems with his cervical spine prior to the injury; (3) the applicant had\nmore degeneration in his spine than would be expected for someone his age; and (4) both the applicant's neurosurgeon\nand the medical board agreed that the injury that the applicant sustained at work would not have been disabling without\nhis preexisting condition.

Application for occupational disability retirement benefits was properly denied where a reasonable basis existed\nfor the conclusion of the Employees Retirement System of Texas Board of Trustees (Board) that the applicant's at-work\ninjury was not the primary cause of his disability; the Board's order and the relevant findings and conclusions that the\napplicant was not entitled to benefits because his preexisting condition was the primary cause of his disability were\nsupported by substantial evidence because: (1) the applicant had reported problems with his lower back prior to the\nat-work injury; (2) the applicant had repeated problems with his cervical spine prior to the injury; (3) the applicant had\nmore degeneration in his spine than would be expected for someone his age; and (4) both the applicant's neurosurgeon\nand the medical board agreed that the injury that the applicant sustained at work would not have been disabling without\nhis preexisting condition.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(F), the Board of Trustees for the Employees Retirement System of\nTexas (ERS) acted arbitrarily and capriciously and abused its discretion in terminating a disability retiree's occupational\n\f                                                                                                                      Page 48\n                                                Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\ndisability retirement benefits, resulting in the retiree's substantial rights being prejudiced, because due process and fun-\ndamental principals of fairness dictated that the Board should have provided meaningful notice to the retiree before ap-\nplying its new 80 percent threshold standard in 34 Tex. Admin. Code § 73.17, which construed Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\n814.208(d), to his post disability earnings to terminate his benefits; being advised of the Board's construction of \"com-\nparable pay\" to include its 80 percent threshold standard at the hearing was not sufficient notice to satisfy due process\nconcerns, and a 2005 letter advising the retiree that his benefits had been terminated similarly was not sufficient, and,\nthus, prior to his hearing, the retiree did not have meaningful notice that earning 80 percent of his adjusted final annual\nstate salary could cause his benefits to be terminated. Patton v. Employees Ret. Sys. of Tex., 2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 9901\n(Tex. App. Austin Dec. 19 2007).\n\n\n\n339. Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 1051.703(a) of the Architecture Practice Act did not categorically preclude licensed engi-\nneers from preparing comprehensive building plans and specifications for the class of public works projects identified in\nthat section, nor did Tex. Occ. Code Ann. § 1051.601 categorically exempt licensed engineers from the Act's require-\nments. Instead, the enforcement matter at issue depended on whether preparation of the engineers' particular building\nplans and specifications was within the scope and practice of engineering as defined by the Engineering Practice Act;\nbecause the record was insufficiently developed to determine that issue as a matter of law, summary disposition was not\nappropriate, and therefore the district court did not abuse its discretion in reversing the Board's decision and remanding\nthe case for further proceedings.

Because it was unclear whether Texas law would allow plaintiff landowners' inverse condemnation suit for a regu-\nlatory groundwater taking, and they had not pursued compensation in state court, their Fifth Amendment takings claim\nagainst defendant water district's directors was not ripe and was dismissed without prejudice. Coates v. Hall, 512 F.\nSupp. 2d 770, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 17168 (W.D. Tex. 2007).\n\n\n\n341. Although appellee acknowledged that appellant owned 100 percent of the leasehold oil and gas estate, and that he\nhad the right \"to inject saltwater under the tract produced from the tract\" to benefit that lease tract, resolution of appel-\nlant's complaint turned on construction of the deeds in appellee's chain of title--specifically, the parameters of the \"sur-\nface estate\" conveyed through those instruments. Thus, it was the sort of issue that was beyond the Texas Railroad\nCommission's jurisdiction under 16 Tex. Admin. Code § 3.9. Rosenthal v. R.R. Comm'n, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 6522\n(Tex. App. Austin Aug. 20 2009).\n\n\n\n342. Where a subcontractor filed a claim alleging that unforeseen conditions caused it to incur additional costs to com-\nplete foundation drilling work on a highway construction contract, substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\n2001.174(2)(E) supported the Texas Department of Transportation's decision that (1) the site conditions were not sig-\nnificantly different; (2) the contract provided that casing was required to prevent caving and water intrusion; and there-\nfore, (3) the subcontractor was not entitled to damages. Granite Constr. Co. v. Tex. DOT, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 9706\n(Tex. App. Austin Nov. 20 2012).\n\n343. In a highway construction contract dispute, although Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 201.112 gave the executive director\nof the Texas Department of Transportation broad discretion to make changes to the proposed findings of fact and con-\nclusions of law of the administrative law judge (ALJ), the executive director could not ignore the evidence; where the\nALJ, and not the executive director, heard the testimony and observed the demeanor of the witnesses, and in the absence\nof independent evidence in the record to support the executive director's credibility choice, the executive director's deci-\nsion to reject the ALJ's findings based on credibility was arbitrary and capricious under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\n2001.174. State v. Mid-South Pavers, Inc., 246 S.W.3d 711, 2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 9905 (Tex.

Code Ann. §§ 284.201, 284.202(a) and an admin-\nistrative adjudication hearing procedure under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 284.204, the alleged violator was not entitled\nto a trial de novo, even though the appeal hinged on a question of law. The procedure was created by a commissioner\ncourt order and was consistent with the substantial evidence standard in Tex. Gov't Code Ann § 2001.174; it did not\nprevent the trial court from considering questions of law. Enter. Leasing Co. v. Harris County Toll Rd. Auth., 356\nS.W.3d 85, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 1962 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2011).\n\n\n\n345. Where an officer initiated a traffic stop and smelled alcohol, appellee admitted that she had just left a bar where she\nhad consumed alcohol; in the license suspension proceeding, the judge's finding that the police had probable cause to\narrest appellee for DWI was supported by substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174; the admission\nof unqualified testimony from a police officer concerning the horizontal gaze nystagmus test was harmless. Tex. Dep't\nof Pub. Safety v. Bishop, 2007 Tex. App. LEXIS 360 (Tex. App. Austin Jan. 22 2007).\n\n346. Trial court erred in reversing the suspension of a driver's license by an administrative law judge (ALJ) because\nsubstantial evidence supported the ALJ's finding under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042 that the driver voluntarily\nrefused to submit to a breath test; although the driver claimed he was misled about the consequences of refusal, the ALJ,\nas the sole trier of fact under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, was free to disbelieve the driver. Tex. Dep't of Pub.\nSafety v. Patel, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 9720 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Nov. 9 2006).\n\n347. Trial court did not err in affirming the suspension of the driver's license where although the ALJ found that the\ndriver had operated a watercraft while intoxicated, this was an obvious clerical error which did not negate the adminis-\ntrative order, and the decision was supported by substantial evidence, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174. Goldstein v.\nTex. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 11285 (Tex. App. San Antonio Oct. 11 2006).\n\n348. In a review under Tex. Gov't Code Ann § 2001.174(2)(E), the trial court erred in reversing a license suspension;\nreasonable suspicion was unnecessary for an initial contact between officers and the driver because the driver stopped\nhis vehicle on the side of a public roadway entirely on his own volition and the officers made contact with him to see if\nhe was in need of assistance; substantial evidence supported a finding of probable cause to arrest the driver because his\nbreath smelled strongly of alcohol, he had bloodshot eyes, his speech was slurred, he admitted that he consumed six\nbeers, and he failed every field sobriety test. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Svoboda, 2006 Tex. App. LEXIS 5266 (Tex.\nApp. San Antonio June 21 2006).\n\n349. Substantial evidence, as required by Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 524.043 and Tex. Gov't Code Ann § 2001.174, sup-\nported a license suspension, even though the underlying accident occurred in an apartment parking lot, because the lot\nwas ungated and open to the public and thus was a \"public place.\" Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Briggs, 2006 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 1129 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 9 2006).\n\n350. License suspension was reinstated because the Texas Department of Public Safety produced more than a scintilla\nof evidence on the factors set forth in Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042, when the driver was properly stopped for vio-\nlation of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 545.104(a), and the officer smelled alcohol on the driver's breath, noticed that the\ndriver's eyes were bloodshot and his speech was slurred. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Shellberg, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS\n6644 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Aug. 18 2005).\n\n351. Statute governing license suspension appeals is the touchstone in deciding which standard of review should apply:\nthe statute specifically requires the reviewing court to use the substantial evidence rule. Because a court applying the\nsubstantial evidence standard of review may not substitute its judgment for that of the administrative law judge as to the\nweight of the evidence, the equally plausible but opposite inferences construct can not be part of the substantial evi-\ndence rule. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Hirschman, 169 S.W.3d 331, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 4579 (Tex. App. Waco 2005).\n\n352. At the license suspension hearing, the arresting officer testified that the driver's vehicle was moving erratically, the\nofficer smelled alcohol coming from the interior of the vehicle, and the driver failed sobriety tests; there was substantial\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 50\n                                               Tex. Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\nevidence to support the administrative finding that there was reasonable suspicion to stop and probable cause to arrest\nthe driver for driving while intoxicated. The trial court erred by reversing the administrative decision to suspend her\ndriver's license, because she refused to provide a breath sample. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Leath, 2005 Tex. App.\nLEXIS 3927 (Tex. App. Amarillo May 18 2005).\n\n353. Administrative law judge's (ALJ) suspension of a driver's license was supported by substantial evidence where the\narresting officer surmised in his sworn report that the driver had been driving while intoxicated because he emitted a\nstrong odor of alcohol, had glassy eyes and slurred speech, and his movements were slowed and staggered, and where\nthe record revealed that the driver admitted to drinking a few beers before the accident. That gave the officer reasonable\nsuspicion to investigate the driver further, and the officer's reasonable suspicion evolved into probable cause when he\nobserved five out of the six points of the horizontal gaze nystagmus test and the driver refused to provide a breath\nspecimen. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Burrer, 2005 Tex. App. LEXIS 3534 (Tex. App. San Antonio May 11 2005).\n\n354. Texas Department of Public Safety properly suspended an individual's driver's license for his refusal to give a\nbreath specimen after he was arrested for suspicion of DWI. On review, the county court ruled that substantial evidence\nexisted to affirm the administrative decision suspending his driver's license, and that the individual failed to prove that\nthe administrative decision prejudiced his substantial rights. Parks v. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS\n9365 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. Oct. 21 2004).\n\n355. Department of Public Safely was not obligated to prove compliance with a 15-minute observation period before\nadmitting a breath test at a license-revocation hearing because no fact issue was raised with respect to the particular\nrequirement; thus, the breath test was properly admitted, and the trial court erred in reversing the license suspension.\nTex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Barrera, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 5346 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi June 17 2004).\n\n356. Under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the appellate court had to reverse when a substantial right had been prej-\nudiced because the administrative decision was affected by an error of law; the administrative law judge erred in apply-\ning the law to the facts as she found them where no necessity justification existed at the time of the driver's arrest be-\ncause his drive back to the scene was not in avoidance of any imminent harm. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Moore, 175\nS.W.3d 270, 2004 Tex. App. LEXIS 4401 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. 2004).\n\n357. Substantial evidence supported the decision of an administrative law judge to suspend the driver's license of an\nindividual arrested for operating a motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Her-\nnandez, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 6333 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi July 24 2003).\n\n358. Since the Texas Legislature had expressed no intent that the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) be penal-\nized for the failure of an officer to submit a report within the five-day deadline of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §\n724.032(c)(4), the failure of an officer to comply with the statute did not render the report inadmissible at an adminis-\ntrative hearing, and the judgment that the evidence was insufficient to authorize suspension of the driver's license was\nreversed and remanded because the erroneous exclusion of exhibits prejudiced the DPS's substantial rights since the\nadministrative law judge denied the DPS the opportunity to satisfy its evidentiary burden at the license suspension\nhearing. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Kimbrough, 106 S.W.3d 747, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 3566 (Tex. App. Fort Worth\n2003).\n\n359. Under the substantial evidence rule of Tex. Govt. Code Ann. § 2001.174, the court erred in reversing a license sus-\npension decision by the Texas Department of Public Safety; the administrative law judge did not err in finding, pursuant\nto Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 524.035(a)(2), that the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for driving while in-\ntoxicated. State Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Boeck, 2001 Tex. App. LEXIS 2785 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Apr. 26 2001).\n\n360. In reviewing administrative license suspension decisions under the substantial evidence standard in Tex. Transp.\nCode Ann. § 524.041 and Tex. Gov't. Code Ann. § 2001.174, the reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that\nof the agency. The issue for the court is not whether the agency's decision was correct, but only whether the record\ndemonstrates some reasonable basis for the agency's action as shown by a \"scintilla\" of evidence. Mireles v. Texas Dep't\nof Pub. Safety, 9 S.W.3d 128, 1999 Tex. LEXIS 125, 43 Tex. Sup. Ct.

Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\n\n\n361. Administrative law judge's finding that the deputy had reasonable suspicion to stop the driver was not reasonably\nsupported by substantial evidence and therefore it erred by suspending the driver's license under Tex. Transp. Code Ann.\n§§ 524.022, .041, because the evidence only showed that the driver was observed driving slowly on a highway at 1:40\na.m; the record was silent regarding the deputy's training and experience and was silent as to the characteristics of the\narea in which the driver was observed driving. In addition, there was no evidence that the deputy stopped the driver be-\ncause he was concerned for her safety, as there was no evidence she was alone in her vehicle, that there were any other\nvehicles sharing the roadway with the driver, or that driving slowly was inherently unsafe; the deputy stated in his re-\nport that he had reasonable suspicion to contact that driver only because he observed her vehicle traveling 40 m.p.h. in a\n65 m.p.h. posted zone. Peters v. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 404 S.W.3d 1, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 2798 (Tex. App. Hou-\nston 1st Dist. 2013).\n\n362. Trial court erred by reversing the administrative decision allowing the suspension of the driver's license because\nsubstantial evidence supported that decision, as the officer testified multiple times that he saw the driver on the road and\nthen enter the parking lot and that he saw the driver in the vehicle's driver's seat when it was parked under a light in the\nparking lot; when the driver approached the officer, he saw that the driver was intoxicated and therefore had reasonable\nsuspicion or probable cause to detain the driver and administer field sobriety tests. The officer's report, which bore the\nseal and signature of the Texas Department of Public Safety's custodian of records, corroborated the officer's testimony\nthat the driver did not provide a breath sample on request and that he refused to provide a post-arrest breath sample. Tex.\nDep't of Pub. Safety v. Perez, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 659 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Jan. 24 2013).\n\n363. Administrative law judge (ALJ) did not err in quashing the driver's subpoena of the arresting officer in the admin-\nistrative license suspension proceeding, because the ALJ's application of the 150-mile limit in Tex. R. Civ. P. 176.3 was\nnot an abuse of discretion; the ALJ was expressly authorized to consider the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Hodge v.\nTex. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 10526 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. Dec. 20 2012).\n\n364. There was substantial evidence to support an administrative law judge's decision authorizing the suspension of a\ndriver's license under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 524.012(b)(1) because there was a reasonable suspicion to stop a vehi-\ncle based on a failure to stop at a red light, there was probable cause to arrest due to an odor of alcohol and signs of in-\ntoxication, and the driver's blood alcohol was above the legal limit. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Caruana, 2012 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 7125 (Tex. App. Austin Aug. 23 2012).\n\n365. Trial court exceeded its authority when it modified an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision that a driver's li-\ncense was suspended for 2 years under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.035(a) and stated that the suspension was for 180\ndays. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Hudson, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1148 (Tex. App. Dallas Feb. 13 2012).\n\n366. Driver's license suspension was proper because the facts established probable cause that the licensee was operating\na motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated for purposes of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042; witnesses at an\naccident scene reported that a pickup had rear-ended another vehicle and driven away, a license plate at the scene was\nmatched to the licensee's pickup, which was later found abandoned with front end damage, and according to the licen-\nsee's wife, the licensee called her to pick him up near the site of the abandoned pickup. After the wife drive the licensee\nto the sheriff's office, a trooper and others observed the licensee and detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage on his\nbreath. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Allen, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 4268 (Tex. App. Amarillo June 3 2011).\n\n367. Substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 supported the administrative suspension of appellee's\ndriver's license under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §§ 724.035, 724.042, because he was stopped for speeding, had trouble\nmaintaining balance, refused to provide a breath or blood specimen, and admitted to ingesting hydrocodone, a con-\ntrolled substance. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Greathouse, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 2119 (Tex. App. Waco Mar. 23 2011).\n\n368. Where a deputy observed a pickup truck make a right turn so wide that it caused the front driver's side tire to go\nonto the grassy area of the road, the deputy had reasonable suspicion to stop appellee's vehicle because he committed a\ntraffic violation under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §§ 545.051(a), 545.101(a); based on the strong odor of an alcoholic bev-\nerage emitting from appellee, his admission that he was drinking beer, and his poor performance on field sobriety tests,\nthe deputy had probable cause to arrest appellee for driving while intoxicated. Because the requirements of Tex. Transp.\nCode Ann. § 524.035(a)(1), (2) were met, the Texas Department of Public Safety's decision to suspend appellee's driv-\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 52\n                                               Tex.

App. Corpus Christi Dec. 2 2010).\n\n369. Suspension of a driver's license for refusal to submit to a breath test under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.035 was\nsupported by substantial evidence because even if the officer's sworn report was inadmissible under Tex. R. Evid. 803(8)\nbased on a lack of a signature, the admissible evidence demonstrated the four elements required to uphold the suspen-\nsion; that evidence included the DIC-24 form, under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.032, which indicated refusal to sub-\nmit to the breath test and was signed by the driver. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Guajardo, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 6000\n(Tex. App. Corpus Christi July 29 2010).\n\n370. Substantial evidence supported the suspension of the minor's driver's license, because the minor was properly ad-\nvised of the consequences set forth under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.015 and he voluntarily refused to submit a\nspecimen at the officer's request, and since the officer was not required to give the minor the notice of suspension before\nrequesting a specimen, any irregularity on the notice of suspension did not affect the voluntariness of the minor's refusal\nto submit a specimen for purposes of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Henson, 2010 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 3478 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. May 11 2010).\n\n371. There was sufficient evidence for the administrative judge to uphold the suspension of the driver's license, because\nthe driver was speeding and veering back and forth, an odor of alcohol emanated from inside the car, the driver's eyes\nwere bloodshot and glassy, the driver's speech was slurred, the driver was unable to complete the one-leg-stand test and\nhe exhibited six clues of intoxication on the walk-and-turn test, and the driver displayed clues of intoxication on the\nhorizontal gaze nystagmus test and the vertical nystagmus test. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Williams, 303 S.W.3d 356,\n2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 9708 (Tex. App. El Paso 2009).\n\n372. Driver's license revocation under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.035 was not supported by substantial evidence, as\nrequired by Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §§ 524.002(b), 724.047 and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, that the licensee\nactually operated his vehicle while intoxicated. He was asleep when an officer approached him, and although the engine\nwas running, he was parked in his usual space behind the building where he worked, did not have a foot on the brake,\nand had not turned on the headlights; also, the car was in park and the front seat was reclined. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety\nv. Allocca, 301 S.W.3d 364, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 8781 (Tex. App. Austin 2009).\n\n373. Decision of an ALJ administratively suspending a driver's license was supported by substantial evidence, Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E), including that it took the driver more than 20 seconds to get his door open and exit\nthe car, he was swaying, had red, bloodshot eyes, had a strong odor of alcohol coming from his mouth, and admitted\ncoming from a bar where he had had eight or nine drinks. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Dishman, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS\n3052 (Tex. App. San Antonio May 6 2009).\n\n374. Under the substantial evidence standard of review, it was determined that driving privileges were properly sus-\npended because there was probable cause to believe that a driver was operating a motor vehicle in a public place under\nTex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042(2)(A); the public had unrestricted access to a private road, and it did not matter that\ntravelers were infrequent or that the road had not been converted to a county road. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Castro,\n2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 3198 (Tex. App. San Antonio Apr. 29 2009).\n\n375. While bloodshot eyes, an odor of alcohol, and unsteady balance were all symptoms of intoxication, those facts did\nnot, without more, give rise to probable cause to believe the driver was driving while intoxicated. As the rest of the evi-\ndence did not support the conclusion that the driver was driving while intoxicated, the administrative law judge's deci-\nsion to suspend the driver's operator's license was not reasonably supported by substantial evidence. Tex. Dep't of Pub.\nSafety v. Gilfeather, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 1502 (Tex. App. Fort Worth Mar. 5 2009).\n\n376. Suspension of an operator's license was improper because an officer did not have reasonable suspicion for a stop\nunder Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042 since slow driving alone was not enough to show that the operator was imped-\ning traffic, there was no violation of San Antonio, Tex., Code of Ordinances § 19-133 since the conditions were foggy\nand rainy, and an investigatory stop was not proper based on the operator's weaving since the officer did not testify that\nhe suspected that defendant was intoxicated or that the operator's driving was unsafe. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Gon-\nzales, 276 S.W.3d 88, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 7985 (Tex.

Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\n\n\n377. Administrative suspension of an operator's license was not subject to reversal based on a clerical error made by an\nadministrative law judge (ALJ) because it did not affect an operator's substantial rights; the ALJ relied on an improper\ndate of arrest. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Gonzales, 276 S.W.3d 88, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 7985 (Tex. App. San Antonio\n2008).\n\n378. Although a clerical error relating to the date that an operator was stopped did not prejudice his substantial rights, a\nsuspension of the operator's license was not warranted because there was no reasonable suspicion for an officer's deci-\nsion to stop him for driving 20 miles under the posted speed limit. There was no evidence that the operator was imped-\ning traffic under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 545.363(a) since slow driving in and of itself was not enough to show a vio-\nlation, the fact that the operator drifted in his own lane of travel did not justify the investigatory stop where the officer\ndid not state that he suspected that the operator was intoxicated or that the driving was unsafe, and driving 10 miles an\nhour or more below the posted speed limit did not constitute a per se violation of San Antonio, Tex., Code of Ordinanc-\nes § 19-133 because the ordinance was concerned with the maximum reasonable, safe, and prudent speed limit; there\nwas no testimony regarding what a reasonable speed would have been under the weather conditions present at the time\nof the stop. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Gonzales, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 6327 (Tex. App. San Antonio Aug. 20 2008).\n\n379. Trial court erred in reversing an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision to suspend a motorist's driver's license\npursuant to Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.035, after the motorist refused to give a breath specimen test, because there\nwas substantial evidence supporting the administrative order as required by Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 524.041 and Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174; a court may not substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v.\nEscobedo, 2008 Tex. App. LEXIS 5651 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi July 29 2008).\n\n380. Judgment suspending driver's license for 180 days was affirmed where the totality of circumstances was substantial\nevidence of probable cause for the driver's arrest for driving while intoxicated. The record showed that the driver drove\npast a roadblock, that he had a strong alcoholic odor, that he had bloodshot eyes, that he admitted drinking an alcoholic\nbeverage, that he was extremely argumentative, and that he refused to take field sobriety tests.

ACTION ON APPLICATIONS AND OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS\n                        SUBCHAPTER G. ACTION BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\n                                                30 TAC § 50.139 (2014)\n\n§ 50.139. Motion to Overturn Executive Director's Decision\n\n   (a) The applicant, public interest counsel or other person may file with the chief clerk a motion to overturn the exec-\nutive director's action on an application or water quality management plan (WQMP) update certification. Notwithstand-\ning any other law, a state agency, except a river authority, may not file a motion to overturn the executive director's ac-\ntion on an application that was received by the commission on or after September 1, 2011 unless the state agency is the\napplicant. Wherever other commission rules refer to a \"motion for reconsideration,\" that term should be considered in-\nterchangeable with the term \"motion to overturn executive director's decision.\"\n     (b) A motion to overturn must be filed no later than 23 days after the date the agency mails notice of the signed\npermit, approval, or other action of the executive director to the applicant and persons on any required mailing list for\nthe action.\n    (c) A motion to overturn must be filed no later than 20 days after the date persons who timely commented on the\nWQMP update are notified of the response to comments and the certified WQMP update. A person is presumed to have\nbeen notified on the third day after the date the notice of the executive director's action is mailed by first class mail.\n     (d) An action by the executive director under this subchapter is not affected by a motion to overturn filed under this\nsection unless expressly ordered by the commission.\n     (e) With the agreement of the parties or on their own motion, the commission of the general counsel may, by writ-\nten order, extend the period of time for filing motions to overturn and for taking action on the motions so long as the\nperiod for taking action is not extended beyond 90 days after the date the agency mails notice of the signed permit, ap-\nproval, or other action of the executive director.\n    (f) Disposition of motion.\n     (1) Unless an extension of time is granted, if a motion to overturn is not acted on by the commission within 45 days\nafter the date the agency mails notice of the signed permit, approval, or other action of the executive director, the mo-\ntion is denied.\n    (2) In the event of an extension, the motion to overturn is overruled by operation of law on the date fixed by the\norder, or in the absence of a fixed date, 90 days after the date the agency mails notice of the signed permit, approval, or\nother action of the executive director.\n     (g) When a motion to overturn is denied under subsection (f) of this section, a motion for rehearing does not need to\nbe filed as a prerequisite for appeal. Section 80.272 of this title (relating to Motion for Rehearing) and Texas Govern-\nment Code, § 2001.146, regarding motions for rehearing in contested cases do not apply when a motion to overturn is\ndenied. If applicable, the commission decision may be subject to judicial review under Texas Water Code, § 5.351, or\nTexas Health and Safety Code, §§ 361.321, 382.032, or 401.341.\n\f                                                                                                                  Page 2\n                                                   30 TAC § 50.139\n\n\n\n\nSOURCE: The provisions of this § 50.139 adopted to be effective September 23, 1999, 24 TexReg 8254; amended to be\neffective February 3, 2000, 25 TexReg 593; amended to be effective April 1, 2001, 26 TexReg 2393; amended to be\neffective May 3, 2012, 37 TexReg 3120\n\nNOTES:\n\nCROSS-REFERENCES: This Section cited in 30 TAC § 50.131, (relating to Purpose and Applicability); 30 TAC §\n50.133, (relating to Executive Director Action on Application or WQMP Update); 30 TAC § 55.201, (relating to Re-\nquests for Reconsideration or Contested Case Hearing); 30 TAC § 116.114, (relating to Application Review Schedule);\n30 TAC § 117.121, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.221, (relating to Alternative\nCase Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 205.4, (relating to Authorizations and Notices of Intent); 30 TAC § 115.783,\n(relating to Equipment Standards); 30 TAC § 91.20, (relating to Applicability); 30 TAC § 330.69, (relating to Public\nNotice for Registrations); 30 TAC § 330.71, (relating to Duration and Limits of Registrations and Permits); 30 TAC §\n117.125, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.225, (relating to Alternative Case Specific\nSpecifications); 30 TAC § 117.325, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.425, (relating\nto Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.1025, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications);\n30 TAC § 117.1125, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.1225, (relating to Alternative\nCase Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.1325, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC §\n117.2025, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.2125, (relating to Alternative Case Spe-\ncific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.3025, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.3125,\n(relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.3325, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Speci-\nfications); 30 TAC § 117.4025, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.4125, (relating to\nAlternative Case Specific Specifications).\n     This Chapter cited in 30 TAC § 39.9, (relating to Deadline for Public Comment and Hearing Requests); 30 TAC §\n39.11, (relating to Text of Public Notice); 30 TAC § 39.409, (relating to Deadline for Public Comment, and for Requests\nfor Reconsideration, Contested Case Hearing, or Notice and Comment Hearing); 30 TAC § 39.411, (relating to Text of\nPublic Notice); 30 TAC § 291.107, (relating to Action on Applications); 30 TAC § 293.6, (relating to Applications Pro-\ncessing Requirements); 30 TAC § 297.72, (relating to Notice and Hearing); 30 TAC § 305.69, (relating to Solid Waste\nPermit Modification at the Request of the Permittee); 30 TAC § 335.23, (relating to Procedures for Case-by-Case Regu-\nlation of Hazardous Waste Recycling Activities); 30 TAC § 335.24, (relating to Requirements for Recyclable Materials\nand Nonhazardous Recyclable Materials); 30 TAC § 335.78, (relating to Special Requirements for Hazardous Waste\nGenerated by Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators); 30 TAC § 335.213, (relating to Standards Applicable\nto Storers of Materials That Are To Be Used in a Manner That Constitutes Disposal Who Are Not the Ultimate Users);\n30 TAC § 335.214, (relating to Standards Applicable to Users of Materials That Are Used in a Manner That Constitutes\nDisposal); 30 TAC § 335.241, (relating to Applicability and Requirements); 30 TAC § 335.251, (relating to Applicabil-\nity and Requirements); 30 TAC § 303.90, (relating to Action on Application Without Public Hearing).\n    This Subchapter cited in 30 TAC § 55.253, (relating to Public Comment Processing); 30 TAC § 50.31, (relating to\nPurpose and Applicability).\n\fTAB 16\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 1\n\n\n\n\n1 of 1 DOCUMENT\n\n                                           TEXAS ADMINISTRATIVE CODE\n\n                        *** This document reflects all regulations in effect as of July 31, 2014 ***\n\n                                    TITLE 30.

A person shall submit a claim for a registration by rule in duplicate with one copy sent directly to the ap-\npropriate Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regional office.\n    (b) A registration is required for an MSW transfer station facility that is used in the transfer of MSW to a solid\nwaste processing or disposal facility from any of the following:\n    (1) a municipality with a population of less than 50,000;\n    (2) a county with a population of less than 85,000;\n    (3) a facility used in the transfer of MSW that transfers or will transfer 125 tons per day or less; or\n    (4) a transfer station located within the permitted boundaries of an MSW Type I or Type IV facility as specified in\n§ 330.5(a) of this title (relating to Classification of Municipal Solid Waste Facilities).\n      (c) A registration is required to establish a waste-separation/recycling facility established at a permitted MSW facil-\nity if owned by the permittee.\n     (d) A registration is required for a facility where the only operation is the storage and/or processing of used and\nscrap tires as provided for in Chapter 328 of this title (relating to Waste Minimization and Recycling). These facilities\nshall be registered with the executive director in accordance with Chapter 328 of this title. Failure to operate such regis-\ntered facilities in accordance with the requirements established in Chapter 328 of this title may be grounds for the revo-\ncation of the registration.\n     (e) A licensed hospital may function as a medical waste collection and transfer facility for generators that generate\nless than 50 pounds of untreated medical waste per month and that transport their own waste if:\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 2\n                                                       30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n     (1) the hospital is located in an incorporated area with a population of less than 25,000 and in a county with a pop-\nulation of less than one million; or\n    (2) the hospital is located in an unincorporated area that is not within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a city with a\npopulation more than 25,000 or within a county with a population of more than one million. The hospital shall submit a\nrequest to the executive director for registration as a medical waste collection station.\n     (f) A registration is required for any new MSW Type V transfer station that includes a material recovery operation\nthat meets all of the following requirements.\n      (1) Materials recovery. The owner or operator must recover 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the to-\ntal incoming waste stream for reuse or recycling; ensure that the incoming waste has already been reduced by at least\n10% through a source-separation recycling program; or, also operate one or more source-separation recycling programs\nin the county where the transfer station is located and those source-separation recycling programs manage a total weight\nor weight equivalent of recyclable materials equal to 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the incoming\nwaste stream to all transfer stations to which credit is being applied. The owner or operator must demonstrate in the\nregistration application the method that will be used to assure that the 10% requirement is achieved.\n     (2) Distance to a landfill. The transfer facility must demonstrate in the registration application that it will transfer\nthe remaining nonrecyclable waste to a landfill not more than 50 miles from the facility.\n     (g) Except as provided in § 330.11(d) of this title, a registration is required for an MSW Type V processing facility\nthat processes only grease trap waste, grit trap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes in ac-\ncordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste means grit\ntrap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators.\n     (1) The facility must attain a 10% recovery of material for beneficial use from the incoming waste. Recovery of\nmaterial for beneficial use is considered to be the recovery of fats, oils, greases, and the recovery of food solids for\ncomposting, but does not include the recovery of water. The Type V processing facilities issued a registration under a\npermit exemption based on 10% recovery of material for beneficial use must maintain records in accordance with the\nrequirements of § 330.219(b)(9) of this title (relating to Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements). Records and a\nreport must be provided on a quarterly basis to the executive director that demonstrate that at least 10% of the volume of\nthe waste received was processed to recover solid material that was recycled or reused. Failure to achieve the relevant\npercent recycling rate in any two quarters within any one-year period will cause a registration to terminate and will re-\nquire the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a permit to continue facility operations. The quarterly report must\nprovide the volume received, percent solids, and the method of determining the percent solids, processed, disposed, and\nrecycled or reused. Records must be kept on a volume basis in gallons except that solids passing the paint filter test may\nbe reported in cubic yard volume converted to gallons. The methods of recycling or reuse must be specified in the re-\nport. Records must be kept for solids and recyclable material leaving these facilities in the form of manifests, shipping\ndocuments, or trip tickets. The quarterly report must include manifests, shipping documents, or trip tickets to show\nwhere the recyclable material was taken for recycling, and the recycled material must be reconciled with the volume of\nwaste received. Water discharged from processing is not allowed to be counted as part of the 10% recovery of material.\nRecovery and recycling or reuse of fats, oils, and greases may be considered a part of recycling for this activity. Com-\nposting of solids resulting from waste processing may be considered to be recycling as part of this activity. Any material\nsuch as lime, polymer, or flocculent added as part of the facility process is not allowed to be considered as part of the\n10% recovery of material from the waste stream and must be subtracted from the material considered as recycled. Di-\nversion of material from the waste stream without processing is not considered to be recycling as part of this activity.\n     (2) The Type V processing facility must be located at a manned treatment facility that is permitted under Texas\nWater Code, Chapter 26; is permitted to discharge at least one million gallons per day; and is owned by and operated for\nthe benefit of a political subdivision of this state. Facilities that have received a permit and wish to add capacity may\napply for a registration in lieu of a permit amendment if the facilities meet the registration requirements established in\nthis chapter.\n     (h) A registration is required for a mobile liquid waste processing unit that processes only grease trap waste, grit\ntrap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste\nmeans grit trap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators. Registration ap-\nplications shall contain the information specified in §§ 330.59(a) and (e) - (h), 330.61(a) and (b), and 330.63(a), (d)(6),\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 3\n                                                       30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n(h), and (j) of this title (relating to Contents of Part I of the Application; Contents of Part II of the Application; and\nContents of Part III of the Application). The following requirements also apply.\n    (1) Mobile liquid waste processing shall be limited to the processing of liquid waste while at the generator's trap.\n    (2) Effluent from the processing of the liquid waste must be discharged to the generator's trap or interceptor.\n     (3) The mobile liquid waste processing units regulated under this section include truck-mounted processes that are\nalso known as separator trucks, and any other liquid waste processes that are not considered to be fixed to a specific\nlocation.\n     (4) This section is not meant to supplant rules or ordinances of local governments where stricter standards are in\neffect.\n     (5) This section is not applicable to septage if waste has received only a pH adjustment prior to or during transpor-\ntation for disposal at a treatment facility permitted under Texas Water Code, Chapter 26, or other authorized facility.\nTransporters who only adjust septage pH during transportation shall register in accordance with § 312.142 of this title\n(relating to Transporter Registration).\n     (i) A registration is required for an MSW Type VI facility that demonstrates new management methods for pro-\ncessing or handling grease trap waste, grit trap waste, septage, or a combination of these three liquid wastes. For the\npurposes of this section, grit trap waste means grit trap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste\nfrom other generators. Those facilities meeting this exemption must obtain a registration by meeting the operational\ncriteria and design criteria established in § 330.63(d)(9) of this title.\n     (j) A registration is required for the following material recovery operations from a landfill. The following opera-\ntions are subject to the general requirements found in § 330.601 of this title (relating to General Requirements), and the\nrequirements set for soil end product standards in § 330.615 of this title (relating to Final Soil Product Grades and Al-\nlowable Uses), and the air quality requirements in § 330.607 of this title (relating to Air Quality Requirements):\n  (1) operations that recover reusable or recyclable material buried in permitted or closed MSW landfill facilities, or\nMSW landfill facilities that were never permitted;\n    (2) operations that reclaim soil from permitted or closed MSW landfills, or from MSW landfill facilities that were\nnever permitted; and\n      (3) facilities that have received prior approval for excavation of buried materials through permits, permit amend-\nments, or other agency authorization, which are exempt from further authorization requirements, as established in this\nsubchapter, for the specific authorization received. Soil final product standards shall be applicable for all registered fa-\ncilities.\n     (k) A registration by rule is granted for the owner or operator of a Type IX MSW facility that recovers landfill gas\nfor beneficial use if all of the following conditions are met.\n    (1) The owner or operator shall submit the following information at least 60 days prior to commencing operations:\n    (A) a large-scale plan drawing of the facility showing the following:\n    (i) facility boundaries (show permit boundaries and/or boundaries and dimensions of tract or land or closed MSW\nlandfill units on which the gas recovery system is to be developed); and\n    (ii) landfill gas treatment, gas compression, electrical power generation equipment, and any other beneficial gas-use\nequipment, indicating limits of waste placement and additional easements required;\n    (B) for enclosed structures, provisions for fire control facilities (fire hydrants, fire extinguisher, water tanks, and\nwaterwell), continuous methane monitoring, and explosion-proof fixtures;\n     (C) a discussion of the proposed method for condensate disposal, including during the landfill post-closure care pe-\nriod;\n    (D) an estimation of average daily gas production;\n    (E) an estimation of the design daily gas production;\n    (F) descriptions of the process units;\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 4\n                                                     30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n    (G) a cost estimate for closure following the requirements of § 330.505 of this title (relating to Closure Cost Esti-\nmates for Storage and Processing Units); and\n     (H) a description of the financial assurance mechanism required by Chapter 37, Subchapter R of this title (relating\nto Financial Assurance for Municipal Solid Waste Facilities).\n     (2) The owner or operator shall acquire all authorizations regarding air emissions for the facility and comply with\nthe following regulations:\n    (A) Subchapter E of this chapter (relating to Operational Standards for Municipal Solid Waste Storage and Pro-\ncessing Units);\n    (B) § 330.459 and § 330.461 of this title (relating to Closure Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste Storage and\nProcessing Units; and Certification of Final Facility Closure); and\n    (C) § 330.505 of this title.\n    (l) A registration by rule is granted for persons that plan to transport untreated medical waste and that are not the\ngenerator of the waste if all of the following conditions are met.\n     (1) The registrant completes registration forms provided by the commission and provides the following information\nat least 60 days prior to commencing operations:\n    (A) name, address, and telephone number of registrant;\n    (B) name, address, and telephone number of partners, corporate officers, and directors; and\n    (C) description of each transportation unit, including:\n    (i) make, model, and year;\n    (ii) motor vehicle identification number, if applicable;\n    (iii) license plate (tag) number, including state and year; and\n    (iv) name of transportation unit owner.\n     (2) The owner or operator submits the fee required by § 330.1211(l) of this title (relating to Transporters of Un-\ntreated Medical Waste) along with the claim for the registration by rule.\n    (3) Registrations by rule expire after one year. The owner or operator must submit an annual fee in accordance with\n§ 330.1211(l) of this title. Failure to timely pay the annual fee eliminates the option to manage wastes until the owner or\noperator claims a new or renewed registration by rule.\n     (4) Persons that claim the registration maintain a copy of the registration form, as annotated by the executive direc-\ntor with an assigned registration number, at their designated place of business and with each transportation unit used to\ntransport untreated medical waste.\n    (5) The owner or operator submits annual summary reports in accordance with applicable provisions in §\n330.1211(m) of this title.\n    (m) A registration by rule is granted for owners or operators of mobile treatment units conducting on-site treatment\nof medical waste who are not the generator if the following conditions are met.\n     (1) The registrant completes registration forms provided by the commission and provides the following information\nat least 60 days prior to commencing operations or expiration of a registration issued under the former rules before the\ncomprehensive rule revisions in this chapter as adopted in 2006 (2006 Revisions) became effective:\n    (A) name, address, and telephone number of registrant;\n    (B) name, address, and telephone number of partners, corporate officers, and directors;\n    (C) description of each mobile treatment unit, including:\n    (i) make, model, and year;\n    (ii) motor vehicle identification number, if applicable; and\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 5\n                                                      30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n    (iii) license plate (tag) number, including state and year;\n    (D) name of mobile treatment unit owner;\n     (E) description of approved treatment method to be employed and chemical preparations, as well as the procedure\nto be utilized for routine performance testing/parameter monitoring;\n    (F) evidence of competency;\n    (G) a description of the management and disposal of process waters generated during treatment events;\n    (H) a written contingency plan that describes the handling and disposal of waste in the event of treatment failure or\nequipment breakdown; and\n     (I) an estimate of the cost to remove and dispose of waste and disinfect the waste treatment equipment and evidence\nof financial assurance using procedures specified in Subchapter L of this chapter (relating to Closure, Post-Closure, and\nCorrective Action Cost Estimates) and Chapter 37, Subchapter R of this title.\n    (2) The owner or operator submits the fee required by § 330.1221(l) of this title (relating to On-Site Treatment Ser-\nvices on Mobile Treatment Units) along with the claim for the registration by rule.\n     (3) The executive director will send a copy of the registration form, annotated with an assigned registration number,\nto the owner or operator,\n     (4) Registrations by rule expire after one year.

These facilities\nshall be registered with the executive director in accordance with Chapter 328 of this title. Failure to operate such regis-\ntered facilities in accordance with the requirements established in Chapter 328 of this title may be grounds for the revo-\ncation of the registration.\n     (e) A licensed hospital may function as a medical waste collection and transfer facility for generators that generate\nless than 50 pounds of untreated medical waste per month and that transport their own waste if:\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 2\n                                                       30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n     (1) the hospital is located in an incorporated area with a population of less than 25,000 and in a county with a pop-\nulation of less than one million; or\n    (2) the hospital is located in an unincorporated area that is not within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a city with a\npopulation more than 25,000 or within a county with a population of more than one million. The hospital shall submit a\nrequest to the executive director for registration as a medical waste collection station.\n     (f) A registration is required for any new MSW Type V transfer station that includes a material recovery operation\nthat meets all of the following requirements.\n      (1) Materials recovery. The owner or operator must recover 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the to-\ntal incoming waste stream for reuse or recycling; ensure that the incoming waste has already been reduced by at least\n10% through a source-separation recycling program; or, also operate one or more source-separation recycling programs\nin the county where the transfer station is located and those source-separation recycling programs manage a total weight\nor weight equivalent of recyclable materials equal to 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the incoming\nwaste stream to all transfer stations to which credit is being applied. The owner or operator must demonstrate in the\nregistration application the method that will be used to assure that the 10% requirement is achieved.\n     (2) Distance to a landfill. The transfer facility must demonstrate in the registration application that it will transfer\nthe remaining nonrecyclable waste to a landfill not more than 50 miles from the facility.\n     (g) Except as provided in § 330.11(d) of this title, a registration is required for an MSW Type V processing facility\nthat processes only grease trap waste, grit trap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes in ac-\ncordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste means grit\ntrap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators.\n     (1) The facility must attain a 10% recovery of material for beneficial use from the incoming waste. Recovery of\nmaterial for beneficial use is considered to be the recovery of fats, oils, greases, and the recovery of food solids for\ncomposting, but does not include the recovery of water. The Type V processing facilities issued a registration under a\npermit exemption based on 10% recovery of material for beneficial use must maintain records in accordance with the\nrequirements of § 330.219(b)(9) of this title (relating to Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements). Records and a\nreport must be provided on a quarterly basis to the executive director that demonstrate that at least 10% of the volume of\nthe waste received was processed to recover solid material that was recycled or reused. Failure to achieve the relevant\npercent recycling rate in any two quarters within any one-year period will cause a registration to terminate and will re-\nquire the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a permit to continue facility operations. The quarterly report must\nprovide the volume received, percent solids, and the method of determining the percent solids, processed, disposed, and\nrecycled or reused. Records must be kept on a volume basis in gallons except that solids passing the paint filter test may\nbe reported in cubic yard volume converted to gallons. The methods of recycling or reuse must be specified in the re-\nport. Records must be kept for solids and recyclable material leaving these facilities in the form of manifests, shipping\ndocuments, or trip tickets. The quarterly report must include manifests, shipping documents, or trip tickets to show\nwhere the recyclable material was taken for recycling, and the recycled material must be reconciled with the volume of\nwaste received. Water discharged from processing is not allowed to be counted as part of the 10% recovery of material.\nRecovery and recycling or reuse of fats, oils, and greases may be considered a part of recycling for this activity. Com-\nposting of solids resulting from waste processing may be considered to be recycling as part of this activity. Any material\nsuch as lime, polymer, or flocculent added as part of the facility process is not allowed to be considered as part of the\n10% recovery of material from the waste stream and must be subtracted from the material considered as recycled. Di-\nversion of material from the waste stream without processing is not considered to be recycling as part of this activity.\n     (2) The Type V processing facility must be located at a manned treatment facility that is permitted under Texas\nWater Code, Chapter 26; is permitted to discharge at least one million gallons per day; and is owned by and operated for\nthe benefit of a political subdivision of this state. Facilities that have received a permit and wish to add capacity may\napply for a registration in lieu of a permit amendment if the facilities meet the registration requirements established in\nthis chapter.\n     (h) A registration is required for a mobile liquid waste processing unit that processes only grease trap waste, grit\ntrap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste\nmeans grit trap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators. Registration ap-\nplications shall contain the information specified in §§ 330.59(a) and (e) - (h), 330.61(a) and (b), and 330.63(a), (d)(6),\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 3\n                                                       30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n(h), and (j) of this title (relating to Contents of Part I of the Application; Contents of Part II of the Application; and\nContents of Part III of the Application). The following requirements also apply.\n    (1) Mobile liquid waste processing shall be limited to the processing of liquid waste while at the generator's trap.\n    (2) Effluent from the processing of the liquid waste must be discharged to the generator's trap or interceptor.\n     (3) The mobile liquid waste processing units regulated under this section include truck-mounted processes that are\nalso known as separator trucks, and any other liquid waste processes that are not considered to be fixed to a specific\nlocation.\n     (4) This section is not meant to supplant rules or ordinances of local governments where stricter standards are in\neffect.\n     (5) This section is not applicable to septage if waste has received only a pH adjustment prior to or during transpor-\ntation for disposal at a treatment facility permitted under Texas Water Code, Chapter 26, or other authorized facility.\nTransporters who only adjust septage pH during transportation shall register in accordance with § 312.142 of this title\n(relating to Transporter Registration).\n     (i) A registration is required for an MSW Type VI facility that demonstrates new management methods for pro-\ncessing or handling grease trap waste, grit trap waste, septage, or a combination of these three liquid wastes. For the\npurposes of this section, grit trap waste means grit trap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste\nfrom other generators. Those facilities meeting this exemption must obtain a registration by meeting the operational\ncriteria and design criteria established in § 330.63(d)(9) of this title.\n     (j) A registration is required for the following material recovery operations from a landfill. The following opera-\ntions are subject to the general requirements found in § 330.601 of this title (relating to General Requirements), and the\nrequirements set for soil end product standards in § 330.615 of this title (relating to Final Soil Product Grades and Al-\nlowable Uses), and the air quality requirements in § 330.607 of this title (relating to Air Quality Requirements):\n  (1) operations that recover reusable or recyclable material buried in permitted or closed MSW landfill facilities, or\nMSW landfill facilities that were never permitted;\n    (2) operations that reclaim soil from permitted or closed MSW landfills, or from MSW landfill facilities that were\nnever permitted; and\n      (3) facilities that have received prior approval for excavation of buried materials through permits, permit amend-\nments, or other agency authorization, which are exempt from further authorization requirements, as established in this\nsubchapter, for the specific authorization received. Soil final product standards shall be applicable for all registered fa-\ncilities.\n     (k) A registration by rule is granted for the owner or operator of a Type IX MSW facility that recovers landfill gas\nfor beneficial use if all of the following conditions are met.\n    (1) The owner or operator shall submit the following information at least 60 days prior to commencing operations:\n    (A) a large-scale plan drawing of the facility showing the following:\n    (i) facility boundaries (show permit boundaries and/or boundaries and dimensions of tract or land or closed MSW\nlandfill units on which the gas recovery system is to be developed); and\n    (ii) landfill gas treatment, gas compression, electrical power generation equipment, and any other beneficial gas-use\nequipment, indicating limits of waste placement and additional easements required;\n    (B) for enclosed structures, provisions for fire control facilities (fire hydrants, fire extinguisher, water tanks, and\nwaterwell), continuous methane monitoring, and explosion-proof fixtures;\n     (C) a discussion of the proposed method for condensate disposal, including during the landfill post-closure care pe-\nriod;\n    (D) an estimation of average daily gas production;\n    (E) an estimation of the design daily gas production;\n    (F) descriptions of the process units;\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 4\n                                                     30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n    (G) a cost estimate for closure following the requirements of § 330.505 of this title (relating to Closure Cost Esti-\nmates for Storage and Processing Units); and\n     (H) a description of the financial assurance mechanism required by Chapter 37, Subchapter R of this title (relating\nto Financial Assurance for Municipal Solid Waste Facilities).\n     (2) The owner or operator shall acquire all authorizations regarding air emissions for the facility and comply with\nthe following regulations:\n    (A) Subchapter E of this chapter (relating to Operational Standards for Municipal Solid Waste Storage and Pro-\ncessing Units);\n    (B) § 330.459 and § 330.461 of this title (relating to Closure Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste Storage and\nProcessing Units; and Certification of Final Facility Closure); and\n    (C) § 330.505 of this title.\n    (l) A registration by rule is granted for persons that plan to transport untreated medical waste and that are not the\ngenerator of the waste if all of the following conditions are met.\n     (1) The registrant completes registration forms provided by the commission and provides the following information\nat least 60 days prior to commencing operations:\n    (A) name, address, and telephone number of registrant;\n    (B) name, address, and telephone number of partners, corporate officers, and directors; and\n    (C) description of each transportation unit, including:\n    (i) make, model, and year;\n    (ii) motor vehicle identification number, if applicable;\n    (iii) license plate (tag) number, including state and year; and\n    (iv) name of transportation unit owner.\n     (2) The owner or operator submits the fee required by § 330.1211(l) of this title (relating to Transporters of Un-\ntreated Medical Waste) along with the claim for the registration by rule.\n    (3) Registrations by rule expire after one year. The owner or operator must submit an annual fee in accordance with\n§ 330.1211(l) of this title. Failure to timely pay the annual fee eliminates the option to manage wastes until the owner or\noperator claims a new or renewed registration by rule.\n     (4) Persons that claim the registration maintain a copy of the registration form, as annotated by the executive direc-\ntor with an assigned registration number, at their designated place of business and with each transportation unit used to\ntransport untreated medical waste.\n    (5) The owner or operator submits annual summary reports in accordance with applicable provisions in §\n330.1211(m) of this title.\n    (m) A registration by rule is granted for owners or operators of mobile treatment units conducting on-site treatment\nof medical waste who are not the generator if the following conditions are met.\n     (1) The registrant completes registration forms provided by the commission and provides the following information\nat least 60 days prior to commencing operations or expiration of a registration issued under the former rules before the\ncomprehensive rule revisions in this chapter as adopted in 2006 (2006 Revisions) became effective:\n    (A) name, address, and telephone number of registrant;\n    (B) name, address, and telephone number of partners, corporate officers, and directors;\n    (C) description of each mobile treatment unit, including:\n    (i) make, model, and year;\n    (ii) motor vehicle identification number, if applicable; and\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 5\n                                                      30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n    (iii) license plate (tag) number, including state and year;\n    (D) name of mobile treatment unit owner;\n     (E) description of approved treatment method to be employed and chemical preparations, as well as the procedure\nto be utilized for routine performance testing/parameter monitoring;\n    (F) evidence of competency;\n    (G) a description of the management and disposal of process waters generated during treatment events;\n    (H) a written contingency plan that describes the handling and disposal of waste in the event of treatment failure or\nequipment breakdown; and\n     (I) an estimate of the cost to remove and dispose of waste and disinfect the waste treatment equipment and evidence\nof financial assurance using procedures specified in Subchapter L of this chapter (relating to Closure, Post-Closure, and\nCorrective Action Cost Estimates) and Chapter 37, Subchapter R of this title.\n    (2) The owner or operator submits the fee required by § 330.1221(l) of this title (relating to On-Site Treatment Ser-\nvices on Mobile Treatment Units) along with the claim for the registration by rule.\n     (3) The executive director will send a copy of the registration form, annotated with an assigned registration number,\nto the owner or operator,\n     (4) Registrations by rule expire after one year. The owner or operator must submit an annual renewal fee in ac-\ncordance with § 330.1221(l) of this title. Failure to timely pay the annual fee eliminates the option to manage wastes\nuntil the owner or operator claims a new or renewed registration by rule.\n    (5) The owner or operator submits annual summary reports in accordance with applicable provisions in §\n330.1221(m) of this title.\n    (6) Providers of on-site treatment of medical waste in mobile units notify the executive director, by letter, within 30\ndays of any changes to their registration if:\n    (A) the method employed to treat medical waste changes;\n    (B) the office or place of business is moved;\n    (C) the name of registrant or owner of the operation is changed;\n    (D) the name of the partners, corporate directors, or corporate officers change; or\n    (E) the unit information changes.\n     (n) A registration is required for facilities that store or process untreated medical waste that is received from off-site\nsources.

Registration Required\n\n   (a) Except as provided in §§ 330.7, 330.11, 330.13, or 330.25 of this title (relating to Permit Required; Notification\nRequired; Waste Management Activities Exempt from Permitting, Registration, or Notification; Relationship with\nCounty Licensing System), no person may cause, suffer, allow, or permit any activity of storage, processing, removal,\nor disposal of any municipal solid waste (MSW) unless that activity is authorized by a registration or other authorization\nfrom the commission. In the event this requirement is violated, the executive director may seek recourse against not\nonly the person that stored, processed, or disposed of the waste but also against the generator, transporter, owner or op-\nerator, or other person who caused, suffered, allowed, or permitted waste to be stored, processed, or disposed. No per-\nson may commence physical construction of a new MSW management facility subject to this registration requirement\nwithout first having submitted a registration application in accordance with §§ 330.57, 330.59, 330.61, 330.63, and\n330.65 of this title (relating to Permit and Registration Application Procedures) and received a registration from the\ncommission. A person shall include a statement justifying the facility's eligibility for a registration as established under\nthis section. A person shall submit a claim for a registration by rule in duplicate with one copy sent directly to the ap-\npropriate Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regional office.\n    (b) A registration is required for an MSW transfer station facility that is used in the transfer of MSW to a solid\nwaste processing or disposal facility from any of the following:\n    (1) a municipality with a population of less than 50,000;\n    (2) a county with a population of less than 85,000;\n    (3) a facility used in the transfer of MSW that transfers or will transfer 125 tons per day or less; or\n    (4) a transfer station located within the permitted boundaries of an MSW Type I or Type IV facility as specified in\n§ 330.5(a) of this title (relating to Classification of Municipal Solid Waste Facilities).\n      (c) A registration is required to establish a waste-separation/recycling facility established at a permitted MSW facil-\nity if owned by the permittee.\n     (d) A registration is required for a facility where the only operation is the storage and/or processing of used and\nscrap tires as provided for in Chapter 328 of this title (relating to Waste Minimization and Recycling). These facilities\nshall be registered with the executive director in accordance with Chapter 328 of this title. Failure to operate such regis-\ntered facilities in accordance with the requirements established in Chapter 328 of this title may be grounds for the revo-\ncation of the registration.\n     (e) A licensed hospital may function as a medical waste collection and transfer facility for generators that generate\nless than 50 pounds of untreated medical waste per month and that transport their own waste if:\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 2\n                                                       30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n     (1) the hospital is located in an incorporated area with a population of less than 25,000 and in a county with a pop-\nulation of less than one million; or\n    (2) the hospital is located in an unincorporated area that is not within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a city with a\npopulation more than 25,000 or within a county with a population of more than one million. The hospital shall submit a\nrequest to the executive director for registration as a medical waste collection station.\n     (f) A registration is required for any new MSW Type V transfer station that includes a material recovery operation\nthat meets all of the following requirements.\n      (1) Materials recovery. The owner or operator must recover 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the to-\ntal incoming waste stream for reuse or recycling; ensure that the incoming waste has already been reduced by at least\n10% through a source-separation recycling program; or, also operate one or more source-separation recycling programs\nin the county where the transfer station is located and those source-separation recycling programs manage a total weight\nor weight equivalent of recyclable materials equal to 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the incoming\nwaste stream to all transfer stations to which credit is being applied. The owner or operator must demonstrate in the\nregistration application the method that will be used to assure that the 10% requirement is achieved.\n     (2) Distance to a landfill. The transfer facility must demonstrate in the registration application that it will transfer\nthe remaining nonrecyclable waste to a landfill not more than 50 miles from the facility.\n     (g) Except as provided in § 330.11(d) of this title, a registration is required for an MSW Type V processing facility\nthat processes only grease trap waste, grit trap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes in ac-\ncordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste means grit\ntrap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators.\n     (1) The facility must attain a 10% recovery of material for beneficial use from the incoming waste. Recovery of\nmaterial for beneficial use is considered to be the recovery of fats, oils, greases, and the recovery of food solids for\ncomposting, but does not include the recovery of water. The Type V processing facilities issued a registration under a\npermit exemption based on 10% recovery of material for beneficial use must maintain records in accordance with the\nrequirements of § 330.219(b)(9) of this title (relating to Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements). Records and a\nreport must be provided on a quarterly basis to the executive director that demonstrate that at least 10% of the volume of\nthe waste received was processed to recover solid material that was recycled or reused. Failure to achieve the relevant\npercent recycling rate in any two quarters within any one-year period will cause a registration to terminate and will re-\nquire the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a permit to continue facility operations. The quarterly report must\nprovide the volume received, percent solids, and the method of determining the percent solids, processed, disposed, and\nrecycled or reused. Records must be kept on a volume basis in gallons except that solids passing the paint filter test may\nbe reported in cubic yard volume converted to gallons. The methods of recycling or reuse must be specified in the re-\nport. Records must be kept for solids and recyclable material leaving these facilities in the form of manifests, shipping\ndocuments, or trip tickets. The quarterly report must include manifests, shipping documents, or trip tickets to show\nwhere the recyclable material was taken for recycling, and the recycled material must be reconciled with the volume of\nwaste received. Water discharged from processing is not allowed to be counted as part of the 10% recovery of material.\nRecovery and recycling or reuse of fats, oils, and greases may be considered a part of recycling for this activity. Com-\nposting of solids resulting from waste processing may be considered to be recycling as part of this activity. Any material\nsuch as lime, polymer, or flocculent added as part of the facility process is not allowed to be considered as part of the\n10% recovery of material from the waste stream and must be subtracted from the material considered as recycled. Di-\nversion of material from the waste stream without processing is not considered to be recycling as part of this activity.\n     (2) The Type V processing facility must be located at a manned treatment facility that is permitted under Texas\nWater Code, Chapter 26; is permitted to discharge at least one million gallons per day; and is owned by and operated for\nthe benefit of a political subdivision of this state. Facilities that have received a permit and wish to add capacity may\napply for a registration in lieu of a permit amendment if the facilities meet the registration requirements established in\nthis chapter.\n     (h) A registration is required for a mobile liquid waste processing unit that processes only grease trap waste, grit\ntrap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste\nmeans grit trap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators.

In the\n\ncase of TCEQ, these are the regulations and statutes that are designed to protect\n\nour health and our environment.       Maintaining these safeguards as they were\n\nintended is important to the preserve Texans’ heath and natural resources. The\n\ndecisional process regarding these important issues would be significantly aided by\n\noral argument. Oral argument will bring clarity to the written arguments presented\n\nby the briefs and appreciably aid the Court in its consideration of the issues and in\n\ndetermining the correct result.\n\n\n\n\n                                         13\n\f                               ISSUES PRESENTED\n\nI.    Issue 1\n\n      An agency is required to follow the clear, unambiguous language of its own\n\nregulations. TCEQ Rule 330.7(a) generally requires a permit for Municipal Solid\n\nWaste (“MSW”) facilities, but there are specific exceptions. Rule 330.9(b)(3)\n\nallows transfer stations that transfer 125 tons of municipal solid waste per day or\n\nless to qualify for registration, rather than requiring a permit. Rule 330.9(f) allows\n\ntransfer stations that include materials recovery operations to qualify for\n\nregistration, but only if certain requirements set forth in the rule are met. TCEQ\n\nissued a registration to a transfer station that includes a materials recovery facility,\n\nbut the facility does not meet the requirements of Rule 330.9(f). Did the trial court\n\nerr in its judgment upholding this registration when TCEQ failed to follow the\n\nclear, unambiguous language of its regulations?\n\nII.   Issue 2\n\n      TCEQ rules and the Solid Waste Act generally require a permit for an MSW\n\nfacility. The permitting process provides affected persons the opportunity for\n\nhearing.   On the other hand, the registration process does not provide an\n\nopportunity for hearing.     Plaintiffs assert that TCEQ acted in violation of its\n\npermitting requirement by utilizing a registration to authorize this Facility. Under\n\nthe permitting requirements, Plaintiffs would have had a statutory right to a hearing\n\n\n\n                                          14\n\fas affected persons. Did the trial court err in its judgment denying all claims that\n\ndue process rights were violated when there was no opportunity for hearing on this\n\nregistration authorization?\n\nIII.   Issue 3\n\n       The TCEQ publicly pronounced its policy regarding technical notices of\n\ndeficiency (NODs) in letters to the regulated entities, instructions to its staff\n\nmembers, communications with the public, and representations to the Texas\n\nlegislature. TCEQ’s stated policy is to allow no more than two (2) NODs before\n\nreturning an MSW registration application. In this case, TCEQ allowed six (6)\n\nNODs and two (2) extensions of time, which is far more than the two (2) NOD\n\nlimit. Did the trial court err in its judgment upholding this registration when more\n\nthan two (2) NODs were issued?\n\n\n\n\n                                        15\n\f                           STATEMENT OF THE FACTS\n\n       A.     Statutory and Regulatory Framework\n\n       The Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act (the “Act”) was enacted “to safeguard\n\nthe health, welfare, and physical property of the people and to protect the\n\nenvironment by controlling the management of solid waste.”17 The Act authorizes\n\nTexas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) to issue permits\n\ngoverning the construction, operation, and maintenance of solid waste facilities.18\n\nThe Act generally requires that a person apply for and obtain a separate permit for\n\neach solid waste facility.19\n\n       To implement its statutory authority under the Act, TCEQ promulgated rules\n\nfound in Title 30, Chapter 330 of the Texas Administrative Code (“TCEQ Rules”).\n\nThe TCEQ Rules generally require a permit for any storage, processing, or\n\ndisposal of any solid waste unless the activity is exempted from permitting\n\nrequirements and authorized through a less rigorous process.20 These less rigorous\n\nauthorization processes include registration, notification, and exemption of certain\n\nwaste management activities from permitting or registration.

Specifically, the Act allows\n\ncertain types of facilities to be authorized by a mere registration, rather than by a\n\npermit.26    An applicant seeking authorization by registration must file an\n\napplication, but unlike the permitting process, the registration process does not\n\ninclude an opportunity for a contested case hearing. Moreover, unlike permit\n\napproval, the Executive Director has exclusive authority to review and approve\n\nregistrations without a vote by TCEQ commissioners.27\n\n       In accordance with the Act’s provisions, TCEQ Rule 330.9 allows\n\nauthorization of certain specific and precisely defined types of facilities pursuant to\n\na registration, rather than a permit.28 Rule 330.9 was expressly promulgated “to\n\nlist all those MSW management activities that are exempt from permitting\n\nrequirements but that still require commission approval by registration.”29 Thus,\n\nan applicant for a registration must be seeking approval for one of the specific\n\ntypes of facilities specified in Rule 330.9 and must meet the applicable\n\nrequirements of 330.9 for that particular type of waste management activity.\n25\n   Tex.

The Proposed Solid Waste Complex\n\n       Pintail Landfill, LLC (“Applicant” or “Pintail”) wishes to construct and\n\noperate a large solid waste complex within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the\n\ncity of Hempstead.30 The complex would consist of two solid waste facilities: 1) a\n\n223-acre, 410-foot high landfill (the “Landfill”); and 2) a transfer station/material\n\nrecovery facility to be located at the same site as the Landfill.31 This appeal\n\npertains to the transfer station/material recovery facility, but information is\n\nprovided below relating to the larger proposed Landfill for context.\n\n       C.      The Pending Landfill Permit Application\n\n       The Applicant has filed an application for a Type I municipal solid waste\n\n(“MSW”) permit to authorize construction and operation of the proposed\n\nLandfill.32 The Applicant filed Parts I and II of the Landfill application on July 22,\n\n2011, and filed Parts III and IV of the Landfill application on January 20, 2012.33\n\nThe Landfill is proposed to be constructed and operated on top of the sandy\n\nrecharge zone of the regional aquifer that serves as the sole source of drinking\n\nwater for the citizens of the city of Hempstead and other nearby residents.34\n\n\n30\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 1, Item 1, (Registration Application for MSW Facility), at p.

The Registration\n\n\n\n35\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 8, Item 65 (CALH’s Reply to Responses to MTO’s).\n36\n   See e.g., APPENDIX E: R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 67 (Waller County’s Request for\nDetermination and Denial of Permit Application and Registration Application).\n37\n   APPENDIX E: R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 67, p. 4-10 (Waller County’s Request for\nDetermination and Denial of Permit Application and Registration Application).\n38\n   APPENDIX E: R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 67, pp. 1-4, 9 (Waller County’s Request for\nDetermination and Denial of Permit Application and Registration Application).\n\n                                           20\n\f       On August 2, 2011, the Applicant filed its application for MSW Facility\n\nRegistration No. 40259 (the “Registration Application”), requesting authority to\n\noperate a transfer station/materials recovery facility (the “Facility”).39 On the first\n\npage of its Registration Application, the Applicant explains that the Facility will\n\ntransfer and recycle waste at the same location as the proposed Landfill in order to\n\ninitiate a market for incoming waste materials.40                Claiming authority under\n\nRule 330.9(b)(3), the Applicant improperly utilized the registration process to\n\nauthorize its transfer station/materials recovery facility.41 Rule 330.9(b)(3) allows\n\nregistration for transfer station facilities that transfer less than 125 tons of waste or\n\nless per day. Rule 330.9(b)(3) expressly applies only to transfer station facilities\n\nonly, and does not authorize the registration of materials recovery, waste\n\nseparation, or recycling facilities.42\n\n       Importantly, Applicant did not claim to use Rule 330.9(f) to authorize its\n\nregistration.    That rule does apply to transfer stations that include materials\n\nrecovery operations, such as the facility proposed by the Applicant. The rule\n\nrequires “any new MSW Type V transfer station that includes a materials recovery\n\noperation” to meet two qualifications: (1) it must recover at least ten percent of the\n\nwaste stream for recycling, and (2) it must send the remaining waste to a landfill\n39\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 1, Item 1, (Registration Application for MSW Facility).\n40\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 1, Item 1, (Registration Application for MSW Facility).\n41\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 1, Item 1, p. 2 (Registration Application for MSW Facility).\n42\n   The terms “materials recovery facility,” “recycling facility,” and “waste separation facility”\nare used interchangeably in TCEQ rules. See 30 Tex. Admin. Code 330.3(174).\n\n                                               21\n\ffacility within 50 miles (the so-called “10/50 requirement”).43 It is undisputed that\n\nApplicant did not meet the 10/50 requirement. In Part II of the Registration\n\nApplication, Applicant openly fails to meet the requirement, stating (1) that\n\nmaterials will be recovered at a rate not to interfere with proper operations of the\n\nfacility, and (2) that waste materials will be transported to a landfill within 100\n\nmiles.44\n\n       During TCEQ’s registration review process, CALH commented that\n\nregistration was inappropriate for this facility because the recycling activities\n\nexceeded those authorized for registration, and therefore permitting was required.45\n\n       E.      TCEQ’s Extended Review of the Registration\n\n       During review of the Registration Application, the TCEQ allowed more than\n\ntwo (2) technical notices of deficiency (“NODs”) and afforded multiple extensions\n\nof time for the Applicant to respond to the deficiencies.46 This conduct violated\n\nTCEQ’s own repeatedly published policies.47 The six NOD’s and two letters\n\ngranting extensions were mailed to Pintail on August 15, 2011 (NOD), October 27,\n\n\n43\n   30 Tex.

Several of CALH’s members own\n\nland, reside, and work adjacent to and near the proposed facility site, and would be\n\naffected in a manner distinct from members of the general public.

Plaintiff Wayne Knox is a resident of Waller County\n\nwho owns and operates Pipe and Valve. Pipe and Valve is located in Waller\n\nCounty directly across from the proposed Facility.\n\n      G.    The City of Hempstead.\n\n      The City of Hempstead (the “City”) is a home rule municipality with a\n\ngrowing and diverse population of approximately 5,800 residents located in\n\nnorthern Waller County, Texas. The proposed landfill complex would be located\n\nwithin the City’s extraterritorial jurisdiction and very near the important junction\n\nof State Highway 6 and U.S. Highway 290, which serves as the gateway into the\n\nCity. The City supplies water to its residents from wells located near the proposed\n\nlandfill complex.\n\n\n\n\n                                        25\n\f                         SUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT\n\n       This Court has held that rules must be followed. When an agency fails to\n\nfollow the clear, unambiguous language of its own regulation, the court must\n\nreverse the agency’s action. TCEQ did not follow its rules when it issued a\n\nregistration to this Facility, so the issuance must be reversed. At least four rules\n\nwere broken:57\n\n1)     30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.9(b)(3). This registration rule\n       expressly applies only to transfer stations, and TCEQ broke this rule by\n       applying it to a materials recovery, or recycling, facility.\n\n2)     30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.9(f). This registration rule applies to\n       transfer stations with materials recovery operations (i.e. this Facility).\n       TCEQ broke this rule by failing to apply it. It was not claimed as authority\n       for registration and its requirements (the “10/50 requirements”) were\n       ignored.\n\n3)     30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.3(157). This rule defines a transfer\n       station as a facility that transfers waste and does nothing more. TCEQ broke\n       this rule by treating a materials recovery facility as a transfer station.\n\n4)     30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.3(174). This rule defines materials\n       recovery, waste separation, and recycling facilities. TCEQ broke this rule\n       by treating a materials recovery facility as a transfer station.\n\n       If a facility does not qualify for registration (or any other permitting\n\nexemption), the law requires a permit and allows affected persons to request a\n\n57\n   Five rules were broken if Rule 330.7(a) is counted, which generally requires a permit. This\nrule states: “Except as provided in §§330.9, 330.11, 330.13, or 330.25 of this title (relating to\nRegistration Required; Notification Required; Waste Management Activities Exempt from\nPermitting, Registration, or Notification; and Relationship with County Licensing System), no\nperson may cause, suffer, allow, or permit any activity of storage, processing, removal, or\ndisposal of any solid waste unless such activity is authorized by a permit or other authorization\nfrom the commission.”\n\n                                               26\n\fhearing. By issuing this registration, TCEQ eviscerated the permit requirement of\n\nits rules. TCEQ impermissibly expanded the scope of 330.9(b), which expressly\n\napplies only to “transfer station facilities.” A transfer station is not a materials\n\nrecovery or recycling facility.        Therefore, TCEQ failed to follow the plain\n\nlanguage of its own rules. Accordingly, reversal is required.\n\n      The permitting process is important because it provides affected persons an\n\nopportunity for contested case hearing. The registration process does not. The\n\nopportunity for hearing invokes obligatory statutory protections that provide a\n\nmeaningful evidentiary hearing for affected persons. Plaintiffs affected by the\n\nimproperly registered solid waste facility and its larger landfill counterpart were\n\ndenied their opportunity for hearing by this registration issuance. Because a permit\n\nwas required and the permitting process provides opportunity for a hearing, the\n\naffected persons were denied their rights to due process. Accordingly, issuance of\n\nthe registration should be reversed.\n\n      Finally, the registration should be reversed because of excessive Notices of\n\nDeficiency (“NOD’s”). The TCEQ arbitrarily disregarded its publicly pronounced\n\npolicy that only two NOD’s are issued to applicants. According to the TCEQ own\n\nPublic Interest Counsel, the public must have confidence that the TCEQ applies its\n\nstated policies, including its two NOD policy, in a uniform manner. The TCEQ\n\nrepeatedly expressed its NOD policy to the legislature, its staff, applicants, and\n\n\n\n                                           27\n\faffected persons. The policy expressed is clear. Applications are required to be\n\nreturned after unsuccessful resolution of two (2) NOD’s.      The TCEQ acted\n\narbitrarily and unreasonably violated its publicly pronounced NOD policy when it\n\nissued six (6) NODs and two (2) extensions of time to respond to Applicant.\n\nTherefore, issuance of the registration should be reversed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         28\n\f                                    ARGUMENT\n\nI.    THE REGISTRATION MUST BE REVERSED BECAUSE TCEQ’S\n      APPROVAL OF APPLICANT’S REGISTRATION FAILED TO\n      FOLLOW THE CLEAR, UNAMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE OF ITS\n      REGULATIONS.\n\n      Issuance of this registration must be reversed because this Facility is not just\n\na transfer station. Rule 330(b)(3) only allows registration for transfer station\n\nfacilities that transfer less than 125 tons of waste per day. This Facility is not a\n\ntransfer station—it is a transfer station with a materials recovery operation.\n\nTherefore, the 10/50 requirements of Rule 330.9(f) apply. TCEQ and Applicant,\n\nhowever, ignored this rule and its requirements. As discussed further below, TCEQ\n\nfailed to follow the clear, unambiguous language of at least four of its regulations\n\nwhen it improperly issued a registration for Applicant’s transfer station/materials\n\nrecovery facility (the “Facility”) utilizing Rule 330.9(b)(3).58 Therefore, the Court\n\nmust reverse the agency’s action as arbitrary and capricious.59\n\n      Additionally, even if a rule is ambiguous or leaves room for policy\n\ndeterminations, a court may not defer to an agency’s interpretation that is plainly\n\nerroneous or inconsistent with the regulation or its underlying statutes.60 TCEQ’s\n\nunauthorized interpretation of its rules is plainly erroneous and inconsistent with\n\n\n58\n   See 30 Tex.

Standard of Review\n\n         In this appeal brought under Texas Health and Safety Code § 361.321(a), the\n\nissue is whether the action of TCEQ was invalid, arbitrary, or unreasonable.61 The\n\nThird Court of Appeals specifically addressed this standard of review in Smith v.\n\nHouston Chemical Services, Inc., opining that the issue of whether the action is\n\ninvalid, arbitrary, or unreasonable was intended to incorporate the provisions of\n\nAdministrative        Procedures      Act     (“APA”),      Texas    Government   Code\n\n§ 2001.174(2)(A)–(F).62 In accordance with these provisions, a reviewing court\n\nshall reverse or remand the case for further proceedings if substantial rights of the\n\nappellant have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences,\n\nconclusions, or decisions are:\n\n         (A) in violation of a constitutional or statutory provision;\n\n         (B) in excess of the agency's statutory authority;\n\n         (C) made through unlawful procedure;\n\n         (D) affected by other error of law;\n\n         (E) not reasonably supported by substantial evidence considering the\n\n61\n     Tex.

TCEQ’s Spontaneous Interpretation of 30 Texas Administrative\n              Code §§ 330.9(f) and 330.9(b)(3).\n\n       The first public pronouncement of TCEQ’s interpretation of 330.9(b)(3) was\n\nat the hearing on this appeal in district court. At that hearing, the district court\n\nasked the Applicant why it claimed it did not need to register under Rule 330.9(f)\n\nand satisfy the 10/50 requirements. For the first time, the Applicant presented a\n\nnew interpretation of Rule 330.9(f) and 330.9(b)(3) that was not asserted at the\n\nagency level, was not asserted in briefing, and flew in the face of TCEQ definitions\n\n\n\n63\n   Tex.

As discussed later, this\n\nreading plainly contradicts the rules.\n\n       At the same hearing, the court asked TCEQ’s attorneys to explain a guidance\n\ndocument appearing to apply the requirements of Rule 330.9(f) to transfer stations\n\nwith material recovery operations. After a brief deliberation among the TCEQ\n\nattorneys, they deferred to the Applicant’s interpretation of the rules. Thus, also\n\nfor the first time, TCEQ attorneys adopted the new interpretation that Rule 330.9(f)\n\nonly applies to transfer stations that include a material recovery operation if the\n\nfacility exceeds the waste volume limitation set forth in Rule 330.9(b)(3).\n\n       As discussed below, Applicant and TCEQ’s reading of the rules disregards\n\ntheir plain language and therefore is impermissible. Furthermore, Applicant and\n\nTCEQ’s position ignores relevant TCEQ guidance on the very rule at issue –\n\n330.9(f). Also as discussed below, TCEQ’s own guidance document69 emphasizes\n\nthat, to receive a registration, any transfer station that includes a materials recovery\n\n68\n  See C.R. at 512–14 (Plaintiff’s Joint Motion for New Trial at 8–10).\n69\n   See APPENDIX D: TCEQ Waste Permits Division Publication titled “Guidelines for\nUtilizing the Source-Separated Recycling Permit Exemption for Municipal Solid Waste Transfer\nFacilities.”\n\n                                            32\n\ffacility must meet the 10/50 rule requirements set forth in Rule 330.9(f). The\n\nguidance document further explains that this requirement is distinct from other\n\nprovisions for registration in Rule 330.9(b).70\n\n      C.     TCEQ Failed to Follow the Clear, Unambiguous Language of Its\n             Regulations.\n\n      When an agency fails to follow the clear, unambiguous language of its own\n\nregulation, the court must reverse the agency’s action as arbitrary and capricious.71\n\nA rule’s plain language must be followed unless it is ambiguous.72 If a rule is\n\nambiguous or leaves room for policy determinations, a court may not defer to an\n\nagency’s interpretation that is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation\n\nor its underlying statutes.73\n\n      A court construes an administrative rule in the same manner it construes a\n\nstatute.74 The court’s primary objective is to give effect to the agency’s intent.75\n\nAs the Texas Supreme Court has explained, other than the plain language of the\n\nrule itself, the “best source” of an agency’s intent is found in the Texas Register,\n\nwhere the agency publishes its notice of the proposed rule and its “explanation of\n\n\n70\n   Id.\n71\n   Gulf States Utilities, 809 S.W.2d at 207 (Tex. 1991); CenterPoint, 408 S.W.3d at 917.\n72\n   CenterPoint, 408 S.W.3d at 916.\n73\n   Id.\n74\n    Rodriguez v.

First, TCEQ failed to\n\nfollow Rule 330.9(b)(3), the provision under which Applicant claimed authority\n\nfor registration.     This rule expressly applies only to transfer station facilities.\n\nSecond, TCEQ failed to follow Rule 330.9(f), which requires that any transfer\n\nstations facilities with materials recovery operations must meet the 10/50\n\nrequirements. It is undisputed that the Facility is a transfer station with materials\n\nrecovery operations, and that the 10/50 requirements were not met. Third, TCEQ\n\nfailed to follow the clear, unambiguous language of its own definitions. TCEQ\n\nrules specifically define both types of facilities at issue, transfer stations and waste\n\nseparation/recycling facilities (also referred to as a materials recovery facilities),\n\nand these facilities engage in different waste management activities.

Applying this rule to other types of\n\nfacilities in addition to transfer stations controverts the plain language of the Rule\n\nitself.    Rule 330.9(b)(3) expressly applies to “transfer station facilities,” not\n\nrecycling facilities or any other types of waste management facilities.78 The rule\n\nstates that “[a] registration is required for an MSW transfer station facility that is\n\nused in the transfer of MSW to a solid waste processing or disposal facility….”79\n\nAs discussed below, transfer station facilities and recycling facilities are separately\n\ndefined in TCEQ regulations, each involing distinct waste management activities.\n\nTCEQ and reviewing courts are bound to construe these terms by their regulatory\n\ndefinitions only.80      Because TCEQ failed to follow the clear, unambiguous\n\nlanguage of its own regulation, the Court must reverse the agency’s action as\n\narbitrary and capricious.\n\n\n78\n   30 Tex.

TCEQ Failed to Follow the Clear, Unambiguous Language\n                       of 30 Texas Administrative Code § 330.9(f).\n\n       TCEQ failed to follow Rule 330.9(f), which requires any new MSW Type V\n\ntransfer station that includes a materials recovery operation to meet two\n\nqualifications: (1) it must recover at least ten percent of the waste stream for\n\nrecycling, and (2) it must send the waste to a landfill within 50 miles (the so-called\n\n“10/50 requirement”). It is undisputed that the Facility is not merely a transfer\n\nstation facility, but includes a material recover operation.81 Thus, the requirements\n\nof Rule 330.9(f) expressly apply to this Facility because they apply to “any new\n\nMSW Type V transfer station that includes a material recovery operation.”82\n\n       Even though this rule fits like a glove, the Applicant did not meet its\n\nrequirements. Indeed, in Part II of Applicant’s Registration Application, Applicant\n\nopenly states (1) that materials will be recovered at a rate not to interfere with\n\nproper operations of the facility, and (2) that waste materials will be transported to\n\na landfill within 100 miles.83 This fails to meet the applicable 10/50 requirements,\n\nand therefore, the registration must be reversed.\n\n       As previously discussed, TCEQ contended for the first time in hearing\n\nbefore the district court that the requirements of 330.9(f) were inapplicable to this\n81\n   C.R. at 509 (Plaintiff’s Joint Motion for New Trial, Note 10 and accompanying text).\n82\n   30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.9(f) (2014) (emphasis added).\n83\n   R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 1, Item 1, p. II-3 (Registration Application) (“The facility will\nrecover recyclable materials at a rate not to interfere with proper operations of the facility. Non-\nrecyclable materials will be transported to a properly permitted Type I or Type IV landfill that is\nlocated within 100 miles of the proposed facility.”).\n\n                                                36\n\fFacility. This assertion fails because it conflicts with the plain language of the\n\nrule, which expressly applies to “any” Type V transfer station that includes a\n\nmaterial recovery operation.\n\n       Furthermore, this assertion is surprising because TCEQ’s published\n\nguidance on Rule 330.9(f)84 emphasizes that, to receive a registration, any transfer\n\nstation that includes a materials recovery facility must meet the 10/50 rule\n\nrequirements set forth in Rule 330.9(f). The guidance document explains that Rule\n\n330.9(f) is distinct from other provisions for registration of a transfer facility\n\nbased on the population of the area served, waste acceptance rate, and location\n\nwithin a permitted facility (30 TAC §330.9(b)).”85 Further, the guidance document\n\ndoes not suggest that applicants wishing to operate a materials recovery facility\n\nmay use Rule 330.9(b) if they self-impose waste acceptance limitations. On the\n\ncontrary, Rule 330.9(f) expressly applies to “any … station that includes a material\n\nrecovery operation,”86 regardless of waste acceptance rates.\n\n              3.     TCEQ Failed to Follow the Clear, Unambiguous Language\n                     of its Regulations Defining Transfer Station and Waste\n                     Separation/Recycling Facility.\n\n       Registration of this Facility violates the clear, unambiguous language of\n\nRules 330.3(157) and 330.3(174), which define transfer station and waste\n84\n    See APPENDIX D: TCEQ Waste Permits Division Publication titled “Guidelines for\nUtilizing the Source-Separated Recycling Permit Exemption for Municipal Solid Waste Transfer\nFacilities.”\n85\n   Id.\n86\n   30 Tex.

It does not mean a transfer station and a\n\nmaterial recovery facility.\n\n       D.      A Loophole Big Enough to Drive a Truck Through: Even if the\n               Regulations Were Ambiguous, TCEQ’s Interpretation Would Not\n               Be Entitled to Deference Because it is Plainly Erroneous or\n               Inconsistent with the Regulation or its Underlying Statutes.\n\n       Even if the regulations were ambiguous, the Facility registration must be\n\nreversed because TCEQ’s interpretation of §330.9(b)(3) is plainly erroneous and\n\ninconsistent with the regulation or its underlying statutes.92 TCEQ’s interpretation\n\nof 330.9(b)(3) is plainly erroneous because it leads to an absurd result. Reading\n\nthis rule to allow activities beyond the stated “transfer” activities would eviscerate\n\nthe Act and TCEQ Rules’ permitting requirement for many MSW storage,\n\nprocessing, and disposal facilities.                 Indeed, under TCEQ’s impromptu\n\ninterpretation, so long as a facility called itself a “transfer station” and transferred\n\nless than 125 tons per day of MSW, it would be able to perform any other MSW\n\n91\n   See Moore v. State, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2467144\"><a href=\"/opinion/2467144/moore-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 349 (Tex. Crim. App. 1987). Also, there is certainly\nnothing in the TCEQ rules that would support any suggestion that the term “transfer station” is\nan umbrella term encompassing various kinds of facilities, like, for example, the term “Type V\nFacility.”\n92\n   Gulf States, 809 S.W.2d at 207; CenterPoint, 408 S.W.3d at 917 (Tex. App.—Austin 2013,\npet. denied) (holding that if a rule is ambiguous or leaves room for policy determinations, a court\nmay not defer to an agency’s interpretation that is plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\nregulation or its underlying statutes.).\n\n                                                39\n\fwaste management activities at that facility, including long-term storage,\n\nprocessing activities such as recycling, and even land disposal. This cannot be the\n\nstate of law, and is plainly erroneous.\n\n       As discussed at length above, TCEQ’s interpretation is inconsistent with its\n\nregulations. Furthermore, the interpretation is also inconsistent with the Act. The\n\nstated purpose of the Act is “to safeguard the health, welfare, and physical property\n\nof the people and to protect the environment by controlling the management of\n\nsolid waste.”93     The Act authorizes TCEQ to issue permits governing the\n\nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of solid waste facilities,94 and the Act\n\ngenerally requires that a person apply for and obtain a separate permit for each\n\nsolid waste facility.95 Furthermore, the Act provides certain specific exceptions to\n\nthe general permitting requirement, which are reflected in the TCEQ Rules (as\n\ndiscussed above). Specifically, the Act allows certain types of facilities to be\n\nauthorized by a mere registration, rather than by a permit.96          The TCEQ’s\n\ninterpretation is inconsistent with the Act because it would result in registration of\n\nsolid waste management activities that should require a permit under the Act.\n\nII.    THE TCEQ DENIED AFFECTED PERSONS DUE PROCESS BY\n       AUTHORIZING THE FACILITY THROUGH REGISTRATION\n       RATHER THAN A PERMIT.\n\n93\n   Tex.

This\n\nFacility is actually part of the proposed Landfill that has not been permitted, and\n\nwhich is the subject of an ongoing contested case hearing.               This registration\n\nimproperly denied these requestors their opportunity for hearing on the storage and\n\nrecycling component of the larger Landfill facility.\n\n       No one has disputed CALH or the City’s standing, and each is a party in the\n\nongoing contested case hearing for the Pintail Landfill at the same location as this\n\nFacility. CALH members and City of Hempstead have property interests that\n\nwould be affected by the proposed facility. For example, CALH has members that\n\nreside adjacent to the proposed location and rely on water wells as their sole source\n\nof domestic water, and the City supplies water to its residents from wells located\n\nnear the Facility. The legislature has determined that a contested case hearing is\n\nthe process that is due to protect the property interests of affected persons and has\n\ncodified the requirements in the Health and Safety Code.98 Where there is a\n\n97\n  Article 1, Section 19 of the Texas Constitution (due process).\n98\n   See Tex. Health & Safety Code Ann. §§ 361.088, 361.0665, 361.0666, 361.067, 361.079,\n361.0791, and 361.081 (relating to various application notice requirements, published notice\nrequirements, mailed notice requirements, hearing notice requirements, and contested case\nhearing requirements for MSW permit applications).\n\n                                            41\n\fstatutory right to a hearing and a right to a hearing under applicable rules, denial of\n\nthe hearing is a violation of procedural due process.99\n\n        CALH and the City’s interests should have been afforded the protection of\n\nthe permitting process. The permitting process, unlike the registration process,\n\ntriggers statutorily granted due process rights to notice and a contested case\n\nhearing by virtue of the Texas Health and Safety Code.100 Here, the issuance of a\n\nregistration when a permit was required denied members of CALH, the City, and\n\nall other affected persons their right to notice and a contested case hearing, as\n\nrequired under the Health and Safety Code for MSW permit applications.101\n\nIII.   THE REGISTRATION SHOULD BE REVERSED BECAUSE TCEQ\n       ALLOWED AN EXCESSIVE NUMBER OF NOTICES OF\n       DEFICIENCY WELL BEYOND ITS PUBLICLY PRONOUNCED\n       POLICY.\n\n       The TCEQ failed to follow its publicly stated policy controlling Notice of\n\nDeficiency (“NOD”) procedures. A NOD is sent by TCEQ to notify applicants of\n\ndeficiencies in their applications and allows them to submit additional information\n\nto address the deficiencies.

During the review, Pintail was afforded at least\n\nsix (6) separate NOD’s and two (2) extensions of time to respond to the NOD’s\n\nfrom the TCEQ.103 This is in direct conflict with the TCEQ’s previous warnings to\n\nPintail and the TCEQ policies outlined in the MSW registration process\n\ndescription, which is located in the TCEQ Sunset Evaluation Report. In its First\n\nTechnical NOD dated October 27, 2011, the TCEQ flatly warned Pintail that the\n\nTCEQ did not “anticipate granting an extension of time to fulfill this request,” and\n\nthat a “third notice of technical deficiency will not be issued.”104 The public\n\nshould be entitled to rely on the clear and unambiguous policies and directives of\n\nthe TCEQ when the TCEQ evaluates applications that could have catastrophic\n\neffects on the health, safety, and financial well being of affected parties.\n\n\n\n\n102\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 8, Item 61, p. 3–4 (Office of Public Interest Counsel’s Response\nto MTO).\n103\n    See R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Index, Items 3, 13, 16, 22, 24, 27, 32, and 39.\n104\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 2, Item 13 (NOD Letter and Policy Notice to Pintail).\n\n                                               43\n\f       Instead, Pintail got at least eleven (11) bites at the apple to supply required\n\ninformation and respond to the numerous concerns outlined by the TCEQ staff\n\nregarding this “transfer station” and recycling facility.105 As stated in the MSW\n\nRegistration No. 40259 itself, the registration request was submitted on August 1,\n\n2011, and ten (10) additional revisions were submitted on August 8, 2011, August\n\n29, 2011; November 16, 2011; January 18, 2012; March 15, 2012; May 1, 2012;\n\nMay 31, 2012; July 20, 2012; September 14, 2012, and October 18, 2012.\n\n       In the initial Technical NOD106 dated October 27, 2011, the TCEQ reviewer\n\nof the Registration Application wrote, “we do not anticipate granting an extension\n\nof time to fulfill this request. Also, please be aware a third notice of technical\n\ndeficiency will not be issued.” (emphasis added).107 The reviewer also stated in\n\nthe same correspondence that “Failure to submit a satisfactory response to each of\n\nthe noted deficiencies may result in the application being returned due to technical\n\ndeficiencies.” These statements by staff are consistent with TCEQ policies, as\n\nrecently expressed in its TCEQ Sunset Evaluation Report.108 As stated in the\n\nreport, which contains a flowchart of the MSW registration review process,\n\n\n105\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 7, Item 55, p. 6 (MSW Registration No. 40259).\n106\n    Although this Technical NOD was labeled the First Technical NOD, there was actually\ncorrespondence from the TCEQ dated August 15, 2011 that was labeled “Preliminary Review”\nasking for information to be added to the original registration request.\n107\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 2, Item 13 (NOD Letter and Policy Notice to Pintail).\n108\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 8, Item 61, p. 3–4 (citing TCEQ Sunset Self-Evaluation Report,\nSec. VII, P. 248).\n\n                                              44\n\fregistration requests are returned to the applicant after an applicant unsuccessfully\n\nresolves the Second NOD.109\n\n       The registration review process documents from 2009-2010 and 2010-\n\nCurrent reveal a consistent TCEQ instruction to its staff, applicable to all\n\nregistrants:\n\n       “Review the second NOD response. If the application still has\n       significant deficiencies, prepare a letter for the Section Manager’s\n       signature returning the application with an explanation why the\n       application is being returned. If the deficiencies are very minor in\n       nature, work with the applicant/consultant to resolve them. There are\n       no third NODs.” (second emphasis added).110\n\n       According to the registration procedures, only very minor deficiencies may\n\nbe addressed, and there are no third NODs. A consultation between the reviewer\n\nand team leader to determine the next course of actions (i.e., whether the issues are\n\neasily addressed minor issues) is consistent with the stated procedure.\n\n       Regardless of these statements and the dissonance with applicable TCEQ\n\npolicies, on December 2, 2011, an extension was granted to allow Pintail additional\n\ntime to respond to the First NOD.111 Pintail did respond on January 18, 2012, but\n\nthe response was again inadequate, as the reviewer sent another request for\n\nadditional information on February 17, 2012.112 And, even though it is labeled\n\n109\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 8, Item 58, Ex. 2 at 248.\n110\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 8, Item 65, Ex. 1, p. 3 of registration procedures document\n(CALH’s Reply to Responses to Motion to Overturn).\n111\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 2, Item 16.\n112\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 4, Item 22.\n\n                                            45\n\f“First Technical Notice of Deficiency,” the letter is clearly an indication that\n\nPintail did not submit a satisfactory response to each of the noted deficiencies in\n\nthe first technical notice of deficiency.         As such, it appears the Registration\n\nApplication should have been returned at this time. However, not only was the\n\nApplication not returned, Pintail was granted yet another extension to respond to\n\nthe Third Technical NOD.113 Despite the statements from TCEQ staff that there\n\nwould not be more than two (2) NOD’s, this pattern continued for a total of at least\n\nsix (6) NOD’s.114\n\n       The registration should have been returned after Pintail’s failure to address\n\nTCEQ’s concerns in the Second NOD, in accordance with the TCEQ’s policy and\n\nthe TCEQ staff’s statements. Allowing Pintail to continue to inadequately respond\n\nto more than two (2) Technical NOD’s is a departure from the stated policy, and\n\nshould not be allowed by the Commission.                    For this reason alone, the\n\nCommission’s approval of MSW Registration No. 40259 is marred by abuse of\n\ndiscretion, unlawful procedure, and unreasonable errors of law.                Accordingly,\n\nissuance of the registration should be reversed.\n\n       The TCEQ has argued that it is entitled to publicly pronounce its policy\n\n\n113\n    R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 5, Item 24. Interestingly, this Technical NOD was not given a\nnumber (nor were the two subsequent NODs of June 25, 2012 and August 16, 2012, given a\nnumber), but by our count it is actually the Fourth NOD when you count the “Preliminary\nReview”.\n114\n    See R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Index, Items 3, 13, 16, 22, 24, 27, 32, and 39.\n\n                                             46\n\fcontrolling NOD procedures, yet not follow that policy because it is not\n\nincorporated into TCEQ rules.115 Appellants respectfully disagree. The TCEQ\n\nshould be bound to follow its public pronouncements.                            Without such a\n\nrequirement, the public will lose trust in their state environmental regulators. Here,\n\nthe Registration Application should have been returned to Pintail after the\n\nunsuccessful resolution of the Second NOD. Instead, Pintail received six (6)\n\nseparate NOD’s resulting in eleven (11) different versions of the Registration\n\nApplication. The TCEQ’s refusal to follow its own publicly pronounced NOD\n\npolicy harmed CALH and its members, harmed the City, and harmed the public of\n\nTexas.       Such refusal was an abuse of discretion, unlawful procedure, and an\n\nunreasonable error of law, and accordingly, was invalid, arbitrary, or unreasonable.\n\nFor this reason, Appellants respectfully request that registration of this Facility be\n\nreversed by the Court.\n\n\n\n\n115\n      R.R. at Joint Ex. 1, AR Vol. 7, Item 53, p. 8 (Response to Comment 10).\n\n                                                 47\n\f                                     PRAYER\n\n      TCEQ acted in violation of its own rules and policies, and in abrogation of\n\nthe due process rights of affected persons, in granting the Registration Application\n\nand issuing Registration No. 40259. Therefore, CALH and the City respectfully\n\npray that the trial court's Judgment affirming the TCEQ’s action be reversed, and\n\nthat Court reverse, or suspend and set aside, the Registration and remand this\n\nmatter to TCEQ for further proceedings consistent with this Court’s opinion.\n\nCALH and the City further pray for all other and further relief, both general and\n\nspecial, at law and in equity, to which they may be justly entitled.\n\n                                       Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                       HANCE SCARBOROUGH, LLP\n                                       400 W. 15th Street, Ste. 950\n                                       Austin, TX 78701\n                                       Telephone: (512) 479-8888\n                                       Facsimile: (512) 482-6891\n\n                                       By: _______________________\n                                         Terry L.

They-may accept most types of household and\n       putrescible waste. Type IV landfills may accept brush, construction and\n       demolition waste, and rubbish, but may not accept household or putrescible\n       waste. Household waste is defined as:\n                  Any solid waste (including garbage, trash, and\n                  sanitaiywaste in septic tanks) derived from\n                  households (including single and multiple residences,\n                  hotels and motels, bunkhouses, ranger stations, crew\n                  quarters, campgrounds, picnic grounds, and day-use\n                  recreation areas); does not include brush.\n                  [30 TAC 330.3(64)]\n        Putrescible waste is defined as:\n             Organic wastes, such as garbage, wastewater treatment\n             plant sludge, and grease trap waste, that are capable of\n             being decomposed by microorganisms with sufficient\n             rapidity as to cause odors or gases or are capable of\n             providing food for or attracting birds, animals, and disease\n             vectors.

To operate as an arid exempt landfill, the facility must\n        first be authorized by the TCEQ in accordance with 30 TAC 330.5(b). To\n        qualify as such, an arid-exempt (AE) landfill must:\n        \"' Accept less than 20 tons per day, based on an annual average of\n            authorized waste in either a Type I-AE or Type IV-AE landfill unit (a\n            discrete area: of land or excavation that receives waste).

EPA publications on waste can be found at\n                             <www.epa.gov/wastes/inforesources/pubs/ >. Some of the principal\n                             methods for cutting costs are changing the frequency of collections,\n                             improving routing, and using automated equipment.\n\n\n                      Transportation\n                      (30 TAC 330, Subchapter C)\n                             MSW transporters are regulated by 30 TAC 330, Subchapter C. It is the\n                             transporter's responsibility to ensure that waste is delivered to a facility\n                             that is authorized to accept that type of waste. Transporters must maintain\n                             records for a minimum of three years, which document? that each load of\n                             waste was taken to an authorized MSW facility.

Money is saved by storing waste at a facility\n                              before transporting it to its final disposal destination. A few large-volume\n                              trucks then take the waste to the final disposal facility, rather than\n                              nIDnerous small trucks traveling the distance-saving both fuel and labor.\n                              There are various consolidation options, including transfer stations and\n                              citizen collection stations. Depending on size of the population served or the\n                              volume of waste handled, your facility may require authorization from the\n                              TCEQ, ranging from notification to permit. Authorization requirements for\n                              each consolidation option are covered later in this document.\n\n\n\n\n                        4                                                                                                July2013\n                                                                                                                                    423\n\fTCEQ publication Pub. No. RG-469   Traditional Municipal Solid Waste Disposal; A Guide for local Governments\n\n\n\n\n       In areas of the state that are underserved by waste-collection services or do·\n       not have access to proper disposal facilities, funds may be available to study\n       the feasibility of a waste consolidation facility. Contact your local council of\n       governments (COG) to determine whether there are grants available for this\n       kind of study.\n\n       Transfer Stations\n       A transfer station is defined at 30 TAC 330.3(157) as:\n                  A facility used for transferring solid waste from\n                  collection vehicles to long-haul ve4icles (one\n                  transportation unit to another transportation unit). It\n                  is not a storage facility such as one where individual\n                  residents can dispose of their wastes in bulk storage\n                  containers that are serviced by collection vehicles.\n        Transfer facilities offer an alternative when the landfill is so far away\n        that it is not economical for each waste-collection vehicle to make\n        round trips. Transfer stations allow local waste haulers to temporarily store.\n        waste and then use large-volume trucks to haul waste to the distant landfill.\n        Though transfer stations save money, they have their uwn operating\n        expenses. It is important to determine whether a transfer facility would\n        be cost effective. The EPA's Waste Transfer Station: A Manual for\n        Decision Making (EPA 530-R-02-002) can help local governments with\n        cost analysis .\n       . .Operating a transfer station :typically requires. a registration or a permit...\n          However, small communities may be able to establish low-volume transfer\n          stations with just a notification. To qualify for this type of authorization, the\n          community must control the facility, comply with local ordinances, notify\n          adjacent landowners, and haul collected waste to a final disposal facility at\n          least weekly. A low-volume transfer station may store, at most, 40 cubic\n          yards of waste.\n         To start a low-volume transfer station, a local government\n         must submit a Notice ofintent to Operate a Low-Volume Transfer\n         Station (Form TCEQ-20370). TCEQ forms can be found at\n         <WWW. tceq.texas.gov/search_forms.html>.\n         Transfer stations that cannot meet the 40-cubic-yard limit vvill have to\n         obtain either a registration or a permit. To be eligible for registration as a\n         transfer station, the facility must meet one of the follmv:ing criteria:\n         \" It serves a municipality,;.vith a population of fewer than 50,000.\n         a    It serves a county ·with a population of fewer than 85,000.\n\n\n\n  July 2013                                                                                                    5\n                                                                                                                   424\n\fTraditional Municipal Solid Waste Disposal: A Guide for Local Governme11is   TCEQ publication Pub.

See the \"Reports'~ section of this document,\n           under \"Additional Requirements.\"\n\n           Citizen Collection Stations\n           A second waste-consolidation option, used when door-to-door waste pickup\n           service is not cost effective, is a citizen collection station (CCS). CCSs are\n           temporary holding facilities where residents can take their household waste\n           for storage until it can be transported to an MSW disposal facility. The\n           collection facility should be located in an area that is convenient and easily\n           accessible. It gives a community the ability to conveniently and legally\n           dispose of household waste.\n           CCSs are regulated by 30 TAC 330.n(e) and 330.213.

The\n           containers provided at the facility should be compatible with the type and\n           quantity of household waste accepted. To prevent illegal dumping, you\n           should post rules governing the use of the CCS facility (including who may\n           use it and what may or may not be deposited), collect waste on a scheduled\n           basis, and-if possible-have an on-site operator supervising the facility.\n           CCSs must follow the same standards as landfills for safety, prevention of\n           scavenging, and control of litter and odor.\n\n\n Operations\n (30 TAC 330, Subchapter D)\n            All registered or permitted MSVv disposal facilities must follow the site\n            operating plan (SOP) designed and approved specifically for that site.

Local governments can take a proactive approach to\n        managing these wastes-planning saves both labor and landfill capacity.\n        As you develop your recycling or disposal strategy, you can determine\n        whether your cleanup will generate revenue or cost money. If your cleanup\n        is not properly budgeted, your local government may be stuck with\n        materials that it cannot properly dispose of or recycle. Stockpiling materials\n        without the prospect of recycling them could be considered abandonment,\n        plus it increases your risk of creating nuisance conditions.\n\n\n Waste from Disposal of Nuisance and Abandoned Buildings\n         [30 TAC 330.7(i)]\n         Counties or municipalities with 12,000 or fewer people. may obtain a permit\n         by rule (PBR) to dispose of demolition waste from properties with nuisance\n         or abandoned buildings. The PBR applies to buildings that have been\n         acquired by a county or municipality by bankruptcy, tax delinquency, or\n         condemnation. Disposal can only occur on land that is owned or controlled\n         by the county or municipality, and that receives 25 inches average annual\n         rainfall or less.\n         To claim this PBR, contact the MSW Permits Section for a simple\n         application form. You must submit the form to the TCEQ, and the agency\n         must acknowledge receipt, before you begin construction of the disposal\n         site.

To have a successful event, you must plan each component of the\n                      cleanup-from acceptance to final disposal-well in advance.\n                      A permit, registration, notification, or other authorization is not required\n                      for a collection point for wastes collected and received in sealed plastic bags\n                      from such activities as periodic citywide cleanup campaigns and cleanup of\n                      rights-of-way or roadside parks.\n                       One of the major priorities of a public collection event is to arrange for final\n                       disposal of every waste stream before the collection date. If waste remains\n                       at the collection area for an extended period of time, it creates ai1 \"out-of-\n                       sight, out-of-mind'' mentality and promotes illegal dumping. Ideally, all\n                       wastes should be removed immediately following the event or as soon as\n                       possible to avoid the creation and maintenance of a nuisance, or the\n                       endangerment of human health or the environment. Options for final\n                       disposal include recycling, composting, and using landfills. With each\n                       option, you should consider several basic questions:\n\n...... .. . .......

If your local government\n         would like an exception, you will need to meet specific requirements and\n         obtain approval from the appropriate TCEQ regional office before doing\n         any burning. You -will also need to check local ordinances or other\n         regulations about outdoor burning.

Texas is a big state;\n        some options may not be practical for all areas. You should develop a plan\n        for the transport, storage, processing, and disposal of various forms of\n        storm debris. This should include identification of suitable sites to\n        temporarily store, segregate, or process large amounts of debris following a\n        disaster. You should consider requesting that residents set appliances,\n        household hazardous waste, brush, construction debris, and putrescible\n        wastes in separate piles for pickup after a storm. Tell contract haulers to\n        maintain separation of materials during the collection, transport, and\n        storage of storm debris to maximize your options for recycling waste and\n        minimize waste-disposal costs. Before designing your plan, you should\n         consider the following:\n\n        Available landfill space\n         \" Where is the closest landfill?\n         \" What is its disposal capacity?\n         \" What types of waste does it accept?\n\n         Recycling options\n         ..

The city or county often becomes responsible for the collection\n       and disposal of the trash left at an illegal dump site. The labor and disposal\n       costs associated-with these sites can eat away at a local government's\n       budget. To help combat illegal dumping in your community, see the TCEQ's\n       Prevent Illegal Dumping: A Guide for Local Governments (RG-455).\n\n\n Don't Mess with Texas Water\n          The Don't Mess -with Texas Water program offers local governments\n          another tool to help prevent illegal dumping.

No. RG-469\n\n\n\n\nWater Regulations\n        Wastewater\n        To protect the waters of the state, all MSW facilities must comply with the\n        Texas Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (TPDES). Any liquids that\n        the facility produces must be disposed of in a manner that will not cause\n        surface water or groundwater pollution. You should determine how to\n        handle. any wastewater that your operation creates, such as vehicle wash\n        water or water that has come into contact with waste. With the wastewater\n        system's approval, your wastewater may be discharged to the local sanitary\n        sewer. To disch:n:ge directly into the waters of Texas, your facility must have\n        a TPDES permit.\n\n        Stormwater\n        To prevent stormwater from being contaminated with solid waste, landfills\n        must obtain a stormwater permit. You can get coverage through either the\n        Multi-Sector General Permit No. TXR.050000 or an individual permit. The\n        application process for the general permit is much simpler, less expensive,\n        and less time-consuming than that for an individual permit.\n        To apply for the general permit, you must:\n        o    develop a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWP3) and\n         e   file the Notice of Intent (Form TCEQ-10382) with the TCEQ.\n\n         Templates to help you develop an SWP3 are available online at\n        · <www;tceq.texas.gov/assistance/water/sw-industrial.html>\n         For assistance on obtaining coverage and meeting the requirements of the\n         permit, contact the TCEQ's Small Business and Local Government\n         Assistance Section at 800-447-2827.\n\n\n Ai!·~Pollution          Control\n         Landfill Air Authorizations\n         MSW facilities are required to have applicable air authorizations based on\n         the activities _at the site. There are three categories of air authorizations for\n         MSW sites: permit by rule (PBR), stand:n:d permit, or a new source review\n         case-by-case permit.\n         The simplest, least expensive, and least time-consuming air authorization to\n         obtain is the PBR106.534, Municipal Solid Waste Landfills and Transfer\n         Stations. This air authorization is for cell Oandfill-unit) construction and\n         activities related to waste disposal; it is not intended for other activities.

When claiming a PBR\n       106.534 air authorization, your facility must follow the requirements in 30\n       TAC 106.534 and 30 TAC 330, Subchapter U.\n       If a landfill operation cannot meet the requirements of PBR 106.534, then\n       the MSW air standard permit may be required. Depending on the level of\n       activity at the landfill, a general operating permit may be required. To\n       determine what level of permit is required for your facility, see the reference\n       guide for reviewers of air permits, Municipal Solid Waste Landfills\n       (MSWLF) and Transfer Stations (PDF), at\n       <wi..vw.tceq.state. tx.us/ goto /mswlf>.\n\n        Additional Air Authorizations\n        MSW facilities using PBR 106.534 may conduct activities that require\n        additional air authorizations.

In addition, the state tracks the available disposal capacity for future\n         waste. It is important that the facility operator submit the required report\n         by the due date. Late reports are sufficient cause for the TCEQ to revoke a\n         permit or registration.\n\n\n\n\n  July 2013                                                                                                '117   436\n\fTraditional Municipal Solid Waste Disposal: A Guide for local Governments    TCEQ publication Pub.

For quarterly reporting, the waste accepted is reported as it was\n        recorded at the gate,. whether compacted/uncompacted tons or compacted/\n        uncompacted cubic yards. For annual reporting, the total waste accepted\n        must be reported in tons; if you use volumetric measurements in your\n        facility's records, you can convert them to short tons.\n\n        Small Community Equivalent Factor\n        If your landfill or h·ansfer station serves. fewer than 5,000 people, you may\n        use a population-equivalent factor instead of mail!]:aining records of the\n        actual amount of waste deposited. Under this system, the amount of waste\n        is calculated as 1 ton per person a year. The report must document the\n        population served by the facility and reflect any changes in population since\n        the previous report.\n\n        Quarterly Report:\n        You must submit a quarterly solid-waste summary report to the TCEQ no\n        later than 20 days following the end of each fiscal quarter.

The\n       amount may be raised or lowered in accordance with spending levels\n       authorized by the Texas Legislature. The TCEQ calculates the fee using\n       information from the facility's quarterly solid-waste summary reports. We\n       will generate a billing statement quarterly and forward it to the applicable\n       pe'rmittee or registrant. For additional information, see Municipal Solid\n       Waste Reporting and Disposal Fee (RG-289).\n\n\n Statewide and Regional Planning\n        Each council of governments develops a regional solid waste plan. The\n        TCEQ aids the COGs in their efforts to ensure proper waste management by\n        permitting and registering facilities, licensing operators, and requiring all\n        registered or permitted facility operators to report the types and amounts of\n        waste processed or disposed of at a facility. COGs can use the information\n        reported to the TCEQ to monitor capacity in their regions .\n\n       .. .COG Permit Review\n        After the TCEQ conducts an administrative revie1v of each MSW permit\n        application, the application is forwarded to the appropriate COG for review.\n        The COG's review considers the compatibility of the proposed facility with\n        the region's MSW plan, along vvith the viability of the proposed facility and\n        the need for it.\n\n         COG Solid Waste Grants\n         As part of its waste planning efforts, the TCEQ administers a Regional Solid\n         v\\Taste Grants Program, which supports regional planning of solid-waste\n         management by the state's 24 regional COGs, as well as a pass-through\n         grant program administered by the COGs to fund regional and local solid-\n         waste management projects.

We conduct routine inspections on an\n        established timeline using standardized checklists, and you can request a\n        copy of the applicable checklist before the inspection. However, if there are\n        consumer complaints~ operational problems, or :requests for assistance, or if\n        the facility is an unsatisfactory verformer, we may inspect inore frequently.\n        Immediately after the inspection, the TCEQ investigator will go over the\n        findings in an exit interview. Then you will receive from us one of three\n        mailed letters: a compliance letter, if there were no violations found; a\n        notice of violation (NOV) ·with a compliance schedule to resolve the\n        violations; o:r a notice of enforcement, if violations are of a serious enough\n        nature to warrant automatic enforcement.\n        We may begin formal enforcement if you have not resolved the violations\n        after issuance of an NOV and you have not requested a justifiable extension.\n        If you receive an NOV, be certain to respond in writing within the time\n        stated in the letter, explaining your actions to resolve any violations, and\n        including pictures if possible.

It explains what the exemption is, what is\nneeded to qualify, and how owners or operators of facilities may apply for and utilize the exemption.\nSeveral examples are also presented. Terms used in this document have the meanings assigned by\nTexas Health and Safety Code, Chapter 361, and 30 TAC Chapters              33.Q, and·™·\n\n\nWhat is the Source-Separated Recycling Permit Exemption?\n\nThe source-separated recycling permit exemption, described in                        allows qualifying\nMSW transfer facilities to operate under a registration instead of a permit. It was established by\na rule amendment, published in the April 9, 2004, issue of the Texas Register, volume 29,\npages 3634-3640. This provision to operate under a registration instead of a permit is distinct\nfrom other provisions for registration of a transfer facility based on the population of the area\nserved, waste acceptance rate, and location within a permitted facility (30 TAC ;:>J.~:.;::Ll_~J\n\nWhat Are the Basic Eligibility Requirements for the Exemption?\n\nMaterials Recovery\n\n30 TAC            allows owners and operators of MSW Type V transfer facilities to register their\noperations instead of permitting them, provided:\n\n          •    The transfer facility recovers 10 percent or more by weight or weight equivalent of the\n               incoming waste stream for reuse or recycling;\n\n          •    Incoming waste has already been reduced by at least 10 percent through a\n               source-separation recycling program; or\n\n          e    The transfer facility owner and/or operator also operate(s) one or more source-separation\n               recycling programs in the county where the transfer facility is located and those\n               source-separation recycling programs manage a total weight or weight equivalent of\n               recyclable materials equal to 10 percent or more by weight or weight equivalent of the total\n               incoming waste stream to all transfer facilities that the person owns or operates under the\n               exemption.\n\nDistance to Landfill\n\nThe owner or operator of the transfer facility must demonstrate in the registration application that\nit will transfer the remaining nonrecyclable waste to a landfill not more than 50 miles from the\nfacility.\n\n\nGuidelines for Source-Separated Recycling Permit Exemption (rev. 06/19/06)                      Page 1 of 5\n\n                                                                                                              443\n\fWhat Other Requirements Apply to a Facility Operating under the Exemption?\n\nOperational Requirements\n\nA Type V transfer facility operating under the exemption must comply with applicable operational\nrequirements for MSW storage and processing units detail in 30 TAC Chapter 330, Subchapter E.\n\nDocumentation (Recordkeeping)\n\nAfter transfer facility operations commence, documentation of the recycling or recovery of at least\n10 percent of waste material from the waste stream (at the transfer facility, and/ or by the\nsource-separation recycling program(s)), must be annually updated and maintained at the transfer\nfacility for records inspection. Failure to maintain the standard of at least 10 percent recovery of\nmaterials shall be grounds for revocation of the registration.\n\nReporting\n\nA Type V transfer facility operating under the exemption must also provide reports in accordance\nwith 30 TAC §330.671(b)(3).\n\nRecycling and Composting Facilities\n\nAll recycling and composting facilities must comply with applicable requirements of 30 TAC\nChapter 328 (Waste Minimization and Recycling) and Chapter 332 (Composting), as well as all\nother applicable laws and regulations, including maintaining records to demonstrate that the\nmaterials recovered (including compost derived from those materials) were reused or recycled.\n\nHow May Owners or Operators of Facilities Apply for and Utilize the Exemption?\n\nOwners or operators wishing to utilize the exemption must register their facilities in accordance\nwith 30 TAC Chapter 330,                 (relating to Permit and Registration Application\nProcedures).\n\nAn applicant must demonstrate in a registration application the methods that will be used to\nmeasure amounts of waste and recycled materials handled and to assure and document that the\nrecycling requirement is achieved. The procedures and methods should be contained in the Site\nOperating Plan (SOP) or placed in a Recycling Plan as an attachment to the SOP. Owners or\noperators of existing registered facilities may modify the facility SOP pursuant to 30 TAC\nChapter 305, §305.70, to include the methods and procedures needed to utilize the exemption,\nprovided there is no increase in the daily maximum limit of waste acceptance.

A facility expects to receive 5,000 tons of municipal solid waste (MSW) in an\n             average month from a combination of residential and commercial customers.\n\n             The owner or operator of this facility also operates a curbside, source-separation\n             recycling program in the same county in which the transfer facility is located, but\n             not necessarily within any part of the area served by the exempt transfer station.\n             The curbside recycling program takes in about 300 tons of glass and plastic bottles,\n             metals cans, and newspapers that are sold to a recycling company, and 500 tons of\n             yard trimmings that are taken to a compost facility where they are processed. The\n             finished compost is used in mulching oflandscape in and around municipal facilities,\n             given free to customers of the waste service operator, and the rest sold to others.\n\n             The 300 + 500 = 800 tons of materials taken in by the curbside recycling program\n             and sold to a recycler or delivered to a compost facility (and compost used)\n             represents 800 / 5000, or 16 percent (by weight) of the waste stream incoming to the\n             exempt transfer facility. The required records were kept and are available for\n             inspection, enabling the facility to demonstrate that it met its obligation.\n\n\nGuidelines for Source-Separated Recycling Permit Exemption (rev. 06/19/06)              Page 5 of 5\n\n                                                                                                      447\n\fAPPENDIX E\n\f                                       .ece ived                                                         Ju I 26 2012 .   ·Tam\nJDl-26-2012 THU 08:48 AN                                                                            FAX NO,                                       P. 02\n\n                                                   ALLISON, BASS & ASSOClA 'rES, L.L..P.\n                                                              ~~aX~.\n                                                             A. 0, WATSONHOU&E\nJAMES I'.

Tex. Health & Safely Code § 363.002.

Piiitail apparently has not responded to this\n\n      latest \"Notice of Deficiency. See http://wwv,:.biggsandmathews,corn/pennits.php. Accordingly .\n\n      nearly one year after filing its initial Transfer Station Registration Application, Pintail has still\n\n      not submitted an Dpplication that meets the roJevant statutory and ad.ministrntive criteria. As\n\n      sr1ch, the Exerntive Director cannot cletennine the application is tech11foally complete and cannot\n\n      take action 011 it. Therefore, Pintail still has not filed a Transfer Station registration application\n\n      that is ac1;ually pending before the Commission.\n\n                                                               rrr.\n                             Pintail's Proposed Applications Should be Denied\n\n              For tl1e .reasons stated above, it is undisputed that Pintail was unprepared to file\n\n      administratively or technically complete applications for the Proposed Laudfi!J permit or\n\n      Transfer Station registration at the time ihat the Waller County Commissioners Court enacted its\n\n      solid waste Ordinance. Pintail sought to initiate the bifurcated permit application, after it became\n\n       aware that the Waller Cotmiy Commissioners Court was considering enacting an ordina11ce that\n\n       would prohibit solid waste processing and disposal at its proposed site.                        Pintail hoped that it\n\n       could claim that it had a pennit \"app!icaiion\" pending before the Commission when Waller\n\n       Cmmty's Ordinance was enacted. \"Nevertheless, this effort to subvet1 Waller Cotmty's statutory\n\n       authority to regi.tlate solid waste processing aud disposal was un.successfol.\n\n              Pintail did not submit its proposed.

As stich, Piniail had no application pending before the\n\n     Commission when the Ordimu1ce became effective. It is, thus, tmlawfol to operate such' facilities\n\n     in the aieas proposed by Pi11tail. Therefore, the Commission may not grant any applications\n\n     from Pintail to process or dispose of municipal or indt1strial solid waste Jn Waller County at the\n\n     proposed site,\n\n             The Texas Health and Safety Code, Section 363.112 of the Comprehensive Solid Waste\n\n     Act and Section 364.012 of the County Solid Waste Control Act, crumot be construed to prohibit\n\n     a couniy from enacting solid waste legislation where a :person simply mails an incomplete solid\n\n     waste application to tlie Commission. Such a detennination would be contrary to tl1e plain\n\n      language of the applicable statutes and adrnin.islrative code prnvisions. Such prov:isi ons provide\n\n     that a partial applicaiion for a land-use detemrinatfon does not constitute a request that ilie\n\n      Commission autliorize a permit for the operation of a municipal solid waste facUiiy. It merely\n\n      requests the Commission to determine whether such a facility would be acceptable at a particular\n\n      location, on the basis of land-use only. Any response from the Commission in response to the\n\n      partial applicaii.on would be merely prelimimuy to the filing of 111<:i full application.         A\n\n      substantive review of a perrnlt application cl!llnot begin until all parts of the application are\n\n      st1bmitted and detennined by the ExeclltiVe Director to be admllustmtive]y complete, Further, the\n\n      Commission's rules provide that the Executive Director cannot take action on any application\n\n      un(i] he has determined that they are tech11icaDy complete.\n\n             Construing a partial application for a land-use only determination or a deficient Transfer\n\n      Station registration application as an actual pe1mit application pending before the Co=nssion\n\n      would also contravene the rules of statutory construction. Jn enacting Sections 363.112 and\n\n      364.012, it is presmned that a just and reasonable result is i11teuded, and tl1at public interest is\n\n      favored over any private interest. Tex.

As !h\\s is a matter of\n\n      public   intere~t,   the statutes prescribe that solid waste ordinan,aes be publicized and that public\n\n      interest be considered before they are enacted. The provisions h1 these statutes limiting solid\n\n      waste prohibitions in areas where permit applications are pen.diDg before the Commission do not\n\n      favor a private i!1terest over a public interest.                Consequently, these statutes should not be\n\n      construed to allow a private aDtor to subvert the legislative authority of a commissioners 0011rt by\n\n      filing documents with the Commission that in substance are merely a request for a deterrn.ination\n\n      about land-use, and wholly fail to meet the relevant statutory and administrative criteria for an\n\n      application for a solid waste facility. The consequence of such a constructiou would endorse the\n\n      filing of sham applications in efforts to avoid the rule of law.\n\n                                                                IV.\n                                                          Conclusion\n               For these reasons, Waller County requests 1l1at the Executive Director determine that the\n\n      Waller County Commissioners Court enacted its Ordinance on August 26, 2011, exercising the\n\n      foll authority confon·ed on !he County under Sections 363.112 and 364.012 of the Texail Health\n\n       and Safety Code, to prohibit the processing and disposal of solid waste in oortain areas of Waller\n\n       Count9. At the time the Ordinance was enacted, Pintail did not have a permit application for its\n\n       Proposed Landfill or a registration application for its proposed Tral)sfer Station pending before\n\n       Commission.

Waller\n          County requested an expedited decision on this Request. On July 31, 2012, we received a letter from\n          the Chief Clerk, Bridget C. Bohac, stating that \"our comments will be considered by the staff prior to\n          the final decision on the application.\"\n                   As previously requested, we seek a determination that the Waller County Ordinance prohibits\n          the processing aµd disposal of solid waste at tbe proposed Pintail site. Further, we request that YDL!\n          detem1ine that Pintail failed to submit applications that met the relevant statL~tory and administrative\n          criteria before the adoption of the county ordinance. Therefore, further considoration of these\n          applications by the TCEQ is unnecessary as Pintail cannot obtain the requisite permit and\n          registration, as a matter oflaw. Waller County re-Urges its request for an expedited decision on these\n          matters.\n                  Thank you for your time and attention to the matter.

Introduction\n\n          Our firm represents Citizens Against the Landfill in Hempstead (\"CALH\") in\n\nthe above-referenced matters.          CALH is an organization with over 400 members\n\ncomprised of Waller County landowners, residents, business owners, and many\n\nother affected parties who have legitimate reasons to oppose the above-referenced\n\nregistration as well as the larger proposed landfill facility that encompasses the\n\nproposed transfer and recycling facility.          Several of CALH's members own land,\n\nreside, and work adjacent to the proposed \"transfer station\" .and landfill site. We\n\nunderstand that the application of Pintail Landfill, L.L.C. for TCEQ Type I MSW\n\nFacility Proposed Permit No. 2377 (landfill permit) is also under review by the\n\n\n\n     111 Congress Avenue, Suite 500 ·Austin, TX 78701- Tel: (512) 479-8888 ·Fax: (512) 482-6891\n                                   Other Offices - Washington, D.C.\n\fPage2\n\n\n        TCEQ, which proposes to include the Type V transfer station registration and\n\n        recycling center within the landfill facility.\n\n               Thousands of comments and hearing requests have already been filed\n\n        regarding the landfill permit and this registration. We hereby include and reiterate\n\n        all other comments in opposition to the landfill application and transfer station\n\n        registration stated in the TCEQ records for both matters, and on behalf of CALH\n\n        and its members, we hereby formally request the Type V transfer station\n\n        registration (New Municipal Solid Waste Facility Registration Application No.\n\n        40259) be denied. In the alternative, we respectfully request that the matter be\n\n        consolidated with the consideration of the proposed Pintail Landfill Permit\n\n        Application for the MSW facility that is to be located at the same site as the facility\n\n        that is the subject of this registration (J\\1SW Facility Proposed Permit No. 2377).\n\n              As adjacent landowners and neighboring businesses, CALH's members will\n\n        be adversely affected by the proposed landfill and transfer station in a manner not\n\n        common to members of the general public. Due to their close proximity, these\n\n        individuals and families will be adversely impacted by the increased truck traffic\n\n        traveling to and from the proposed trash facilities, will be impacted by the nuisance\n\n        odors and wind-blown trash emanating from the trash operations, and will face a\n\n        real threat to quantity and quality of their drinking water that comes from the\n\n        shallow aquifer that lies beneath the proposed facilities. These members rely on\n\n        this aquifer as their sole source of drinking water, and the trash facilities are\n\n        proposed to be situated on the sandy recharge zone of this aquifer. Additionally,\n\fPage 3\n\n\n\n         those members of CALH living downstream from the proposed trash facilities on\n\n         Clear Creek will be impacted by the pollution and potential flooding caused by the\n\n         increased runoff containing contaminants from the trash facilities.\n\n         II.    Summary\n\n                In summary, CALH comments that the proposed Transfer Station must be\n\n         permitted, not just registered, under the applicable rules.                 The registration\n\n         application plainly states that the applicant is not just requesting a transfer\n\n         station, but rather, is seeking a recycling facility. 1 Therefore, a mere registration is\n\n         inadequate and TCEQ should deny the registration application. Even if TCEQ were\n\n         to consider the application, a registration for a waste separation/recycling facility\n\n         can only be considered after a final decision is rendered on the pending Pintail\n\n         MSW landfill application at the same location.             Therefore, consideration of the\n\n         registration application at this time is premature,. and would violate TCEQ rules.\n\n         Additionally, the Applicant failed to supplement its application with the crucial fact\n\n         that there is a County Ordinance prohibiting disposal of waste at the proposed\n\n         location. The County Ordinance was passed soon afterthe registration application\n\n         was filed, and Pintail has failed to satisfy the obligation to supplement its\n\n         application to correct this inaccuracy. Finally, this registration application should\n\n         have already been returned to the applicant. Even with all the above-referenced\n\n         defects, the Applicant has been afforded five (5) separate Technical Notices of\n\n\n         1 \"Pintail Landfill, LLC expects to begin a C&D waste recycling and transfer operation prior to\n         commencement of landfill operations.\" See Exhibit 1: Registration Application, Part 1 Fmm - Part\n         I, page I-1.\n\fPage 4\n\n\n         Deficiency (NODs) and two (2) extensions of time to respond to the NO D's from the\n\n         TCEQ. This is in direct conflict with the TCEQ's previous warnings to the applicant\n\n         and the TCEQ policies outlined in the MSW Registration Application Process\n\n         description, which is located in the TCEQ Sunset Evaluation Report. In its First\n\n         Technical NOD dated October 27, 2011, the TCEQ flatly warned the applicant that\n\n         the TCEQ did not \"anticipate granting an extension of time to fulfill this request\",\n\n         and that a \"third notice of technical deficiency will not be issued.\" How many bites\n\n         of the apple does Pintail get to adequately respond to the numerous concerns\n\n         outlined by the TCEQ staff regarding this proposed \"transfer station\" and recycling\n\n         facility?   For these reasons, and for all other reasons raised by commenters on the\n\n         Pintail Transfer Facility Registration Application and the Pintail Landfill\n\n         Application,   we respectfully request that the TCEQ summarily deny the\n\n         registration application.   In the alternative, we request that the TCEQ consolidate\n\n         this registration request with the consideration of the pending landfill permit\n\n         application, and abstain from considering this registration until after a final\n\n         decision is rendered on the pending Pintail MSW landfill application at the same\n\n         location, in accordance with TCEQ rules.\n\n         HI.    A Permit (Not a Mere Registration) Is Required to Operate the\n                Proposed \"Transfer Facility,\" Which Is Actually A Recycling\n                Processing Facility. Because No Permit Application Was Filed,\n                TCEQ Should Deny the Registration Application.\n\n                30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.7 requires a permit for any activity of storage,\n\n         processing, removal, or disposal of any solid waste, except as provided by § 330.9\n\fPage 5\n\n\n         (and a few other sections that do not apply here). A recycling facility may .only be\n\n         authorized through registration at a permitted MSVV facility owned by the permitee.\n\n         30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.9(c).             In other words, a recycling facility reqmres a\n\n         separate permit when there is no existing MSW permit.\n\n                 In this case, the Applicant seeks a registration for a recycling facility when\n\n         there is no existing MSW permit. 2 Such an application is illegal under TCEQ rules.\n\n         Under the applicable rule, § 330.9(c), the Applicant is required to seek a permit for\n\n         a processing facility that performs waste-separation/recycling activities.\n\n                 Making matters worse, the Applicant seeks to circumvent the required\n\n         permitting process by incorporating its unauthorized recycling application into a\n\n         registration for a transfer facility.s          Transfer facilities, recycling facilities, and\n\n         waste-separation/recycling facilities are each different under the rules. 4 Each type\n\n         of facility presents different environmental challenges and consequences.\n\n\n\n         z The registration application states, \"A permit application for the Pintail Landfill (Proposed Permit\n         No. MSW-2377) has been filed with TCEQ and is currently pending. Requests for authorizations to\n         operate the composting and C&D facilities in conjunction with the Pintail Landfill will be submitted.\n         However, in order to meet expected demand and to initiate a market for incoming C&D waste\n         materials, Pintail Landfill, LLC expects to begin a C&D waste recycling and transfer operation prior\n         to coniniencenient of landfill operations. This registration application, is being subniitted to obtain\n         authorization for this initial phase C&D waste recycling and transfer operation to be conducted on\n         the same site on which the Pintail Landfill will eventually be developed. It is anticipated that the\n         C&D waste recycling and transfer facility will operate for no more than five years pursuant to this\n         registration and that subsequent C&D waste processing and recycling will be conducted under\n         further authorizations.\" See Exhibit 1: Registration Application, Part 1 Form - Part I, page I-1\n         (emphasis added).\n         ' See id.; see also 30 Tex.

This type of\n\n         transfer operation is not what the Applicant seeks, as described in the application.\n\n                 There are real-life environmental consequences when the permitting process\n\n         is circumvented.       The process exists to protect the environment and the public.\n\n         Here, it is the members of CALH and the environment that stand to lose if this\n\n         registration application is granted. The rules are clear-a permit is required. The\n\n         Applicant impermissibly seeks to operate an unpermitted recycling facility under\n\n         the registration process. For this reason alone, the TCEQ should summarily deny\n\n         the Transfer Station Application, which is illegal under applicable rules.\n\n         IV.    If TCEQ Considers Applicant's Illegal Registration Application, the\n                MSW Landfill Application Must Be Considered Before Taking Action\n                on the Registration Application\n\n                As previously discussed, waste separation/recycling facilities require a\n\n         separate permit when there is no existing MSW permit. 30 Tex. Admin. Code §\n\n         330.7 (requiring a permit); 30 Tex. Admin.

Therefore, the Pintail Registration\n\n         Application, which includes recycling activities, cannot be considered without first\n\n         making a final determination on Pintail's MSW Application.        The TCEQ should\n\n         flatly deny the improper recycling registration because no MSW permit exists.\n\n         However, if the registration application is to be considered, the TCEQ must at least\n\n         refrain from considering it until a final decision is rendered on the pending Pintail\n\n         MSW landfill application at the same location.\n\n         V.     Applicant Failed to Supplement Its Application With the County\n                Ordinance Prohibiting a Landfill at the Location\n\n                Applicant has failed to uphold its duty to supplement its application by\n\n         neglecting to inform the TCEQ that a County ordinance exists prohibiting disposal\n\n         at the location.     The Applicant has a duty to supplement information that is\n\n         incorrect. Indeed, the affidavit attached to the application is a statement by the\n\n         preparer that the information is \"true, accurate, and complete.\" Furthermore, every\n\n         MS'.V permit recognizes this duty with a standard permit condition-\"[w]here the\n\n         perrnittee becomes aware that it failed to submit any relevant facts in a permit\n\n         application, or submitted incorrect information in an application, or in any report to\n\n         the executive director, it shall promptly submit such facts or information.\" 6 This\n\n         duty makes sense. Permits should not be granted upon false information.\n\n                The registration application was filed on 8/2/2011 and stated that no County\n\n         ordinance existed prohibiting disposal at the location. See Exhibit 2: Registration\n\n\n\n         s 30 Tex. Admin. Code§ 305.125(19).\n\fPage 8\n\n\n         Application Excerpt (Denial that County Ordinance Exists):                         However, Waller\n\n         County Ordinance No. 2011-001 was passed less than a month later, on August 26,\n\n         2011.      Furthermore, Applicant regularly attends Waller County Commissioners'\n\n         meetings and has met with the County Commissioners on multiple occasions. Yet,\n\n         Applicant chose not to abide by its duty to supplement its application. Applicant\n\n         chose not to disclose the County ordinance that prohibits disposal at its proposed\n\n         location.\n\n                 Under 30 Tex. Admin. Code § 330.57(d), the application should have been\n\n         returned for incomplete information.7 Now, more than one year later, there has still\n\n         been no supplement by Applicant.                Therefore, the application should be denied\n\n         because the assertion that no County ordinance prohibits disposal at the location is\n\n         false and Applicant knew better. 8\n\n         VI.     Applicant Received Five Technical Notices of Deficiency and Two\n                 Extensions to Respond, when Initially Informed there Would be No\n                 Extensions and Only 2 NOD's\n\n                 In the initial Technical NOD9 dated October 27, 2011, the TCEQ reviewer of\n\n         the registration wrote, \"we do not anticipate granting an extension of time to fulfill\n\n         this request. Also, please be aware a third notice of technical deficiency will not be\n\n         issued.\"     The reviewer also stated in the same correspondence that \"Failure to\n\n\n         130 Tex. Admin. Code§ 330.57(d) (\"Failure of the owner or operator to provide complete information\n         as required by this chapter may be cause for the executive director to return the application without\n         further action ...\" \"Submission of false information shall constitute grounds for denial of the permit or\n         registration application.\")\n         8Jd.\n         9 Although this Technical NOD was labeled the First Technical NOD, there was actually\n         correspondence from the TCEQ dated August 15, 2011 that was labeled \"Preliminary Review\" asking\n         for information to be added to the original registration request.\n\f                                                                                                  ---------\n\n\n\n\nPage 9\n\n\n         submit a satisfactory response to each of the noted deficiencies may result in the\n\n         application being returned due to technical deficiencies.\" These statements by staff\n\n         are consistent with TCEQ policies, as recently expressed in its TCEQ Sunset\n\n         Evaluation Reportrn As stated in the report, which is a flowchart of the MSW\n\n         Registration Application Process, applications are returned to the applicant after an\n\n         applicant unsuccessfully resolves the Second NOD.\n\n                Regardless of these statements and the dissonance with applicable TCEQ\n\n         policies, on December 2, 2011, an extension was granted to allow Pintail additional\n\n         time to respond to the First NOD. Pintail did respond on January 18, 2012, but the\n\n         response was again inadequate, as the reviewer sent another request for additional\n\n         information on February 17, 2012. And, even though it is labeled \"First Technical\n\n         Notice of Deficiency\", the letter is clearly an indication that Pintail did not submit a\n\n         satisfactory response to each of the noted deficiencies in the first technical notice of\n\n         deficiency. As such, it appears the application should have been returned at this\n\n         time. However, not only was the registration not returned, Pintail was granted yet\n\n         another extension to respond to the Third Technical NOD.11 Despite the statements\n\n         from TCEQ staff that there would not be more two (2) NODs, this pattern continued\n\n         for a total of six (6) NODs.\n\n\n\n\n         10 See Exhibit 4: MSW Registration Application Process, TCEQ Sunset Evaluation Report, October\n         2009, SFR-089 (contemplating only two (2) Notices of Deficiency (NODs) before retmning an\n         application for an MSW registration).\n         11 Interestingly, this Technical NOD was not given a number (nor were the two subsequent NODs of\n\n         June 25, 2012 and August 16, 2012, given a number), but by our count it is actually the Fourth NOD\n         when you count the \"Preliminary Review\".\n\f----   -----------                                                                     - - - - - - - - - -- - - - -\n\n\n\n\n       Page 10\n\n\n                   The application should have been returned after the Second NOD, in\n\n             accordance with the TCEQ's policy and the TCEQ staffs statements. Allow:iJ.1g the\n\n             Applicant to continue to inadequately respond to more than two (2) Technical\n\n             NOD's is a departure from normal policy, and should not be allowed by the\n\n             Commission. For this reason alone, the transfer and recycling facility registration\n\n             application should be denied.\n\n             VIII. Conclusion\n\n                   The proposed \"Transfer Station\" must be permitted, not merely registered,\n\n             under the applicable rules.     It is not a transfer station, but a recycling facility.\n\n             Therefore, a mere registration is inadequate and TCEQ should deny the\n\n             registration application.     Even if TCEQ were to consider the application, a\n\n             registration for a waste separation/recycling facility can only be considered after a\n\n             final decision is rendered on the pending Pintail MSW Landfill Application at the\n\n             same location. Therefore, consideration of the registration application at this time\n\n             is premature, and approval would violate TCEQ rules. Additionally, the Applicant\n\n             failed to supplement its application with the crucial fact that there is a County\n\n             Ordinance prohibiting disposal of waste at the proposed location.         Finally, this\n\n             registration application should have already been returned to the applicant. the\n\n             Applicant has been afforded five (5) separate Technical Notices of Deficiency\n\n             (NODs) and two (2) extensions of time to respond to the NOD's from the TCEQ.\n\n             This is in direct conflict with the TCEQ's previous warnings to the applicant and\n\f                                                                 -----------------\n\n\n\n\nPage 11\n\n\n      the TCEQ policies outlined in the MS\\V Registration Application Process, and\n\n      should result in denial of the registration application.\n\n            For these reasons, and for all other reasons raised by commenters opposed to\n\n      the Pintail Transfer Facility Registration Application and the Pintail Landfill\n\n      Application, we respectfully request that the TCEQ summarily deny the\n\n      registration application.    In the alternative, we request that the TCEQ abstain\n\n      from considering this matter until after a final decision is rendered on the pending _\n\n      Pintail MSW landfill application at the same location.\n\n\n\n\n                                              Michael L.

A permit application for the Pintail Landfill\n{Proposed Permit No. MSW-2377) has been filed with TCEQ and is currently pending.\nRequests for authorizations to operate the composting and C&D facilities in conjunction\nwith the Pintail Landfill will be submitted. However, in order to meet expected demand\nand to initiate a market for incoming C&D waste materials, Pintail Landfill, LLC expects\nto begin a C&D waste recycling and transfer operation prior to commencement of landfill\noperations. This registration application is being submitted to obtain authorization for\nthis initial phase C&D waste recycling and transfer operation to be conducted on the\nsame site on which the Pintail Landfill will eventually be developed. It is anticipated that\nthe C&D waste recycling and transfer facility will operate for no more than five years\npursuant to this registration and that subsequent C&D waste processing and recycling\nwill be conducted under further authorizations.\n\nPintail Landfill, LLC intends to register and operate a Type V municipal solid waste\ntransfer station in northwest Waller County off State Highway 6. The Pintail Landfill\nTransfer Station will be a Type V municipal solid waste transfer facility that will accept\nonly construction and demolition wastes. The site entrance will be located about 1 mile\nnorth of the intersection of State Highway 6 and US Highway 290 off of Wendt Road, on\nthe east side of State Highway 6. The proposed facility is intended to provide transfer\nand recycling capabilities for construction and demolition. waste for the City of\nHempstead, Waller County, and the surrounding areas. The facility will be designed to\nprotect the health and safety of the people in the region.\n\nThis application has been prepared consistent with 30 TAC Chapter 330 Municipal Solid\nWaste Management Regulations {MSWMR) adopted by the Texas Commission on\nEnvironmental Quality (TCEQ), effective March 27, 2006 and May 29, 2008.\n\nIt is intended that this registration be processed in accordance with §330.9(b){3), which\nallows for a transfer station facility to be registered if the facility will transfer 125 tons per\nday or less. The proposed Pintail Landfill Transfer Station will transfer less than 125\ntons per day.\n\nPart I of this registration application contains information about the site and the applicant\nas required in 30 TAC §§281.5, 305.45, and 330.59. Part II of the registration\napplication describes the existing conditions and character of the facility and\nsurrounding area as required in §330.61.

In an appeal arising from a dispute over a highway construction contract between a contractor and the Texas Depart-\nment of Transportation, the decision of the Department's executive director to reject an administrative law judge's\n(ALJ's) proposed findings based on credibility was arbitrary and capricious and an abuse of discretion where the ALJ,\nnot the executive director, heard the testimony and observed the demeanor of the witnesses, and where the executive\ndirector failed to comply with Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 201.112(c) by not providing a written statement for each indi-\nvidual change to the ALJ's findings of fact and conclusions of law that explained his rationale for each change, and his\nchanges to particular findings and conclusions proposed by the ALJ suggested he was acting as the Department's fact-\nfinder, despite the legislature having delegated that responsibility to the ALJ in § 201.112(b). By failing to comply with\nthe requirement to provide a written statement containing the reason and legal basis for changing the ALJ's findings and\nconclusions, the executive director's decision in his final order raised serious due process concerns, and without know-\ning on what facts the executive director relied to make his finding of credible evidence, there was no rational connection\nbetween the facts and his decision.

Trial court erred in finding that a notice of an enforcement action hearing before the Texas Alcoholic Beverage\nCommission (TABC) was ineffective because evidence that the TABC sent the notice to the licensee at the address in-\ndicated in the TABC's records and that it received a signed green card in return was substantial evidence under Tex.\nAlco.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2) for the TABC's finding that the licensee had\nactual notice; the agency was entitled to resolve conflicts in the evidence, and, here, the evidence could have supported\na finding either way. The trial court impermissibly substituted its judgment for that of the agency as the agency's resolu-\ntion of the issues of any \"address problems\" and the green card signature was not unreasonable.

Admin. Code § 73.17, which construed Tex. Gov't Code Ann. §\n814.208(d), to his post disability earnings to terminate his benefits; being advised of the Board's construction of \"com-\nparable pay\" to include its 80 percent threshold standard at the hearing was not sufficient notice to satisfy due process\nconcerns, and a 2005 letter advising the retiree that his benefits had been terminated similarly was not sufficient, and,\nthus, prior to his hearing, the retiree did not have meaningful notice that earning 80 percent of his adjusted final annual\nstate salary could cause his benefits to be terminated.

Instead, the enforcement matter at issue depended on whether preparation of the engineers' particular building\nplans and specifications was within the scope and practice of engineering as defined by the Engineering Practice Act;\nbecause the record was insufficiently developed to determine that issue as a matter of law, summary disposition was not\nappropriate, and therefore the district court did not abuse its discretion in reversing the Board's decision and remanding\nthe case for further proceedings.

In connection with a hearing to review the suspension of a motorist's driver's license, the motorist failed to object to\nthe introduction of an officer's report on the ground that the officer was absent, and thus, the motorist waived this issue,\nbut assuming that a supervisor's report and intoxilyzer record were improperly admitted, the admission of the officer's\nreport rendered any such error harmless because the primary source of the evidence relevant to and supporting the fac-\ntual issues before the administrative law judge was the officer's report. Most of the information in the supervisor's report\nand intoxilyzer record was also reported in the officer's report, and thus the motorist was not prejudiced by the error, if\nany, pursuant to Tex.

Order of the Texas Railroad Commission, directing appellant company to backfill and compact certain sludge pits\nand to dispose of all oil or oil by-products located in them, was not arbitrary and capricious under former Tex. Rev. Civ.\nStat. Ann. art. 6252-13a, § 19(e)(6) because the fact that appellant controlled the pits for 23 years was not legally irrel-\nevant, nor was it inherently arbitrary to proceed against only appellant even though other potentially liable parties ex-\nisted; while the pits had been conveyed to appellant by a corporation that had disposed of sludge in the pits, and appel-\nlant subsequently had released its interest in the pits to another party, the harm caused by the joint tortfeasors was indi-\nvisible, and thus the Commission could choose to proceed against only one of them.

Agreed Final Judgment purported to find facts (that the city had met the criteria for issuance of a permit) and to\nrender judgment granting a permit, and Tex.

Although a group was correct that a company did not raise adding a special provision to its groundwater monitor-\ning plan until after the proposal for decision had been submitted, and thus the company did not formally introduce the\nprovision, the court's task was to review the order of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality to see if substan-\ntial evidence supported the order, considering the evidence in the record as a whole, for purposes of Tex. Gov't Code\nAnn. § 2001.174(2)(E); the administrative law judge considered the provision in reaching findings and conclusions,\nsuch that the provision was part of the record as a whole under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.060(1), (2), (5), (6). City of\nJacksboro v. Two Bush Cmty. Action Group, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1108 (Tex. App. Austin Feb. 10 2012).\n\n111. Even if the court assumed the record contained no evidence regarding a special provision, the court could reverse\non substantial-evidence grounds if a group's substantial rights were prejudiced under Tex.

Insurance agent's license was properly revoked because the insurance agent's statement to clients that when they\nwanted out of a universal lease program, a leasing agent would buy back the timeshare for the amount of the investment\nproved to be untrue; substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E) supported the finding that the\ninsurance agent acted recklessly with respect to the truth or falsity of the representations. Meyer v. Tex. Dep't of Ins.,\n2011 Tex.

Legislature granted the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners (Board) the power to protect the public interest by\nregulating those physicians who were granted the privilege of practicing medicine, Tex.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, and the lack of a trial de novo (either a bench or jury trial) for\nlicense-revocation appeals by physicians was rationally related to the legitimate governmental purpose of conservation\nof judicial resources.

Where a deputy observed a pickup truck make a right turn so wide that it caused the front driver's side tire to go\nonto the grassy area of the road, the deputy had reasonable suspicion to stop appellee's vehicle because he committed a\ntraffic violation under Tex.

Because the requirements of Tex. Transp.\nCode Ann. § 524.035(a)(1), (2) were met, the Texas Department of Public Safety's decision to suspend appellee's driv-\ner's license was supported by substantial evidence under Tex.

Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Henson, 2010 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 3478 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. May 11 2010).\n\n123. Motorist argued that at least one half of the license plate was working and that the officer could see the license\nplate when he turned on his headlights, and while the court could concede the rear license plate was barely illuminated,\nnothing suggested the plate was clearly legible at a distance of 50 feet from the rear under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §\n547.322(f); the court does not rewrite the statute to say the plate must be legible if a police officer is driving behind a\nsuspect with his lights on because the statute's purpose may also be to ensure officers on foot and potential witnesses are\nable to see the license plate, and in any event, even had the motorist presented conflicting evidence on this point, the\ncourt would still have been unable to disregard the administrative law judge's factual determinations, for purposes of\nTex.

Trial court erred in finding that a notice of an enforcement action hearing before the Texas Alcoholic Beverage\nCommission (TABC) was ineffective because evidence that the TABC sent the notice to the licensee at the address in-\ndicated in the TABC's records and that it received a signed green card in return was substantial evidence under Tex.\nAlco.

Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2) for the TABC's finding that the licensee had\nactual notice; the agency was entitled to resolve conflicts in the evidence, and, here, the evidence could have supported\na finding either way. The trial court impermissibly substituted its judgment for that of the agency as the agency's resolu-\ntion of the issues of any \"address problems\" and the green card signature was not unreasonable.

Final order of the Public Utility Commission of Texas, which reconciled an electric utility company's eligible fuel\nexpenses and revenues for a certain time period, was upheld on appeal as a reasonable remedy within the Commission's\nstatutory authority; the Commission's final order was found to have reasonably required the utility company to account\nfor all revenues it collected after December 31, 2001, that were directly attributable to the generation of electricity\nthrough that date, and reasonably required it to reconcile all fuel revenues it received and expenses it incurred after that\ndate, to serve customers who were not yet switched to a retail electric provider; the Commission reconciliation method-\nology was found to have been proper and reasonably interpreted the Texas Legislature's directive to conduct a final\nreconciliation by accounting for all revenues associated with the expenses of providing bundled service during the rec-\nonciliation period; a reasonable basis existed for the Commission's decision to discount approximately $ 2.7 million in\nfuel costs and that the decision was supported by substantial evidence; and the Commission was found to have properly\ndelineated and applied its reasonableness or prudence standard of review, which took into account, among other things,\nchanges in the market.

The electric company's witness had reduced his\nestimate on rebuttal due to the fact that new technology increased the capacity of existing transmission facilities and\neliminated the need to construct certain new projects; therefore no reasonable basis existed for the PUC's use of the\noriginal estimate.

An IGCC pro-\ncess was significantly different from the pulverized coal power plant proposed by the applicant, and because an oppo-\nnent of the application had offered no evidence that IGCC was a process that could be applied to the proposed pulver-\nized coal power plant, it had failed to meet its burden.

In reviewing the Texas Commissioner of Insurance's decision denying the applicant a local recording agent's li-\ncense under the substantial evidence rule, Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, the Commissioner's consideration of two\n25-year-old felony convictions that involved the defrauding of elderly victims through the sale of an unauthorized in-\nsurance product was not erroneous under Tex.

Transp. Code Ann. §\n724.032(c)(4), the failure of an officer to comply with the statute did not render the report inadmissible at an adminis-\ntrative hearing, and the judgment that the evidence was insufficient to authorize suspension of the driver's license was\nreversed and remanded because the erroneous exclusion of exhibits prejudiced the DPS's substantial rights since the\nadministrative law judge denied the DPS the opportunity to satisfy its evidentiary burden at the license suspension\nhearing.

App. LEXIS 3566 (Tex. App. Fort Worth\n2003).\n\n359. Under the substantial evidence rule of Tex. Govt. Code Ann. § 2001.174, the court erred in reversing a license sus-\npension decision by the Texas Department of Public Safety; the administrative law judge did not err in finding, pursuant\nto Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 524.035(a)(2), that the officer had probable cause to arrest defendant for driving while in-\ntoxicated. State Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Boeck, 2001 Tex. App. LEXIS 2785 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Apr. 26 2001).\n\n360. In reviewing administrative license suspension decisions under the substantial evidence standard in Tex. Transp.\nCode Ann. § 524.041 and Tex. Gov't. Code Ann. § 2001.174, the reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that\nof the agency. The issue for the court is not whether the agency's decision was correct, but only whether the record\ndemonstrates some reasonable basis for the agency's action as shown by a \"scintilla\" of evidence.

Gov't Code § 2001.174\n\n\n\n\n361. Administrative law judge's finding that the deputy had reasonable suspicion to stop the driver was not reasonably\nsupported by substantial evidence and therefore it erred by suspending the driver's license under Tex. Transp. Code Ann.\n§§ 524.022, .041, because the evidence only showed that the driver was observed driving slowly on a highway at 1:40\na.m; the record was silent regarding the deputy's training and experience and was silent as to the characteristics of the\narea in which the driver was observed driving. In addition, there was no evidence that the deputy stopped the driver be-\ncause he was concerned for her safety, as there was no evidence she was alone in her vehicle, that there were any other\nvehicles sharing the roadway with the driver, or that driving slowly was inherently unsafe; the deputy stated in his re-\nport that he had reasonable suspicion to contact that driver only because he observed her vehicle traveling 40 m.p.h. in a\n65 m.p.h. posted zone.

App. LEXIS 2798 (Tex. App. Hou-\nston 1st Dist. 2013).\n\n362. Trial court erred by reversing the administrative decision allowing the suspension of the driver's license because\nsubstantial evidence supported that decision, as the officer testified multiple times that he saw the driver on the road and\nthen enter the parking lot and that he saw the driver in the vehicle's driver's seat when it was parked under a light in the\nparking lot; when the driver approached the officer, he saw that the driver was intoxicated and therefore had reasonable\nsuspicion or probable cause to detain the driver and administer field sobriety tests. The officer's report, which bore the\nseal and signature of the Texas Department of Public Safety's custodian of records, corroborated the officer's testimony\nthat the driver did not provide a breath sample on request and that he refused to provide a post-arrest breath sample. Tex.\nDep't of Pub. Safety v. Perez, 2013 Tex. App. LEXIS 659 (Tex. App. Corpus Christi Jan. 24 2013).\n\n363. Administrative law judge (ALJ) did not err in quashing the driver's subpoena of the arresting officer in the admin-\nistrative license suspension proceeding, because the ALJ's application of the 150-mile limit in Tex. R. Civ. P. 176.3 was\nnot an abuse of discretion; the ALJ was expressly authorized to consider the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Hodge v.\nTex. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 10526 (Tex. App. Houston 1st Dist. Dec. 20 2012).\n\n364. There was substantial evidence to support an administrative law judge's decision authorizing the suspension of a\ndriver's license under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 524.012(b)(1) because there was a reasonable suspicion to stop a vehi-\ncle based on a failure to stop at a red light, there was probable cause to arrest due to an odor of alcohol and signs of in-\ntoxication, and the driver's blood alcohol was above the legal limit. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Caruana, 2012 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 7125 (Tex. App. Austin Aug. 23 2012).\n\n365. Trial court exceeded its authority when it modified an administrative law judge's (ALJ) decision that a driver's li-\ncense was suspended for 2 years under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.035(a) and stated that the suspension was for 180\ndays. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Hudson, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 1148 (Tex. App. Dallas Feb. 13 2012).\n\n366. Driver's license suspension was proper because the facts established probable cause that the licensee was operating\na motor vehicle in a public place while intoxicated for purposes of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042; witnesses at an\naccident scene reported that a pickup had rear-ended another vehicle and driven away, a license plate at the scene was\nmatched to the licensee's pickup, which was later found abandoned with front end damage, and according to the licen-\nsee's wife, the licensee called her to pick him up near the site of the abandoned pickup. After the wife drive the licensee\nto the sheriff's office, a trooper and others observed the licensee and detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage on his\nbreath. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Allen, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 4268 (Tex. App. Amarillo June 3 2011).\n\n367. Substantial evidence under Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174 supported the administrative suspension of appellee's\ndriver's license under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §§ 724.035, 724.042, because he was stopped for speeding, had trouble\nmaintaining balance, refused to provide a breath or blood specimen, and admitted to ingesting hydrocodone, a con-\ntrolled substance. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Greathouse, 2011 Tex. App. LEXIS 2119 (Tex. App. Waco Mar. 23 2011).\n\n368. Where a deputy observed a pickup truck make a right turn so wide that it caused the front driver's side tire to go\nonto the grassy area of the road, the deputy had reasonable suspicion to stop appellee's vehicle because he committed a\ntraffic violation under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. §§ 545.051(a), 545.101(a); based on the strong odor of an alcoholic bev-\nerage emitting from appellee, his admission that he was drinking beer, and his poor performance on field sobriety tests,\nthe deputy had probable cause to arrest appellee for driving while intoxicated. Because the requirements of Tex. Transp.\nCode Ann. § 524.035(a)(1), (2) were met, the Texas Department of Public Safety's decision to suspend appellee's driv-\n\f                                                                                                                   Page 52\n                                               Tex.

App. Corpus Christi Dec. 2 2010).\n\n369. Suspension of a driver's license for refusal to submit to a breath test under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.035 was\nsupported by substantial evidence because even if the officer's sworn report was inadmissible under Tex. R. Evid. 803(8)\nbased on a lack of a signature, the admissible evidence demonstrated the four elements required to uphold the suspen-\nsion; that evidence included the DIC-24 form, under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.032, which indicated refusal to sub-\nmit to the breath test and was signed by the driver. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Guajardo, 2010 Tex. App. LEXIS 6000\n(Tex. App. Corpus Christi July 29 2010).\n\n370. Substantial evidence supported the suspension of the minor's driver's license, because the minor was properly ad-\nvised of the consequences set forth under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.015 and he voluntarily refused to submit a\nspecimen at the officer's request, and since the officer was not required to give the minor the notice of suspension before\nrequesting a specimen, any irregularity on the notice of suspension did not affect the voluntariness of the minor's refusal\nto submit a specimen for purposes of Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Henson, 2010 Tex.\nApp. LEXIS 3478 (Tex. App. Houston 14th Dist. May 11 2010).\n\n371. There was sufficient evidence for the administrative judge to uphold the suspension of the driver's license, because\nthe driver was speeding and veering back and forth, an odor of alcohol emanated from inside the car, the driver's eyes\nwere bloodshot and glassy, the driver's speech was slurred, the driver was unable to complete the one-leg-stand test and\nhe exhibited six clues of intoxication on the walk-and-turn test, and the driver displayed clues of intoxication on the\nhorizontal gaze nystagmus test and the vertical nystagmus test.

Code Ann. §§ 524.002(b), 724.047 and Tex. Gov't Code Ann. § 2001.174, that the licensee\nactually operated his vehicle while intoxicated. He was asleep when an officer approached him, and although the engine\nwas running, he was parked in his usual space behind the building where he worked, did not have a foot on the brake,\nand had not turned on the headlights; also, the car was in park and the front seat was reclined.

Decision of an ALJ administratively suspending a driver's license was supported by substantial evidence, Tex.\nGov't Code Ann. § 2001.174(2)(E), including that it took the driver more than 20 seconds to get his door open and exit\nthe car, he was swaying, had red, bloodshot eyes, had a strong odor of alcohol coming from his mouth, and admitted\ncoming from a bar where he had had eight or nine drinks. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Dishman, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS\n3052 (Tex. App. San Antonio May 6 2009).\n\n374. Under the substantial evidence standard of review, it was determined that driving privileges were properly sus-\npended because there was probable cause to believe that a driver was operating a motor vehicle in a public place under\nTex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042(2)(A); the public had unrestricted access to a private road, and it did not matter that\ntravelers were infrequent or that the road had not been converted to a county road. Tex. Dep't of Pub. Safety v. Castro,\n2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 3198 (Tex. App. San Antonio Apr. 29 2009).\n\n375. While bloodshot eyes, an odor of alcohol, and unsteady balance were all symptoms of intoxication, those facts did\nnot, without more, give rise to probable cause to believe the driver was driving while intoxicated. As the rest of the evi-\ndence did not support the conclusion that the driver was driving while intoxicated, the administrative law judge's deci-\nsion to suspend the driver's operator's license was not reasonably supported by substantial evidence. Tex. Dep't of Pub.\nSafety v. Gilfeather, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 1502 (Tex. App. Fort Worth Mar. 5 2009).\n\n376. Suspension of an operator's license was improper because an officer did not have reasonable suspicion for a stop\nunder Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 724.042 since slow driving alone was not enough to show that the operator was imped-\ning traffic, there was no violation of San Antonio, Tex., Code of Ordinances § 19-133 since the conditions were foggy\nand rainy, and an investigatory stop was not proper based on the operator's weaving since the officer did not testify that\nhe suspected that defendant was intoxicated or that the operator's driving was unsafe.

Although a clerical error relating to the date that an operator was stopped did not prejudice his substantial rights, a\nsuspension of the operator's license was not warranted because there was no reasonable suspicion for an officer's deci-\nsion to stop him for driving 20 miles under the posted speed limit. There was no evidence that the operator was imped-\ning traffic under Tex. Transp. Code Ann. § 545.363(a) since slow driving in and of itself was not enough to show a vio-\nlation, the fact that the operator drifted in his own lane of travel did not justify the investigatory stop where the officer\ndid not state that he suspected that the operator was intoxicated or that the driving was unsafe, and driving 10 miles an\nhour or more below the posted speed limit did not constitute a per se violation of San Antonio, Tex., Code of Ordinanc-\nes § 19-133 because the ordinance was concerned with the maximum reasonable, safe, and prudent speed limit; there\nwas no testimony regarding what a reasonable speed would have been under the weather conditions present at the time\nof the stop.

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY\n                      PART 1. TEXAS COMMISSION ON ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY\n                  CHAPTER 50. ACTION ON APPLICATIONS AND OTHER AUTHORIZATIONS\n                        SUBCHAPTER G. ACTION BY THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR\n\n                                                30 TAC § 50.139 (2014)\n\n§ 50.139. Motion to Overturn Executive Director's Decision\n\n   (a) The applicant, public interest counsel or other person may file with the chief clerk a motion to overturn the exec-\nutive director's action on an application or water quality management plan (WQMP) update certification. Notwithstand-\ning any other law, a state agency, except a river authority, may not file a motion to overturn the executive director's ac-\ntion on an application that was received by the commission on or after September 1, 2011 unless the state agency is the\napplicant. Wherever other commission rules refer to a \"motion for reconsideration,\" that term should be considered in-\nterchangeable with the term \"motion to overturn executive director's decision.\"\n     (b) A motion to overturn must be filed no later than 23 days after the date the agency mails notice of the signed\npermit, approval, or other action of the executive director to the applicant and persons on any required mailing list for\nthe action.\n    (c) A motion to overturn must be filed no later than 20 days after the date persons who timely commented on the\nWQMP update are notified of the response to comments and the certified WQMP update. A person is presumed to have\nbeen notified on the third day after the date the notice of the executive director's action is mailed by first class mail.\n     (d) An action by the executive director under this subchapter is not affected by a motion to overturn filed under this\nsection unless expressly ordered by the commission.\n     (e) With the agreement of the parties or on their own motion, the commission of the general counsel may, by writ-\nten order, extend the period of time for filing motions to overturn and for taking action on the motions so long as the\nperiod for taking action is not extended beyond 90 days after the date the agency mails notice of the signed permit, ap-\nproval, or other action of the executive director.\n    (f) Disposition of motion.\n     (1) Unless an extension of time is granted, if a motion to overturn is not acted on by the commission within 45 days\nafter the date the agency mails notice of the signed permit, approval, or other action of the executive director, the mo-\ntion is denied.\n    (2) In the event of an extension, the motion to overturn is overruled by operation of law on the date fixed by the\norder, or in the absence of a fixed date, 90 days after the date the agency mails notice of the signed permit, approval, or\nother action of the executive director.\n     (g) When a motion to overturn is denied under subsection (f) of this section, a motion for rehearing does not need to\nbe filed as a prerequisite for appeal. Section 80.272 of this title (relating to Motion for Rehearing) and Texas Govern-\nment Code, § 2001.146, regarding motions for rehearing in contested cases do not apply when a motion to overturn is\ndenied. If applicable, the commission decision may be subject to judicial review under Texas Water Code, § 5.351, or\nTexas Health and Safety Code, §§ 361.321, 382.032, or 401.341.\n\f                                                                                                                  Page 2\n                                                   30 TAC § 50.139\n\n\n\n\nSOURCE: The provisions of this § 50.139 adopted to be effective September 23, 1999, 24 TexReg 8254; amended to be\neffective February 3, 2000, 25 TexReg 593; amended to be effective April 1, 2001, 26 TexReg 2393; amended to be\neffective May 3, 2012, 37 TexReg 3120\n\nNOTES:\n\nCROSS-REFERENCES: This Section cited in 30 TAC § 50.131, (relating to Purpose and Applicability); 30 TAC §\n50.133, (relating to Executive Director Action on Application or WQMP Update); 30 TAC § 55.201, (relating to Re-\nquests for Reconsideration or Contested Case Hearing); 30 TAC § 116.114, (relating to Application Review Schedule);\n30 TAC § 117.121, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.221, (relating to Alternative\nCase Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 205.4, (relating to Authorizations and Notices of Intent); 30 TAC § 115.783,\n(relating to Equipment Standards); 30 TAC § 91.20, (relating to Applicability); 30 TAC § 330.69, (relating to Public\nNotice for Registrations); 30 TAC § 330.71, (relating to Duration and Limits of Registrations and Permits); 30 TAC §\n117.125, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.225, (relating to Alternative Case Specific\nSpecifications); 30 TAC § 117.325, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.425, (relating\nto Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.1025, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications);\n30 TAC § 117.1125, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.1225, (relating to Alternative\nCase Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.1325, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC §\n117.2025, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.2125, (relating to Alternative Case Spe-\ncific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.3025, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.3125,\n(relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.3325, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Speci-\nfications); 30 TAC § 117.4025, (relating to Alternative Case Specific Specifications); 30 TAC § 117.4125, (relating to\nAlternative Case Specific Specifications).\n     This Chapter cited in 30 TAC § 39.9, (relating to Deadline for Public Comment and Hearing Requests); 30 TAC §\n39.11, (relating to Text of Public Notice); 30 TAC § 39.409, (relating to Deadline for Public Comment, and for Requests\nfor Reconsideration, Contested Case Hearing, or Notice and Comment Hearing); 30 TAC § 39.411, (relating to Text of\nPublic Notice); 30 TAC § 291.107, (relating to Action on Applications); 30 TAC § 293.6, (relating to Applications Pro-\ncessing Requirements); 30 TAC § 297.72, (relating to Notice and Hearing); 30 TAC § 305.69, (relating to Solid Waste\nPermit Modification at the Request of the Permittee); 30 TAC § 335.23, (relating to Procedures for Case-by-Case Regu-\nlation of Hazardous Waste Recycling Activities); 30 TAC § 335.24, (relating to Requirements for Recyclable Materials\nand Nonhazardous Recyclable Materials); 30 TAC § 335.78, (relating to Special Requirements for Hazardous Waste\nGenerated by Conditionally Exempt Small Quantity Generators); 30 TAC § 335.213, (relating to Standards Applicable\nto Storers of Materials That Are To Be Used in a Manner That Constitutes Disposal Who Are Not the Ultimate Users);\n30 TAC § 335.214, (relating to Standards Applicable to Users of Materials That Are Used in a Manner That Constitutes\nDisposal); 30 TAC § 335.241, (relating to Applicability and Requirements); 30 TAC § 335.251, (relating to Applicabil-\nity and Requirements); 30 TAC § 303.90, (relating to Action on Application Without Public Hearing).\n    This Subchapter cited in 30 TAC § 55.253, (relating to Public Comment Processing); 30 TAC § 50.31, (relating to\nPurpose and Applicability).\n\fTAB 16\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 1\n\n\n\n\n1 of 1 DOCUMENT\n\n                                           TEXAS ADMINISTRATIVE CODE\n\n                        *** This document reflects all regulations in effect as of July 31, 2014 ***\n\n                                    TITLE 30.

A person shall submit a claim for a registration by rule in duplicate with one copy sent directly to the ap-\npropriate Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regional office.\n    (b) A registration is required for an MSW transfer station facility that is used in the transfer of MSW to a solid\nwaste processing or disposal facility from any of the following:\n    (1) a municipality with a population of less than 50,000;\n    (2) a county with a population of less than 85,000;\n    (3) a facility used in the transfer of MSW that transfers or will transfer 125 tons per day or less; or\n    (4) a transfer station located within the permitted boundaries of an MSW Type I or Type IV facility as specified in\n§ 330.5(a) of this title (relating to Classification of Municipal Solid Waste Facilities).\n      (c) A registration is required to establish a waste-separation/recycling facility established at a permitted MSW facil-\nity if owned by the permittee.\n     (d) A registration is required for a facility where the only operation is the storage and/or processing of used and\nscrap tires as provided for in Chapter 328 of this title (relating to Waste Minimization and Recycling). These facilities\nshall be registered with the executive director in accordance with Chapter 328 of this title. Failure to operate such regis-\ntered facilities in accordance with the requirements established in Chapter 328 of this title may be grounds for the revo-\ncation of the registration.\n     (e) A licensed hospital may function as a medical waste collection and transfer facility for generators that generate\nless than 50 pounds of untreated medical waste per month and that transport their own waste if:\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 2\n                                                       30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n     (1) the hospital is located in an incorporated area with a population of less than 25,000 and in a county with a pop-\nulation of less than one million; or\n    (2) the hospital is located in an unincorporated area that is not within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a city with a\npopulation more than 25,000 or within a county with a population of more than one million. The hospital shall submit a\nrequest to the executive director for registration as a medical waste collection station.\n     (f) A registration is required for any new MSW Type V transfer station that includes a material recovery operation\nthat meets all of the following requirements.\n      (1) Materials recovery. The owner or operator must recover 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the to-\ntal incoming waste stream for reuse or recycling; ensure that the incoming waste has already been reduced by at least\n10% through a source-separation recycling program; or, also operate one or more source-separation recycling programs\nin the county where the transfer station is located and those source-separation recycling programs manage a total weight\nor weight equivalent of recyclable materials equal to 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the incoming\nwaste stream to all transfer stations to which credit is being applied. The owner or operator must demonstrate in the\nregistration application the method that will be used to assure that the 10% requirement is achieved.\n     (2) Distance to a landfill. The transfer facility must demonstrate in the registration application that it will transfer\nthe remaining nonrecyclable waste to a landfill not more than 50 miles from the facility.\n     (g) Except as provided in § 330.11(d) of this title, a registration is required for an MSW Type V processing facility\nthat processes only grease trap waste, grit trap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes in ac-\ncordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste means grit\ntrap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators.\n     (1) The facility must attain a 10% recovery of material for beneficial use from the incoming waste. Recovery of\nmaterial for beneficial use is considered to be the recovery of fats, oils, greases, and the recovery of food solids for\ncomposting, but does not include the recovery of water. The Type V processing facilities issued a registration under a\npermit exemption based on 10% recovery of material for beneficial use must maintain records in accordance with the\nrequirements of § 330.219(b)(9) of this title (relating to Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements). Records and a\nreport must be provided on a quarterly basis to the executive director that demonstrate that at least 10% of the volume of\nthe waste received was processed to recover solid material that was recycled or reused. Failure to achieve the relevant\npercent recycling rate in any two quarters within any one-year period will cause a registration to terminate and will re-\nquire the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a permit to continue facility operations. The quarterly report must\nprovide the volume received, percent solids, and the method of determining the percent solids, processed, disposed, and\nrecycled or reused. Records must be kept on a volume basis in gallons except that solids passing the paint filter test may\nbe reported in cubic yard volume converted to gallons. The methods of recycling or reuse must be specified in the re-\nport. Records must be kept for solids and recyclable material leaving these facilities in the form of manifests, shipping\ndocuments, or trip tickets. The quarterly report must include manifests, shipping documents, or trip tickets to show\nwhere the recyclable material was taken for recycling, and the recycled material must be reconciled with the volume of\nwaste received. Water discharged from processing is not allowed to be counted as part of the 10% recovery of material.\nRecovery and recycling or reuse of fats, oils, and greases may be considered a part of recycling for this activity. Com-\nposting of solids resulting from waste processing may be considered to be recycling as part of this activity. Any material\nsuch as lime, polymer, or flocculent added as part of the facility process is not allowed to be considered as part of the\n10% recovery of material from the waste stream and must be subtracted from the material considered as recycled. Di-\nversion of material from the waste stream without processing is not considered to be recycling as part of this activity.\n     (2) The Type V processing facility must be located at a manned treatment facility that is permitted under Texas\nWater Code, Chapter 26; is permitted to discharge at least one million gallons per day; and is owned by and operated for\nthe benefit of a political subdivision of this state. Facilities that have received a permit and wish to add capacity may\napply for a registration in lieu of a permit amendment if the facilities meet the registration requirements established in\nthis chapter.\n     (h) A registration is required for a mobile liquid waste processing unit that processes only grease trap waste, grit\ntrap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste\nmeans grit trap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators. Registration ap-\nplications shall contain the information specified in §§ 330.59(a) and (e) - (h), 330.61(a) and (b), and 330.63(a), (d)(6),\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 3\n                                                       30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n(h), and (j) of this title (relating to Contents of Part I of the Application; Contents of Part II of the Application; and\nContents of Part III of the Application). The following requirements also apply.\n    (1) Mobile liquid waste processing shall be limited to the processing of liquid waste while at the generator's trap.\n    (2) Effluent from the processing of the liquid waste must be discharged to the generator's trap or interceptor.\n     (3) The mobile liquid waste processing units regulated under this section include truck-mounted processes that are\nalso known as separator trucks, and any other liquid waste processes that are not considered to be fixed to a specific\nlocation.\n     (4) This section is not meant to supplant rules or ordinances of local governments where stricter standards are in\neffect.\n     (5) This section is not applicable to septage if waste has received only a pH adjustment prior to or during transpor-\ntation for disposal at a treatment facility permitted under Texas Water Code, Chapter 26, or other authorized facility.\nTransporters who only adjust septage pH during transportation shall register in accordance with § 312.142 of this title\n(relating to Transporter Registration).\n     (i) A registration is required for an MSW Type VI facility that demonstrates new management methods for pro-\ncessing or handling grease trap waste, grit trap waste, septage, or a combination of these three liquid wastes. For the\npurposes of this section, grit trap waste means grit trap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste\nfrom other generators. Those facilities meeting this exemption must obtain a registration by meeting the operational\ncriteria and design criteria established in § 330.63(d)(9) of this title.\n     (j) A registration is required for the following material recovery operations from a landfill. The following opera-\ntions are subject to the general requirements found in § 330.601 of this title (relating to General Requirements), and the\nrequirements set for soil end product standards in § 330.615 of this title (relating to Final Soil Product Grades and Al-\nlowable Uses), and the air quality requirements in § 330.607 of this title (relating to Air Quality Requirements):\n  (1) operations that recover reusable or recyclable material buried in permitted or closed MSW landfill facilities, or\nMSW landfill facilities that were never permitted;\n    (2) operations that reclaim soil from permitted or closed MSW landfills, or from MSW landfill facilities that were\nnever permitted; and\n      (3) facilities that have received prior approval for excavation of buried materials through permits, permit amend-\nments, or other agency authorization, which are exempt from further authorization requirements, as established in this\nsubchapter, for the specific authorization received. Soil final product standards shall be applicable for all registered fa-\ncilities.\n     (k) A registration by rule is granted for the owner or operator of a Type IX MSW facility that recovers landfill gas\nfor beneficial use if all of the following conditions are met.\n    (1) The owner or operator shall submit the following information at least 60 days prior to commencing operations:\n    (A) a large-scale plan drawing of the facility showing the following:\n    (i) facility boundaries (show permit boundaries and/or boundaries and dimensions of tract or land or closed MSW\nlandfill units on which the gas recovery system is to be developed); and\n    (ii) landfill gas treatment, gas compression, electrical power generation equipment, and any other beneficial gas-use\nequipment, indicating limits of waste placement and additional easements required;\n    (B) for enclosed structures, provisions for fire control facilities (fire hydrants, fire extinguisher, water tanks, and\nwaterwell), continuous methane monitoring, and explosion-proof fixtures;\n     (C) a discussion of the proposed method for condensate disposal, including during the landfill post-closure care pe-\nriod;\n    (D) an estimation of average daily gas production;\n    (E) an estimation of the design daily gas production;\n    (F) descriptions of the process units;\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 4\n                                                     30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n    (G) a cost estimate for closure following the requirements of § 330.505 of this title (relating to Closure Cost Esti-\nmates for Storage and Processing Units); and\n     (H) a description of the financial assurance mechanism required by Chapter 37, Subchapter R of this title (relating\nto Financial Assurance for Municipal Solid Waste Facilities).\n     (2) The owner or operator shall acquire all authorizations regarding air emissions for the facility and comply with\nthe following regulations:\n    (A) Subchapter E of this chapter (relating to Operational Standards for Municipal Solid Waste Storage and Pro-\ncessing Units);\n    (B) § 330.459 and § 330.461 of this title (relating to Closure Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste Storage and\nProcessing Units; and Certification of Final Facility Closure); and\n    (C) § 330.505 of this title.\n    (l) A registration by rule is granted for persons that plan to transport untreated medical waste and that are not the\ngenerator of the waste if all of the following conditions are met.\n     (1) The registrant completes registration forms provided by the commission and provides the following information\nat least 60 days prior to commencing operations:\n    (A) name, address, and telephone number of registrant;\n    (B) name, address, and telephone number of partners, corporate officers, and directors; and\n    (C) description of each transportation unit, including:\n    (i) make, model, and year;\n    (ii) motor vehicle identification number, if applicable;\n    (iii) license plate (tag) number, including state and year; and\n    (iv) name of transportation unit owner.\n     (2) The owner or operator submits the fee required by § 330.1211(l) of this title (relating to Transporters of Un-\ntreated Medical Waste) along with the claim for the registration by rule.\n    (3) Registrations by rule expire after one year. The owner or operator must submit an annual fee in accordance with\n§ 330.1211(l) of this title. Failure to timely pay the annual fee eliminates the option to manage wastes until the owner or\noperator claims a new or renewed registration by rule.\n     (4) Persons that claim the registration maintain a copy of the registration form, as annotated by the executive direc-\ntor with an assigned registration number, at their designated place of business and with each transportation unit used to\ntransport untreated medical waste.\n    (5) The owner or operator submits annual summary reports in accordance with applicable provisions in §\n330.1211(m) of this title.\n    (m) A registration by rule is granted for owners or operators of mobile treatment units conducting on-site treatment\nof medical waste who are not the generator if the following conditions are met.\n     (1) The registrant completes registration forms provided by the commission and provides the following information\nat least 60 days prior to commencing operations or expiration of a registration issued under the former rules before the\ncomprehensive rule revisions in this chapter as adopted in 2006 (2006 Revisions) became effective:\n    (A) name, address, and telephone number of registrant;\n    (B) name, address, and telephone number of partners, corporate officers, and directors;\n    (C) description of each mobile treatment unit, including:\n    (i) make, model, and year;\n    (ii) motor vehicle identification number, if applicable; and\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 5\n                                                      30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n    (iii) license plate (tag) number, including state and year;\n    (D) name of mobile treatment unit owner;\n     (E) description of approved treatment method to be employed and chemical preparations, as well as the procedure\nto be utilized for routine performance testing/parameter monitoring;\n    (F) evidence of competency;\n    (G) a description of the management and disposal of process waters generated during treatment events;\n    (H) a written contingency plan that describes the handling and disposal of waste in the event of treatment failure or\nequipment breakdown; and\n     (I) an estimate of the cost to remove and dispose of waste and disinfect the waste treatment equipment and evidence\nof financial assurance using procedures specified in Subchapter L of this chapter (relating to Closure, Post-Closure, and\nCorrective Action Cost Estimates) and Chapter 37, Subchapter R of this title.\n    (2) The owner or operator submits the fee required by § 330.1221(l) of this title (relating to On-Site Treatment Ser-\nvices on Mobile Treatment Units) along with the claim for the registration by rule.\n     (3) The executive director will send a copy of the registration form, annotated with an assigned registration number,\nto the owner or operator,\n     (4) Registrations by rule expire after one year.

These facilities\nshall be registered with the executive director in accordance with Chapter 328 of this title. Failure to operate such regis-\ntered facilities in accordance with the requirements established in Chapter 328 of this title may be grounds for the revo-\ncation of the registration.\n     (e) A licensed hospital may function as a medical waste collection and transfer facility for generators that generate\nless than 50 pounds of untreated medical waste per month and that transport their own waste if:\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 2\n                                                       30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n     (1) the hospital is located in an incorporated area with a population of less than 25,000 and in a county with a pop-\nulation of less than one million; or\n    (2) the hospital is located in an unincorporated area that is not within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a city with a\npopulation more than 25,000 or within a county with a population of more than one million. The hospital shall submit a\nrequest to the executive director for registration as a medical waste collection station.\n     (f) A registration is required for any new MSW Type V transfer station that includes a material recovery operation\nthat meets all of the following requirements.\n      (1) Materials recovery. The owner or operator must recover 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the to-\ntal incoming waste stream for reuse or recycling; ensure that the incoming waste has already been reduced by at least\n10% through a source-separation recycling program; or, also operate one or more source-separation recycling programs\nin the county where the transfer station is located and those source-separation recycling programs manage a total weight\nor weight equivalent of recyclable materials equal to 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the incoming\nwaste stream to all transfer stations to which credit is being applied. The owner or operator must demonstrate in the\nregistration application the method that will be used to assure that the 10% requirement is achieved.\n     (2) Distance to a landfill. The transfer facility must demonstrate in the registration application that it will transfer\nthe remaining nonrecyclable waste to a landfill not more than 50 miles from the facility.\n     (g) Except as provided in § 330.11(d) of this title, a registration is required for an MSW Type V processing facility\nthat processes only grease trap waste, grit trap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes in ac-\ncordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste means grit\ntrap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators.\n     (1) The facility must attain a 10% recovery of material for beneficial use from the incoming waste. Recovery of\nmaterial for beneficial use is considered to be the recovery of fats, oils, greases, and the recovery of food solids for\ncomposting, but does not include the recovery of water. The Type V processing facilities issued a registration under a\npermit exemption based on 10% recovery of material for beneficial use must maintain records in accordance with the\nrequirements of § 330.219(b)(9) of this title (relating to Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements). Records and a\nreport must be provided on a quarterly basis to the executive director that demonstrate that at least 10% of the volume of\nthe waste received was processed to recover solid material that was recycled or reused. Failure to achieve the relevant\npercent recycling rate in any two quarters within any one-year period will cause a registration to terminate and will re-\nquire the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a permit to continue facility operations. The quarterly report must\nprovide the volume received, percent solids, and the method of determining the percent solids, processed, disposed, and\nrecycled or reused. Records must be kept on a volume basis in gallons except that solids passing the paint filter test may\nbe reported in cubic yard volume converted to gallons. The methods of recycling or reuse must be specified in the re-\nport. Records must be kept for solids and recyclable material leaving these facilities in the form of manifests, shipping\ndocuments, or trip tickets. The quarterly report must include manifests, shipping documents, or trip tickets to show\nwhere the recyclable material was taken for recycling, and the recycled material must be reconciled with the volume of\nwaste received. Water discharged from processing is not allowed to be counted as part of the 10% recovery of material.\nRecovery and recycling or reuse of fats, oils, and greases may be considered a part of recycling for this activity. Com-\nposting of solids resulting from waste processing may be considered to be recycling as part of this activity. Any material\nsuch as lime, polymer, or flocculent added as part of the facility process is not allowed to be considered as part of the\n10% recovery of material from the waste stream and must be subtracted from the material considered as recycled. Di-\nversion of material from the waste stream without processing is not considered to be recycling as part of this activity.\n     (2) The Type V processing facility must be located at a manned treatment facility that is permitted under Texas\nWater Code, Chapter 26; is permitted to discharge at least one million gallons per day; and is owned by and operated for\nthe benefit of a political subdivision of this state. Facilities that have received a permit and wish to add capacity may\napply for a registration in lieu of a permit amendment if the facilities meet the registration requirements established in\nthis chapter.\n     (h) A registration is required for a mobile liquid waste processing unit that processes only grease trap waste, grit\ntrap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste\nmeans grit trap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators. Registration ap-\nplications shall contain the information specified in §§ 330.59(a) and (e) - (h), 330.61(a) and (b), and 330.63(a), (d)(6),\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 3\n                                                       30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n(h), and (j) of this title (relating to Contents of Part I of the Application; Contents of Part II of the Application; and\nContents of Part III of the Application). The following requirements also apply.\n    (1) Mobile liquid waste processing shall be limited to the processing of liquid waste while at the generator's trap.\n    (2) Effluent from the processing of the liquid waste must be discharged to the generator's trap or interceptor.\n     (3) The mobile liquid waste processing units regulated under this section include truck-mounted processes that are\nalso known as separator trucks, and any other liquid waste processes that are not considered to be fixed to a specific\nlocation.\n     (4) This section is not meant to supplant rules or ordinances of local governments where stricter standards are in\neffect.\n     (5) This section is not applicable to septage if waste has received only a pH adjustment prior to or during transpor-\ntation for disposal at a treatment facility permitted under Texas Water Code, Chapter 26, or other authorized facility.\nTransporters who only adjust septage pH during transportation shall register in accordance with § 312.142 of this title\n(relating to Transporter Registration).\n     (i) A registration is required for an MSW Type VI facility that demonstrates new management methods for pro-\ncessing or handling grease trap waste, grit trap waste, septage, or a combination of these three liquid wastes. For the\npurposes of this section, grit trap waste means grit trap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste\nfrom other generators. Those facilities meeting this exemption must obtain a registration by meeting the operational\ncriteria and design criteria established in § 330.63(d)(9) of this title.\n     (j) A registration is required for the following material recovery operations from a landfill. The following opera-\ntions are subject to the general requirements found in § 330.601 of this title (relating to General Requirements), and the\nrequirements set for soil end product standards in § 330.615 of this title (relating to Final Soil Product Grades and Al-\nlowable Uses), and the air quality requirements in § 330.607 of this title (relating to Air Quality Requirements):\n  (1) operations that recover reusable or recyclable material buried in permitted or closed MSW landfill facilities, or\nMSW landfill facilities that were never permitted;\n    (2) operations that reclaim soil from permitted or closed MSW landfills, or from MSW landfill facilities that were\nnever permitted; and\n      (3) facilities that have received prior approval for excavation of buried materials through permits, permit amend-\nments, or other agency authorization, which are exempt from further authorization requirements, as established in this\nsubchapter, for the specific authorization received. Soil final product standards shall be applicable for all registered fa-\ncilities.\n     (k) A registration by rule is granted for the owner or operator of a Type IX MSW facility that recovers landfill gas\nfor beneficial use if all of the following conditions are met.\n    (1) The owner or operator shall submit the following information at least 60 days prior to commencing operations:\n    (A) a large-scale plan drawing of the facility showing the following:\n    (i) facility boundaries (show permit boundaries and/or boundaries and dimensions of tract or land or closed MSW\nlandfill units on which the gas recovery system is to be developed); and\n    (ii) landfill gas treatment, gas compression, electrical power generation equipment, and any other beneficial gas-use\nequipment, indicating limits of waste placement and additional easements required;\n    (B) for enclosed structures, provisions for fire control facilities (fire hydrants, fire extinguisher, water tanks, and\nwaterwell), continuous methane monitoring, and explosion-proof fixtures;\n     (C) a discussion of the proposed method for condensate disposal, including during the landfill post-closure care pe-\nriod;\n    (D) an estimation of average daily gas production;\n    (E) an estimation of the design daily gas production;\n    (F) descriptions of the process units;\n\f                                                                                                                     Page 4\n                                                     30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n    (G) a cost estimate for closure following the requirements of § 330.505 of this title (relating to Closure Cost Esti-\nmates for Storage and Processing Units); and\n     (H) a description of the financial assurance mechanism required by Chapter 37, Subchapter R of this title (relating\nto Financial Assurance for Municipal Solid Waste Facilities).\n     (2) The owner or operator shall acquire all authorizations regarding air emissions for the facility and comply with\nthe following regulations:\n    (A) Subchapter E of this chapter (relating to Operational Standards for Municipal Solid Waste Storage and Pro-\ncessing Units);\n    (B) § 330.459 and § 330.461 of this title (relating to Closure Requirements for Municipal Solid Waste Storage and\nProcessing Units; and Certification of Final Facility Closure); and\n    (C) § 330.505 of this title.\n    (l) A registration by rule is granted for persons that plan to transport untreated medical waste and that are not the\ngenerator of the waste if all of the following conditions are met.\n     (1) The registrant completes registration forms provided by the commission and provides the following information\nat least 60 days prior to commencing operations:\n    (A) name, address, and telephone number of registrant;\n    (B) name, address, and telephone number of partners, corporate officers, and directors; and\n    (C) description of each transportation unit, including:\n    (i) make, model, and year;\n    (ii) motor vehicle identification number, if applicable;\n    (iii) license plate (tag) number, including state and year; and\n    (iv) name of transportation unit owner.\n     (2) The owner or operator submits the fee required by § 330.1211(l) of this title (relating to Transporters of Un-\ntreated Medical Waste) along with the claim for the registration by rule.\n    (3) Registrations by rule expire after one year. The owner or operator must submit an annual fee in accordance with\n§ 330.1211(l) of this title. Failure to timely pay the annual fee eliminates the option to manage wastes until the owner or\noperator claims a new or renewed registration by rule.\n     (4) Persons that claim the registration maintain a copy of the registration form, as annotated by the executive direc-\ntor with an assigned registration number, at their designated place of business and with each transportation unit used to\ntransport untreated medical waste.\n    (5) The owner or operator submits annual summary reports in accordance with applicable provisions in §\n330.1211(m) of this title.\n    (m) A registration by rule is granted for owners or operators of mobile treatment units conducting on-site treatment\nof medical waste who are not the generator if the following conditions are met.\n     (1) The registrant completes registration forms provided by the commission and provides the following information\nat least 60 days prior to commencing operations or expiration of a registration issued under the former rules before the\ncomprehensive rule revisions in this chapter as adopted in 2006 (2006 Revisions) became effective:\n    (A) name, address, and telephone number of registrant;\n    (B) name, address, and telephone number of partners, corporate officers, and directors;\n    (C) description of each mobile treatment unit, including:\n    (i) make, model, and year;\n    (ii) motor vehicle identification number, if applicable; and\n\f                                                                                                                       Page 5\n                                                      30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n    (iii) license plate (tag) number, including state and year;\n    (D) name of mobile treatment unit owner;\n     (E) description of approved treatment method to be employed and chemical preparations, as well as the procedure\nto be utilized for routine performance testing/parameter monitoring;\n    (F) evidence of competency;\n    (G) a description of the management and disposal of process waters generated during treatment events;\n    (H) a written contingency plan that describes the handling and disposal of waste in the event of treatment failure or\nequipment breakdown; and\n     (I) an estimate of the cost to remove and dispose of waste and disinfect the waste treatment equipment and evidence\nof financial assurance using procedures specified in Subchapter L of this chapter (relating to Closure, Post-Closure, and\nCorrective Action Cost Estimates) and Chapter 37, Subchapter R of this title.\n    (2) The owner or operator submits the fee required by § 330.1221(l) of this title (relating to On-Site Treatment Ser-\nvices on Mobile Treatment Units) along with the claim for the registration by rule.\n     (3) The executive director will send a copy of the registration form, annotated with an assigned registration number,\nto the owner or operator,\n     (4) Registrations by rule expire after one year. The owner or operator must submit an annual renewal fee in ac-\ncordance with § 330.1221(l) of this title. Failure to timely pay the annual fee eliminates the option to manage wastes\nuntil the owner or operator claims a new or renewed registration by rule.\n    (5) The owner or operator submits annual summary reports in accordance with applicable provisions in §\n330.1221(m) of this title.\n    (6) Providers of on-site treatment of medical waste in mobile units notify the executive director, by letter, within 30\ndays of any changes to their registration if:\n    (A) the method employed to treat medical waste changes;\n    (B) the office or place of business is moved;\n    (C) the name of registrant or owner of the operation is changed;\n    (D) the name of the partners, corporate directors, or corporate officers change; or\n    (E) the unit information changes.\n     (n) A registration is required for facilities that store or process untreated medical waste that is received from off-site\nsources.

Registration Required\n\n   (a) Except as provided in §§ 330.7, 330.11, 330.13, or 330.25 of this title (relating to Permit Required; Notification\nRequired; Waste Management Activities Exempt from Permitting, Registration, or Notification; Relationship with\nCounty Licensing System), no person may cause, suffer, allow, or permit any activity of storage, processing, removal,\nor disposal of any municipal solid waste (MSW) unless that activity is authorized by a registration or other authorization\nfrom the commission. In the event this requirement is violated, the executive director may seek recourse against not\nonly the person that stored, processed, or disposed of the waste but also against the generator, transporter, owner or op-\nerator, or other person who caused, suffered, allowed, or permitted waste to be stored, processed, or disposed. No per-\nson may commence physical construction of a new MSW management facility subject to this registration requirement\nwithout first having submitted a registration application in accordance with §§ 330.57, 330.59, 330.61, 330.63, and\n330.65 of this title (relating to Permit and Registration Application Procedures) and received a registration from the\ncommission. A person shall include a statement justifying the facility's eligibility for a registration as established under\nthis section. A person shall submit a claim for a registration by rule in duplicate with one copy sent directly to the ap-\npropriate Texas Commission on Environmental Quality regional office.\n    (b) A registration is required for an MSW transfer station facility that is used in the transfer of MSW to a solid\nwaste processing or disposal facility from any of the following:\n    (1) a municipality with a population of less than 50,000;\n    (2) a county with a population of less than 85,000;\n    (3) a facility used in the transfer of MSW that transfers or will transfer 125 tons per day or less; or\n    (4) a transfer station located within the permitted boundaries of an MSW Type I or Type IV facility as specified in\n§ 330.5(a) of this title (relating to Classification of Municipal Solid Waste Facilities).\n      (c) A registration is required to establish a waste-separation/recycling facility established at a permitted MSW facil-\nity if owned by the permittee.\n     (d) A registration is required for a facility where the only operation is the storage and/or processing of used and\nscrap tires as provided for in Chapter 328 of this title (relating to Waste Minimization and Recycling). These facilities\nshall be registered with the executive director in accordance with Chapter 328 of this title. Failure to operate such regis-\ntered facilities in accordance with the requirements established in Chapter 328 of this title may be grounds for the revo-\ncation of the registration.\n     (e) A licensed hospital may function as a medical waste collection and transfer facility for generators that generate\nless than 50 pounds of untreated medical waste per month and that transport their own waste if:\n\f                                                                                                                        Page 2\n                                                       30 TAC § 330.9\n\n\n     (1) the hospital is located in an incorporated area with a population of less than 25,000 and in a county with a pop-\nulation of less than one million; or\n    (2) the hospital is located in an unincorporated area that is not within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of a city with a\npopulation more than 25,000 or within a county with a population of more than one million. The hospital shall submit a\nrequest to the executive director for registration as a medical waste collection station.\n     (f) A registration is required for any new MSW Type V transfer station that includes a material recovery operation\nthat meets all of the following requirements.\n      (1) Materials recovery. The owner or operator must recover 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the to-\ntal incoming waste stream for reuse or recycling; ensure that the incoming waste has already been reduced by at least\n10% through a source-separation recycling program; or, also operate one or more source-separation recycling programs\nin the county where the transfer station is located and those source-separation recycling programs manage a total weight\nor weight equivalent of recyclable materials equal to 10% or more by weight or weight equivalent of the incoming\nwaste stream to all transfer stations to which credit is being applied. The owner or operator must demonstrate in the\nregistration application the method that will be used to assure that the 10% requirement is achieved.\n     (2) Distance to a landfill. The transfer facility must demonstrate in the registration application that it will transfer\nthe remaining nonrecyclable waste to a landfill not more than 50 miles from the facility.\n     (g) Except as provided in § 330.11(d) of this title, a registration is required for an MSW Type V processing facility\nthat processes only grease trap waste, grit trap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes in ac-\ncordance with either paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste means grit\ntrap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators.\n     (1) The facility must attain a 10% recovery of material for beneficial use from the incoming waste. Recovery of\nmaterial for beneficial use is considered to be the recovery of fats, oils, greases, and the recovery of food solids for\ncomposting, but does not include the recovery of water. The Type V processing facilities issued a registration under a\npermit exemption based on 10% recovery of material for beneficial use must maintain records in accordance with the\nrequirements of § 330.219(b)(9) of this title (relating to Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements). Records and a\nreport must be provided on a quarterly basis to the executive director that demonstrate that at least 10% of the volume of\nthe waste received was processed to recover solid material that was recycled or reused. Failure to achieve the relevant\npercent recycling rate in any two quarters within any one-year period will cause a registration to terminate and will re-\nquire the owner or operator of the facility to obtain a permit to continue facility operations. The quarterly report must\nprovide the volume received, percent solids, and the method of determining the percent solids, processed, disposed, and\nrecycled or reused. Records must be kept on a volume basis in gallons except that solids passing the paint filter test may\nbe reported in cubic yard volume converted to gallons. The methods of recycling or reuse must be specified in the re-\nport. Records must be kept for solids and recyclable material leaving these facilities in the form of manifests, shipping\ndocuments, or trip tickets. The quarterly report must include manifests, shipping documents, or trip tickets to show\nwhere the recyclable material was taken for recycling, and the recycled material must be reconciled with the volume of\nwaste received. Water discharged from processing is not allowed to be counted as part of the 10% recovery of material.\nRecovery and recycling or reuse of fats, oils, and greases may be considered a part of recycling for this activity. Com-\nposting of solids resulting from waste processing may be considered to be recycling as part of this activity. Any material\nsuch as lime, polymer, or flocculent added as part of the facility process is not allowed to be considered as part of the\n10% recovery of material from the waste stream and must be subtracted from the material considered as recycled. Di-\nversion of material from the waste stream without processing is not considered to be recycling as part of this activity.\n     (2) The Type V processing facility must be located at a manned treatment facility that is permitted under Texas\nWater Code, Chapter 26; is permitted to discharge at least one million gallons per day; and is owned by and operated for\nthe benefit of a political subdivision of this state. Facilities that have received a permit and wish to add capacity may\napply for a registration in lieu of a permit amendment if the facilities meet the registration requirements established in\nthis chapter.\n     (h) A registration is required for a mobile liquid waste processing unit that processes only grease trap waste, grit\ntrap waste, or septage or a combination of these three liquid wastes. For the purposes of this section, grit trap waste\nmeans grit trap waste from commercial car washes and excludes grit trap waste from other generators.
