In the previous\n\nappeal, we reversed the District Court’s grant of summary judgment for the\n\nCross-Appellants and held that their cross-appeal on the attorneys’ fee issue was moot.\n\nWestern Tradition Partn., Inc. v. Atty. Gen., 2011 MT 328, ¶ 48, 363 Mont. 220, 271\n\nP.3d 1. Our decision thereafter was reversed by the United States Supreme Court.\n\nAmerican Tradition Partn., Inc. v. Bullock, 567 U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 2490 (2012) (per\n\ncuriam). On motion of the Cross-Appellants, we agreed to consider the attorneys’ fee\n\nissue based on the briefing previously submitted to this Court. We now affirm.\n\n                 FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n¶2    The procedural history of this case is set forth in detail in the Court’s previous\n\nopinion. Western Tradition Partn., ¶¶ 2-33. Briefly stated, Plaintiffs Western Tradition\n\nPartnership—now known as American Tradition Partnership—Champion Painting, and\n\nMontana Shooting Sports Foundation (collectively referred to as ATP) sought a\n\ndeclaratory ruling that § 13-35-227(1), MCA, violated their rights to free speech\n\nguaranteed by the United States and Montana Constitutions by prohibiting political\n\nexpenditures by corporations on behalf of or opposing candidates for public office. ATP\n\nargued that the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310,\n\n130 S. Ct. 876 (2010), barred Montana from prohibiting independent and indirect\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\fcorporate expenditures on political speech, and that Montana’s century-old ban on\n\nindependent corporate expenditures therefore was invalid.\n\n¶3     The Attorney General defended the law’s constitutionality on the grounds that the\n\nlaw invalidated in Citizens United was distinguishable from the Montana statute, that\n\ncorporate rights could not be asserted against states in the same manner as against\n\nCongress, and that Montana has a compelling interest in requiring business corporations\n\nto use segregated funds for campaign expenditures. The Attorney General argued that\n\n§ 13-35-227(1), MCA, is narrowly tailored because it still allows for lobbying, testimony,\n\nand other direct contacts and that the Commissioner of Political Practices has interpreted\n\nthe law to exclude voluntary associations.\n\n¶4     The District Court entertained the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nATP’s motion included a request for attorneys’ fees under the Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act (UDJA), §§ 27-8-101 et seq., MCA, and under the private attorney\n\ngeneral doctrine, first recognized by this Court in In re Dearborn Drainage Area, 240\n\nMont. 39, 43, 782 P.2d 898, 900 (1989). The court granted ATP’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on the merits of its constitutional claim, denied the State’s motion for summary\n\njudgment, declared § 13-35-227(1), MCA, unconstitutional, enjoined enforcement of the\n\nstatute, and denied ATP’s request for attorneys’ fees. The Attorney General appealed the\n\nDistrict Court’s summary judgment rulings and ATP appealed the denial of its request for\n\nattorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f¶5     On appeal, this Court reversed. A majority of the Court agreed with the Attorney\n\nGeneral’s position that Citizens United did not foreclose Montana from prohibiting\n\nindependent corporate expenditures on behalf of candidates.              Based on the record\n\ndeveloped in the District Court, this Court concluded that the State had a compelling\n\ninterest that justified the imposition of statutory restrictions that the Court determined\n\nwere narrowly tailored to meet its objectives. Western Tradition Partn., ¶¶ 47-48. We\n\ndid not reach ATP’s claim for fees, as it was mooted by our reversal of the District\n\nCourt’s summary judgment ruling. Western Tradition Partn., ¶ 48. Two members of the\n\nCourt dissented on the ground that Montana’s statute did not pass constitutional muster\n\nunder Citizens United. Western Tradition Partn., ¶¶ 49-60 (Baker, J., dissenting), ¶¶ 61-\n\n135 (Nelson, J., dissenting). The U.S. Supreme Court summarily reversed, ruling that\n\n“[t]here can be no serious doubt” that the holding of Citizens United applies to the\n\nMontana statute. American Tradition Partn., 567 U.S. at ___, 132 S. Ct. at 2491.\n\n¶6     We return now to ATP’s cross-appeal and consider whether it is entitled to recover\n\nits attorneys’ fees from the State of Montana under either the UDJA or the private\n\nattorney general doctrine.1 ATP seeks a total award of $138,403.01.\n\n                                 STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n¶7     We review for abuse of discretion a district court’s ruling granting or denying\n\nattorneys’ fees under either the UDJA or the private attorney general doctrine. Bitterroot\n\n1\n Although ATP’s renewed motion for fees also seeks a fee award under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, as\nprevailing parties in a proceeding to enforce 42 U.S.C. § 1983, this argument was not raised in or\ndecided by the District Court and we decline to consider it. Robison v. Mont. Dep’t of Revenue,\n2012 MT 145, ¶ 26, 365 Mont. 336, 281 P.3d 218.\n                                             4\n\fRiver Protective Ass’n v. Bitterroot Conserv. Dist., 2011 MT 51, ¶¶ 9-10, 359 Mont. 393,\n\n251 P.3d 131.\n\n                                      DISCUSSION\n\n¶8     Did the District Court abuse its discretion in declining to award attorneys’ fees?\n\n¶9     Montana follows the American Rule that, absent a specific statutory or contractual\n\nprovision, a prevailing party generally is not entitled to recovery of its attorneys’ fees in\n\nprosecuting or defending the action. Trustees of Ind. Univ. v. Buxbaum, 2003 MT 97,\n\n¶ 19, 315 Mont. 210, 69 P.3d 663. We have recognized equitable exceptions to the\n\nAmerican Rule, Buxbaum, ¶ 19, but construe these exceptions narrowly “lest they\n\nswallow the rule.” Jacobsen v. Allstate Ins. Co., 2009 MT 248, ¶ 23, 351 Mont. 464, 215\n\nP.3d 649. We have rejected the expansion of such equitable exceptions when the effect\n\nwould “drive a stake into the heart of the American Rule.” Jacobsen, ¶ 22 (quoting\n\nMountain West Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brewer, 2003 MT 98, ¶ 40, 315 Mont. 231,\n\n69 P.3d 652).\n\n       1. Statutory Basis for Fees\n\n¶10    Montana law provides that a prevailing party may recover attorneys’ fees against\n\nthe State of Montana only if “the court finds that the claim or defense of the state . . . was\n\nfrivolous or pursued in bad faith.” Section 25-10-711(1)(b), MCA. A claim or defense is\n\nfrivolous or in bad faith “when it is ‘outside the bounds of legitimate argument on a\n\nsubstantial issue on which there is a bona fide difference of opinion.’” Ostergren v. Dept.\n\nof Revenue, 2004 MT 30, ¶ 23, 319 Mont. 405, 85 P.3d 738 (quoting Jones v. City of\n\n                                          5\n\fBillings, 279 Mont. 341, 344, 927 P.2d 9, 11 (1996), and Armstrong v. State, Dept. of\n\nJustice, 250 Mont. 468, 469-70, 820 P.2d 1273, 1274 (1991)). In this case, the District\n\nCourt did not find the Attorney General’s position to be frivolous or in bad faith. To the\n\ncontrary, the court determined that the State’s arguments “were made in good faith and\n\nwere supported by briefs that were meticulously researched, well written, and well\n\nargued.”\n\n¶11   ATP argues that, despite its finding of good faith, the District Court erred by\n\nfailing to award fees under § 27-8-313, MCA, which serves as statutory authority for an\n\naward of fees in this case. That section does not specifically provide for an award of\n\nattorneys’ fees to a prevailing party, but does give a court the ability to grant\n\n“supplemental relief” in a case brought under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act\n\nwhen the court determines such relief to be “necessary or proper.” Wagner v. Woodward,\n\n2012 MT 19, ¶ 31, 363 Mont. 403, 270 P.3d 21 (citing Buxbaum, ¶ 42). While § 27-8-\n\n313, MCA, may provide a statutory basis for awarding fees, its reach is narrow. In order\n\nto avoid “eviscerat[ing]” the American Rule, we have determined that an award of fees to\n\nthe prevailing party is not warranted “in every garden variety declaratory judgment\n\naction[.]” Mungas v. Great Falls Clinic, LLP, 2009 MT 426, ¶ 44, 354 Mont. 50, 221\n\nP.3d 1230.\n\n¶12   Accordingly, we have required courts analyzing a claim for fees in a declaratory\n\njudgment proceeding to make a threshold determination that equitable considerations\n\nsupport an award of attorneys’ fees. Mungas, ¶ 45; Hughes v. Ahlgren, 2011 MT 189,\n\n                                        6\n\f¶¶ 13, 21, 361 Mont. 319, 258 P.3d 439; United Nat’l Ins. Co. v. St. Paul Fire & Marine\n\nIns. Co., 2009 MT 269, ¶ 39, 352 Mont. 105, 214 P.3d 1260.                      If that threshold\n\ndetermination is met, we apply a three-part “tangible parameters test” to determine\n\nwhether an award of fees is necessary or proper as required by § 27-8-313, MCA.\n\nRenville v. Farmers Ins. Exch., 2004 MT 366, ¶ 27, 324 Mont. 509, 105 P.3d 280.2 The\n\nDistrict Court concluded that, although the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act provided\n\nauthority for an award of fees, the court did not find it “necessary and proper to do so in\n\nthis case.” Because equitable considerations also inform the analysis of ATP’s claim for\n\nfees under the private attorney general doctrine, we will consider these arguments\n\ntogether.\n\n       2. Private Attorney General Doctrine\n\n¶13    The private attorney general doctrine is one of a handful of equitable exceptions\n\nthis Court has recognized to the American Rule. Buxbaum, ¶ 19. This doctrine “is\n\nnormally utilized when the government, for some reason, fails to properly enforce\n\ninterests which are significant to its citizens.” Montanans for the Responsible Use of the\n\nSch. Trust v. State ex rel. Bd. of Land Comm’rs (Montrust), 1999 MT 263, ¶ 64, 296\n\nMont. 402, 989 P.2d 800 (quoting Dearborn Drainage Area, 240 Mont. at 43, 782 P.2d at\n\n900). It, too, has been invoked sparingly. Since first recognizing the doctrine in 1989,\n\nwe have only twice used it to award or uphold the award of fees, and just once to a party\n\n2\n The three factors are “(1) an insurance company possesses what the plaintiffs sought in the\ndeclaratory relief action; (2) it is necessary to seek a declaration showing that the plaintiffs are\nentitled to the relief sought; and (3) the declaratory relief sought was necessary in order to\nchange the status quo.” Renville, ¶ 27.\n                                              7\n\fprevailing against the State. Montrust, ¶ 69 (fees awarded against the State); Bitterroot\n\nRiver Protective Ass’n, ¶ 37 (upholding award of fees against private parties).\n\n¶14    We held in Montrust that three factors should be considered in determining\n\nwhether to award fees under the private attorney general doctrine: “(1) the strength or\n\nsocietal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the necessity for\n\nprivate enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, (3) the\n\nnumber of people standing to benefit from the decision.”            Montrust, ¶ 66 (quoting\n\nSerrano v. Priest, 569 P.2d 1303, 1314 (Cal. 1977)). We have limited the award of fees\n\nunder the doctrine to cases “vindicating constitutional interests.”          Bitterroot River\n\nProtective Ass’n, ¶ 22. We have declined to apply the doctrine when the litigation\n\nprimarily served a party’s own pecuniary interests. Sunburst Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Texaco,\n\nInc., 2007 MT 183, ¶ 91, 338 Mont. 259, 165 P.3d 1079. We also consider whether an\n\naward of fees would be unjust under the circumstances. Finke v. State ex rel. McGrath,\n\n2003 MT 48, ¶ 33, 314 Mont. 314, 65 P.3d 576.\n\n¶15    ATP argues that it has vindicated important free speech rights that benefit all\n\nMontana citizens and corporations and will result in adding more thoughts and views to\n\nthe state’s political discourse. The Attorney General, conversely, argues that there is\n\nsubstantial overlap between ATP’s view of the public interest and its own pecuniary\n\ninterests, and that the District Court was justified in declining to award fees in this case.\n\n¶16    The constitutional principles underlying this litigation cannot be doubted. The\n\nU.S. Supreme Court’s order reaffirmed that “political speech does not lose First\n\n                                           8\n\fAmendment protection simply because its source is a corporation.” ATP v. Bullock, 567\n\nU.S. at ___, 132 S. Ct. at 2491 (quoting Citizens United, 558 U.S. at ___, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n900).   Our cases applying the private attorney general doctrine reflect the caution,\n\nhowever, “that the first factor not become for courts ‘assessments of the relative strength\n\nor weakness of public policies furthered by their decisions . . . a role closely approaching\n\nthat of the legislative function.’” Bitterroot Protective Ass’n, ¶ 22 (quoting Serrano, 569\n\nP.2d at 1314). The separation of powers between the branches requires us to use the\n\nsame caution to avoid interference with the executive function as well.\n\n¶17     “The Attorney General is the legal officer of the state and shall have the duties and\n\npowers provided by law.” Mont. Const. art. VI, § 4(4). It is the duty of the Attorney\n\nGeneral “to prosecute or defend all causes in the supreme court in which the state or any\n\nofficer of the state in the officer’s official capacity is a party or in which the state has an\n\ninterest.” Section 2-15-501(1), MCA. As an executive officer of the State of Montana,\n\nthe Attorney General determines when to prosecute or to defend cases in which the State\n\nhas an interest. Thus, if a challenge is brought to a state statute, the Attorney General has\n\ndiscretion to decide whether or not to defend its constitutionality. See In re W.C., 206\n\nMont. 432, 439, 671 P.2d 621, 624 (1983) (Attorney General does not have a duty to\n\nappear in every action concerning constitutionality of a statute); Associated Press v. State\n\nof Mont., 250 Mont. 299, 820 P.2d 421 (1991) (noting Attorney General’s concession that\n\nchallenged statute was unconstitutional). The courts necessarily must use caution in\n\nawarding fees against the State in a “garden variety” declaratory judgment action that\n\n                                           9\n\fchallenges the constitutionality of a statute that the Attorney General, in the exercise of\n\nhis executive power, has chosen to defend.\n\n¶18    The legislature has cabined this executive discretion by authorizing the courts to\n\nimpose fees when the State’s defense is frivolous or in bad faith.         Section 25-10-\n\n711(1)(b), MCA. While not dispositive, this standard also serves as a guidepost in\n\nanalyzing a claim for fees under the private attorney general doctrine.        This Court\n\nreversed a fee award in Dearborn Drainage Area where, notwithstanding the ruling’s\n\npotential “far reaching” effects, the State, through the Department of Fish, Wildlife and\n\nParks, had “acted in good faith and in accordance with constitutional and statutory\n\nmandates” in representing the public’s recreational use rights in the waters of Bean Lake.\n\nDearborn Drainage Area, 240 Mont. at 43, 782 P.2d at 900. In Montrust, on the other\n\nhand, we implied that since the private attorney general doctrine is an equitable exception\n\nto the American Rule, the statute was not controlling. Montrust, ¶ 64.\n\n¶19    Montrust, however, was not a “garden variety” constitutional challenge to a\n\nlegislative enactment. It involved unique issues raising the State’s breach of fiduciary\n\nduties imposed by the Montana Constitution and federal enabling laws under which the\n\nfederal government’s grant of lands to Montana for support of common schools\n\nconstitutes a trust for which the State is the trustee. Montrust, ¶¶ 13-14. As trustee, the\n\nState is obligated to obtain full market value for the school trust lands; the statutes in\n\nquestion were held to violate the State’s constitutional obligation and its duty of\n\nundivided loyalty to the trust beneficiary. Montrust, ¶¶ 14, 32, 42, 51, 58. In contrast,\n\n                                        10\n\fwe observed in Finke that fees against the State would not be appropriate under the\n\nprivate attorney general doctrine where “the only potential liability of the State for fees\n\nwould lie for the actions of the Legislature in enacting an unconstitutional bill.” Finke,\n\n¶ 34.\n\n¶20     In this case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the\n\nState mounted a good faith defense to § 13-35-227(1), MCA. While the Attorney\n\nGeneral did not prevail, it is difficult to conclude that his arguments were frivolous when\n\nfive members of this Court were convinced of their merit. In the final analysis, even\n\nthough ATP vindicated principles of constitutional magnitude, the State’s defense also\n\nwas grounded in constitutional principles and in an effort to enforce interests the\n\nexecutive deemed equally significant to its citizens. The Attorney General defended a\n\nstatute with deep roots in the State’s history, enacted by initiative of the people to combat\n\ncorruption that had resulted in the bribery of state judges and the embarrassment of\n\nseeing one of the State’s U.S. Senators unseated for also accepting bribes. Western\n\nTradition Partn., ¶¶ 23, 25. The challenge was brought in a time of shifting legal\n\nlandscapes, the contours of which still have not finally been defined.          Under these\n\ncircumstances, the predicate for an award of fees under the private attorney general\n\ndoctrine—“when the government, for some reason, fails to properly enforce interests\n\nwhich are significant to its citizens”—has not been established.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f                                       CONCLUSION\n\n¶21    We reverse a district court for abusing its discretion only “when it acts arbitrarily\n\nwithout employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason[,]\n\nresulting in substantial injustice.” B Bar J Ranch, LLC v. Carlisle Wide Plank Floors,\n\nInc., 2012 MT 246, ¶ 10, 366 Mont. 506, ___ P.3d ___. For the reasons discussed above,\n\nand given the District Court’s express determination that the State’s defense was\n\nmeticulously researched, well presented, and made in good faith, we cannot conclude that\n\nequitable considerations required it to award fees against the State under either the\n\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act or the private attorney general doctrine.\n\n¶22    The District Court’s order declining to award attorneys’ fees to the\n\nCross-Appellants is affirmed.\n\n                                                  /S/ BETH BAKER\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n/S/ MIKE McGRATH\n/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT\n/S/ PATRICIA COTTER\n/S/ BRIAN MORRIS\n/S/ JIM RICE\n\n\nJustice James C. Nelson, dissenting.\n\n¶23    I dissent from the Court’s denial of attorneys’ fees under the private attorney\n\ngeneral doctrine. I believe the Court errs in three respects.\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\f¶24       First, the District Court provided two distinct analyses of ATP’s two distinct\n\ntheories for seeking attorneys’ fees: one under the private attorney general doctrine and\n\nthe other under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act (§ 27-8-313, MCA). This Court\n\nprovides zero analysis of the District Court’s actual decision under the private attorney\n\ngeneral doctrine. Moreover, the Court fails to conduct its own distinct analysis under this\n\ndoctrine pursuant to the three Montrust factors. See Opinion, ¶ 14; Montanans for the\n\nResponsible Use of the Sch. Trust v. State ex rel. Bd. of Land Commrs. (Montrust), 1999\n\nMT 263, ¶ 67, 296 Mont. 402, 989 P.2d 800. Instead, the Court merges the private\n\nattorney general analysis into the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act analysis and\n\nthereby creates a sort of one-size-fits-all procedural “smoothie” for analyzing attorneys’\n\nfees requests under these two distinct doctrines.\n\n¶25       Second, the Court further confuses matters by injecting § 25-10-711, MCA, into\n\nthis case. That statute provides an independent basis for an award of attorneys’ fees. It\n\nstates:\n\n                  (1) In any civil action brought by or against the state, a political\n          subdivision, or an agency of the state or a political subdivision, the\n          opposing party, whether plaintiff or defendant, is entitled to the costs\n          enumerated in 25-10-201 and reasonable attorney fees as determined by the\n          court if:\n                  (a) the opposing party prevails against the state, political\n          subdivision, or agency; and\n                  (b) the court finds that the claim or defense of the state, political\n          subdivision, or agency that brought or defended the action was frivolous or\n          pursued in bad faith.\n                  (2) Costs may be granted pursuant to subsection (1) notwithstanding\n          any other provision of the law to the contrary.\n\n\n                                           13\n\fSection 25-10-711, MCA. If ATP had sought an award of attorneys’ fees pursuant to this\n\nprovision, then ATP would have been required to show (a) that it prevailed against the\n\nState and (b) that the State’s defense was “frivolous or pursued in bad faith.” What the\n\nCourt apparently fails to appreciate, however, is the fact that ATP did not seek an award\n\nof attorneys’ fees based on this statute. ATP relied, rather, on the private attorney general\n\ndoctrine and the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Hence, ATP was not required to\n\nshow that the State’s defense was “frivolous or pursued in bad faith.” It was required,\n\nrather, to establish the elements of the two doctrines upon which it relied.\n\n¶26    Notably, the district court in Montrust denied an award of attorneys’ fees under\n\n§ 25-10-711, MCA, because the action involved “neither frivolous conduct, extreme\n\nconduct, nor bad faith by the State.” Montrust, ¶ 60. On appeal, the State asserted the\n\nvery proposition stated at ¶ 10 of today’s Opinion—namely, that a prevailing party may\n\nrecover attorneys’ fees against the State only if the court finds that the claim or defense of\n\nthe State was frivolous or pursued in bad faith. See Montrust, ¶ 63. In other words, the\n\nState suggested that § 25-10-711, MCA, is a blanket limitation on an award of attorneys’\n\nfees against the State under any theory—what the Court effectively holds in today’s\n\ndecision. The statute contains no such language, however, and we therefore rejected the\n\nState’s proposition and instead adopted the private attorney general doctrine as a theory\n\nof recovery distinct from the entitlement to, and limitations on, an award of attorneys’\n\nfees under § 25-10-711, MCA. See Montrust, ¶¶ 64-67. We concluded that Montrust\n\nwas entitled to attorneys’ fees under the private attorney general theory, regardless of the\n\n                                          14\n\fdistrict court’s determination that the action involved “neither frivolous conduct, extreme\n\nconduct, nor bad faith by the State.” Montrust, ¶¶ 60, 69. The Court’s contrary approach\n\nin its decision today throws this entire area of law into a state of utter disarray.\n\n¶27    Third, the Court denies relief under ATP’s private attorney general theory based\n\nentirely on a sentence in the District Court’s order that was not part of the District Court’s\n\nreasoning under that theory. Specifically, the District Court observed that “[t]he State’s\n\narguments were made in good faith and were supported by briefs that were meticulously\n\nresearched, well written, and well argued.” This statement might be relevant if ATP were\n\npursuing a claim for attorneys’ fees under § 25-10-711, MCA. ATP is not relying on this\n\nstatute, however, as noted above. Furthermore, the District Court provided the foregoing\n\nquoted statement as its rationale for concluding that an award of attorneys’ fees was not\n\nproper under ATP’s Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act theory. The District Court\n\nprovided an entirely separate analysis of the private attorney general theory; this Court\n\nsimply chooses not to address the District Court’s specific reasoning under that theory.\n\n¶28    In short, and with due respect, I believe it is wrong—not to mention patently\n\nunfair—for this Court to reject ATP’s argument for attorneys’ fees based on the criteria\n\nof a statute (§ 25-10-711, MCA) that ATP never even invoked. Cf. Western Sec. Bank v.\n\nEide Bailly LLP, 2010 MT 291, ¶¶ 73, 81, 359 Mont. 34, 249 P.3d 35 (Nelson, J.,\n\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part) (“It will surely come as a surprise to Glacier,\n\nhowever, when it learns that it has lost this case because it failed to adequately support a\n\nclaim that it never even raised! . . . It is unfair to remake a plaintiff’s cause of action into\n\n                                           15\n\fsomething it never was intended to be and then to deny the plaintiff relief for failing to\n\nadequately support this remade cause.”). The Court completely muddles this area of law\n\nby blending the private attorney general doctrine and the Uniform Declaratory Judgments\n\nAct doctrine into a single analysis and then superimposing on that analysis the “frivolous\n\nor pursued in bad faith” criterion of § 25-10-711, MCA—contrary to our approach in\n\nMontrust. With this Opinion, we have effectively done away with the private attorney\n\ngeneral doctrine. Like the majority of the United States Supreme Court in Citizens\n\nUnited v. FEC, 558 U.S. 310, 130 S. Ct. 876 (2010), this Court has now remade this case\n\nso as to remake the law pertaining to the private attorney general doctrine.\n\n¶29    For the reasons which follow, I conclude and would hold that ATP is entitled to an\n\naward of attorneys’ fees under a proper application of the criteria of the private attorney\n\ngeneral doctrine, as set forth in Montrust.\n\n                        The Private Attorney General Doctrine\n\n¶30    This Court adopted the private attorney general doctrine in Montrust, ¶ 67. There\n\nare three factors to be considered in awarding attorneys’ fees under this doctrine: (1) the\n\nstrength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the\n\nnecessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the\n\nplaintiff, and (3) the number of people standing to benefit from the decision.\n\nMontrust, ¶ 66 (citing Serrano v. Priest, 569 P.2d 1303, 1314 (Cal. 1977)).\n\n¶31    In the present case, the District Court concluded under the first factor that the\n\nissues here are clearly very important. Second, the District Court reasoned that because\n\n                                         16\n\fthe Attorney General is required to defend the statute in question, private enforcement of\n\nthe important constitutional rights at issue was required. Third, however, although the\n\nDistrict Court had ruled in favor of ATP on the merits of its constitutional claim, the\n\ncourt opined that “there is no reasonable way of knowing ‘the number of people’ standing\n\nto benefit from this decision” (emphasis in original). For this latter reason, the District\n\nCourt denied an award of attorneys’ fees under the private attorney general doctrine.\n\n¶32    While I agree with the District Court’s analysis as to the first factor, and agree\n\nwith the District Court’s ultimate conclusion under the second factor, I do not agree with\n\nthe District Court’s reasoning regarding the third factor.        In my view, ATP has\n\nsuccessfully answered all three factors. I address each one in turn.\n\n                                         Factor 1\n\n¶33    First, as to the strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by\n\nthe litigation, it is hardly open to argument that ATP’s lawsuit secured against the\n\nproscriptions of Montana’s Corrupt Practices Act (in particular, § 13-35-227, MCA) the\n\nexpansive right of corporations and associations—as decreed by the United States\n\nSupreme Court under the First Amendment in Citizens United—to use general treasury\n\nfunds to make independent expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of\n\ncandidates. Absent this challenge, corporations and associations remained constrained\n\nand inhibited from making such independent expenditures in support of or against\n\ncandidates in Montana. Moreover, as the Ninth Circuit has recently held, the loss of such\n\nFirst Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, constitutes irreparable\n\n                                         17\n\finjury. Sanders County Republican Cent. Comm. v. Bullock, 698 F.3d 741, 748 (9th Cir.\n\n2012).\n\n                                             Factor 2\n\n¶34       Second, as to the necessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the\n\nresultant burden on the plaintiff, the Attorney General’s decision to defend the Corrupt\n\nPractices Act left ATP with no choice but to litigate its rights under Citizens United.\n\nIndeed, ATP took on the burden of vindicating the First Amendment rights of every\n\ncorporation, association, and person1 in the State of Montana.\n\n¶35       In this regard, I note my disagreement with the District Court’s reasoning that this\n\nis a case in which the Attorney General was “required to defend the statute.” I appreciate\n\nthat it is the Attorney General’s duty, generally, to defend the State and argue the validity\n\nof state statutes against attack. See § 2-15-501, MCA. However, as the Court points out,\n\nthe Attorney General has discretion in this regard and has even conceded that a\n\nchallenged statute was unconstitutional. Opinion, ¶ 17; In re W.C., 206 Mont. 432, 439,\n\n671 P.2d 621, 624 (1983); Associated Press v. State, 250 Mont. 299, 300, 820 P.2d 421,\n\n422 (1991). In the present case, given the clarity and breadth of the Citizens United\n\ndecision and the fact that the Supreme Court in Citizens United rejected every one—not\n\njust some, but all—of the arguments for upholding § 13-35-227, MCA,2 I cannot\n\n\n          1\n              I use the term “person” here deliberately, for reasons explained under the third\nfactor.\n          2\n        See Am. Tradition Partn. v. Bullock, ___ U.S. ___, 132 S. Ct. 2490, 2491 (2012)\n(per curiam) (“Montana’s arguments in support of the judgment below either were\nalready rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.”).\n                                             18\n\funderstand how, much less agree with the proposition that, the Attorney General had any\n\nsubstantial grounds to defend the statute against ATP’s challenge. Nor can I agree with\n\nthe Court’s suggestion that ATP’s challenge was brought in a time of “shifting legal\n\nlandscapes.” Opinion, ¶ 20. The Supreme Court was very clear as to the breadth of its\n\nholding in Citizens United. The Attorney General, like other elected officials of this\n\nState, takes an oath to “support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States\n\n. . . .” Mont. Const. art. III, § 3. The Constitution of the United States, as interpreted by\n\nthe Supreme Court in Citizens United, is “the supreme Law of the Land . . . , any Thing in\n\nthe Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary notwithstanding.” U.S. Const.\n\nart. VI, cl. 2. I am not going to repeat my analysis in Western Tradition Partn., Inc. v.\n\nAtty. Gen. of Montana, 2011 MT 328, ¶¶ 61-135, 363 Mont. 220, 271 P.3d 1 (Nelson, J.,\n\ndissenting). Suffice it to say that, in my view, such analysis could just as easily have\n\nbeen undertaken and adopted by the Attorney General (as a host of other state attorneys\n\ngeneral did), with the result that ATP’s litigation in the District Court would not have\n\nbeen necessary, ATP’s appeal to this Court would not have been necessary, and ATP’s\n\nappeal to the Supreme Court of the United States would not have been necessary.\n\n¶36    In any event, the important point is that the Attorney General’s decision to defend\n\nthe law made it necessary for ATP to enforce its rights under Citizens United. As for the\n\nmagnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, the State contends that ATP’s burden\n\nwas negligible because ATP’s attorneys “litigated this case only minimally. Plaintiffs\n\nconducted no discovery, swore out a couple of bare-bones affidavits, and in their two\n\n                                         19\n\fsummary judgment briefs below made no legal arguments not already contained within\n\nthe Citizens United opinion itself.” According to the State, “[t]his is far from the typical\n\ncase of private attorney general doctrine fee awards, which involves ‘significant legal\n\ncosts’ resulting from extensive discovery, expert testimony, and often trial.”\n\n¶37    There are two flaws in the State’s argument. First, the magnitude of the resultant\n\nburden on the plaintiff must be considered in relative terms. Here, the burden on ATP\n\nwas significant if one considers that ATP should not have been forced to pursue this\n\naction in the first place.   According to the Supreme Court, the Attorney General’s\n\narguments for upholding § 13-35-227(1), MCA, “either were already rejected in Citizens\n\nUnited, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.” Am. Tradition, 132 S. Ct. at 2491.\n\nYet, despite the clarity and breadth of the Citizens United decision, the Attorney General\n\ntook the position that Montana’s ban on independent expenditures is constitutional and\n\nenforceable. Regardless of the Attorney General’s rationale behind this decision, the\n\nundisputed result was that ATP had to incur the burden of litigating its rights—not only\n\nin the District Court, but also in appeals to this Court and the Supreme Court—against\n\narguments that “either were already rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully\n\ndistinguish that case.” Am. Tradition, 132 S. Ct. at 2491. In my view, given these facts,\n\nthe magnitude of the burden was great.\n\n¶38    Second, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that ATP’s burden was\n\n“minimal,” adopting the State’s approach would give plaintiffs in these sorts of cases an\n\nincentive to run up “significant legal costs”—even if the costs are unnecessary—in order\n\n                                         20\n\fto strengthen their claim for attorneys’ fees under the private attorney general doctrine.\n\nIn a case, such as the present one, which otherwise qualifies under that doctrine, the\n\nplaintiff should not be penalized for failing to incur “significant legal costs” in the\n\nprocess. It is truly ironic that the State is here complaining that ATP’s legal bills are not\n\nhigh enough. Such an approach to the private attorney general doctrine would not be in\n\nthe taxpayers’ best interests.\n\n¶39    For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that the necessity for private enforcement\n\nand the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff weigh in ATP’s favor. The\n\nSupreme Court spoke unequivocally in Citizens United; Montana chose to challenge the\n\napplication of Citizens United to Montana; and, predictably, Montana lost. Montana\n\nshould not now be heard to argue that ATP is not entitled to its attorneys’ fees for\n\nsuccessfully litigating a case that, in my view, ATP should not have been forced to\n\nlitigate in the first place.\n\n                                         Factor 3\n\n¶40    Finally, the third factor concerns the number of people standing to benefit from the\n\ndecision. There is no question that every corporation and association in Montana—and,\n\ndue to ATP’s appeal to the Supreme Court, every corporation and association in the\n\nUnited States—benefited from ATP’s filing and pursuance of this litigation. As a result\n\nof the instant lawsuit, each corporation and association has been guaranteed the ability to\n\nexercise, at the state level, the rights decreed in Citizens United, given that the Supreme\n\nCourt’s reversal of this Court’s decision removed any lingering doubt—implausible as\n\n                                         21\n\fthat doubt may have been3—about whether the application of Citizens United was limited\n\nto federal elections. See Am. Tradition, 132 S. Ct. at 2491 (“The question presented in\n\nthis case is whether the holding of Citizens United applies to the Montana state law.\n\nThere can be no serious doubt that it does.” (citing the Supremacy clause, U.S. Const.,\n\nart. VI, cl. 2)).\n\n¶41     As noted, the District Court concluded that the third factor was not met because\n\n“there is no reasonable way of knowing ‘the number of people’ standing to benefit” from\n\nthe District Court’s ruling in favor of ATP on the merits of its constitutional claim\n\n(emphasis in original). The District Court, however, cited no authority for its apparent\n\npremise that the term “people” in Montrust’s third factor is limited to human beings. The\n\nDistrict Court, it appears, simply assumed this to be true without analysis.\n\n¶42     Setting aside the controversial question whether corporations and associations are\n\n“persons,” however, the District Court overlooked a fundamental point of the Citizens\n\nUnited decision. As I recently discussed in Montanans Opposed to I-166 v. Bullock,\n\n2012 MT 168, ¶¶ 20-25, 365 Mont. 520, 285 P.3d 435 (Nelson, J., dissenting), Citizens\n\nUnited was not just about the rights of corporations and associations to speak. More\n\nimportantly, it was about the rights of citizens to hear and obtain information about\n\ncandidates from diverse sources without governmental censorship. Indeed, the Citizens\n\nUnited decision rested on two propositions: first, that expenditures (by a person or an\n\n        3\n        See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 903 (noting that a state ban on corporate\nindependent expenditures would be unconstitutional under the longstanding principle that\n“the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker’s\ncorporate identity”).\n                                         22\n\forganization) on political communication are a form of “speech”; and second, that\n\n“citizens [have the right] to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach\n\nconsensus.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898 (emphasis added). These propositions\n\nwere not created in Citizens United. Rather, they can be traced to Buckley v. Valeo, 424\n\nU.S. 1, 96 S. Ct. 612 (1976) (per curiam), and First Natl. Bank v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765,\n\n98 S. Ct. 1407 (1978).\n\n¶43    Of particular significance to the present discussion, the Supreme Court observed in\n\nBellotti that\n\n       [t]he court below framed the principal question in this case as whether and to\n       what extent corporations have First Amendment rights. We believe that the court\n       posed the wrong question. The Constitution often protects interests broader than\n       those of the party seeking their vindication. The First Amendment, in particular,\n       serves significant societal interests. The proper question therefore is not whether\n       corporations “have” First Amendment rights and, if so, whether they are\n       coextensive with those of natural persons. Instead, the question must be whether\n       [the state statute at issue] abridges expression that the First Amendment was\n       meant to protect.\n\n435 U.S. at 775-76, 98 S. Ct. at 1415 (emphasis added). The Bellotti Court stated further\n\nthat “[t]he inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public\n\ndoes not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union,\n\nor individual,” 435 U.S. at 777, 98 S. Ct. at 1416, and that “the First Amendment goes\n\nbeyond protection of the press and the self-expression of individuals to prohibit\n\ngovernment from limiting the stock of information from which members of the public may\n\ndraw,” 435 U.S. at 783, 98 S. Ct. at 1419 (emphasis added).\n\n¶44    Likewise, the Supreme Court stated in Citizens United that “it is inherent in the\n\nnature of the political process that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse\n                                           23\n\fsources in order to determine how to cast their votes” and that the First Amendment does\n\nnot allow “the exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public dialogue.” 130\n\nS. Ct. at 899 (emphases added). The Supreme Court observed that the First Amendment\n\nprotects the “open marketplace” of ideas, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899, and prohibits\n\nrestrictions on political speech based on the speaker’s identity, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 902-03. Because voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources, it is a\n\nviolation of the First Amendment to control expression by distinguishing among different\n\nspeakers and the subjects upon which they may speak. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n898-99. The Supreme Court held that this country’s law and tradition require more\n\nexpression, not less, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911, and that “[w]hen Government\n\nseeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may\n\nget his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses\n\ncensorship to control thought,” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908 (emphasis added).\n\n¶45    Clearly, then, the constitutional rights protected by the Citizens United decision\n\nare not just those of corporations; they are those of “people.” And the District Court was\n\nclearly wrong, therefore, in suggesting that “people” do not stand to benefit from the\n\nDistrict Court’s decision in favor of ATP or that there is no reasonable way of knowing\n\n“the number” of people standing to benefit from that decision. As a matter of federal\n\nconstitutional law, all Montana citizens—at least, every voter in Montana—benefitted\n\nfrom the District Court’s decision in favor of ATP under Citizens United. By virtue of\n\nthe District Court’s decision, which the Supreme Court has now tacitly affirmed, the\n\n                                         24\n\fState of Montana may not “use its full power, including the criminal law, to command\n\nwhere a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may\n\nnot hear.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908. The State no longer may “limit[ ] the stock\n\nof information from which members of the public may draw” when making their\n\nelectoral decisions. Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 783, 98 S. Ct. at 1419. ATP’s successful lawsuit\n\nvindicated not only the rights of corporations and associations to make independent\n\nexpenditures in support of or against candidates, but also the First Amendment rights of\n\nthe “people” of Montana to receive information about candidates from diverse sources\n\nwithout governmental censorship.4\n\n                                       Conclusion\n\n¶46    Based on the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the private attorney general\n\ndoctrine applies to ATP’s lawsuit. Accordingly, I would reverse the District Court’s\n\ndenial of attorneys’ fees. I would remand for a factual determination of ATP’s attorneys’\n\nfees and for the entry of judgment in ATP’s favor and against the State. I disagree with\n\nthis Court’s contrary decision.\n\n       4\n         While I accept, and agree with, the principle that the government does not have\nthe power “to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted\nsource he or she may not hear,” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908, I still have concerns\nabout the ability of corporations, associations, and those with extreme wealth to drown\nout other voices. Western Tradition, ¶ 127 (Nelson, J., dissenting). In my view, the\nprotections of the First Amendment, as with other constitutional provisions, ought to be\nbalanced. Western Tradition, ¶ 130 (Nelson, J., dissenting).

Western Tradition Partn., ¶¶ 2-33. Briefly stated, Plaintiffs Western Tradition\n\nPartnership—now known as American Tradition Partnership—Champion Painting, and\n\nMontana Shooting Sports Foundation (collectively referred to as ATP) sought a\n\ndeclaratory ruling that § 13-35-227(1), MCA, violated their rights to free speech\n\nguaranteed by the United States and Montana Constitutions by prohibiting political\n\nexpenditures by corporations on behalf of or opposing candidates for public office. ATP\n\nargued that the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Citizens United v. FEC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1741\"><a href=\"/opinion/1741/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2010), barred Montana from prohibiting independent and indirect\n\n\n\n\n                                        2\n\fcorporate expenditures on political speech, and that Montana’s century-old ban on\n\nindependent corporate expenditures therefore was invalid.\n\n¶3     The Attorney General defended the law’s constitutionality on the grounds that the\n\nlaw invalidated in Citizens United was distinguishable from the Montana statute, that\n\ncorporate rights could not be asserted against states in the same manner as against\n\nCongress, and that Montana has a compelling interest in requiring business corporations\n\nto use segregated funds for campaign expenditures. The Attorney General argued that\n\n§ 13-35-227(1), MCA, is narrowly tailored because it still allows for lobbying, testimony,\n\nand other direct contacts and that the Commissioner of Political Practices has interpreted\n\nthe law to exclude voluntary associations.\n\n¶4     The District Court entertained the parties’ cross-motions for summary judgment.\n\nATP’s motion included a request for attorneys’ fees under the Uniform Declaratory\n\nJudgments Act (UDJA), §§ 27-8-101 et seq., MCA, and under the private attorney\n\ngeneral doctrine, first recognized by this Court in In re Dearborn Drainage Area, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 43, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"880281\"><a href=\"/opinion/880281/matter-of-dearborn-drainage-area/\"><span class=\"volume\">782</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">898</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 900 (1989). The court granted ATP’s motion for summary\n\njudgment on the merits of its constitutional claim, denied the State’s motion for summary\n\njudgment, declared § 13-35-227(1), MCA, unconstitutional, enjoined enforcement of the\n\nstatute, and denied ATP’s request for attorneys’ fees. The Attorney General appealed the\n\nDistrict Court’s summary judgment rulings and ATP appealed the denial of its request for\n\nattorneys’ fees.\n\n\n\n\n                                         3\n\f¶5     On appeal, this Court reversed. A majority of the Court agreed with the Attorney\n\nGeneral’s position that Citizens United did not foreclose Montana from prohibiting\n\nindependent corporate expenditures on behalf of candidates.              Based on the record\n\ndeveloped in the District Court, this Court concluded that the State had a compelling\n\ninterest that justified the imposition of statutory restrictions that the Court determined\n\nwere narrowly tailored to meet its objectives. Western Tradition Partn., ¶¶ 47-48. We\n\ndid not reach ATP’s claim for fees, as it was mooted by our reversal of the District\n\nCourt’s summary judgment ruling. Western Tradition Partn., ¶ 48. Two members of the\n\nCourt dissented on the ground that Montana’s statute did not pass constitutional muster\n\nunder Citizens United. Western Tradition Partn., ¶¶ 49-60 (Baker, J., dissenting), ¶¶ 61-\n\n135 (Nelson, J., dissenting). The U.S. Supreme Court summarily reversed, ruling that\n\n“[t]here can be no serious doubt” that the holding of Citizens United applies to the\n\nMontana statute.

That section does not specifically provide for an award of\n\nattorneys’ fees to a prevailing party, but does give a court the ability to grant\n\n“supplemental relief” in a case brought under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act\n\nwhen the court determines such relief to be “necessary or proper.” Wagner v.

The\n\nU.S. Supreme Court’s order reaffirmed that “political speech does not lose First\n\n                                           8\n\fAmendment protection simply because its source is a corporation.” ATP v.

Our cases applying the private attorney general doctrine reflect the caution,\n\nhowever, “that the first factor not become for courts ‘assessments of the relative strength\n\nor weakness of public policies furthered by their decisions . . . a role closely approaching\n\nthat of the legislative function.’” Bitterroot Protective Ass’n, ¶ 22 (quoting Serrano, 569\n\nP.2d at 1314). The separation of powers between the branches requires us to use the\n\nsame caution to avoid interference with the executive function as well.\n\n¶17     “The Attorney General is the legal officer of the state and shall have the duties and\n\npowers provided by law.” Mont. Const. art. VI, § 4(4). It is the duty of the Attorney\n\nGeneral “to prosecute or defend all causes in the supreme court in which the state or any\n\nofficer of the state in the officer’s official capacity is a party or in which the state has an\n\ninterest.” Section 2-15-501(1), MCA. As an executive officer of the State of Montana,\n\nthe Attorney General determines when to prosecute or to defend cases in which the State\n\nhas an interest. Thus, if a challenge is brought to a state statute, the Attorney General has\n\ndiscretion to decide whether or not to defend its constitutionality.

The courts necessarily must use caution in\n\nawarding fees against the State in a “garden variety” declaratory judgment action that\n\n                                           9\n\fchallenges the constitutionality of a statute that the Attorney General, in the exercise of\n\nhis executive power, has chosen to defend.\n\n¶18    The legislature has cabined this executive discretion by authorizing the courts to\n\nimpose fees when the State’s defense is frivolous or in bad faith.         Section 25-10-\n\n711(1)(b), MCA. While not dispositive, this standard also serves as a guidepost in\n\nanalyzing a claim for fees under the private attorney general doctrine.        This Court\n\nreversed a fee award in Dearborn Drainage Area where, notwithstanding the ruling’s\n\npotential “far reaching” effects, the State, through the Department of Fish, Wildlife and\n\nParks, had “acted in good faith and in accordance with constitutional and statutory\n\nmandates” in representing the public’s recreational use rights in the waters of Bean Lake.\n\nDearborn Drainage Area, 240 Mont. at 43, 782 P.2d at 900. In Montrust, on the other\n\nhand, we implied that since the private attorney general doctrine is an equitable exception\n\nto the American Rule, the statute was not controlling. Montrust, ¶ 64.\n\n¶19    Montrust, however, was not a “garden variety” constitutional challenge to a\n\nlegislative enactment. It involved unique issues raising the State’s breach of fiduciary\n\nduties imposed by the Montana Constitution and federal enabling laws under which the\n\nfederal government’s grant of lands to Montana for support of common schools\n\nconstitutes a trust for which the State is the trustee. Montrust, ¶¶ 13-14. As trustee, the\n\nState is obligated to obtain full market value for the school trust lands; the statutes in\n\nquestion were held to violate the State’s constitutional obligation and its duty of\n\nundivided loyalty to the trust beneficiary. Montrust, ¶¶ 14, 32, 42, 51, 58. In contrast,\n\n                                        10\n\fwe observed in Finke that fees against the State would not be appropriate under the\n\nprivate attorney general doctrine where “the only potential liability of the State for fees\n\nwould lie for the actions of the Legislature in enacting an unconstitutional bill.” Finke,\n\n¶ 34.\n\n¶20     In this case, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the\n\nState mounted a good faith defense to § 13-35-227(1), MCA. While the Attorney\n\nGeneral did not prevail, it is difficult to conclude that his arguments were frivolous when\n\nfive members of this Court were convinced of their merit. In the final analysis, even\n\nthough ATP vindicated principles of constitutional magnitude, the State’s defense also\n\nwas grounded in constitutional principles and in an effort to enforce interests the\n\nexecutive deemed equally significant to its citizens. The Attorney General defended a\n\nstatute with deep roots in the State’s history, enacted by initiative of the people to combat\n\ncorruption that had resulted in the bribery of state judges and the embarrassment of\n\nseeing one of the State’s U.S. Senators unseated for also accepting bribes. Western\n\nTradition Partn., ¶¶ 23, 25. The challenge was brought in a time of shifting legal\n\nlandscapes, the contours of which still have not finally been defined.          Under these\n\ncircumstances, the predicate for an award of fees under the private attorney general\n\ndoctrine—“when the government, for some reason, fails to properly enforce interests\n\nwhich are significant to its citizens”—has not been established.\n\n\n\n\n                                          11\n\f                                       CONCLUSION\n\n¶21    We reverse a district court for abusing its discretion only “when it acts arbitrarily\n\nwithout employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason[,]\n\nresulting in substantial injustice.” B Bar J Ranch, LLC v.

For the reasons discussed above,\n\nand given the District Court’s express determination that the State’s defense was\n\nmeticulously researched, well presented, and made in good faith, we cannot conclude that\n\nequitable considerations required it to award fees against the State under either the\n\nUniform Declaratory Judgments Act or the private attorney general doctrine.\n\n¶22    The District Court’s order declining to award attorneys’ fees to the\n\nCross-Appellants is affirmed.\n\n                                                  /S/ BETH BAKER\n\n\nWe concur:\n\n/S/ MIKE McGRATH\n/S/ MICHAEL E WHEAT\n/S/ PATRICIA COTTER\n/S/ BRIAN MORRIS\n/S/ JIM RICE\n\n\nJustice James C.

This Court\n\nprovides zero analysis of the District Court’s actual decision under the private attorney\n\ngeneral doctrine. Moreover, the Court fails to conduct its own distinct analysis under this\n\ndoctrine pursuant to the three Montrust factors. See Opinion, ¶ 14; Montanans for the\n\nResponsible Use of the Sch. Trust v. State ex rel. Bd. of Land Commrs. (Montrust), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"884906\"><a href=\"/opinion/884906/school-trust-v-state-ex-rel-bd-of-comrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">1999</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶ 67, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">296</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">402</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"884906\"><a href=\"/opinion/884906/school-trust-v-state-ex-rel-bd-of-comrs/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Instead, the Court merges the private\n\nattorney general analysis into the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act analysis and\n\nthereby creates a sort of one-size-fits-all procedural “smoothie” for analyzing attorneys’\n\nfees requests under these two distinct doctrines.\n\n¶25       Second, the Court further confuses matters by injecting § 25-10-711, MCA, into\n\nthis case. That statute provides an independent basis for an award of attorneys’ fees. It\n\nstates:\n\n                  (1) In any civil action brought by or against the state, a political\n          subdivision, or an agency of the state or a political subdivision, the\n          opposing party, whether plaintiff or defendant, is entitled to the costs\n          enumerated in 25-10-201 and reasonable attorney fees as determined by the\n          court if:\n                  (a) the opposing party prevails against the state, political\n          subdivision, or agency; and\n                  (b) the court finds that the claim or defense of the state, political\n          subdivision, or agency that brought or defended the action was frivolous or\n          pursued in bad faith.\n                  (2) Costs may be granted pursuant to subsection (1) notwithstanding\n          any other provision of the law to the contrary.\n\n\n                                           13\n\fSection 25-10-711, MCA. If ATP had sought an award of attorneys’ fees pursuant to this\n\nprovision, then ATP would have been required to show (a) that it prevailed against the\n\nState and (b) that the State’s defense was “frivolous or pursued in bad faith.” What the\n\nCourt apparently fails to appreciate, however, is the fact that ATP did not seek an award\n\nof attorneys’ fees based on this statute. ATP relied, rather, on the private attorney general\n\ndoctrine and the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act. Hence, ATP was not required to\n\nshow that the State’s defense was “frivolous or pursued in bad faith.” It was required,\n\nrather, to establish the elements of the two doctrines upon which it relied.\n\n¶26    Notably, the district court in Montrust denied an award of attorneys’ fees under\n\n§ 25-10-711, MCA, because the action involved “neither frivolous conduct, extreme\n\nconduct, nor bad faith by the State.” Montrust, ¶ 60. On appeal, the State asserted the\n\nvery proposition stated at ¶ 10 of today’s Opinion—namely, that a prevailing party may\n\nrecover attorneys’ fees against the State only if the court finds that the claim or defense of\n\nthe State was frivolous or pursued in bad faith. See Montrust, ¶ 63. In other words, the\n\nState suggested that § 25-10-711, MCA, is a blanket limitation on an award of attorneys’\n\nfees against the State under any theory—what the Court effectively holds in today’s\n\ndecision. The statute contains no such language, however, and we therefore rejected the\n\nState’s proposition and instead adopted the private attorney general doctrine as a theory\n\nof recovery distinct from the entitlement to, and limitations on, an award of attorneys’\n\nfees under § 25-10-711, MCA. See Montrust, ¶¶ 64-67. We concluded that Montrust\n\nwas entitled to attorneys’ fees under the private attorney general theory, regardless of the\n\n                                          14\n\fdistrict court’s determination that the action involved “neither frivolous conduct, extreme\n\nconduct, nor bad faith by the State.” Montrust, ¶¶ 60, 69. The Court’s contrary approach\n\nin its decision today throws this entire area of law into a state of utter disarray.\n\n¶27    Third, the Court denies relief under ATP’s private attorney general theory based\n\nentirely on a sentence in the District Court’s order that was not part of the District Court’s\n\nreasoning under that theory. Specifically, the District Court observed that “[t]he State’s\n\narguments were made in good faith and were supported by briefs that were meticulously\n\nresearched, well written, and well argued.” This statement might be relevant if ATP were\n\npursuing a claim for attorneys’ fees under § 25-10-711, MCA. ATP is not relying on this\n\nstatute, however, as noted above. Furthermore, the District Court provided the foregoing\n\nquoted statement as its rationale for concluding that an award of attorneys’ fees was not\n\nproper under ATP’s Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act theory. The District Court\n\nprovided an entirely separate analysis of the private attorney general theory; this Court\n\nsimply chooses not to address the District Court’s specific reasoning under that theory.\n\n¶28    In short, and with due respect, I believe it is wrong—not to mention patently\n\nunfair—for this Court to reject ATP’s argument for attorneys’ fees based on the criteria\n\nof a statute (§ 25-10-711, MCA) that ATP never even invoked.

The Court completely muddles this area of law\n\nby blending the private attorney general doctrine and the Uniform Declaratory Judgments\n\nAct doctrine into a single analysis and then superimposing on that analysis the “frivolous\n\nor pursued in bad faith” criterion of § 25-10-711, MCA—contrary to our approach in\n\nMontrust.

There\n\nare three factors to be considered in awarding attorneys’ fees under this doctrine: (1) the\n\nstrength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by the litigation, (2) the\n\nnecessity for private enforcement and the magnitude of the resultant burden on the\n\nplaintiff, and (3) the number of people standing to benefit from the decision.\n\nMontrust, ¶ 66 (citing Serrano v. Priest, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1245386\"><a href=\"/opinion/1245386/serrano-v-priest/\"><span class=\"volume\">569</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1314 (Cal. 1977)).\n\n¶31    In the present case, the District Court concluded under the first factor that the\n\nissues here are clearly very important. Second, the District Court reasoned that because\n\n                                         16\n\fthe Attorney General is required to defend the statute in question, private enforcement of\n\nthe important constitutional rights at issue was required. Third, however, although the\n\nDistrict Court had ruled in favor of ATP on the merits of its constitutional claim, the\n\ncourt opined that “there is no reasonable way of knowing ‘the number of people’ standing\n\nto benefit from this decision” (emphasis in original). For this latter reason, the District\n\nCourt denied an award of attorneys’ fees under the private attorney general doctrine.\n\n¶32    While I agree with the District Court’s analysis as to the first factor, and agree\n\nwith the District Court’s ultimate conclusion under the second factor, I do not agree with\n\nthe District Court’s reasoning regarding the third factor.        In my view, ATP has\n\nsuccessfully answered all three factors. I address each one in turn.\n\n                                         Factor 1\n\n¶33    First, as to the strength or societal importance of the public policy vindicated by\n\nthe litigation, it is hardly open to argument that ATP’s lawsuit secured against the\n\nproscriptions of Montana’s Corrupt Practices Act (in particular, § 13-35-227, MCA) the\n\nexpansive right of corporations and associations—as decreed by the United States\n\nSupreme Court under the First Amendment in Citizens United—to use general treasury\n\nfunds to make independent expenditures expressly advocating the election or defeat of\n\ncandidates. Absent this challenge, corporations and associations remained constrained\n\nand inhibited from making such independent expenditures in support of or against\n\ncandidates in Montana. Moreover, as the Ninth Circuit has recently held, the loss of such\n\nFirst Amendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of time, constitutes irreparable\n\n                                         17\n\finjury.

See § 2-15-501, MCA. However, as the Court points out,\n\nthe Attorney General has discretion in this regard and has even conceded that a\n\nchallenged statute was unconstitutional.

The Supreme Court was very clear as to the breadth of its\n\nholding in Citizens United. The Attorney General, like other elected officials of this\n\nState, takes an oath to “support, protect and defend the constitution of the United States\n\n. . . .” Mont. Const. art. III, § 3.

Suffice it to say that, in my view, such analysis could just as easily have\n\nbeen undertaken and adopted by the Attorney General (as a host of other state attorneys\n\ngeneral did), with the result that ATP’s litigation in the District Court would not have\n\nbeen necessary, ATP’s appeal to this Court would not have been necessary, and ATP’s\n\nappeal to the Supreme Court of the United States would not have been necessary.\n\n¶36    In any event, the important point is that the Attorney General’s decision to defend\n\nthe law made it necessary for ATP to enforce its rights under Citizens United. As for the\n\nmagnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff, the State contends that ATP’s burden\n\nwas negligible because ATP’s attorneys “litigated this case only minimally. Plaintiffs\n\nconducted no discovery, swore out a couple of bare-bones affidavits, and in their two\n\n                                         19\n\fsummary judgment briefs below made no legal arguments not already contained within\n\nthe Citizens United opinion itself.” According to the State, “[t]his is far from the typical\n\ncase of private attorney general doctrine fee awards, which involves ‘significant legal\n\ncosts’ resulting from extensive discovery, expert testimony, and often trial.”\n\n¶37    There are two flaws in the State’s argument. First, the magnitude of the resultant\n\nburden on the plaintiff must be considered in relative terms. Here, the burden on ATP\n\nwas significant if one considers that ATP should not have been forced to pursue this\n\naction in the first place.   According to the Supreme Court, the Attorney General’s\n\narguments for upholding § 13-35-227(1), MCA, “either were already rejected in Citizens\n\nUnited, or fail to meaningfully distinguish that case.” Am. Tradition, 132 S. Ct. at 2491.\n\nYet, despite the clarity and breadth of the Citizens United decision, the Attorney General\n\ntook the position that Montana’s ban on independent expenditures is constitutional and\n\nenforceable. Regardless of the Attorney General’s rationale behind this decision, the\n\nundisputed result was that ATP had to incur the burden of litigating its rights—not only\n\nin the District Court, but also in appeals to this Court and the Supreme Court—against\n\narguments that “either were already rejected in Citizens United, or fail to meaningfully\n\ndistinguish that case.” Am. Tradition, 132 S. Ct. at 2491. In my view, given these facts,\n\nthe magnitude of the burden was great.\n\n¶38    Second, even assuming, for the sake of argument, that ATP’s burden was\n\n“minimal,” adopting the State’s approach would give plaintiffs in these sorts of cases an\n\nincentive to run up “significant legal costs”—even if the costs are unnecessary—in order\n\n                                         20\n\fto strengthen their claim for attorneys’ fees under the private attorney general doctrine.\n\nIn a case, such as the present one, which otherwise qualifies under that doctrine, the\n\nplaintiff should not be penalized for failing to incur “significant legal costs” in the\n\nprocess. It is truly ironic that the State is here complaining that ATP’s legal bills are not\n\nhigh enough. Such an approach to the private attorney general doctrine would not be in\n\nthe taxpayers’ best interests.\n\n¶39    For the foregoing reasons, I would hold that the necessity for private enforcement\n\nand the magnitude of the resultant burden on the plaintiff weigh in ATP’s favor. The\n\nSupreme Court spoke unequivocally in Citizens United; Montana chose to challenge the\n\napplication of Citizens United to Montana; and, predictably, Montana lost. Montana\n\nshould not now be heard to argue that ATP is not entitled to its attorneys’ fees for\n\nsuccessfully litigating a case that, in my view, ATP should not have been forced to\n\nlitigate in the first place.\n\n                                         Factor 3\n\n¶40    Finally, the third factor concerns the number of people standing to benefit from the\n\ndecision. There is no question that every corporation and association in Montana—and,\n\ndue to ATP’s appeal to the Supreme Court, every corporation and association in the\n\nUnited States—benefited from ATP’s filing and pursuance of this litigation. As a result\n\nof the instant lawsuit, each corporation and association has been guaranteed the ability to\n\nexercise, at the state level, the rights decreed in Citizens United, given that the Supreme\n\nCourt’s reversal of this Court’s decision removed any lingering doubt—implausible as\n\n                                         21\n\fthat doubt may have been3—about whether the application of Citizens United was limited\n\nto federal elections. See Am. Tradition, 132 S. Ct. at 2491 (“The question presented in\n\nthis case is whether the holding of Citizens United applies to the Montana state law.\n\nThere can be no serious doubt that it does.” (citing the Supremacy clause, U.S. Const.,\n\nart. VI, cl. 2)).\n\n¶41     As noted, the District Court concluded that the third factor was not met because\n\n“there is no reasonable way of knowing ‘the number of people’ standing to benefit” from\n\nthe District Court’s ruling in favor of ATP on the merits of its constitutional claim\n\n(emphasis in original). The District Court, however, cited no authority for its apparent\n\npremise that the term “people” in Montrust’s third factor is limited to human beings. The\n\nDistrict Court, it appears, simply assumed this to be true without analysis.\n\n¶42     Setting aside the controversial question whether corporations and associations are\n\n“persons,” however, the District Court overlooked a fundamental point of the Citizens\n\nUnited decision. As I recently discussed in Montanans Opposed to I-166 v. Bullock,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"890082\"><a href=\"/opinion/890082/opposed-to-i-166-v-bullock/\"><span class=\"volume\">2012</span> <span class=\"reporter\">MT</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, ¶¶ 20-25, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mont.</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Nelson, J., dissenting), Citizens\n\nUnited was not just about the rights of corporations and associations to speak. More\n\nimportantly, it was about the rights of citizens to hear and obtain information about\n\ncandidates from diverse sources without governmental censorship. Indeed, the Citizens\n\nUnited decision rested on two propositions: first, that expenditures (by a person or an\n\n        3\n        See Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 903 (noting that a state ban on corporate\nindependent expenditures would be unconstitutional under the longstanding principle that\n“the First Amendment does not allow political speech restrictions based on a speaker’s\ncorporate identity”).\n                                         22\n\forganization) on political communication are a form of “speech”; and second, that\n\n“citizens [have the right] to inquire, to hear, to speak, and to use information to reach\n\nconsensus.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 898 (emphasis added). These propositions\n\nwere not created in Citizens United. Rather, they can be traced to Buckley v. Valeo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1407</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1978).\n\n¶43    Of particular significance to the present discussion, the Supreme Court observed in\n\nBellotti that\n\n       [t]he court below framed the principal question in this case as whether and to\n       what extent corporations have First Amendment rights. We believe that the court\n       posed the wrong question. The Constitution often protects interests broader than\n       those of the party seeking their vindication. The First Amendment, in particular,\n       serves significant societal interests. The proper question therefore is not whether\n       corporations “have” First Amendment rights and, if so, whether they are\n       coextensive with those of natural persons. Instead, the question must be whether\n       [the state statute at issue] abridges expression that the First Amendment was\n       meant to protect.\n\n435 U.S. at 775-76, 98 S. Ct. at 1415 (emphasis added). The Bellotti Court stated further\n\nthat “[t]he inherent worth of the speech in terms of its capacity for informing the public\n\ndoes not depend upon the identity of its source, whether corporation, association, union,\n\nor individual,” 435 U.S. at 777, 98 S. Ct. at 1416, and that “the First Amendment goes\n\nbeyond protection of the press and the self-expression of individuals to prohibit\n\ngovernment from limiting the stock of information from which members of the public may\n\ndraw,” 435 U.S. at 783, 98 S. Ct. at 1419 (emphasis added).\n\n¶44    Likewise, the Supreme Court stated in Citizens United that “it is inherent in the\n\nnature of the political process that voters must be free to obtain information from diverse\n                                           23\n\fsources in order to determine how to cast their votes” and that the First Amendment does\n\nnot allow “the exclusion of a class of speakers from the general public dialogue.” 130\n\nS. Ct. at 899 (emphases added). The Supreme Court observed that the First Amendment\n\nprotects the “open marketplace” of ideas, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899, and prohibits\n\nrestrictions on political speech based on the speaker’s identity, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct.\n\nat 902-03. Because voters must be free to obtain information from diverse sources, it is a\n\nviolation of the First Amendment to control expression by distinguishing among different\n\nspeakers and the subjects upon which they may speak. Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at\n\n898-99. The Supreme Court held that this country’s law and tradition require more\n\nexpression, not less, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 911, and that “[w]hen Government\n\nseeks to use its full power, including the criminal law, to command where a person may\n\nget his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may not hear, it uses\n\ncensorship to control thought,” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908 (emphasis added).\n\n¶45    Clearly, then, the constitutional rights protected by the Citizens United decision\n\nare not just those of corporations; they are those of “people.” And the District Court was\n\nclearly wrong, therefore, in suggesting that “people” do not stand to benefit from the\n\nDistrict Court’s decision in favor of ATP or that there is no reasonable way of knowing\n\n“the number” of people standing to benefit from that decision. As a matter of federal\n\nconstitutional law, all Montana citizens—at least, every voter in Montana—benefitted\n\nfrom the District Court’s decision in favor of ATP under Citizens United. By virtue of\n\nthe District Court’s decision, which the Supreme Court has now tacitly affirmed, the\n\n                                         24\n\fState of Montana may not “use its full power, including the criminal law, to command\n\nwhere a person may get his or her information or what distrusted source he or she may\n\nnot hear.” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908. The State no longer may “limit[ ] the stock\n\nof information from which members of the public may draw” when making their\n\nelectoral decisions. Bellotti, 435 U.S. at 783, 98 S. Ct. at 1419. ATP’s successful lawsuit\n\nvindicated not only the rights of corporations and associations to make independent\n\nexpenditures in support of or against candidates, but also the First Amendment rights of\n\nthe “people” of Montana to receive information about candidates from diverse sources\n\nwithout governmental censorship.4\n\n                                       Conclusion\n\n¶46    Based on the foregoing analysis, I conclude that the private attorney general\n\ndoctrine applies to ATP’s lawsuit. Accordingly, I would reverse the District Court’s\n\ndenial of attorneys’ fees. I would remand for a factual determination of ATP’s attorneys’\n\nfees and for the entry of judgment in ATP’s favor and against the State. I disagree with\n\nthis Court’s contrary decision.\n\n       4\n         While I accept, and agree with, the principle that the government does not have\nthe power “to command where a person may get his or her information or what distrusted\nsource he or she may not hear,” Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 908, I still have concerns\nabout the ability of corporations, associations, and those with extreme wealth to drown\nout other voices. Western Tradition, ¶ 127 (Nelson, J., dissenting). In my view, the\nprotections of the First Amendment, as with other constitutional provisions, ought to be\nbalanced. Western Tradition, ¶ 130 (Nelson, J., dissenting). In this respect, while all\nspeakers—corporations, associations, and individuals alike—have the right to contribute\nto the “open marketplace” of ideas, Citizens United, 130 S. Ct. at 899, no one contributor\nshould be able to monopolize the marketplace to the exclusion of other potential\ncontributors. There can be no open exchange of ideas and debate if some of the parties to\nthe conversation cannot afford to get a word in edgewise.\n                                        25\n\f¶47   I dissent.\n\n\n                        /S/ JAMES C.
