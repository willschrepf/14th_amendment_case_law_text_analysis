In doing so, the proper construction to be given\n\nthe Correction Warranty Deed clearly would show that the grantor did not\n\nintend to re-convey more property to the grantee than what was originally\n\nreceived by the grantor.         Furthermore, the intent and purpose of the\n\nCorrection Warranty Deed is, and was, to describe the interest being re-\n\n\n1\n The Index for the Clerk’s Record has incorrect filing dates and typographical errors.\nReferences in Appellants’ Brief shall be to the file-stamped pleadings and not the Index.\n\n                                           1\n\fconveyed in terms of a “non-participating royalty interest” rather than a\n\n“mineral interest” with reservations.\n\n      The Johnie Acker Heirs maintain, to the contrary, that the Correction\n\nWarranty Deed should be read without regard to the referenced prior 1965\n\ndeed that it corrected in order to grant them more than what was originally\n\ngiven to Mabel Snowden.\n\n      This Court of Appeals, in a previous related case involving the same\n\nparties, interpreted these same mineral conveyances. Consequently, the\n\nintent and character of the interests being conveyed is clear as to the\n\nconveyances referenced in this appeal. Accordingly, this Court should\n\nreverse the summary judgment granted in favor of the Johnie Acker Heirs\n\nand render summary judgment in favor of the Mabel Snowden Heirs.\n\nProcedural History\n\n      On June 21, 2012, Swift Energy filed Plaintiff’s Original Petition in\n\nInterpleader.2 (CR 001-010) On July 30, 2012, the Mabel Snowden Heirs\n\nfiled their original answer, original counterclaim, and cross-action in\n\ninterpleader.

E. Murphy, now deceased, had five (5) children: (i) Mabel M.\n\nSnowden, (ii) Johnie Lorene Acker, (iii) Edna Mae Jones, (iv) Julia Authelia\n\nAkers, (v) Emmett Granvel Murphy. The Mabel Snowden Heirs are the\n\nchildren of Mabel M. Snowden. The Johnie Acker Heirs are the heirs of\n\nJohni Lorene Acker.\n\n     J. E. Murphy owned four (4) separate ranches prior to his death.\n\nUpon his death, his 5 children owned undivided interests in each of the\n\nranches, including the entire mineral estate. In accordance with the estate\n\nplanning wishes of J. E. Murphy, all 5 children executed 4 deeds on October\n\n21, 1948 partitioning the surface estates of the 4 ranches to his 4 children\n\nexcluding Mabel M. Snowden. In lieu of conveying a ranch to Mabel M.\n\nSnowden, she received cash of equal value since Mabel M. Snowden had\n\npreviously acquired a ranch in 1945 in Dimmit and La Salle Counties. (CR\n\n71-88; App. 3) (CR 089-094; App. 4)\n\n     Each of the four separate surface deeds to the four children, (“1948\n\nMurphy Estate Partition Deeds”), provides as follows:\n\n                                      5\n\f     “ … the parties (the 5 children) shall continue to own and hold in\n     common all of the oil, gas, and other minerals in the same undivided\n     proportion …. it being further provided, however, anything in the\n     foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, that the grantee of the\n     surface estate … shall have the exclusive right to execute … mineral\n     lease(s) … and receive, as (his/her) separate property, such bonuses,\n     oil payments, and rentals as may be paid under said .. mineral leases\n     …     except that (he/she) shall reserve in each …. mineral lease … a\n     base one-eighth (1/8) royalty interest for the benefit of\n     (herself/himself) and the other four children .. in the same proportion\n     they now own same.” (CR 71-88; App. 3)\n\nSix days thereafter, on October 27, 1948, Mabel M. Snowden executed a\n\nNon-Participating Mineral Deed, (“1948 Snowden NPMD”), in connection\n\nwith her existing ranch in Dimmitt and LaSalle Counties, (the “Snowden\n\nRanch”). In furtherance of the estate planning design of J. E. Murphy, the\n\n1948 Snowden NPMD conveyed an undivided four-fifths (4/5) interest in\n\nand to 1/8th of the royalty from all oil, gas and minerals in and under the\n\nSnowden Ranch to the 4 siblings of Mabel M. Snowden. The 1948 Snowden\n\nNPMD specifically contained a reservation identical in substance as the\n\n1948 Murphy Estate Partition Deeds, to-wit:\n\n      “It is further agreed that Grantees [the other four siblings] shall have\nno interest in any bonus money or oil payment above the one-eighth\n(1/8th) royalty received by the Grantors in any future lease or leases given\non said land and that it shall not be necessary for the Grantees to join in\nany such lease or leases so made; that Grantees shall receive under such\nlease or leases four-fifths (the same being one-fifth (1/5th) to each Grantee)\npart of all the oil, gas and other minerals taken and saved under any such\nlease or leases and he or she shall receive the same out of the royalty\nprovided for in such lease or leases, but Grantees shall have no part in the\n\n                                      6\n\fannual rentals paid to keep such lease or leases in force until drilling is\nbegun.” (CR 095-100; App. 5) (emphasis added)\n\nMabel M. Snowden thereby conveyed only a fixed 1/5th of 1/8th royalty to\n\neach of her four siblings, including Johnie Lorene Acker, in the Mabel\n\nSnowden NPMD. (CR 095-100; App. 5)\n\n      In 1953, the five siblings wanted confirmation from each other as to\n\nthe estate planning intent of their father and, in particular, their respective\n\nrights as surface owners to the mineral estate on their lands. (CR 101-106;\n\nApp. 6) Accordingly, on December 9, 1953, Johnie Lorene Acker and Mabel\n\nMullen Snowden, as well as the other siblings, executed a recordable\n\ndeclaration and agreement, (“Declaration & Agreement”), confirming to\n\neach other as follows:\n\n      “[We] hereby declare, that in making the division of the property in\n      the Estate of J. E. Murphy, deceased, it was the intention of said\n      parties to grant to the party receiving the surface, the right to\n      receive all rentals from oil, gas and mineral leases then on said land\n      so granted and to receive all bonuses and rentals on leases that\n      might thereafter be made by the party to whom the surface was\n      conveyed by Special Warranty Deed, provided, however, that the\n      Lessor in said oil, gas and mineral lease, so executed by him or her,\n      should reserve, in each oil, gas and mineral leases so executed, a\n      basic one-eighth (1/8) royalty interest ..... for the benefit of the\n      Lessor and the other children of J. E. Murphy, deceased, and those\n      claiming under said children or child .......\n      (CR 101-106; App. 6) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\fConveyance/Re-Conveyance of Snowden Ranch Royalty Interests\n\n     On or about December 31, 1953, Mabel M. Snowden sought to borrow\n\nmoney against the Snowden Ranch. (CR 107-110; App. 7) As a condition of\n\nthe loan, the bank required that Mabel M. Snowden own at least three-\n\nfifths (3/5ths) of the mineral interest in the Snowden Ranch. (CR 107-110;\n\nApp. 7) At that time, she only owned 1/5th of 1/8th royalty interest together\n\nwith all rights to the minerals and production over and above the 4/5ths of\n\n1/8th royalty conveyed to her siblings. Consequently, at Mabel M.\n\nSnowden’s request, Johnie Lorene Acker and Virginia Gertrude Akers\n\nMurphy, (being the surviving wife of Emmett Granvel Murphy and sole\n\ndevisee under his Last Will and Testament), conveyed to Mabel M.\n\nSnowden their respective one-fifth (1/5) of said 1/8 royalty interests in the\n\nSnowden Ranch by Royalty Deed dated December 31, 1953, so that Mabel\n\nM. Snowden then owned a total of three-fifths (3/5) of said base (or basic)\n\nroyalty interest in the Snowden Ranch together with all rights to the\n\nminerals and production therefrom over and above the remaining 2/5ths of\n\n1/8th royalty in favor of her other siblings, (“1953 Royalty Deed”). (CR 107-\n\n110; App. 7)\n\n     When Mabel M. Snowden paid the note to the bank, she re-conveyed\n\nthe same royalty interest back to Johnie Lorene Acker on March 25, 1965 by\n\n                                     8\n\finstrument, (“1965 Mineral Deed”), that provided:\n\n[Mabel M. Snowden] granted and conveyed to Johnie Lorene Acker an ....\n\n      “undivided one-fifth (1/5th) interest as her separate, sole and\n      individual property in and to all of the oil, gas and other minerals in\n      and to the land hereinafter described, the mineral interest hereby\n      conveyed being all of the interest conveyed by Johnie Lorene Acker\n      to Mabel M. Snowden by deed dated December 31, 1953, and\n      recorded in Volume X-4, Page 355, Deed Records of La Salle County,\n      Texas.” (CR 111-114; App. 8)\n\nThe royalty interest of Virginia Gertrude Akers Murphy was, by agreement,\n\nretained by Mabel M. Snowden as part of the Mabel M. Snowden estate.\n\n(CR 111-114; App. 8)\n\n      In or about 1980, a title search was conducted on the Snowden Ranch\n\nby a prospective oil and gas lessee. (CR 115-120; App. 9) In that process, it\n\nbecame desirable to express the re-conveyance to the Johnie Acker Heirs in\n\nterms of a non-participating royalty interest, (“NPRI”), rather than a\n\nmineral interest with reservations. (CR 115-120; App. 9) Consequently,\n\nMabel M. Snowden and Johnie Lorene Acker agreed to correct and clarify\n\nthe 1965 Mineral Deed to express the conveyance in terms of an NPRI. (CR\n\n115-120; App. 9)\n\n      Therefore, on or about June 24, 1980, (but effective as of March 25,\n\n1965), a Correction Warranty Deed was prepared and executed that stated,\n\nin pertinent part:\n\n                                      9\n\f      “in place of and as a Deed of Correction” to the March 25, 1965 deed\n      “wherein by error or mistake, Grantors conveyed to Grantee an\n      undivided one-fifth (1/5th) mineral interest in and to all of the oil, gas\n      and other minerals, when in truth and fact Grantor should have\n      conveyed an undivided non-participating 1/5th of the whole and\n      entire royalty interest, ….” (CR 115-120; App. 9)\n\n      On December 1, 2009, the Mabel Snowden Heirs executed an oil and\n\ngas lease with Swift Energy, (the “Swift Lease”), which provided a 25%\n\nroyalty to the mineral estate owners. (CR 121-159; App. 10) When Swift\n\ncirculated a division order to the mineral owners, the Johnie Acker Heirs\n\nasserted that they were enitled to 1/5th of ¼ (25%) of the royalties under\n\nthe Swift Lease rather than 1/5th of 1/8th as set forth in the 1948 Snowden\n\nNPMD.     The claim caused Swift to suspend royalty payments and the\n\ninstitution of the present interpleader lawsuit.\n\n      In the lawsuit, the Johnie Acker Heirs, contend that the 1965 Mineral\n\nDeed, as corrected in 1980, entitles them to 1/5 share of the 25% royalties\n\nunder the Swift Lease, not just the 1/5 of 1/8th (12.5% of the royalties) as\n\nprovided in the original 1948 Mabel Snowden NPMD. (CR 111-114; App. 8)\n\n(CR 115-120; App. 9)\n\n      The Mabel Snowden Heirs, on the other hand, maintain that the 1948\n\nMabel Snowden NPMD and the succeeding conveyances, all of which were\n\nincorporated into the 1980 Correction Deed, express the clear intent to\n\n\n                                      10\n\fconvey only an undivided 1/5th of 1/8th royalty interest (1/5th x 12.5%\n\nroyalty) to each of the siblings and their heirs, including the Johnie Acker\n\nHeirs, while reserving to the surface owner, the Mabel Snowden Heirs, all\n\nroyalty and incidents of the mineral estate above that amount. (CR 115-120;\n\nApp. 9)\n\n        The Mabel Snowden Heirs’ interpretation has clear support under the\n\n1948 Murphy Estate Partition Deeds, the 1948 Snowden NPMD, and\n\nsubsequent conveyance documents:\n\n        First, the 1980 Correction Warranty Deed, the 1965 Mineral Deed,\n\nand the 1953 Royalty Deed each refer back to the interests conveyed by the\n\n1948 Snowden NPMD. (CR 115-120; App. 9) (CR 111-114; App. 8) (CR 107-\n\n110; App. 7) (CR 095-100; App. 5) The 1948 Snowden NPMD restricts the\n\nconveyance to the four siblings to only a portion of the mineral interest,\n\nthat being an undivided one-fifth (1/5th) of one-eighth (1/8th) royalty,\n\nreserving all other aspects of the mineral estate to the Mabel Snowden\n\nHeirs. (CR 095-100; App. 5)\n\n        Second, the 1980 Correction Warranty Deed clearly states in relevant\n\npart:\n\n        “This Deed is made in place of and as a Deed of Correction of [the\n        1965 Mineral Deed] wherein by error or mistake, Grantors conveyed\n        to Grantee an undivided 1/5th mineral interest in and to all of the oil,\n\n                                        11\n\f     gas and other minerals, when in truth and fact Grantors should have\n     conveyed an undivided non-participating 1/5th of the whole and\n     entire royalty interest, and this instrument …, in all other respects\n     confirming said former Deed .....” (CR 115-120; App. 9) (emphasis\n     added)\n\n     Consequently, when reading the 1965 Mineral Deed together with the\n\nthe 1980 Correction Warranty Deed results in the following construction:\n\n     Mabel M. Snowden conveys to Johnie Lorene Acker:\n\n     “an undivided non-participating one-fifth (1/5) of the whole and\n     entire royalty interest as her separate, sole and individual property in\n     and to all of the oil, gas and other minerals in and to the land\n     hereinafter described, the mineral interest hereby conveyed being\n     all of the interest conveyed by Johnie Lorene Acker to\n     Mabel M. Snowden by deed dated December 31, 1953, and\n     recorded in Volume X-4, Page 355, Deed Records of La Salle\n     County, Texas.” (CR 111-114; App. 8) (emphasis added)\n\n     Third, it is irrefutable that the December 31, 1953 Deed from Johnie\n\nLorene Acker to Mabel M. Snowden, conveyed “all of the interest previously\n\nconveyed by Mabel M. Snowden to Johnie Lorene Acker … by Deed dated\n\nOctober 27, 1948 .... (i.e. the 1948 Snowden NPMD)” (CR 107-110; App. 7)\n\n     Fourth, the 1948 Snowden NPMD makes it absolutely clear that\n\nJohnie Lorene Acker and the other siblings received no interest in any “oil\n\npayment above the one-eighth (1/8th) royalty received by the Grantors in\n\nany future lease or leases.” (CR 095-100; App. 5) None of the other heirs\n\ncontested this fact and indeed the subject Final Judgment entered in this\n\n\n                                     12\n\fcase resolves any issues concerning same.\n\n     Fifth, the Declaration and Agreement executed by the parties on\n\nDecember 9, 1953 makes it absolutely clear that the siblings and their heirs\n\nare to receive only an undivided 1/5th of “a basic one-eighth (1/8) royalty\n\ninterest” from the other siblings’ mineral estate. (CR 101-106; App. 6)\n\n     Accordingly, the “whole and entire royalty interest” language\n\ncontained in the 1980 deed must be construed with reference to the 1965\n\nMineral Deed and constitutes a reference to the entire base (or basic) 1/8th\n\nroyalty, as consistently set forth in the family’s series of deeds and\n\ndeclarations in 1948, 1953 and 1965 describing the royalty held in common\n\nby the five Murphy siblings and their heirs and assigns. (CR 095-100; App.\n\n5) (CR 101-106; App. 6) (CR 107-110; App. 7) (CR 111-114; App. 8) (CR 115-\n\n120; App. 9)\n\nThis Court of Appeals previously interpreted the 1948 Murphy\nEstate Partition Deeds, including the 1948 Snowden NPMD, and\nthe 1953 Declaration and Agreement\n\n     In 1988, a lawsuit was filed to determine the intent and terms of the\n\nshared family royalty interest between the Johnie Acker Heirs, Julia\n\nAuthelia Akers (known at that time as Julia Authelia Winslow), and Mabel\n\nM. Snowden and some of her heirs. (CR 247-252; App. 12) In that dispute,\n\nthe Johnie Acker Heirs had entered into several oil and gas leases on the\n\n                                     13\n\fAcker ranch whereby overriding royalties were conveyed to Edwin Acker,\n\nJr. (CR 247-252; App. 12)\n\n      The plaintiffs in the 1988 lawsuit (being Julia Authelia Winslow,\n\nMabel M. Snowden and others) felt that they were entitled to share in the\n\noverriding royalties in addition to their respective undivided 1/5th of 1/8th\n\nroyalty interests in the Acker ranch. (CR 247-252; App. 12) The Johnie\n\nAcker Heirs contended that the terms “base one-eighth (1/8) royalty\n\ninterest” [in the four 1948 Murphy Estate Partition Deeds] and “above the\n\none-eighth (1/8) royalty” [in the 1948 Snowden NPMD], and “basic one-\n\neighth (1/8) royalty interest” in the 1953 Declaration and Agreement,\n\nlimited the Winslow and Snowden interests to only 1/5 each of a 1/8\n\nroyalty. (CR 247-252; App. 12) They were correct.\n\n      The trial court reviewed the language in the four 1948 Murphy Estate\n\nPartition Deeds, including the 1948 Snowden NPMD to her four siblings\n\nand the 1953 Declaration and Agreement, and interpreted all of the\n\nreservations and restrictions contained therein (construing their different\n\nlanguage together) as limiting the four other Murphy siblings’ non-\n\nexecutive interests to only four-fifths (4/5ths) of a one-eighth (1/8th)\n\nroyalty – that is, an undivided 1/5th of 1/8th royalty interest to each of the\n\nfive children of J. E. Murphy. (CR 253-272; App. 13)\n\n                                      14\n\f     The judgment of the court was appealed. (CR 247-252; App. 12)\n\n     This honorable court of appeals upheld the trial court’s judgment.\n\nJulia Authelia Winslow v. Edwin V. Acker, 781 S.W.2d 322 (Tex. App–-San\n\nAntonio 1989, writ denied). (CR 247-252; App. 12)\n\nThe instant Royalty Interest Dispute is Limited to Mabel\nSnowden Heirs and Johnie Acker Heirs\n\n     The other Defendants named in this case, to-wit, the Edna Mae Jones\n\nHeirs and the Julia Authelia Winslow Heirs, do not contest the division of\n\nroyalties under the Swift Lease as interpreted by the Mabel Snowden Heirs\n\nand, in fact, many executed and delivered Division Orders to Swift Energy\n\nreflecting the division as set forth by the Mabel Snowden Heirs, (“Division\n\nOrders”). (CR 160-246; App. 11)\n\n     Notwithstanding the fact that there was no dispute among the Mabel\n\nSnowden Heirs, the Edna Mae Jones Heirs, and/or the Julia Authelia\n\nWinslow Heirs, Swift Energy wrongfully withheld and suspended Seven\n\nand One-Half (7 ½%) percent of the royalties from the Swift Lease, when it\n\nshould have only withheld and suspended Two and One-Half (2 ½%)\n\nPercent, i.e., the difference between what the the Mabel Snowden Heirs\n\ncontend that the Johnie Acker Heirs are entitled to receive - an undivided\n\n1/5th of 1/8th royalty interest (1/5th x 12.5%), and what the Johnie Acker\n\n                                    15\n\fHeirs contend that they are entitled to receive - an undivided 1/5th of 1/4th\n\nroyalty interest (1/5th x 25%) under the Swift Lease. This dispute amounts\n\nto 2-½% royalty interest, not 7-½%. However, after Summary Judgment\n\nwas granted to the Johnie Acker Heirs, Swift Energy unilaterally released\n\n5% of the suspended royalties to the Mabel Snowden Heirs and final\n\nJudgment in this case disposes of all issues with Swift Energy. Hence, this\n\nappeal is limited to the dispute between the Johnie Acker Heirs and the\n\nMabel Snowden Heirs over the suspended 2-1/2% royalties and future\n\nroyalties under the Swift Lease, and the construction of the subject deed\n\nconveyances.\n\n                       STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n     When both sides move for summary judgment and the trial court\n\ngrants one motion and denies the other, as at bar, summary judgment\n\nevidence presented by both sides is reviewed and this honorable court of\n\nappeals determines all questions presented. Comm’rs Court of Titus\n\nCounty v. Agan, 940 S.W.2d 77, 81 (Tex.1997). Furthermore, as in the\n\ninstant case where the Mabel Snowden Heirs have pleaded the affirmative\n\ndefense of Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel, a movant who conclusively\n\nestablishes all of the elements of an affirmative defense is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment. Cathey v. Booth, 900 S.W.2d 339, 341 (Tex.1995).\n\n                                     16\n\fSummary judgment is reviewed de novo. Provident Life & Accident Ins. Co.\n\nv. Knott, 128 S.W.3d 211, 215 (Tex.2003). Evidence presented in the motion\n\nand response are analyzed in the light most favorable to the party against\n\nwhom the summary judgment was rendered, crediting evidence favorable\n\nto that party if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence\n\nunless reasonable jurors could not. See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d\n\n802, 827 (Tex.2005); Johnson v. Brewer & Pritchard, P.C., 73 S.W.3d 193,\n\n208 (Tex.2002). The party moving for traditional summary judgment bears\n\nthe burden of showing no genuine issue of material fact exists and it is\n\nentitled to judgment as a matter of law.

The trial court had\n\nample summary judgment proof to grant summary judgment in favor of the\n\nMabel Snowden Heirs.\n\n\n                        ISSUE NUMBER ONE\n                            (RESTATED)\n\n      Whether the motion for summary judgment filed by the Mabel\nSnowden Heirs, supported by competent summary judgment evidence,\nrequired the trial court to properly construe the referenced conveyances in\nthe Correction Warranty Deed in order to validate the grantor’s intent.\n\n                  ARGUMENT AND AUTHORITIES\n\nThe Mabel Snowden Heirs Met Their Burden Of Proof\n\n     In support of their motion for summary judgment, the Mabel\n\nSnowden Heirs attached the following competent summary judgment\n\nproof:\n\n\nExhibit 1: 1948 Murphy Estate Partition Deeds (Certified Copies):\n\n     (i) Johnie L.

Edwin V. Acker, 781 S.W.2d 322\n(Tex. App–San Antonio 1989, writ denied).\n\nExhibit 11: Cause No. 1013-C, Julia Winslow et al v. Edwin V. Acker et al, in\nthe 343rd Judicial District Court, McMullen County, Texas (Certified Copies\nof the following orders and pleadings):\n\n\n                                     19\n\f     Final Judgment\n     Defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment\n     Plaintiffs’ Response to Defendants’ Brief in Support of Defendants’\n     Motion for Summary Judgment\n     Defendants’ First Amended Original Answer and Counterclaim\n     Plaintiffs’ First Amended Original Petition\n\nExhibit 12: Affidavit of Richard J. Karam\n            Affidavit of Michael L. McReynolds\n\n     1.    Documents are Unambiguous\n\n     A contract or deed that can be given a definite or certain legal\n\nmeaning is not ambiguous. See Stewart & Title Guar. Co. v. Aiello, 941\n\nS.W.2d 68, 74 (Tex.1997). The construction of an unambiguous deed is a\n\nquestion of law for the court. Luckel v. White, 819 S.W.2d 459, 461\n\n(Tex.1991). The primary duty of a court when construing deeds that are\n\nunambiguous is to ascertain the intent of the parties from all of the\n\nlanguage as contained in the four corners of the relevant the deeds. Id.\n\nNeither party contends that the deeds in this case are ambiguous.\n\n     The Mabel Snowden Heirs contend that when the Court construes the\n\ndocuments attached to their Motion, the intent of the parties is clear and\n\ncertain that only an undivided 1/5th of 1/8th royalty interest was conveyed\n\nto the Johnie Acker Heirs. Indeed, the other Murphy siblings who are\n\nnamed defendants in the lawsuit recognize this truth by not contesting the\n\nissues and by the execution and delivery of Division Orders consistent\n\n                                    20\n\ftherewith.\n\n     2.    Winslow vs. Acker: The declaration of rights in this\nprior appeal constitutes Res Judicata and/or Collateral Estoppel\nto the issues in the instant appeal.\n\n      Res Judicata precludes re-litigation of claims that have been finally\n\nadjudicated or that arise out of the same subject matter and could have\n\nbeen litigated in the prior action. Barr v. Resolution Trust Corp., 837\n\nS.W.2d 627, 628 (Tex.1992). Res Judicata requires proof of the following\n\nelements: (1) a prior final judgment on the merits by a court of competent\n\njurisdiction; (2) identity of parties or those in privity with them; and (3) a\n\nsecond action based on the same claims as were raised or could have been\n\nraised in the first action. Amstadt v. U.S. Brass Corp., 919 S.W.2d 644, 652\n\n(Tex.1996).\n\n      Collateral Estoppel precludes re-litigation of any ultimate issue of fact\n\nactually litigated and essential to the judgment in a prior suit. Bonniwell v.\n\nBeech Aircraft Corp., 663 S.W.2d 816, 818 (Tex.1984). The doctrine applies\n\nwhen the party against whom Collateral Estoppel is asserted had a full and\n\nfair opportunity to litigate the issue in the prior suit. Id.\n\n      In Winslow v. Acker, this honorable court of appeals reviewed the\n\nlanguage in the 1948 Murphy Estate Partition Deeds, the 1948 Snowden\n\n\n                                        21\n\fNPMD, and the 1953 Declaration and Agreement. Julia Authelia Winslow,\n\n781 S.W.2d at 322-26. (CR 247-252; App. 12) In so doing, the court of\n\nappeals interpreted all of the reservations and restrictions contained\n\ntherein (construing their differing language together) as limiting the four\n\nother Murphy siblings’ non-executive interests, including the Johnie Acker\n\nHeirs, to only four-fifths (4/5ths) of a one-eighth (1/8th) royalty – that is,\n\nan undivided 1/5th of 1/8th royalty interest to each of the children of J. E.\n\nMurphy. Julia Authelia Winslow, 781 S.W.2d at 327. (CR 247-252; App.\n\n12) Therefore, the trial court’s declaration regarding the deeds in Winslow\n\nv. Acker constitutes Res Judicata and/or Collateral Estoppel to the\n\nlimitations of the mineral grant from Mabel M. Snowden to her four\n\nsiblings and their heirs, i.e., each would receive 1/5th of 1/8th of the royalties\n\nand no more. See Julia Authelia Winslow, 781 S.W.2d at 327-328. (CR\n\n247-252; App. 12)\n\n      In their supplemental briefing in support of their motion for\n\nsummary judgment, the Johnie Acker Heirs misinterpret the law when they\n\ncite the decision in Hausser for the proposition that the trial court is\n\nprohibited from examining prior conveyances when construing a deed. (CR\n\n604-607; App. 20); Hausser v. Cuellar, 345 S.W.3d 462, 470-71 (Tex.\n\nApp.–San Antonio 2011, pet. denied).\n\n                                       22\n\f     In Hausser, the deed under scrutiny did not reference a prior\n\nconveyance. The conveying language in Hausser provided as follows:\n\n     Grantors] have GRANTED, SOLD, CONVEYED, ASSIGNED AND\n     DELIVERED, and by these presents do GRANT, SELL, ASSIGN,\n     CONVEY AND DELIVER unto the said Grantees, Share and share\n     alike, an undivided (1/2) interest in and to all of the oil royalty, gas\n     royalty, royalty in casinghead gas and gasoline, and royalty in other\n     minerals in and under, and that may be produced and mined from the\n     following described land situated in the County of Zapata and State of\n     Texas, to wit: ..... Id. at 467.\n\nThe majority of the court of appeals in Hausser emphasized that when a\n\ndeed is unambiguous on its face, it would be improper to look back at prior\n\nconveyances for interpretation disapproving of the decision of Neel. Id. at\n\n470 (citing Neel v. Killam Oil Co., Ltd., 88 S.W.3d 334, 340-41 (Tex.App.—\n\nSan Antonio 2002, pet. denied)). However as explained by Justices Marion\n\nand Hilbig in their dissent in Hausser, the majority misreads Neel because\n\nthe examination of the prior deed in Neel was merely to confirm the\n\nconclusion, not to create it. Hausser, 345 S.W.3d at 472 (dissent).\n\n     The Mabel Snowden Heirs agree with both principles of law that an\n\nunambiguous deed should be read to harmonize and give effect to all its\n\nprovisions by ascertaining the intent from the four corners of the document\n\nand that in certain cases, such as the appeal at bar, where a deed references\n\nthe intent – not creates it – it is appropriate to look to prior referenced\n\n\n                                     23\n\fconveyances.\n\n     At bar, the 1965 Mineral Deed from Mabel M. Snowden to Johnie\n\nLorene Acker states:\n\n     Mabel M. Snowden Grants and convey to Johnie Lorene Acker an ....\n\n     “undivided one-fifth (1/5th) interest as her separate, sole and\n     individual property in and to all of the oil, gas and other minerals in\n     and to the land hereinafter described, the mineral interest\n     hereby conveyed being all of the interest conveyed by\n     Johnie Lorene Acker to Mabel M. Snowden by deed dated\n     December 31, 1953, and recorded in Volume X-4, Page 355,\n     Deed Records of La Salle County, Texas.”\n     (CR 111-114; App. 8) (emphasis added)\n\nThe 1965 Mineral Deed, unlike the Hausser deed, specifically referenced a\n\nprior deed for a description of the mineral interest being conveyed. Hence,\n\nthe prior deed must be referred to in order to ascertain the intent of the\n\nparties as to the interest being conveyed. See Harris v. Windsor, 156 Tex.\n\n324, 325-327, 294 S.W.2d 798, 799-800 (Tex.1956).\n\n     In Harris, the issue was whether the “reservations” contained in the\n\nprior deed were carried forward. The granting clause of the deed stated:\n\n     'And being the same land described in Warranty deed from\n     the The Federal Land Bank of Houston to W. C. Windsor,\n     recorded in Vol. X-2, Page 119, Deed Records of Marion\n     County, Texas, reference to which is made for all purposes.' Id.\n\n     The Texas Supreme Court in Harris relied on the “made for all\n\npurposes” to incorporate the reservations from the prior conveyance in\n\n                                     24\n\ffollowing language:\n\n     It is obvious that the reference in the Federal Land Bank deed to the\n     Liverman-Tems deed, 'for all legal purposes,' was not for the purpose\n     of description, but for the purpose of disclosing that the deed was\n     subject to all restrictions and reservations in that deed. As before\n     stated, that deed reserved one-half in the minerals to Liverman.\n     Id. at 156 Tex. at 327, 294 S.W.2d at 800.\n\n     In the appeal at bar, the reference “made for all purposes” is\n\nunnecessary because the reference in the Snowden deed to the prior deed\n\nwas specific to “the mineral interest hereby conveyed.” In other words, the\n\nreference to the prior deed was for the specific purpose of describing the\n\ninterest being conveyed.\n\n     Reliance by the Johnie Acker Heirs on the decision in Myrad\n\nProperties, Inc. and the subsequent additions to the Texas Property Code,\n\nSection 5.030 which made the case “dead letter law,” is also inapposite as\n\nthe Mabel Snowden Heirs are not contending that the Correction Warranty\n\nDeed adds an additional mineral interest, but to the contrary, that the\n\nCorrection Warranty Deed merely restated the prior grant in terms of a\n\nroyalty interest rather than a mineral interest with reservations. Myrad\n\nProperties, Inc. v. La Salle Bank Nat. Ass’n, 300 S.W.3d 746, 749-750\n\n(Tex.2009). (CR 604-607; App. 20) In this regard, the Correction Warranty\n\nDeed speaks for itself on the intent and purpose of the correction:\n\n\n                                     25\n\f     “This Deed is made in place of and as a Deed of Correction of [the\n     1965 Mineral Deed] wherein by error or mistake, Grantors\n     conveyed to Grantee an undivided 1/5th mineral interest in\n     and to all of the oil, gas and other minerals, when in truth\n     and fact Grantors should have conveyed an undivided non-\n     participating 1/5th of the whole and entire royalty interest,\n     and this instrument …, in all other respects confirming said\n     former Deed ..... “ (CR 115-120; App. 9) (emphasis added)\n\n     In fact the 1965 Mineral Deed did state that it conveyed an undivided\n\n1/5th mineral interest in all the oil, gas and other minerals; however, that\n\nbroad conveyance was qualified by the succeeding language “being all of the\n\ninterest conveyed by Johnie Loren Acker to Mabel M. Snowden by deed\n\ndated December 31, 1953, and recorded in Volume X-4, Page 355, Deed\n\nRecords of La Salle County, Texas.”       The 1953 Royalty deed likewise\n\nreferences the interest as “being all of the interest conveyed by Mabel M.\n\nSnowden to Johnie Lorene Acker …. by Deed dated October 27, 1948 …… “\n\nHence, in each of the successive conveyances one must refer back to the\n\n1948 Mabel Snowden NPMD to determine exactly what was and what is\n\nbeing conveyed, which unquestionably restricts the conveyance to 1/5 of\n\n1/8th royalty. The Correction Warranty Deed states that “in truth and fact\n\nGrantors should have conveyed an undivided nor-participating 1/5th of the\n\nwhole and entire royalty … confirming in all other respects the former\n\nDeed. It is clear that the Correction Warranty Deed merely expresses the\n\n\n                                     26\n\fconveyance as a non-participating mineral interest (NPMI) rather than a\n\nmineral interest which reserves for grantor all other aspects of the mineral\n\nestate. (CR 115-120; App. 9)\n\n      The five essential elements of a severed mineral estate, are (1) the\n\nright to develop [the right of ingress and egress]; (2) the right to lease [the\n\nexecutive right]; (3) the right to receive bonus payments; (4) the right to\n\nreceive delay rentals and (5) the right to receive royalty payments). See\n\nAltman v. Blake, 712 S.W.2d 117, 118 (Tex.1986); Julia Authelia Winslow,\n\n781 S.W. 2d at 326. In fact, the interest conveyed remains the same, albeit\n\nexpressed in different terminology.\n\n      The contention by the Johnie Acker Heirs is that the Correction\n\nWarranty Deed removed the reference to the prior 1965 Mineral Deed. This\n\nposition is frivolous. Nowhere in the Correction Warranty Deed does it do\n\nso. (CR 115-120; App. 9) If that was the intent of the correction, the removal\n\ncould have been easily included in the Correction Warranty Deed.\n\n      When the 1965 Mineral Deed and the 1980 Correction Warranty Deed\n\nare reconciled, it would read as follows:\n\n      Mabel M. Snowden ..... do(es) grant, bargain, sell and convey to the\n      said Johnie Lorene Acker, an undivided non-participating one-fifth\n      (1/5th) of the whole and entire royalty interest ....... in and to all of the\n      oil, gas and other minerals described below, being all of the\n      interest conveyed by Johnie Lorene Acker to Mabel M.\n\n                                        27\n\f     Snowden by deed dated December 31, 1953, and recorded in\n     Volume X-4, Page 355, Deed Records of La Salle County,\n     Texas.”\n     (CR 107-110; App. 7) (CR 115-120; App. 9) (emphasis added)\n\n\n3.   Attorneys Fees -\n\n     Declaratory Judgment\n\n     Pursuant to Chapter 37 of the Texas Civil Practice and Remedies\n\nCode, the Mabel Snowden Heirs seek a declaratory judgment from this\n\ncourt of appeals that would have the effect of settling the entitlements\n\nregarding the suspended royalties and settling future disputes under the\n\ndocuments granting such royalty rights.

Murphy, put into effect an estate plan\n                    where his descendants would share, to some extent,\n                    royalties produced on each of their respective lands.\n\n                      On December 1, 2009, Swift Energy Operating, LLC,\n                      Lessee, and Patricia Jo Kardell, Martin Murphy\n                      Snowden, Mickey Darrell, Snowden, and Mary\n                      Delilla Snowden, as Lessor, (“the Mabel Snowden\n                      Heirs”), executed a certain Oil, Gas & Mineral Lease,\n                      (“Swift Lease”). The Swift Lease provided a 25%\n                      royalty to the mineral estate owners.\n\n                      The Mabel Snowden Heirs contend that Edwin V.\n                      Acker, Jr., Stephen Adolph Acker, Elaine Acker,\n                      George, Shella Acker Reinke, and Edwin Scott\n                      Acker, (“the Johnie Acker Heirs”), are entitled to\n                      only an undivided 1/5th of 1/8th royalty interest (or\n                      1/5th x 12.5% royalty) under the Swift Lease, or,\n                      stated differently, 2.5% out of the 25.0% royalty\n                      interest.\n\n                      The Johnie Acker Heirs, contend that they are\n                      entitled to 1/5th of 1/4th royalty interest (or 1/5th x\n                      25% royalty) under the Swift Lease, i.e., 5% out of\n                      the 25% royalty interest.\n\n                      Inexplicably, Swift Energy Operating, LLC, withheld\n                      7-1/2% of the royalties under the Swift Lease, rather\n                      than the 2.5% in dispute.\n\nTrial Judge:          Honorable Donna S.

In doing so, the proper construction to be given\n\nthe Correction Warranty Deed clearly would show that the grantor did not\n\nintend to re-convey more property to the grantee than what was originally\n\nreceived by the grantor.         Furthermore, the intent and purpose of the\n\nCorrection Warranty Deed is, and was, to describe the interest being re-\n\n\n1\n The Index for the Clerk’s Record has incorrect filing dates and typographical errors.\nReferences in Appellants’ Brief shall be to the file-stamped pleadings and not the Index.\n\n                                           1\n\fconveyed in terms of a “non-participating royalty interest” rather than a\n\n“mineral interest” with reservations.\n\n      The Johnie Acker Heirs maintain, to the contrary, that the Correction\n\nWarranty Deed should be read without regard to the referenced prior 1965\n\ndeed that it corrected in order to grant them more than what was originally\n\ngiven to Mabel Snowden.\n\n      This Court of Appeals, in a previous related case involving the same\n\nparties, interpreted these same mineral conveyances. Consequently, the\n\nintent and character of the interests being conveyed is clear as to the\n\nconveyances referenced in this appeal. Accordingly, this Court should\n\nreverse the summary judgment granted in favor of the Johnie Acker Heirs\n\nand render summary judgment in favor of the Mabel Snowden Heirs.\n\nProcedural History\n\n      On June 21, 2012, Swift Energy filed Plaintiff’s Original Petition in\n\nInterpleader.2 (CR 001-010) On July 30, 2012, the Mabel Snowden Heirs\n\nfiled their original answer, original counterclaim, and cross-action in\n\ninterpleader.

(CR\n\n654-672; App. 1) On August 19, 2015, the Mabel Snowden Heirs filed their\n\njoint notice of appeal. (CR 673-698) On August 25, 2015, the Clerk’s Record\n\n                                     4\n\fwas requested by the Mabel Snowden Heirs and it was filed on August 26.\n\n(CR 699-705; 706)\n\nSubstantive Facts\n\nMurphy Partition Deeds and Estate Plan\n\n     J. E. Murphy, now deceased, had five (5) children: (i) Mabel M.\n\nSnowden, (ii) Johnie Lorene Acker, (iii) Edna Mae Jones, (iv) Julia Authelia\n\nAkers, (v) Emmett Granvel Murphy. The Mabel Snowden Heirs are the\n\nchildren of Mabel M. Snowden. The Johnie Acker Heirs are the heirs of\n\nJohni Lorene Acker.\n\n     J. E. Murphy owned four (4) separate ranches prior to his death.\n\nUpon his death, his 5 children owned undivided interests in each of the\n\nranches, including the entire mineral estate. In accordance with the estate\n\nplanning wishes of J. E. Murphy, all 5 children executed 4 deeds on October\n\n21, 1948 partitioning the surface estates of the 4 ranches to his 4 children\n\nexcluding Mabel M. Snowden. In lieu of conveying a ranch to Mabel M.\n\nSnowden, she received cash of equal value since Mabel M. Snowden had\n\npreviously acquired a ranch in 1945 in Dimmit and La Salle Counties. (CR\n\n71-88; App. 3) (CR 089-094; App. 4)\n\n     Each of the four separate surface deeds to the four children, (“1948\n\nMurphy Estate Partition Deeds”), provides as follows:\n\n                                      5\n\f     “ … the parties (the 5 children) shall continue to own and hold in\n     common all of the oil, gas, and other minerals in the same undivided\n     proportion …. it being further provided, however, anything in the\n     foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, that the grantee of the\n     surface estate … shall have the exclusive right to execute … mineral\n     lease(s) … and receive, as (his/her) separate property, such bonuses,\n     oil payments, and rentals as may be paid under said .. mineral leases\n     …     except that (he/she) shall reserve in each …. mineral lease … a\n     base one-eighth (1/8) royalty interest for the benefit of\n     (herself/himself) and the other four children .. in the same proportion\n     they now own same.” (CR 71-88; App. 3)\n\nSix days thereafter, on October 27, 1948, Mabel M. Snowden executed a\n\nNon-Participating Mineral Deed, (“1948 Snowden NPMD”), in connection\n\nwith her existing ranch in Dimmitt and LaSalle Counties, (the “Snowden\n\nRanch”). In furtherance of the estate planning design of J. E. Murphy, the\n\n1948 Snowden NPMD conveyed an undivided four-fifths (4/5) interest in\n\nand to 1/8th of the royalty from all oil, gas and minerals in and under the\n\nSnowden Ranch to the 4 siblings of Mabel M. Snowden. The 1948 Snowden\n\nNPMD specifically contained a reservation identical in substance as the\n\n1948 Murphy Estate Partition Deeds, to-wit:\n\n      “It is further agreed that Grantees [the other four siblings] shall have\nno interest in any bonus money or oil payment above the one-eighth\n(1/8th) royalty received by the Grantors in any future lease or leases given\non said land and that it shall not be necessary for the Grantees to join in\nany such lease or leases so made; that Grantees shall receive under such\nlease or leases four-fifths (the same being one-fifth (1/5th) to each Grantee)\npart of all the oil, gas and other minerals taken and saved under any such\nlease or leases and he or she shall receive the same out of the royalty\nprovided for in such lease or leases, but Grantees shall have no part in the\n\n                                      6\n\fannual rentals paid to keep such lease or leases in force until drilling is\nbegun.” (CR 095-100; App. 5) (emphasis added)\n\nMabel M. Snowden thereby conveyed only a fixed 1/5th of 1/8th royalty to\n\neach of her four siblings, including Johnie Lorene Acker, in the Mabel\n\nSnowden NPMD. (CR 095-100; App. 5)\n\n      In 1953, the five siblings wanted confirmation from each other as to\n\nthe estate planning intent of their father and, in particular, their respective\n\nrights as surface owners to the mineral estate on their lands. (CR 101-106;\n\nApp. 6) Accordingly, on December 9, 1953, Johnie Lorene Acker and Mabel\n\nMullen Snowden, as well as the other siblings, executed a recordable\n\ndeclaration and agreement, (“Declaration & Agreement”), confirming to\n\neach other as follows:\n\n      “[We] hereby declare, that in making the division of the property in\n      the Estate of J. E. Murphy, deceased, it was the intention of said\n      parties to grant to the party receiving the surface, the right to\n      receive all rentals from oil, gas and mineral leases then on said land\n      so granted and to receive all bonuses and rentals on leases that\n      might thereafter be made by the party to whom the surface was\n      conveyed by Special Warranty Deed, provided, however, that the\n      Lessor in said oil, gas and mineral lease, so executed by him or her,\n      should reserve, in each oil, gas and mineral leases so executed, a\n      basic one-eighth (1/8) royalty interest ..... for the benefit of the\n      Lessor and the other children of J. E. Murphy, deceased, and those\n      claiming under said children or child .......\n      (CR 101-106; App. 6) (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                      7\n\fConveyance/Re-Conveyance of Snowden Ranch Royalty Interests\n\n     On or about December 31, 1953, Mabel M. Snowden sought to borrow\n\nmoney against the Snowden Ranch. (CR 107-110; App. 7) As a condition of\n\nthe loan, the bank required that Mabel M. Snowden own at least three-\n\nfifths (3/5ths) of the mineral interest in the Snowden Ranch. (CR 107-110;\n\nApp. 7) At that time, she only owned 1/5th of 1/8th royalty interest together\n\nwith all rights to the minerals and production over and above the 4/5ths of\n\n1/8th royalty conveyed to her siblings. Consequently, at Mabel M.\n\nSnowden’s request, Johnie Lorene Acker and Virginia Gertrude Akers\n\nMurphy, (being the surviving wife of Emmett Granvel Murphy and sole\n\ndevisee under his Last Will and Testament), conveyed to Mabel M.\n\nSnowden their respective one-fifth (1/5) of said 1/8 royalty interests in the\n\nSnowden Ranch by Royalty Deed dated December 31, 1953, so that Mabel\n\nM. Snowden then owned a total of three-fifths (3/5) of said base (or basic)\n\nroyalty interest in the Snowden Ranch together with all rights to the\n\nminerals and production therefrom over and above the remaining 2/5ths of\n\n1/8th royalty in favor of her other siblings, (“1953 Royalty Deed”). (CR 107-\n\n110; App. 7)\n\n     When Mabel M. Snowden paid the note to the bank, she re-conveyed\n\nthe same royalty interest back to Johnie Lorene Acker on March 25, 1965 by\n\n                                     8\n\finstrument, (“1965 Mineral Deed”), that provided:\n\n[Mabel M. Snowden] granted and conveyed to Johnie Lorene Acker an ....\n\n      “undivided one-fifth (1/5th) interest as her separate, sole and\n      individual property in and to all of the oil, gas and other minerals in\n      and to the land hereinafter described, the mineral interest hereby\n      conveyed being all of the interest conveyed by Johnie Lorene Acker\n      to Mabel M. Snowden by deed dated December 31, 1953, and\n      recorded in Volume X-4, Page 355, Deed Records of La Salle County,\n      Texas.” (CR 111-114; App. 8)\n\nThe royalty interest of Virginia Gertrude Akers Murphy was, by agreement,\n\nretained by Mabel M. Snowden as part of the Mabel M. Snowden estate.\n\n(CR 111-114; App. 8)\n\n      In or about 1980, a title search was conducted on the Snowden Ranch\n\nby a prospective oil and gas lessee. (CR 115-120; App. 9) In that process, it\n\nbecame desirable to express the re-conveyance to the Johnie Acker Heirs in\n\nterms of a non-participating royalty interest, (“NPRI”), rather than a\n\nmineral interest with reservations. (CR 115-120; App. 9) Consequently,\n\nMabel M. Snowden and Johnie Lorene Acker agreed to correct and clarify\n\nthe 1965 Mineral Deed to express the conveyance in terms of an NPRI. (CR\n\n115-120; App. 9)\n\n      Therefore, on or about June 24, 1980, (but effective as of March 25,\n\n1965), a Correction Warranty Deed was prepared and executed that stated,\n\nin pertinent part:\n\n                                      9\n\f      “in place of and as a Deed of Correction” to the March 25, 1965 deed\n      “wherein by error or mistake, Grantors conveyed to Grantee an\n      undivided one-fifth (1/5th) mineral interest in and to all of the oil, gas\n      and other minerals, when in truth and fact Grantor should have\n      conveyed an undivided non-participating 1/5th of the whole and\n      entire royalty interest, ….” (CR 115-120; App. 9)\n\n      On December 1, 2009, the Mabel Snowden Heirs executed an oil and\n\ngas lease with Swift Energy, (the “Swift Lease”), which provided a 25%\n\nroyalty to the mineral estate owners. (CR 121-159; App. 10) When Swift\n\ncirculated a division order to the mineral owners, the Johnie Acker Heirs\n\nasserted that they were enitled to 1/5th of ¼ (25%) of the royalties under\n\nthe Swift Lease rather than 1/5th of 1/8th as set forth in the 1948 Snowden\n\nNPMD.     The claim caused Swift to suspend royalty payments and the\n\ninstitution of the present interpleader lawsuit.\n\n      In the lawsuit, the Johnie Acker Heirs, contend that the 1965 Mineral\n\nDeed, as corrected in 1980, entitles them to 1/5 share of the 25% royalties\n\nunder the Swift Lease, not just the 1/5 of 1/8th (12.5% of the royalties) as\n\nprovided in the original 1948 Mabel Snowden NPMD. (CR 111-114; App. 8)\n\n(CR 115-120; App. 9)\n\n      The Mabel Snowden Heirs, on the other hand, maintain that the 1948\n\nMabel Snowden NPMD and the succeeding conveyances, all of which were\n\nincorporated into the 1980 Correction Deed, express the clear intent to\n\n\n                                      10\n\fconvey only an undivided 1/5th of 1/8th royalty interest (1/5th x 12.5%\n\nroyalty) to each of the siblings and their heirs, including the Johnie Acker\n\nHeirs, while reserving to the surface owner, the Mabel Snowden Heirs, all\n\nroyalty and incidents of the mineral estate above that amount. (CR 115-120;\n\nApp. 9)\n\n        The Mabel Snowden Heirs’ interpretation has clear support under the\n\n1948 Murphy Estate Partition Deeds, the 1948 Snowden NPMD, and\n\nsubsequent conveyance documents:\n\n        First, the 1980 Correction Warranty Deed, the 1965 Mineral Deed,\n\nand the 1953 Royalty Deed each refer back to the interests conveyed by the\n\n1948 Snowden NPMD. (CR 115-120; App. 9) (CR 111-114; App. 8) (CR 107-\n\n110; App. 7) (CR 095-100; App. 5) The 1948 Snowden NPMD restricts the\n\nconveyance to the four siblings to only a portion of the mineral interest,\n\nthat being an undivided one-fifth (1/5th) of one-eighth (1/8th) royalty,\n\nreserving all other aspects of the mineral estate to the Mabel Snowden\n\nHeirs. (CR 095-100; App. 5)\n\n        Second, the 1980 Correction Warranty Deed clearly states in relevant\n\npart:\n\n        “This Deed is made in place of and as a Deed of Correction of [the\n        1965 Mineral Deed] wherein by error or mistake, Grantors conveyed\n        to Grantee an undivided 1/5th mineral interest in and to all of the oil,\n\n                                        11\n\f     gas and other minerals, when in truth and fact Grantors should have\n     conveyed an undivided non-participating 1/5th of the whole and\n     entire royalty interest, and this instrument …, in all other respects\n     confirming said former Deed .....” (CR 115-120; App. 9) (emphasis\n     added)\n\n     Consequently, when reading the 1965 Mineral Deed together with the\n\nthe 1980 Correction Warranty Deed results in the following construction:\n\n     Mabel M. Snowden conveys to Johnie Lorene Acker:\n\n     “an undivided non-participating one-fifth (1/5) of the whole and\n     entire royalty interest as her separate, sole and individual property in\n     and to all of the oil, gas and other minerals in and to the land\n     hereinafter described, the mineral interest hereby conveyed being\n     all of the interest conveyed by Johnie Lorene Acker to\n     Mabel M. Snowden by deed dated December 31, 1953, and\n     recorded in Volume X-4, Page 355, Deed Records of La Salle\n     County, Texas.” (CR 111-114; App. 8) (emphasis added)\n\n     Third, it is irrefutable that the December 31, 1953 Deed from Johnie\n\nLorene Acker to Mabel M. Snowden, conveyed “all of the interest previously\n\nconveyed by Mabel M. Snowden to Johnie Lorene Acker … by Deed dated\n\nOctober 27, 1948 .... (i.e. the 1948 Snowden NPMD)” (CR 107-110; App. 7)\n\n     Fourth, the 1948 Snowden NPMD makes it absolutely clear that\n\nJohnie Lorene Acker and the other siblings received no interest in any “oil\n\npayment above the one-eighth (1/8th) royalty received by the Grantors in\n\nany future lease or leases.” (CR 095-100; App. 5) None of the other heirs\n\ncontested this fact and indeed the subject Final Judgment entered in this\n\n\n                                     12\n\fcase resolves any issues concerning same.\n\n     Fifth, the Declaration and Agreement executed by the parties on\n\nDecember 9, 1953 makes it absolutely clear that the siblings and their heirs\n\nare to receive only an undivided 1/5th of “a basic one-eighth (1/8) royalty\n\ninterest” from the other siblings’ mineral estate. (CR 101-106; App. 6)\n\n     Accordingly, the “whole and entire royalty interest” language\n\ncontained in the 1980 deed must be construed with reference to the 1965\n\nMineral Deed and constitutes a reference to the entire base (or basic) 1/8th\n\nroyalty, as consistently set forth in the family’s series of deeds and\n\ndeclarations in 1948, 1953 and 1965 describing the royalty held in common\n\nby the five Murphy siblings and their heirs and assigns. (CR 095-100; App.\n\n5) (CR 101-106; App. 6) (CR 107-110; App. 7) (CR 111-114; App. 8) (CR 115-\n\n120; App. 9)\n\nThis Court of Appeals previously interpreted the 1948 Murphy\nEstate Partition Deeds, including the 1948 Snowden NPMD, and\nthe 1953 Declaration and Agreement\n\n     In 1988, a lawsuit was filed to determine the intent and terms of the\n\nshared family royalty interest between the Johnie Acker Heirs, Julia\n\nAuthelia Akers (known at that time as Julia Authelia Winslow), and Mabel\n\nM. Snowden and some of her heirs. (CR 247-252; App. 12) In that dispute,\n\nthe Johnie Acker Heirs had entered into several oil and gas leases on the\n\n                                     13\n\fAcker ranch whereby overriding royalties were conveyed to Edwin Acker,\n\nJr. (CR 247-252; App. 12)\n\n      The plaintiffs in the 1988 lawsuit (being Julia Authelia Winslow,\n\nMabel M. Snowden and others) felt that they were entitled to share in the\n\noverriding royalties in addition to their respective undivided 1/5th of 1/8th\n\nroyalty interests in the Acker ranch. (CR 247-252; App. 12) The Johnie\n\nAcker Heirs contended that the terms “base one-eighth (1/8) royalty\n\ninterest” [in the four 1948 Murphy Estate Partition Deeds] and “above the\n\none-eighth (1/8) royalty” [in the 1948 Snowden NPMD], and “basic one-\n\neighth (1/8) royalty interest” in the 1953 Declaration and Agreement,\n\nlimited the Winslow and Snowden interests to only 1/5 each of a 1/8\n\nroyalty. (CR 247-252; App. 12) They were correct.\n\n      The trial court reviewed the language in the four 1948 Murphy Estate\n\nPartition Deeds, including the 1948 Snowden NPMD to her four siblings\n\nand the 1953 Declaration and Agreement, and interpreted all of the\n\nreservations and restrictions contained therein (construing their different\n\nlanguage together) as limiting the four other Murphy siblings’ non-\n\nexecutive interests to only four-fifths (4/5ths) of a one-eighth (1/8th)\n\nroyalty – that is, an undivided 1/5th of 1/8th royalty interest to each of the\n\nfive children of J. E. Murphy. (CR 253-272; App. 13)\n\n                                      14\n\f     The judgment of the court was appealed.

This dispute amounts\n\nto 2-½% royalty interest, not 7-½%. However, after Summary Judgment\n\nwas granted to the Johnie Acker Heirs, Swift Energy unilaterally released\n\n5% of the suspended royalties to the Mabel Snowden Heirs and final\n\nJudgment in this case disposes of all issues with Swift Energy. Hence, this\n\nappeal is limited to the dispute between the Johnie Acker Heirs and the\n\nMabel Snowden Heirs over the suspended 2-1/2% royalties and future\n\nroyalties under the Swift Lease, and the construction of the subject deed\n\nconveyances.\n\n                       STANDARDS OF REVIEW\n\n     When both sides move for summary judgment and the trial court\n\ngrants one motion and denies the other, as at bar, summary judgment\n\nevidence presented by both sides is reviewed and this honorable court of\n\nappeals determines all questions presented.

However as explained by Justices Marion\n\nand Hilbig in their dissent in Hausser, the majority misreads Neel because\n\nthe examination of the prior deed in Neel was merely to confirm the\n\nconclusion, not to create it. Hausser, 345 S.W.3d at 472 (dissent).\n\n     The Mabel Snowden Heirs agree with both principles of law that an\n\nunambiguous deed should be read to harmonize and give effect to all its\n\nprovisions by ascertaining the intent from the four corners of the document\n\nand that in certain cases, such as the appeal at bar, where a deed references\n\nthe intent – not creates it – it is appropriate to look to prior referenced\n\n\n                                     23\n\fconveyances.\n\n     At bar, the 1965 Mineral Deed from Mabel M. Snowden to Johnie\n\nLorene Acker states:\n\n     Mabel M. Snowden Grants and convey to Johnie Lorene Acker an ....\n\n     “undivided one-fifth (1/5th) interest as her separate, sole and\n     individual property in and to all of the oil, gas and other minerals in\n     and to the land hereinafter described, the mineral interest\n     hereby conveyed being all of the interest conveyed by\n     Johnie Lorene Acker to Mabel M. Snowden by deed dated\n     December 31, 1953, and recorded in Volume X-4, Page 355,\n     Deed Records of La Salle County, Texas.”\n     (CR 111-114; App. 8) (emphasis added)\n\nThe 1965 Mineral Deed, unlike the Hausser deed, specifically referenced a\n\nprior deed for a description of the mineral interest being conveyed. Hence,\n\nthe prior deed must be referred to in order to ascertain the intent of the\n\nparties as to the interest being conveyed. See Harris v. Windsor, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Tex.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">324</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 325-327, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1620293\"><a href=\"/opinion/1620293/harris-v-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 799-800 (Tex.1956).\n\n     In Harris, the issue was whether the “reservations” contained in the\n\nprior deed were carried forward. The granting clause of the deed stated:\n\n     'And being the same land described in Warranty deed from\n     the The Federal Land Bank of Houston to W. C. Windsor,\n     recorded in Vol. X-2, Page 119, Deed Records of Marion\n     County, Texas, reference to which is made for all purposes.' Id.\n\n     The Texas Supreme Court in Harris relied on the “made for all\n\npurposes” to incorporate the reservations from the prior conveyance in\n\n                                     24\n\ffollowing language:\n\n     It is obvious that the reference in the Federal Land Bank deed to the\n     Liverman-Tems deed, 'for all legal purposes,' was not for the purpose\n     of description, but for the purpose of disclosing that the deed was\n     subject to all restrictions and reservations in that deed. As before\n     stated, that deed reserved one-half in the minerals to Liverman.\n     Id. at 156 Tex. at 327, 294 S.W.2d at 800.\n\n     In the appeal at bar, the reference “made for all purposes” is\n\nunnecessary because the reference in the Snowden deed to the prior deed\n\nwas specific to “the mineral interest hereby conveyed.” In other words, the\n\nreference to the prior deed was for the specific purpose of describing the\n\ninterest being conveyed.\n\n     Reliance by the Johnie Acker Heirs on the decision in Myrad\n\nProperties, Inc. and the subsequent additions to the Texas Property Code,\n\nSection 5.030 which made the case “dead letter law,” is also inapposite as\n\nthe Mabel Snowden Heirs are not contending that the Correction Warranty\n\nDeed adds an additional mineral interest, but to the contrary, that the\n\nCorrection Warranty Deed merely restated the prior grant in terms of a\n\nroyalty interest rather than a mineral interest with reservations.

(CR 604-607; App. 20) In this regard, the Correction Warranty\n\nDeed speaks for itself on the intent and purpose of the correction:\n\n\n                                     25\n\f     “This Deed is made in place of and as a Deed of Correction of [the\n     1965 Mineral Deed] wherein by error or mistake, Grantors\n     conveyed to Grantee an undivided 1/5th mineral interest in\n     and to all of the oil, gas and other minerals, when in truth\n     and fact Grantors should have conveyed an undivided non-\n     participating 1/5th of the whole and entire royalty interest,\n     and this instrument …, in all other respects confirming said\n     former Deed ..... “ (CR 115-120; App. 9) (emphasis added)\n\n     In fact the 1965 Mineral Deed did state that it conveyed an undivided\n\n1/5th mineral interest in all the oil, gas and other minerals; however, that\n\nbroad conveyance was qualified by the succeeding language “being all of the\n\ninterest conveyed by Johnie Loren Acker to Mabel M. Snowden by deed\n\ndated December 31, 1953, and recorded in Volume X-4, Page 355, Deed\n\nRecords of La Salle County, Texas.”       The 1953 Royalty deed likewise\n\nreferences the interest as “being all of the interest conveyed by Mabel M.\n\nSnowden to Johnie Lorene Acker …. by Deed dated October 27, 1948 …… “\n\nHence, in each of the successive conveyances one must refer back to the\n\n1948 Mabel Snowden NPMD to determine exactly what was and what is\n\nbeing conveyed, which unquestionably restricts the conveyance to 1/5 of\n\n1/8th royalty. The Correction Warranty Deed states that “in truth and fact\n\nGrantors should have conveyed an undivided nor-participating 1/5th of the\n\nwhole and entire royalty … confirming in all other respects the former\n\nDeed. It is clear that the Correction Warranty Deed merely expresses the\n\n\n                                     26\n\fconveyance as a non-participating mineral interest (NPMI) rather than a\n\nmineral interest which reserves for grantor all other aspects of the mineral\n\nestate. (CR 115-120; App. 9)\n\n      The five essential elements of a severed mineral estate, are (1) the\n\nright to develop [the right of ingress and egress]; (2) the right to lease [the\n\nexecutive right]; (3) the right to receive bonus payments; (4) the right to\n\nreceive delay rentals and (5) the right to receive royalty payments). See\n\nAltman v. Blake, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2437399\"><a href=\"/opinion/2437399/altman-v-blake/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">117</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 118 (Tex.1986); Julia Authelia Winslow,\n\n781 S.W. 2d at 326. In fact, the interest conveyed remains the same, albeit\n\nexpressed in different terminology.\n\n      The contention by the Johnie Acker Heirs is that the Correction\n\nWarranty Deed removed the reference to the prior 1965 Mineral Deed. This\n\nposition is frivolous. Nowhere in the Correction Warranty Deed does it do\n\nso. (CR 115-120; App. 9) If that was the intent of the correction, the removal\n\ncould have been easily included in the Correction Warranty Deed.\n\n      When the 1965 Mineral Deed and the 1980 Correction Warranty Deed\n\nare reconciled, it would read as follows:\n\n      Mabel M. Snowden ..... do(es) grant, bargain, sell and convey to the\n      said Johnie Lorene Acker, an undivided non-participating one-fifth\n      (1/5th) of the whole and entire royalty interest ....... in and to all of the\n      oil, gas and other minerals described below, being all of the\n      interest conveyed by Johnie Lorene Acker to Mabel M.\n\n                                        27\n\f     Snowden by deed dated December 31, 1953, and recorded in\n     Volume X-4, Page 355, Deed Records of La Salle County,\n     Texas.”\n     (CR 107-110; App. 7) (CR 115-120; App. 9) (emphasis added)\n\n\n3.
