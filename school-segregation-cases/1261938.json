We review a grant of\n\nsummary judgment applying the same standard as the court below.\n\nDeas v. River West, L.P., 152 F.3d 471, 475 (5th Cir. 1998).\n\n     To establish a failure-to-protect claim, Pennell must show\n\nthat he was “incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial\n\nrisk of serious harm and that prison officials were deliberately\n\nindifferent to his need for protection.”      Neals v. Norwood, 59\n\n\n     *\n        Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined\nthat this opinion should not be published and is not precedent\nexcept under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH CIR.\nR. 47.5.4.\n\f                           No. 01-40277\n                                -2-\n\nF.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir. 1995).   “In order to act with deliberate\n\nindifference, ‘the official must both be aware of facts from\n\nwhich the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.’”     Id.\n\n(quoting Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994)).     A prison\n\nofficial acts with deliberate indifference “only if he knows that\n\ninmates face a substantial risk of serious harm and disregards\n\nthat risk by failing to take reasonable measures to abate it.”\n\nFarmer, 511 U.S. at 847.\n\n     Pennell’s argument that the district court erred is premised\n\non his conclusion that the basis for the district court’s summary\n\njudgment was the absence of proof that Pennell had acquired\n\nadministrative-segregation status on the date of the attack.    He\n\nargues that this determination by the district court was\n\nerroneous because (1) the defendants removed from the documents\n\nsubmitted to the district court the “I-169\" form signed by Warden\n\nMassengill on December 18, 1997, which placed him in\n\nadministrative segregation; (2) the evidence submitted by the\n\ndefendants refutes their argument that Pennell was never assigned\n\nadministrative-segregation status prior to the attack; (3) the\n\nDecember 18, 1997, “recommendation” that he be placed in\n\nadministrative segregation was a de facto change in custody,\n\ndespite the fact that no hearing had yet been held; and (4) a\n\nhearing was not necessary to officially change his status to\n\nadministrative segregation as is evidenced by the fact that upon\n\nhis return from the hospital, he was immediately placed in\n\nadministrative segregation.\n\f                            No. 01-40277\n                                 -3-\n\n     Pennell, however, provided no evidence in opposition to\n\nsummary judgment that the defendants were aware of facts from\n\nwhich the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of\n\nserious harm existed by placing him in a cell with the inmate who\n\nattacked him.    His argument is based on the erroneous assumption\n\nthat placing an inmate who is on administrative-segregation\n\nstatus in a cell with any other inmate is per se evidence of\n\ndeliberate indifference.   Pennell has not adduced any evidence\n\nwhich creates a genuine issue of material fact whether the\n\ndefendants knew that a serious risk of harm to him would arise by\n\nplacing him in a cell with a particular inmate.     He has therefore\n\nnot shown that the district court erred in its summary-judgment\n\ndetermination.\n\n     Pennell further argues that the district court erred in\n\ndenying his motion to modify discovery.     We review a district\n\ncourt’s discovery determinations for an abuse of discretion.\n\nBeattie v. Madison County Sch. Dist., 254 F.3d 595, 605 (5th Cir.\n\n2001).   Pennell’s argument is devoid of an explanation how\n\ndiscovery would have assisted in creating a genuine issue of\n\nmaterial fact.   He has therefore not established that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion.      See id. at 606 (appellant\n\nmust show why additional discovery is necessary and how that\n\ndiscovery will create a genuine issue of material fact).\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\f",
