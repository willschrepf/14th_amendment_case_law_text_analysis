The case is,\n\ntherefore, submitted without oral argument.\n\n       Plaintiff Richard Kirby, appearing pro se and seeking to proceed in forma\n\npauperis, appeals the district court’s entry of judgment in favor of defendants,\n\nvarious New Mexico correctional officers, on claims Kirby raised against them\n\npursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Exercising jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1291, we DENY Kirby leave to proceed in forma pauperis and AFFIRM the\n\nrulings of the district court.\n\n                                          I\n\n       On July 15, 2008, Kirby filed a § 1983 complaint in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of New Mexico. At that time, Kirby was\n\nincarcerated at the Torrance County Detention Facility (“TCDF”), a privately run\n\ncorrectional institution in Estancia, New Mexico. In his complaint, Kirby alleged\n\n(1) that he had been unconstitutionally denied access to the courts by Robert\n\nEzell, the warden at TCDF, and Shannon McReynolds, an employee of the New\n\nMexico Corrections Department (“NMCD”) responsible for ensuring TCDF’s\n\ncompliance with NMCD policies and procedures; (2) that he had been transferred\n\nbetween correctional facilities in violation of Fed. R. App. P. 23(a); (3) that he\n\nhad been unconstitutionally denied access to the courts by Vince Horton, the\n\nsecurity warden at Lea County Correctional Facility, a privately run correctional\n\ninstitution in Hobbs, New Mexico; and (4) that he had been unconstitutionally\n\n                                         -2-\n\fdenied access to the courts when he was forced to re-mail forty-two pieces of\n\nwhat he characterized as “legal mail.” Kirby subsequently amended his complaint\n\nto add a fifth claim, alleging that Grievance Officer David Brown of TCDF had\n\nretaliated against him for filing his § 1983 action by having Kirby placed in\n\nsegregation.\n\n      After Kirby’s complaint had been amended, the district court issued a\n\nmemorandum opinion and order, sua sponte dismissing Kirby’s Fed. R. App. P.\n\n23(a) claim pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915(e)(2)(B) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). 1\n\nThe district court subsequently granted Brown’s Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss\n\nKirby’s retaliation claim and then ordered the remaining defendants to prepare\n\nand produce reports pursuant to Martinez v. Aaron, 570 F.2d 317 (10th Cir.\n\n1978). The district court advised the remaining defendants that their Martinez\n\nreports could be used for summary judgment purposes.\n\n      After receiving the remaining defendants’ Martinez reports and Kirby’s\n\nresponses thereto, 2 the magistrate judge prepared a document it captioned as an\n\n      1\n       The district court subsequently denied Kirby’s request to reconsider this\ndismissal.\n      2\n         Kirby filed a document captioned “Second Request for Extension of Time\nto File a Response to the Martinez Report.” Therein, Kirby noted that “[i]f [his]\nRequest or Motion [was] sufficient to allow evaluation of the claims, the Court\nmay deem th[e] document as [his] Response.” ROA Vol. 2, at 510. The\nmagistrate judge’s Analysis and Recommended Disposition, which was adopted\nby the district court, accepted Kirby’s invitation and construed this filing to be\nboth a response to the defendants’ Martinez reports and a motion for a summary\n                                                                        (continued...)\n\n                                         -3-\n\f“Analysis and Recommended Disposition.” Therein, the magistrate judge\n\nrecommended (1) that Kirby’s claim that Ezell and McReynolds had denied him\n\naccess to the courts be dismissed with prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6); (2)\n\nthat Horton be granted summary judgment on the denial of access to the courts\n\nclaim that Kirby raised against him; (3) that Kirby’s claim that he was denied\n\naccess to the courts by being forced to re-mail certain documents be dismissed\n\nwith prejudice pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6); and (4) that Kirby’s Rule 56(f) motion\n\nbe denied. The district court subsequently entered an order which adopted the\n\nmagistrate judge’s recommended dispositions. In its order, the district court also\n\nrejected Kirby’s request, made in his objections to the magistrate judge’s\n\nAnalysis and Recommended Disposition, for leave to amend his complaint to add\n\nnew claims against new defendants. Kirby then filed this timely appeal.\n\n                                         II\n\n                                Standard of Review\n\n      “We review a grant of summary judgment de novo.” Annett v. Univ. of\n\nKan., 371 F.3d 1233, 1237 (10th Cir. 2004). In doing so, “we view the evidence\n\nand draw reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmoving party.” Id. (quotation and citation omitted). Ultimately, summary\n\njudgment is appropriate only “if the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure\n\n\n      2\n      (...continued)\njudgment continuance filed pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f).\n\n                                        -4-\n\fmaterials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).\n\n      Likewise, we “review[] de novo the district court’s grant of a motion to\n\ndismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), applying the same legal standard applicable in\n\nthe district court.” Corder v. Lewis Palmer Sch. Dist. No. 38, 566 F.3d 1219,\n\n1223 (10th Cir. 2009) (quotation and citation omitted). In doing so, we “look for\n\nplausibility in the complaint.” Id. (quotation and citation omitted). “Under this\n\nstandard, a complaint must include enough facts to state a claim to relief that is\n\nplausible on its face.” Id. at 1223-24 (quotation and citation omitted).\n\n      Finally, we review for an abuse of discretion both the district court’s denial\n\nof a Rule 56(f) motion, see Libertarian Party of N.M. v. Herrera, 506 F.3d 1303,\n\n1308 (10th Cir. 2007), and its denial of a motion to amend a complaint, see Hayes\n\nv. Whitman, 264 F.3d 1017, 1026 (10th Cir. 2001).\n\n                                      Analysis\n\n      As an initial matter, we note that the district court correctly dismissed\n\nKirby’s Fed. R. App. P. 23(a) claim. Rule 23(a) “was designed to prevent prison\n\nofficials from impeding a prisoner’s attempt to obtain habeas corpus relief by\n\nphysically removing the prisoner from the territorial jurisdiction of the court in\n\nwhich a habeas petition is pending.” Hammer v. Meachum, 691 F.2d 958, 961\n\n(10th Cir. 1982) (quotation and citation omitted). The appeal which Kirby had\n\n                                         -5-\n\fpending before the Fifth Circuit at the time of his complained of transfers did not,\n\nhowever, relate to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. See United States v.\n\nKirby, 302 F. App’x 321, 321 (5th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). Rather, it related to a\n\npetition for a writ of coram nobis. Id. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit’s\n\njurisdiction to hear Kirby’s appeal could not have been, and indeed was not\n\ndefeated by Kirby’s transfers between correctional facilities in New Mexico. Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 505 n.4 (1954) (noting that a coram nobis\n\nproceeding is “a step in the criminal case and not, like habeas corpus where relief\n\nis sought in a separate case and record, the beginning of a separate civil\n\nproceeding.”). Thus, Rule 23(a) is simply irrelevant to Kirby’s complained of\n\ntransfers.\n\n      Next, we note that because Kirby has failed to plausibly allege that he has\n\nsuffered an “actual injury,” either as the result Ezell’s or McReynolds’ actions, or\n\nas the result of the delay he experienced in sending his forty-two pieces of “legal\n\nmail,” the district court correctly dismissed Kirby’s claims which relate to these\n\nactions. See Lewis v. Casey, 518 U.S. 343, 351 (1996) (“Insofar as the right\n\nvindicated by Bounds is concerned . . . the inmate . . . must . . . demonstrate that\n\nthe alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his\n\nefforts to pursue a legal claim.”). Further, because Kirby has failed to create a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to Horton’s personal involvement in any alleged\n\ndenial of Kirby’s access to the courts, the district court correctly concluded that\n\n                                          -6-\n\fHorton is entitled to summary judgment on this claim. See Gallagher v. Shelton,\n\n587 F.3d 1063, 1069 (10th Cir. 2009) (“Individual liability under § 1983 must be\n\nbased on personal involvement in the alleged constitutional violation.”) (quotation\n\nand citation omitted). And finally, upon our careful review of the record, we\n\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion either in denying\n\nKirby’s Rule 56(f) motion, or in denying his request to amend his complaint.\n\n                                          III\n\n      The judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED. Kirby is DENIED\n\nleave to proceed in forma pauperis and is ordered to make full payment of the\n\nfiling fee forthwith.\n\n                                                Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                                Mary Beck Briscoe\n                                                Chief Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f",

R. App. P. 23(a) claim. Rule 23(a) “was designed to prevent prison\n\nofficials from impeding a prisoner’s attempt to obtain habeas corpus relief by\n\nphysically removing the prisoner from the territorial jurisdiction of the court in\n\nwhich a habeas petition is pending.” Hammer v. Meachum, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"410239\"><a href=\"/opinion/410239/david-paul-hammer-v-larry-meachum-director-oklahoma-department-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">691</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">958</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 961\n\n(10th Cir. 1982) (quotation and citation omitted). The appeal which Kirby had\n\n                                         -5-\n\fpending before the Fifth Circuit at the time of his complained of transfers did not,\n\nhowever, relate to a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. See United States v.\n\nKirby, 302 F. App’x 321, 321 (5th Cir. 2008) (per curiam). Rather, it related to a\n\npetition for a writ of coram nobis. Id. Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit’s\n\njurisdiction to hear Kirby’s appeal could not have been, and indeed was not\n\ndefeated by Kirby’s transfers between correctional facilities in New Mexico. Cf.\n\nUnited States v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105176\"><a href=\"/opinion/105176/united-states-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505 n.4 (1954) (noting that a coram nobis\n\nproceeding is “a step in the criminal case and not, like habeas corpus where relief\n\nis sought in a separate case and record, the beginning of a separate civil\n\nproceeding.”). Thus, Rule 23(a) is simply irrelevant to Kirby’s complained of\n\ntransfers.\n\n      Next, we note that because Kirby has failed to plausibly allege that he has\n\nsuffered an “actual injury,” either as the result Ezell’s or McReynolds’ actions, or\n\nas the result of the delay he experienced in sending his forty-two pieces of “legal\n\nmail,” the district court correctly dismissed Kirby’s claims which relate to these\n\nactions. See Lewis v. Casey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118054\"><a href=\"/opinion/118054/lewis-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 351 (1996) (“Insofar as the right\n\nvindicated by Bounds is concerned . . . the inmate . . . must . . . demonstrate that\n\nthe alleged shortcomings in the library or legal assistance program hindered his\n\nefforts to pursue a legal claim.”). Further, because Kirby has failed to create a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to Horton’s personal involvement in any alleged\n\ndenial of Kirby’s access to the courts, the district court correctly concluded that\n\n                                          -6-\n\fHorton is entitled to summary judgment on this claim. See Gallagher v. Shelton,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"172882\"><a href=\"/opinion/172882/gallagher-v-shelton/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1063</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1069 (10th Cir. 2009) (“Individual liability under § 1983 must be\n\nbased on personal involvement in the alleged constitutional violation.”) (quotation\n\nand citation omitted). And finally, upon our careful review of the record, we\n\nconclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion either in denying\n\nKirby’s Rule 56(f) motion, or in denying his request to amend his complaint.\n\n                                          III\n\n      The judgments of the district court are AFFIRMED. Kirby is DENIED\n\nleave to proceed in forma pauperis and is ordered to make full payment of the\n\nfiling fee forthwith.\n\n                                                Entered for the Court\n\n\n                                                Mary Beck Briscoe\n                                                Chief Judge\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\f</pre>",
