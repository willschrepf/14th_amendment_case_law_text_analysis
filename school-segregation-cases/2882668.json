John R. Padova\n\n                   Submitted Under Third Circuit LAR 34.1(a)\n                              November 8, 2006\n\n       Before: SLOVITER, CHAGARES, and GREENBERG, Circuit Judges.\n\n                                 ___________\n\n                           (Filed November 30, 2007)\n\n                           OPINION OF THE COURT\n\n\n\n\nCHAGARES, Circuit Judge.\n\fPlaintiff/appellant Charles Willis sued his employer, the United States Air Force, alleging\n\nretaliation and discrimination on the basis of race and gender in violation of Title VII.\n\nDefendant/appellee James Roche, the Secretary of the Air Force, moved to dismiss\n\nWillis’ complaint pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), arguing that Willis’ claims were\n\nbarred by the doctrine of intra-military immunity, more commonly known as the Feres\n\ndoctrine. The District Court agreed and dismissed Willis’ complaint. We conclude that\n\nWillis’ claims are barred by the Feres doctrine, and will therefore affirm.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       Willis, a black male, is a civilian employee of the United States Air Force. At all\n\npertinent times, Willis has been stationed at the Willow Grove Air Reserve Station in\n\nWillow Grove, Pennsylvania. Willis is an Air Reserve Technician (ART) and Chief of\n\nthe Relocation, Employment, and Training Subdivision, a branch of the Military\n\nPersonnel Flight Division. In his capacity as head of this subdivision, Willis is a GS-11\n\nlevel employee and supervises six people. As a condition of his employment, Willis is\n\nrequired to be a member of the military reserves. Willis’ direct supervisor, Lt. Col. Jerald\n\nUber, and his second level supervisor, Lt. Col. Kay Long, are both on active military duty.\n\n       In his complaint, Willis alleges that Lt. Col. Uber subjected him to a variety of\n\nactions that constituted racial and gender-based discrimination. On August 1, 1997,\n\nWillis filed a formal charge of discrimination with the appropriate agency, the Air Force\n\nReview Board. Willis also filed a second discrimination charge on December 12, 1997.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fThese charges were consolidated, and the parties attended a hearing before an EEOC\n\nadministrative judge. The administrative judge determined that there was insufficient\n\nevidence to support Willis’ claims of discrimination, and the Air Force Review Board\n\nadopted the administrative law judge’s findings.\n\n       Thereafter, Willis filed suit in federal court, and the District Court dismissed his\n\ncomplaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). This appeal followed.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s dismissal of this action under\n\nRule 12(b)(1). In re Cybergenics Corp., 226 F.3d 237, 239 (3d Cir. 2000). “Because the\n\ngovernment’s challenge to the District Court’s jurisdiction was a factual one under Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), we are not confined to the allegations in the complaint (nor was the\n\nDistrict Court) and can look beyond the pleadings . . . .” Cestonaro v. United States, 211\n\nF.3d 749, 752 (3d Cir. 2000). As the plaintiff, Willis bears the burden to show that his\n\nclaims are not barred by the Feres doctrine. See Luckett v. Bure, 290 F.3d 493, 497 (2d\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n                                             III.\n\n                                             A.\n\n       Willis’ claims arise under 42 U.S.C. 2000e-16(a), which, inter alia, prohibits\n\nmilitary departments from engaging in employment discrimination. It is undisputed that\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fWillis is an employee of a military department. See 5 U.S.C. § 102 (defining “military\n\ndepartment” to include the Department of the Air Force).\n\n       The doctrine of intra-military immunity, first recognized in Feres v. United States,\n\n340 U.S. 135 (1950), however, sharply limits the scope of military department employees\n\nwho may seek relief under § 2000e-16(a). The issue in this case is whether Willis’ claims\n\nare barred by the so-called Feres doctrine.\n\n       In Feres, the Supreme Court held that uniformed members of the armed forces may\n\nnot bring suit against the federal government under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA)\n\nfor injuries that “arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.” Id. at\n\n146. This holding was based on “[t]he peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to\n\nhis superiors, the effects of the maintenance of such suits on discipline, and the extreme\n\nresults that might obtain if suits under the [FTCA] were allowed for negligent orders\n\ngiven or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty. . . .” United States v.\n\nBrown, 348 U.S. 110, 112 (1954).\n\n       The intra-military immunity doctrine has been extended well beyond its original\n\napplication to FTCA claims by active duty military personnel, and now applies to a broad\n\narray of constitutional and statutory claims by active duty and non-active duty military\n\npersonnel alike. For example, in Chappell v. Wallace, 462 U.S. 296 (1983), the Supreme\n\nCourt considered claims of race discrimination brought by five enlisted men serving in\n\nthe United States Navy against their supervisors, under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fAgents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, 403 U.S. 388 (1971). The Court held that the\n\nenlisted men could not maintain their lawsuit. Relying upon the Feres doctrine and its\n\nunderlying rationale, the Court explained “[c]ivilian courts must, at the very least, hesitate\n\nlong before entertaining a suit which asks the court to tamper with the established\n\nrelationship between enlisted military personnel and their superior officers. . . .”\n\nChappell, 462 U.S. at 300.\n\n       Apparently, every court of appeals considering the issue has held that the Feres\n\ndoctrine bars uniformed military personnel from bringing discrimination claims under\n\nTitle VII and other discrimination statutes. See, e.g., Stinson v. Hornsby, 821 F.2d 1537,\n\n1541 (11th Cir. 1987) (holding that the Feres doctrine bars Title VII claims by military\n\npersonnel on active duty); Roper v. Dep’t of the Army, 832 F.2d 247, 248 (2d Cir. 1987)\n\n(same); Gonzalez v. Dep’t of the Army, 718 F.2d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir. 1983) (same);\n\nJohnson v. Alexander, 572 F.2d 1219, 1222-23 (8th Cir. 1978) (same); see also Doe v.\n\nGarrett, 903 F.2d 1455, 1461-62 (11th Cir. 1990) (holding that Rehabilitation Act claims\n\nby active duty military personnel are barred); Baldwin v. United States Army, 223 F.3d\n\n100, 101 (2d Cir. 2000) (“As with Title VII and the ADEA, there is no indication that the\n\nremedies provided in the ADA were to be extended to uniformed members of the\n\nmilitary.”).\n\n       Recently, in Matreale v. New Jersey Dep’t of Military & Veterans Affairs,\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f487 F.3d 150 (3d Cir. 2007), our court considered whether the Feres doctrine barred\n\nemployment discrimination claims by a member of the New Jersey Army National Guard\n\nunder the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination. We decided that the Feres doctrine\n\ndid bar such employment discrimination claims and noted:\n\n       Without exception, in other post- Feres cases, the Court has adhered to the\n       compelling necessity of maintaining military discipline as the basis for\n       expanding the intra-military immunity doctrine to encompass a variety of\n       claims, against an assortment of defendants, brought by a range of\n       servicemen, for injuries arising out of, or in the course of activity incident\n       to, military service.\n\nId. at 153.\n\n       The analysis is less straightforward in cases where, as here, the plaintiff is not on\n\nactive military duty, but instead holds a position requiring performance of both military\n\nand civilian job duties. As a “military technician,” the hybrid nature of Wills’ job is\n\nexplicitly noted by statute. See 10 U.S.C. § 10216(d).1 Willis’ role and responsibilities as\n\n\n       1\n           Congress defined “military technician” as follows:\n\n       For purposes of this section and any other provision of law, a military\n       technician (dual status) is a Federal civilian employee who—\n\n       ...\n\n       (B) is required as a condition of that employment to maintain membership\n       in the Selected Reserve;\n\n       ...\n\n       (2) Military technicians (dual status) shall be authorized and accounted for\n       as a separate category of civilian employees.\n\n\n                                               6\n\fan ART 2 further confirm that his job is neither fish (totally civilian) nor fowl (totally\n\nmilitary). The question, then, is whether the military aspects of Willis’ job as an ART\n\npreclude him from asserting his claims of discrimination.\n\n                                              B.\n\n       Courts of appeals that have addressed this question have uniformly held that, at a\n\nminimum, Feres precludes claims by hybrid employees if their claims arise in whole or in\n\npart out of the military aspects of the claimant’s job. See, e.g., Luckett, 290 F.3d at 499\n\n(2d Cir. 2002); Brown v. United States, 227 F.3d 295, 298-99 (5th Cir. 2000); Mier v.\n\nOwens, 57 F.3d 747, 750-51 (9th Cir. 1995); see also Fisher v. Peters, 249 F.3d 433, 443\n\n(6th Cir. 2001) (holding that discrimination claims by hybrid employees are “irreducibly\n\n\n\n       2\n           ARTs are defined as:\n\n       Full time civilian employees who are also members of the Air Force unit in which\n       they are employed. In addition to their civilian assignments, they are assigned to\n       equivalent positions in the Reserve organization with a Reserve military rank or\n       grade. ARTs must maintain active membership in their Reserve unit of assignment\n       and keep satisfactory participation in order to keep their ART position.\n\nAppendix (App.) 66.\n\n       The role of an ART is:\n\n       To provide stable, continuous, full-time management, administration, and training\n       of the Ready Reserve and [oversee] the transition from a peacetime to a wartime or\n       national emergency situation to ensure mobilization readiness is maintained.\n       ARTs train reservists, provide continuity within the Reserve unit of assignment,\n       and support the unit’s gaining major command.\n\nApp. 62.\n\n                                               7\n\fmilitary in nature,” and therefore non-justiciable). We agree with our sister courts of\n\nappeals and, therefore, we must determine whether Willis’ discrimination claims arise\n\n“purely from [his] ART[] civilian position . . . .” Brown, 227 F.3d at 299.\n\n       In this case, it is clear that Willis’ claims do not arise purely from the civilian\n\naspects of his job as an ART. All of Willis’ claims arise out of his relationship with\n\nUber, who is Willis’ supervisor in both his military and civilian capacities. It therefore\n\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to partition Willis’ relationship with Uber into\n\ncivilian and military components.3 As a result, “[a]ny attempt surgically to dissect and\n\nanalyze the civilian relationship between [Willis and Uber], with its military dimensions, .\n\n. . would itself threaten to intrude into their military relationship.” Overton v. New York\n\nState Div. of Military and Naval Affairs, 373 F.3d 83, 96 (2d Cir. 2004). See Wright v.\n\nPark, 5 F.3d 586, 591 (1st Cir. 1993) (dismissing § 1983 claim on Feres grounds, noting\n\nthat “a technician’s dual roles are too tightly imbricated to be pried apart at a litigant’s\n\nwhim”).\n\n       An affidavit submitted Master Sergeant Timothy A. Martin further demonstrates\n\nthat any effort to segregate the military and civilian aspects of Willis’ relationship with\n\nUber would be futile. Martin’s affidavit supports the government’s contention that the\n\ncircumstances giving rise to several of Willis’ claims did not arise exclusively within the\n\n\n\n\n       3\n           Indeed, Willis does not even suggest how we could do so.\n\n                                               8\n\fcivilian aspects of his employment. We discuss the allegations mentioned in the Martin\n\naffidavit in the order in which they are listed in the complaint.\n\n       Willis first alleges that Uber discriminated against him by requesting personal and\n\nprivileged information. Martin states in his affidavit that Uber’s request arose in the\n\nmilitary context, as Uber sought information regarding Willis’ residence to determine\n\nwhether Willis was entitled to travel pay in either his civilian or his military capacity, or\n\nwhether such pay was limited to travel in connection with Willis’ military reserve status.\n\n       Willis also alleges that Uber improperly removed him as the Test Control Officer\n\nfrom the Career Development Course. Martin states in his affidavit that the Career\n\nDevelopment Course is a military—not civilian—training requirement, and that the\n\npurpose of this training is to provide individual service members with the skills and\n\nknowledge to perform their duties effectively.\n\n       With respect to Willis’ allegation that Uber illegally discriminated against him\n\nregarding his 5 skill level proficiency, Martin’s affidavit states that skill level\n\nproficiencies are military—not civilian—designations which refer to the performance\n\nlevel at which the holder can accomplish his or her duties in the Air Force Specialty Code\n\nor career field.\n\n       Willis also alleges that Uber discriminated against him by placing a letter of\n\nreprimand in the form of an Unfavorable Information File into the computerized military\n\npersonnel system without cause. In his affidavit, Martin states that an Unfavorable\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fInformation File is an official record of censures that a military member has received for\n\ndeficient performance. Martin also notes that unlike military employees, civilian\n\nemployees do not have Unfavorable Information Files.\n\n       Willis also alleges that Uber discriminated against him by removing him from his\n\noffice and placing him among his subordinates as a working supervisor. According to\n\nMartin, Willis’ removal and change of position was the result of a restructuring of the\n\nMilitary Personnel Flight at the direction of Air Force Reserve Command. As the District\n\nCourt properly concluded, this decision to reorganize is “integrally related to the\n\nmilitary’s unique structure,” and is therefore non-justiciable. 6A, 27A-30A; Cf. Mier, 57\n\nF.3d at 750-51 (barring discrimination and retaliation claims arising out of military’s\n\ndecision not to promote plaintiff).\n\n       Given the nature of the relationship between Willis and Uber, and given Willis’\n\nfailure to offer any evidence to contradict Martin’s affidavit, we conclude that the\n\ncircumstances about which Willis complains did not arise wholly in the context of the\n\ncivilian aspects of his employment. Accordingly, Willis has failed to carry his burden to\n\nshow that his claims are justiciable, and they must therefore be dismissed.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s decision in all\n\nrespects.\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f",

R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1), arguing that Willis’ claims were\n\nbarred by the doctrine of intra-military immunity, more commonly known as the Feres\n\ndoctrine. The District Court agreed and dismissed Willis’ complaint. We conclude that\n\nWillis’ claims are barred by the Feres doctrine, and will therefore affirm.\n\n                                              I.\n\n       Willis, a black male, is a civilian employee of the United States Air Force. At all\n\npertinent times, Willis has been stationed at the Willow Grove Air Reserve Station in\n\nWillow Grove, Pennsylvania. Willis is an Air Reserve Technician (ART) and Chief of\n\nthe Relocation, Employment, and Training Subdivision, a branch of the Military\n\nPersonnel Flight Division. In his capacity as head of this subdivision, Willis is a GS-11\n\nlevel employee and supervises six people. As a condition of his employment, Willis is\n\nrequired to be a member of the military reserves. Willis’ direct supervisor, Lt. Col. Jerald\n\nUber, and his second level supervisor, Lt. Col. Kay Long, are both on active military duty.\n\n       In his complaint, Willis alleges that Lt. Col. Uber subjected him to a variety of\n\nactions that constituted racial and gender-based discrimination. On August 1, 1997,\n\nWillis filed a formal charge of discrimination with the appropriate agency, the Air Force\n\nReview Board. Willis also filed a second discrimination charge on December 12, 1997.\n\n\n\n                                              2\n\fThese charges were consolidated, and the parties attended a hearing before an EEOC\n\nadministrative judge. The administrative judge determined that there was insufficient\n\nevidence to support Willis’ claims of discrimination, and the Air Force Review Board\n\nadopted the administrative law judge’s findings.\n\n       Thereafter, Willis filed suit in federal court, and the District Court dismissed his\n\ncomplaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(1). This appeal followed.\n\n                                             II.\n\n       We exercise plenary review over the District Court’s dismissal of this action under\n\nRule 12(b)(1).

As the plaintiff, Willis bears the burden to show that his\n\nclaims are not barred by the Feres doctrine. See Luckett v.

It is undisputed that\n\n\n\n\n                                              3\n\fWillis is an employee of a military department. See 5 U.S.C. § 102 (defining “military\n\ndepartment” to include the Department of the Air Force).\n\n       The doctrine of intra-military immunity, first recognized in Feres v. United States,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104831\"><a href=\"/opinion/104831/feres-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">340</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1950), however, sharply limits the scope of military department employees\n\nwho may seek relief under § 2000e-16(a). The issue in this case is whether Willis’ claims\n\nare barred by the so-called Feres doctrine.\n\n       In Feres, the Supreme Court held that uniformed members of the armed forces may\n\nnot bring suit against the federal government under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA)\n\nfor injuries that “arise out of or are in the course of activity incident to service.” Id. at\n\n146. This holding was based on “[t]he peculiar and special relationship of the soldier to\n\nhis superiors, the effects of the maintenance of such suits on discipline, and the extreme\n\nresults that might obtain if suits under the [FTCA] were allowed for negligent orders\n\ngiven or negligent acts committed in the course of military duty. . . .” United States v.\n\nBrown, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105252\"><a href=\"/opinion/105252/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112 (1954).\n\n       The intra-military immunity doctrine has been extended well beyond its original\n\napplication to FTCA claims by active duty military personnel, and now applies to a broad\n\narray of constitutional and statutory claims by active duty and non-active duty military\n\npersonnel alike. For example, in Chappell v. Wallace, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110960\"><a href=\"/opinion/110960/chappell-v-wallace/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1983), the Supreme\n\nCourt considered claims of race discrimination brought by five enlisted men serving in\n\nthe United States Navy against their supervisors, under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named\n\n\n\n                                                4\n\fAgents of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108375\"><a href=\"/opinion/108375/bivens-v-six-unknown-fed-narcotics-agents/\"><span class=\"volume\">403</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1971). The Court held that the\n\nenlisted men could not maintain their lawsuit. Relying upon the Feres doctrine and its\n\nunderlying rationale, the Court explained “[c]ivilian courts must, at the very least, hesitate\n\nlong before entertaining a suit which asks the court to tamper with the established\n\nrelationship between enlisted military personnel and their superior officers. . . .”\n\nChappell, 462 U.S. at 300.\n\n       Apparently, every court of appeals considering the issue has held that the Feres\n\ndoctrine bars uniformed military personnel from bringing discrimination claims under\n\nTitle VII and other discrimination statutes.

We decided that the Feres doctrine\n\ndid bar such employment discrimination claims and noted:\n\n       Without exception, in other post- Feres cases, the Court has adhered to the\n       compelling necessity of maintaining military discipline as the basis for\n       expanding the intra-military immunity doctrine to encompass a variety of\n       claims, against an assortment of defendants, brought by a range of\n       servicemen, for injuries arising out of, or in the course of activity incident\n       to, military service.\n\nId. at 153.\n\n       The analysis is less straightforward in cases where, as here, the plaintiff is not on\n\nactive military duty, but instead holds a position requiring performance of both military\n\nand civilian job duties. As a “military technician,” the hybrid nature of Wills’ job is\n\nexplicitly noted by statute. See 10 U.S.C. § 10216(d).1 Willis’ role and responsibilities as\n\n\n       1\n           Congress defined “military technician” as follows:\n\n       For purposes of this section and any other provision of law, a military\n       technician (dual status) is a Federal civilian employee who—\n\n       ...\n\n       (B) is required as a condition of that employment to maintain membership\n       in the Selected Reserve;\n\n       ...\n\n       (2) Military technicians (dual status) shall be authorized and accounted for\n       as a separate category of civilian employees.\n\n\n                                               6\n\fan ART 2 further confirm that his job is neither fish (totally civilian) nor fowl (totally\n\nmilitary). The question, then, is whether the military aspects of Willis’ job as an ART\n\npreclude him from asserting his claims of discrimination.\n\n                                              B.\n\n       Courts of appeals that have addressed this question have uniformly held that, at a\n\nminimum, Feres precludes claims by hybrid employees if their claims arise in whole or in\n\npart out of the military aspects of the claimant’s job.

In addition to their civilian assignments, they are assigned to\n       equivalent positions in the Reserve organization with a Reserve military rank or\n       grade. ARTs must maintain active membership in their Reserve unit of assignment\n       and keep satisfactory participation in order to keep their ART position.\n\nAppendix (App.) 66.\n\n       The role of an ART is:\n\n       To provide stable, continuous, full-time management, administration, and training\n       of the Ready Reserve and [oversee] the transition from a peacetime to a wartime or\n       national emergency situation to ensure mobilization readiness is maintained.\n       ARTs train reservists, provide continuity within the Reserve unit of assignment,\n       and support the unit’s gaining major command.\n\nApp. 62.\n\n                                               7\n\fmilitary in nature,” and therefore non-justiciable). We agree with our sister courts of\n\nappeals and, therefore, we must determine whether Willis’ discrimination claims arise\n\n“purely from [his] ART[] civilian position . . . .” Brown, 227 F.3d at 299.\n\n       In this case, it is clear that Willis’ claims do not arise purely from the civilian\n\naspects of his job as an ART. All of Willis’ claims arise out of his relationship with\n\nUber, who is Willis’ supervisor in both his military and civilian capacities. It therefore\n\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to partition Willis’ relationship with Uber into\n\ncivilian and military components.3 As a result, “[a]ny attempt surgically to dissect and\n\nanalyze the civilian relationship between [Willis and Uber], with its military dimensions, .\n\n. . would itself threaten to intrude into their military relationship.” Overton v.

Martin further demonstrates\n\nthat any effort to segregate the military and civilian aspects of Willis’ relationship with\n\nUber would be futile. Martin’s affidavit supports the government’s contention that the\n\ncircumstances giving rise to several of Willis’ claims did not arise exclusively within the\n\n\n\n\n       3\n           Indeed, Willis does not even suggest how we could do so.\n\n                                               8\n\fcivilian aspects of his employment. We discuss the allegations mentioned in the Martin\n\naffidavit in the order in which they are listed in the complaint.\n\n       Willis first alleges that Uber discriminated against him by requesting personal and\n\nprivileged information. Martin states in his affidavit that Uber’s request arose in the\n\nmilitary context, as Uber sought information regarding Willis’ residence to determine\n\nwhether Willis was entitled to travel pay in either his civilian or his military capacity, or\n\nwhether such pay was limited to travel in connection with Willis’ military reserve status.\n\n       Willis also alleges that Uber improperly removed him as the Test Control Officer\n\nfrom the Career Development Course. Martin states in his affidavit that the Career\n\nDevelopment Course is a military—not civilian—training requirement, and that the\n\npurpose of this training is to provide individual service members with the skills and\n\nknowledge to perform their duties effectively.\n\n       With respect to Willis’ allegation that Uber illegally discriminated against him\n\nregarding his 5 skill level proficiency, Martin’s affidavit states that skill level\n\nproficiencies are military—not civilian—designations which refer to the performance\n\nlevel at which the holder can accomplish his or her duties in the Air Force Specialty Code\n\nor career field.\n\n       Willis also alleges that Uber discriminated against him by placing a letter of\n\nreprimand in the form of an Unfavorable Information File into the computerized military\n\npersonnel system without cause. In his affidavit, Martin states that an Unfavorable\n\n\n\n                                               9\n\fInformation File is an official record of censures that a military member has received for\n\ndeficient performance. Martin also notes that unlike military employees, civilian\n\nemployees do not have Unfavorable Information Files.\n\n       Willis also alleges that Uber discriminated against him by removing him from his\n\noffice and placing him among his subordinates as a working supervisor. According to\n\nMartin, Willis’ removal and change of position was the result of a restructuring of the\n\nMilitary Personnel Flight at the direction of Air Force Reserve Command. As the District\n\nCourt properly concluded, this decision to reorganize is “integrally related to the\n\nmilitary’s unique structure,” and is therefore non-justiciable. 6A, 27A-30A; Cf. Mier, 57\n\nF.3d at 750-51 (barring discrimination and retaliation claims arising out of military’s\n\ndecision not to promote plaintiff).\n\n       Given the nature of the relationship between Willis and Uber, and given Willis’\n\nfailure to offer any evidence to contradict Martin’s affidavit, we conclude that the\n\ncircumstances about which Willis complains did not arise wholly in the context of the\n\ncivilian aspects of his employment. Accordingly, Willis has failed to carry his burden to\n\nshow that his claims are justiciable, and they must therefore be dismissed.\n\n                                            IV.\n\n       For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the District Court’s decision in all\n\nrespects.\n\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\f</pre>",
