GRIFFIN, J.\n(p. 5), delivered a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n        KAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge. Defendant-Appellant Jennifer Brunner,\nSecretary of State of Ohio (“the Secretary”), brings this emergency motion to stay or vacate the\ndistrict court’s grant of a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) restraining enforcement of\nAdvisory 2008-24, which advised county boards of elections that they are not required to allow\nelection observers during the 35-day in-person absentee voting period immediately preceding\nElection Day. The Secretary argues before this court that (1) the district court lacked jurisdiction\nto issue injunctive relief against state officials on the basis of state law, and (2) the district court\nabused its discretion in granting the TRO. Plaintiffs-Appellees, the Ohio Republican Party and\nLarry Wolpert, bring an emergency motion seeking an injunction restraining the Secretary from\nallowing simultaneous registration and absentee voting to the extent that ballots cast by newly\nregistered voters are not physically segregated from other ballots. For the reasons stated below, we\nGRANT the Secretary’s emergency motion to stay the district court’s TRO and DENY the\nplaintiffs’ emergency motion for an injunction.\n\n\n\n        *\n           The Honorable Myron H. Bright, Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\n\n                                                         1\n\fNos. 08-4242/4243/4251          Ohio Republican Party et al. v. Brunner                         Page 2\n\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n       This case involves a dispute over the five-day window (from September 30, 2008, through\nOctober 6, 2008) under Ohio election law during which a voter may both register to vote and\nsimultaneously cast an absentee ballot. On August 13, 2008, the Secretary issued Directive 2008-63,\nwhich directed county boards of elections to develop procedures for same-day registration and the\nissuance of absentee ballots at the time of registration. The instant case is the third suit to be filed\nconcerning same-day registration and absentee balloting.\n         The first suit filed was an original mandamus action against the Secretary filed on September\n12, 2008, in the Ohio Supreme Court that challenged Directive 2008-63. See State ex rel. Colvin\nv. Brunner, No. 2008-1813. This was followed by an action brought by a different group of\nplaintiffs in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. See Project Vote v.\nMadison County Bd. of Elections, No. 1:08-cv-2266. That suit sought named the Madison County\nBoard of Elections as a defendant because it had indicated that it would not enforce Directive 2008-\n63 to allow same-day registration and absentee balloting. The instant case was filed by the Plaintiffs\nin the Southern District of Ohio on September 26, 2008. Each of these actions involved the\npropriety of Directive 2008-63.\n        In the instant case, the Plaintiffs also challenged Advisory 2008-24, which was issued by the\nSecretary on September 23, 2008. Advisory 2008-24 addressed the question of “whether Ohio law\nprovides for election observers during the 35-day period for in-person absentee voting at board of\nelections offices or other designated sites.” This Advisory explained that Chapter 3505 of the Ohio\nRevised Code provides for the presence of observers at five distinct points during an election. The\nAdvisory concluded, however, that Chapter 3505 did not “provide[] for election observers during\nthe 35-day period for in-person absentee voting at boards of elections’ offices or other designated\nsites.” In reaching this conclusion, the Advisory stated that “the principal statute on election\nobservers, [Ohio Revised Code Section] 3505.21, appears only to address observers on Election\nDay.”\n        On September 27, 2008, the Secretary filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to\ntransfer venue and consolidate the present case with the Project Vote case pending in the Northern\nDistrict of Ohio. That motion was denied by the district court on September 28.\n       On September 29, the district court in the Project Vote case entered a TRO ordering the\nMadison County Board of Elections to follow Directive 2008-63. Also on September 29, the Ohio\nSupreme Court ruled in Colvin that the Secretary’s interpretation of Ohio law in Directive 2008-63\nwas correct.\n        On September 26, the Plaintiffs in the instant case filed a motion for a TRO and preliminary\ninjunction restraining enforcement of both Directive 2008-63 and Advisory 2008-24. Noting the\nOhio Supreme Court’s ruling in Colvin, the district court “abstain[ed] from ruling on the validity of\nDirective 2008-63.” But the district court granted a TRO with respect to Advisory 2008-24.\n                                           II. ANALYSIS\nA. TRO Restraining Enforcement of Advisory 2008-24\n        Although we generally lack jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a district court’s order granting\nor denying a TRO, we have allowed interlocutory appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 1291(a)(1) of “TROs\nwhich threatened to inflict irretrievable harms before the TRO expired.” Northeast Ohio Coalition\nfor the Homeless v. Blackwell, 467 F.3d 999, 1005-06 (6th Cir. 2006) (“NEOCH”). Given the\nextraordinary time constraints of the present dispute, the nature and effect of this TRO necessitate\nan immediate appeal. Accordingly, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.\n\fNos. 08-4242/4243/4251                Ohio Republican Party et al. v. Brunner                                  Page 3\n\n\n         We begin by addressing the Secretary’s argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction\nto grant injunctive relief based on the holding of Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman,\n465 U.S. 89, 124-25 (1984), that federal courts lack jurisdiction to enjoin state officials on the basis\nof state law. In granting the TRO restraining enforcement of Advisory 2008-24, the focus of the\ndistrict court’s analysis was on interpreting Ohio state law. Specifically, the district court\ninterpreted Ohio Revised Code Section 3505.21 as being applicable not just to election day but also\nto the same-day registration and absentee balloting authorized by Directive 2008-63, and therefore\nthe district court ruled that election observers must be allowed during same-day registration and\nballoting prior to election day. The district court thus ruled that Advisory 2008-24—which\nconcluded that Ohio Revised Code Section 3505.21 was only applicable on election day—was an\nincorrect interpretation of state law. Arguing that the district court’s order is grounded entirely in\nstate law, the Secretary contends that the injunctive relief against state officials here is barred by\nPennhurst. We believe that the Secretary’s position is well taken. As the Court wrote in Pennhurst,\n“it is difficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when a federal court instructs\nstate officials on how to conform their conduct to state law.” 465 U.S. at 106. The district court’s\norder granting the TRO appears only to construe the meaning of state law and does not link the issue\nof observers to any provision of federal law.\n        However, noting the time constraints under which it issued its decision, we will assume that\nthe district court issued the TRO on the basis of federal law. Specifically, in their motion for a TRO,1\nthe Plaintiffs argued that Advisory 2008-24 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (“VRA”).\nAccordingly, we will assume that the district court granted the TRO on the basis of the federal-law\nclaim under the VRA.\n         “The district court’s decision to grant a temporary restraining order, when appealable, is\nreviewed by this court for abuse of discretion.” NEOCH, 467 F.3d at 1009. In determining whether\nto stay the TRO, we consider “the same factors considered in determining whether to issue a TRO\nor preliminary injunction.” Id. These factors are:\n         (1) whether the movant has a strong liklihood of success on the merits, (2) whether\n         the movant would suffer irreparable injury absent a stay, (3) whether granting the\n         stay would cause substantial harm to others, and (4) whether the public interest\n         would be served by granting the stay.\nId.\n        We conclude that it is unlikely that the Plaintiffs will succeed on the merits. As we\nexplained above, we assume the district court granted the TRO on the basis of the Plaintiffs’ claim\nunder Section 2 of the VRA. Thus, we now turn to assessing the likelihood that the Plaintiffs will\nsucceed on the merits of this VRA claim. Section 2 of the VRA provides that “no voting\nqualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied\nby any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right\nof any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).\nIn essence, the Plaintiffs argue that Advisory 2008-24 violates the VRA because it incorrectly\ninterprets state law so as to bar outside election observers during same-day registration and balloting\nactivities. Because the observers authorized by state law would not be present, the Plaintiffs contend\nthat the Advisory “increases the possibility that voters will suffer intimidation while attempting to\nexercise their franchise.” Plaintiffs’ Motion for TRO at 16.\n\n\n\n         1\n         The Plaintiffs raised several other federal claims in that motion. But specific argument on these other federal\nclaims was directed only at Directive 2008-63 and not at Advisory 2008-24.\n\fNos. 08-4242/4243/4251          Ohio Republican Party et al. v. Brunner                         Page 4\n\n\n         Even assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs’ interpretation of Ohio law is correct and that\nobservers should be permitted, we believe that Plaintiffs have little likelihood of success on the\nmerits of a VRA claim based on these allegations. We are aware of no case—and none was cited\nin the Plaintiffs’ motion—in which a VRA claim has succeeded based on allegations that state-law-\nauthorized observers were unlawfully excluded from a polling facility. Given the absence of any\nauthority for a successful VRA claim based on facts similar to those alleged by the Plaintiffs, we\nconclude that this claim would have little likelihood of success on the merits. Because we believe\nthis factor is dispositive, we need not address the other three factors for determining whether to grant\na TRO or preliminary injunction. See, e.g., Bonnell v. Lorenzo, 241 F.3d 800, 809 (6th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 534 U.S. 951 (2001).\n        Because we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in granting the TRO, we\ngrant the Secretary’s motion for a stay of the TRO.\nB. Plaintiffs’ Motion for an Injunction\n        On cross-appeal, the Plaintiffs move this court for an injunction requiring the Secretary “to\norder the segregation of the absentee ballots cast by newly registered (and hence unverified) voters\nand verification of those voters’ eligibility prior to counting their ballots, consistent with federal\nlaw.” Response to Emergency Mot. at 4. The district court never ruled on this issue. Further, this\nmotion raises factual issues concerning whether the absentee ballots cast by newly registered voters\nare properly handled by county boards of elections. According to the Secretary, “each county board\nof elections keeps the absentee ballots, once cast, under lock and key. Board employees—one\nmember from each political party—then carefully check each ballot envelope before removing the\nballot to ensure that the voter was properly registered and the ballot properly cast.” Secretary’s\nResponse at 7-8. We believe that such factually-intensive issues are best presented, in the first\ninstance, to the district court. Accordingly, we deny the Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for an\ninjunction.\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n         For the reasons stated above, we GRANT the Secretary’s emergency motion to stay the\ndistrict court’s TRO and DENY the Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for an injunction.\n\fNos. 08-4242/4243/4251          Ohio Republican Party et al. v. Brunner                          Page 5\n\n\n                   _________________________________________________\n                     CONCURRING IN PART, DISSENTING IN PART\n                   _________________________________________________\n        GRIFFIN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I would affirm the district\ncourt in regard to both appeals. Thus, I respectfully dissent from the decision by the majority to stay\nthe temporary restraining order. Under the circumstances of this case, the district judge did not\nabuse his discretion by issuing the temporary restraining order. In deciding defendant’s emergency\nrequest to stay the temporary restraining order, we consider the following four factors:\n       (1) whether the movant has a “strong” likelihood of success on the merits;\n       (2) whether the movant would otherwise suffer irreparable injury; (3) whether\n       issuance of a preliminary injunction would cause substantial harm to others; and\n       (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuance of a preliminary\n       injunction.\nLeary v. Daeschner, 228 F.3d 729, 736 (6th Cir. 2000); see also Summit County Democratic Cent.\n& Exec. Comm., et al. v. Blackwell, et al., 388 F.3d 547, 550 (6th Cir. 2004). “All four factors are\nnot prerequisites but are interconnected considerations that must be balanced together.” Coalition\nto Defend Affirmative Action v. Granholm, 473 F.3d 237, 244 (6th Cir. 2006) (citing Mich. Coal.\nof Radioactive Material Users, Inc. v. Griepentrog, 945 F.2d 150, 153 (6th Cir. 1991)).\n        Defendant Secretary of State seeks to enforce a directive that would authorize county boards\nof election to exclude election observers from the sites when simultaneous registration and absentee\nballoting is occurring. The temporary restraining order issued by the district court against this\ndirective should remain in effect. Defendant has failed to establish irreparable injury by the\npresence of election observers; the public interest served by an exclusion; or the likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits. See Help Americans Vote Act of 2002 (“HAVA”), 42 U.S.C. § 15301, et seq.\nand U.S. CONST. amend. XIV.\n       As noted by Judge Smith in his order:\n       Moreover, there will be no harm to others if the temporary restraining order is issued.\n       All individuals who seek to register to vote may still do so. Further, those who wish\n       to request an absentee ballot and cast it may do so, and therefore the individual’s\n       right to vote has not been burdened in any way. However, if observers were not\n       permitted, there would be tremendous risk of harm to the general public as voter\n       fraud and intimidation are possible, leading to the undermining of voter confidence\n       as a whole.\n        I would affirm and therefore respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority’s order\nthat stays the temporary restraining order.\n\f",

Defendant-Appellant Jennifer Brunner,\nSecretary of State of Ohio (“the Secretary”), brings this emergency motion to stay or vacate the\ndistrict court’s grant of a Temporary Restraining Order (“TRO”) restraining enforcement of\nAdvisory 2008-24, which advised county boards of elections that they are not required to allow\nelection observers during the 35-day in-person absentee voting period immediately preceding\nElection Day. The Secretary argues before this court that (1) the district court lacked jurisdiction\nto issue injunctive relief against state officials on the basis of state law, and (2) the district court\nabused its discretion in granting the TRO. Plaintiffs-Appellees, the Ohio Republican Party and\nLarry Wolpert, bring an emergency motion seeking an injunction restraining the Secretary from\nallowing simultaneous registration and absentee voting to the extent that ballots cast by newly\nregistered voters are not physically segregated from other ballots. For the reasons stated below, we\nGRANT the Secretary’s emergency motion to stay the district court’s TRO and DENY the\nplaintiffs’ emergency motion for an injunction.\n\n\n\n        *\n           The Honorable Myron H. Bright, Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\n\n                                                         1\n\fNos. 08-4242/4243/4251          Ohio Republican Party et al. v. Brunner                         Page 2\n\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n       This case involves a dispute over the five-day window (from September 30, 2008, through\nOctober 6, 2008) under Ohio election law during which a voter may both register to vote and\nsimultaneously cast an absentee ballot. On August 13, 2008, the Secretary issued Directive 2008-63,\nwhich directed county boards of elections to develop procedures for same-day registration and the\nissuance of absentee ballots at the time of registration. The instant case is the third suit to be filed\nconcerning same-day registration and absentee balloting.\n         The first suit filed was an original mandamus action against the Secretary filed on September\n12, 2008, in the Ohio Supreme Court that challenged Directive 2008-63. See State ex rel. Colvin\nv. Brunner, No. 2008-1813. This was followed by an action brought by a different group of\nplaintiffs in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. See Project Vote v.\nMadison County Bd. of Elections, No. 1:08-cv-2266. That suit sought named the Madison County\nBoard of Elections as a defendant because it had indicated that it would not enforce Directive 2008-\n63 to allow same-day registration and absentee balloting. The instant case was filed by the Plaintiffs\nin the Southern District of Ohio on September 26, 2008. Each of these actions involved the\npropriety of Directive 2008-63.\n        In the instant case, the Plaintiffs also challenged Advisory 2008-24, which was issued by the\nSecretary on September 23, 2008. Advisory 2008-24 addressed the question of “whether Ohio law\nprovides for election observers during the 35-day period for in-person absentee voting at board of\nelections offices or other designated sites.” This Advisory explained that Chapter 3505 of the Ohio\nRevised Code provides for the presence of observers at five distinct points during an election. The\nAdvisory concluded, however, that Chapter 3505 did not “provide[] for election observers during\nthe 35-day period for in-person absentee voting at boards of elections’ offices or other designated\nsites.” In reaching this conclusion, the Advisory stated that “the principal statute on election\nobservers, [Ohio Revised Code Section] 3505.21, appears only to address observers on Election\nDay.”\n        On September 27, 2008, the Secretary filed a motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1404(a) to\ntransfer venue and consolidate the present case with the Project Vote case pending in the Northern\nDistrict of Ohio. That motion was denied by the district court on September 28.\n       On September 29, the district court in the Project Vote case entered a TRO ordering the\nMadison County Board of Elections to follow Directive 2008-63. Also on September 29, the Ohio\nSupreme Court ruled in Colvin that the Secretary’s interpretation of Ohio law in Directive 2008-63\nwas correct.\n        On September 26, the Plaintiffs in the instant case filed a motion for a TRO and preliminary\ninjunction restraining enforcement of both Directive 2008-63 and Advisory 2008-24. Noting the\nOhio Supreme Court’s ruling in Colvin, the district court “abstain[ed] from ruling on the validity of\nDirective 2008-63.” But the district court granted a TRO with respect to Advisory 2008-24.\n                                           II. ANALYSIS\nA. TRO Restraining Enforcement of Advisory 2008-24\n        Although we generally lack jurisdiction to hear an appeal of a district court’s order granting\nor denying a TRO, we have allowed interlocutory appeals under 28 U.S.C. § 1291(a)(1) of “TROs\nwhich threatened to inflict irretrievable harms before the TRO expired.” Northeast Ohio Coalition\nfor the Homeless v. Blackwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">999</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1005-06 (6th Cir. 2006) (“NEOCH”). Given the\nextraordinary time constraints of the present dispute, the nature and effect of this TRO necessitate\nan immediate appeal. Accordingly, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to consider this appeal.\n\fNos. 08-4242/4243/4251                Ohio Republican Party et al. v. Brunner                                  Page 3\n\n\n         We begin by addressing the Secretary’s argument that the district court lacked jurisdiction\nto grant injunctive relief based on the holding of Pennhurst State School & Hospital v. Halderman,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 124-25 (1984), that federal courts lack jurisdiction to enjoin state officials on the basis\nof state law. In granting the TRO restraining enforcement of Advisory 2008-24, the focus of the\ndistrict court’s analysis was on interpreting Ohio state law. Specifically, the district court\ninterpreted Ohio Revised Code Section 3505.21 as being applicable not just to election day but also\nto the same-day registration and absentee balloting authorized by Directive 2008-63, and therefore\nthe district court ruled that election observers must be allowed during same-day registration and\nballoting prior to election day. The district court thus ruled that Advisory 2008-24—which\nconcluded that Ohio Revised Code Section 3505.21 was only applicable on election day—was an\nincorrect interpretation of state law. Arguing that the district court’s order is grounded entirely in\nstate law, the Secretary contends that the injunctive relief against state officials here is barred by\nPennhurst. We believe that the Secretary’s position is well taken. As the Court wrote in Pennhurst,\n“it is difficult to think of a greater intrusion on state sovereignty than when a federal court instructs\nstate officials on how to conform their conduct to state law.” 465 U.S. at 106. The district court’s\norder granting the TRO appears only to construe the meaning of state law and does not link the issue\nof observers to any provision of federal law.\n        However, noting the time constraints under which it issued its decision, we will assume that\nthe district court issued the TRO on the basis of federal law. Specifically, in their motion for a TRO,1\nthe Plaintiffs argued that Advisory 2008-24 violates Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (“VRA”).\nAccordingly, we will assume that the district court granted the TRO on the basis of the federal-law\nclaim under the VRA.\n         “The district court’s decision to grant a temporary restraining order, when appealable, is\nreviewed by this court for abuse of discretion.” NEOCH, 467 F.3d at 1009. In determining whether\nto stay the TRO, we consider “the same factors considered in determining whether to issue a TRO\nor preliminary injunction.” Id. These factors are:\n         (1) whether the movant has a strong liklihood of success on the merits, (2) whether\n         the movant would suffer irreparable injury absent a stay, (3) whether granting the\n         stay would cause substantial harm to others, and (4) whether the public interest\n         would be served by granting the stay.\nId.\n        We conclude that it is unlikely that the Plaintiffs will succeed on the merits. As we\nexplained above, we assume the district court granted the TRO on the basis of the Plaintiffs’ claim\nunder Section 2 of the VRA. Thus, we now turn to assessing the likelihood that the Plaintiffs will\nsucceed on the merits of this VRA claim. Section 2 of the VRA provides that “no voting\nqualification or prerequisite to voting or standard, practice, or procedure shall be imposed or applied\nby any State or political subdivision in a manner which results in a denial or abridgement of the right\nof any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).\nIn essence, the Plaintiffs argue that Advisory 2008-24 violates the VRA because it incorrectly\ninterprets state law so as to bar outside election observers during same-day registration and balloting\nactivities. Because the observers authorized by state law would not be present, the Plaintiffs contend\nthat the Advisory “increases the possibility that voters will suffer intimidation while attempting to\nexercise their franchise.” Plaintiffs’ Motion for TRO at 16.\n\n\n\n         1\n         The Plaintiffs raised several other federal claims in that motion. But specific argument on these other federal\nclaims was directed only at Directive 2008-63 and not at Advisory 2008-24.\n\fNos. 08-4242/4243/4251          Ohio Republican Party et al. v. Brunner                         Page 4\n\n\n         Even assuming arguendo that Plaintiffs’ interpretation of Ohio law is correct and that\nobservers should be permitted, we believe that Plaintiffs have little likelihood of success on the\nmerits of a VRA claim based on these allegations. We are aware of no case—and none was cited\nin the Plaintiffs’ motion—in which a VRA claim has succeeded based on allegations that state-law-\nauthorized observers were unlawfully excluded from a polling facility. Given the absence of any\nauthority for a successful VRA claim based on facts similar to those alleged by the Plaintiffs, we\nconclude that this claim would have little likelihood of success on the merits. Because we believe\nthis factor is dispositive, we need not address the other three factors for determining whether to grant\na TRO or preliminary injunction. See, e.g., Bonnell v. Lorenzo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772253\"><a href=\"/opinion/772253/john-c-bonnell-and-nancy-l-bonnell-v-albert-lorenzo-william-macqueen/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 809 (6th Cir.), cert.\ndenied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">951</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001).\n        Because we conclude that the district court abused its discretion in granting the TRO, we\ngrant the Secretary’s motion for a stay of the TRO.\nB. Plaintiffs’ Motion for an Injunction\n        On cross-appeal, the Plaintiffs move this court for an injunction requiring the Secretary “to\norder the segregation of the absentee ballots cast by newly registered (and hence unverified) voters\nand verification of those voters’ eligibility prior to counting their ballots, consistent with federal\nlaw.” Response to Emergency Mot. at 4. The district court never ruled on this issue. Further, this\nmotion raises factual issues concerning whether the absentee ballots cast by newly registered voters\nare properly handled by county boards of elections. According to the Secretary, “each county board\nof elections keeps the absentee ballots, once cast, under lock and key. Board employees—one\nmember from each political party—then carefully check each ballot envelope before removing the\nballot to ensure that the voter was properly registered and the ballot properly cast.” Secretary’s\nResponse at 7-8. We believe that such factually-intensive issues are best presented, in the first\ninstance, to the district court. Accordingly, we deny the Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for an\ninjunction.\n                                        III. CONCLUSION\n         For the reasons stated above, we GRANT the Secretary’s emergency motion to stay the\ndistrict court’s TRO and DENY the Plaintiffs’ emergency motion for an injunction.\n\fNos. 08-4242/4243/4251          Ohio Republican Party et al. v.

I would affirm the district\ncourt in regard to both appeals. Thus, I respectfully dissent from the decision by the majority to stay\nthe temporary restraining order. Under the circumstances of this case, the district judge did not\nabuse his discretion by issuing the temporary restraining order. In deciding defendant’s emergency\nrequest to stay the temporary restraining order, we consider the following four factors:\n       (1) whether the movant has a “strong” likelihood of success on the merits;\n       (2) whether the movant would otherwise suffer irreparable injury; (3) whether\n       issuance of a preliminary injunction would cause substantial harm to others; and\n       (4) whether the public interest would be served by issuance of a preliminary\n       injunction.\nLeary v.

The temporary restraining order issued by the district court against this\ndirective should remain in effect. Defendant has failed to establish irreparable injury by the\npresence of election observers; the public interest served by an exclusion; or the likelihood of\nsuccess on the merits. See Help Americans Vote Act of 2002 (“HAVA”), 42 U.S.C. § 15301, et seq.\nand U.S. CONST. amend. XIV.\n       As noted by Judge Smith in his order:\n       Moreover, there will be no harm to others if the temporary restraining order is issued.\n       All individuals who seek to register to vote may still do so. Further, those who wish\n       to request an absentee ballot and cast it may do so, and therefore the individual’s\n       right to vote has not been burdened in any way. However, if observers were not\n       permitted, there would be tremendous risk of harm to the general public as voter\n       fraud and intimidation are possible, leading to the undermining of voter confidence\n       as a whole.\n        I would affirm and therefore respectfully dissent from that portion of the majority’s order\nthat stays the temporary restraining order.\n\f</pre>",
