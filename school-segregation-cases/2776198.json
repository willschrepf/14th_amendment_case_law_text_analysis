We affirm.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Factual and Procedural Background</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn June of 1994, McAllen Independent School District (\"McAllen\")\r\nentered into a contract with Vega Roofing Company, Inc. (\"Vega\r\nRoofing\") for roofing repair work at  McAllen High School.  The roof\r\nconsisted of a metal deck layered with concrete, tar impregnated felt,\r\ngravel, foam, and a final acrylic coating applied on top.  Under the\r\ncontract, Vega Roofing was to remove and replace areas of wet foam as\r\nidentified by infra-red scan, clean and dry the roof, and apply a new\r\nacrylic coating to the roof.  \tMcAllen failed to complete payments\r\nto Vega Roofing under the contract, and Juan Vega and Vega Roofing\r\nfiled the underlying action alleging breach of contract against McAllen. \r\nMcAllen counterclaimed for breach of contract, breach of express and\r\nimplied warranties, and negligence.  McAllen also filed a third party\r\npetition against Commercial Indemnity Insurance Company\r\n(\"Commercial Indemnity\"), the bonding company for Vega Roofing,\r\nseeking enforcement of the payment and performance bonds and\r\nalleging fraud.  \t\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAt trial, the court granted a directed verdict against Juan Vega\r\nregarding his individual claims, a directed verdict for Commercial\r\nIndemnity regarding the fraud claim against it, and a directed verdict\r\nagainst McAllen on its negligence cause of action against Vega Roofing. \r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAccording to the jury's findings, McAllen failed to comply with the\r\ncontract and its failure to comply was not excused. Vega Roofing did\r\nnot breach the contract, it substantially performed its obligations under\r\nthe contract, and it did not breach its warranty to repair the roof in a\r\ngood and workmanlike manner.  The jury found that Commercial\r\nIndemnity did not breach its performance bond.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe trial court entered judgment for Vega Roofing for actual and\r\nconsequential damages of $100,171.40, and $92,000.00 in attorney's\r\nfees, plus attorney's fees on appeal.  Neither Juan Vega nor Commercial\r\nIndemnity are parties to this appeal. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen appeals the judgment against it by seven issues.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Substantial Performance</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tBy its first issue, McAllen asserts that Vega Roofing cannot\r\nrecover on a theory of substantial performance because it failed to prove\r\nthe appropriate credit due McAllen under the contract.  Vega Roofing\r\nresponds that it performed its part of the contract completely and\r\nMcAllen was not entitled to a credit on the contract price.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe doctrine of substantial performance allows a party to a\r\ncontract, who is himself in breach but who nevertheless substantially\r\ncompleted performance, to recover damages for that performance. \r\n<em>Dobbins v. Redden</em>, 785 S.W.2d 377, 378 (Tex. 1990).  A party that has\r\nsubstantially performed a building contract is entitled to recover the full\r\ncontract price less the cost of remedying those defects which are\r\nremediable.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>Vance v. My Apartment Steak House of San Antonio,\r\nInc.</em>, 677 S.W.2d 480, 481 (Tex. 1984); <em>Sheldon L. Pollack Corp. v.\r\nFalcon Ind.</em>, 794 S.W.2d 380, 382 (Tex.App.­Corpus Christi 1990, writ\r\ndenied).  In such cases, the party seeking to recover on the contract has\r\nthe burden of proving that he substantially performed under the\r\ncontract, the consideration due to him under the contract, and the cost\r\nof remedying the defects due to his errors or omissions.  <em>Vance</em>, 677\r\nS.W.2d at 483; <em>Sheldon L. Pollack Corp.</em>, 794 S.W.2d at 380.  The\r\ndoctrine of substantial performance is  inapplicable to non-breaching\r\nparties.   <em>Tacon Mechanical Contractors v. Grant Sheet</em>, 889 S.W.2d\r\n666, 670 (Tex. App.­Houston [14<sup>th</sup> Dist.] 1994, writ denied)(refusing to\r\napply substantial performance doctrine to bar recovery by non-breaching party); <em>see</em> <em>Dobbins</em>, 785 S.W.2d at 377-78 (substantial\r\nperformance allows defaulting party to recover on contract).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen argues that Vega Roofing's recovery was predicated on\r\nsubstantial performance because Vega Roofing failed to submit an issue\r\non full performance and the jury was asked about substantial\r\nperformance rather than full performance.  McAllen further argues that\r\nbecause Vega Roofing failed to present evidence regarding the\r\nreasonable and necessary cost of repairing, correcting, or completing\r\nthe work to achieve final completion, Vega Roofing failed to carry its\r\nburden to establish any credit due to McAllen, thus barring recovery\r\nunder substantial performance.  Ultimately, McAllen contends that the\r\ndeficiency under the substantial performance standard is fatal to Vega\r\nRoofing's recovery because McAllen assumes that the jury's negative\r\nanswer to the question of whether Vega Roofing breached the contract\r\ndoes not satisfy Vega Roofing's burden to prove complete performance. \r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe disagree with McAllen's assumption that Vega Roofing's\r\nrecovery was based on substantial performance.  Vega Roofing's\r\npleadings do not invoke the substantial performance doctrine, but rather\r\nallege breach of contract.  At trial, Juan Vega testified that all the work\r\nrequired by the contract documents was performed; that he believed\r\nthat the proper insurance was provided and accepted; that none of the\r\nreported leaks were related to the roof; and that all defective materials\r\nor workmanship was corrected.  Vega Roofing further objected to the\r\nsubmission of the substantial performance issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe jury found that McAllen failed to comply with the contract;\r\nthat McAllen's breach of contract was unexcused; that  Vega Roofing\r\ndid not breach the contract; that Vega Roofing did not breach its\r\nwarranty to repair the roofs in a good and workmanlike manner; and\r\nthat Vega Roofing substantially performed its obligations under the\r\ncontract.  These fact findings necessarily imply that Vega Roofing\r\nperformed its obligations under the contract.  This conclusion is\r\nessentially acknowledged by McAllen in its second point of error, which\r\nstates: \"the jury found that Vega Roofing did not breach the\r\nsubcontract.\"  Moreover, \"substantial performance\" means that the\r\nessential elements of a contract have been performed and is the legal\r\nequivalent to full performance.  <em>Anderson v. Vinson Exploration, Inc.</em>,\r\n832 S.W.2d 657, 666 (Tex.App.­El Paso 1992, writ denied).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tVega Roofing was a non-breaching party, and the doctrine of\r\nsubstantial performance is  inapplicable to non-breaching parties.  \r\n<em>Tacon Mechanical Contractors</em>, 889 S.W.2d at 670; <em>see</em> <em>Dobbins</em>, 785\r\nS.W.2d at 377-78.  Accordingly, we overrule McAllen's first point of\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Conflict in Jury's Answers</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its second point of error, McAllen alleges that a fatal conflict\r\nexists between the jury's answer to question four finding that Vega\r\nRoofing substantially completed the work on December 15, 1994, and\r\nthe jury's answer to question five finding that Vega Roofing did not\r\nbreach the contract.  McAllen argues that these findings are in conflict\r\nbecause the contract provided that time was of the essence, and Vega\r\nRoofing did not perform the contract in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn order to preserve error when jury answers are alleged to be in\r\nfatal conflict, an appellant must object to the conflict before the jury is\r\ndischarged.  <em>City of Port Isabel v. Shiba</em>, 976 S.W.2d 856, 860\r\n(Tex.App.­Corpus Christi 1998, writ denied); <em>Durkay v. Madco Oil Co.</em>,\r\n862 S.W.2d 14, 23 (Tex.App.­Corpus Christi 1993, writ denied); <em>see</em>\r\nTex. R. Civ. P. 295.  McAllen failed to object to the jury's allegedly\r\nconflicting answers before the jury was discharged, therefore, the\r\ncomplaint that the jury's answers are in fatal conflict has been waived. \r\n<em>Shiba</em>, 976 S.W.2d at 860.  McAllen's second issue is overruled.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Factual Sufficiency</u>    </center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tBy its third issue, McAllen argues that the jury's finding that Vega\r\nRoofing did not breach the contract is supported by factually insufficient\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn conducting a factual sufficiency review, an appellate court must\r\nconsider and weigh all of the evidence, not just that evidence which\r\nsupports the judgment. <em>Maritime Overseas Corp. v. Ellis,</em> 971 S.W.2d\r\n402, 407 (Tex. 1998),<em> cert. denied</em>, 119 S.Ct. 541 (1998).  The judgment\r\ncan be set aside only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight and\r\npreponderance of the evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.  <em>See\r\nid.;  Cain v. Bain</em>, 709 S.W.2d 175, 176 (Tex. 1986).  In conducting our\r\nreview, we are mindful that it is for the trier of fact, not this court, to\r\njudge the credibility of the evidence, assign the weight to be given to\r\ntestimony, and resolve conflicts or inconsistencies.  <em>Perseus, Inc. v.\r\nCanody</em>, 995 S.W.2d 202, 205 (Tex.App.­San Antonio 1999, no pet.).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen argues that Vega Roofing breached the contract in three\r\nseparate instances by (1) failing to achieve substantial completion\r\nwithin seventy days after commencement of work as required by the\r\ncontract and the notice to proceed; (2) failing to provide insurance as\r\nrequired by the subcontract; and (3) failing to perform its work in\r\naccordance with the plans and specifications for work and in a good\r\nand workmanlike manner.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen argues that Vega Roofing breached the contractual \"time\r\nis of the essence\" clause requiring that all new work be substantially\r\ncompleted seventy days after commencement of the project.  The jury\r\nfound that Vega Roofing reached substantial completion on December\r\n15, 1994, more than seventy days after it commenced work.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe contract at issue includes the following language in a\r\nliquidated damages provision:\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOWNER and CONTRACTOR recognize that time is of the\r\nessence in this Agreement and that OWNER will suffer\r\nfinancial loss if the Work is not completed within the time\r\nspecified in Paragraph 3.1 above, plus any extensions\r\nthereof allowed in accordance with Article 8 of the General\r\nConditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Both Article 8 and the \"notice to proceed\" under the contract authorized\r\nthe completion date to be extended for causes beyond the control and\r\nwithout fault or negligence of the contractor.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAt trial, Vega Roofing presented several reasons for extension of\r\nthe completion date.  Although disputed, Vega presented some\r\ntestimony that he was unable to begin work in a timely manner due to\r\ndelay in receipt of an infra-red survey of the roof.  Vega further testified\r\nthat McAllen diverted Vega Roofing from the roofing project at issue in\r\norder to perform emergency repairs on other buildings not relating to\r\nthe contract itself.  Testimony in the record also indicated that McAllen\r\non occasion ordered Vega Roofing not to work on the roofs because of\r\nan election and because of the noise level created by the roofing repairs. \r\nFinally, Vega testified that there were some occasions on which Vega\r\nRoofing was unable to work due to weather.  According to Vega, the\r\ncontract was completed in late October of 1994.  While the jury found\r\nthat the project was not substantially completed until December 15,\r\n1994, the jury could have determined that the delays were for\r\nunforeseeable causes beyond the control and without fault or\r\nnegligence of Vega Roofing. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tPointing to discrepancies within the insurance documents,\r\nMcAllen also contended that Vega Roofing breached the contract by\r\nfailing to provide insurance as specified by the contract.  The contract\r\nrequired that Vega Roofing procure $2,000,000 in insurance listing\r\nMcAllen as an insured.  The jury had before it a certificate of insurance\r\nwith the required $2,000,000 coverage which listed McAllen as an\r\ninsured.  At trial, Vega testified that he complied with the contract, and\r\nthat McAllen did not complain about the provided insurance.  Given this\r\ntestimony, the jury could have found that Vega Roofing did not breach\r\nthe contract by failing to provide the requisite insurance.  Moreover,\r\neven if the jury had found that Vega failed to provide the specified\r\ninsurance, we do not see how any such breach could be a proximate\r\ncause of McAllen's alleged damages in the instant case.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tFinally, McAllen contends that Vega Roofing breached the contract\r\nby failing to perform its work in accordance with the plans and\r\nspecifications for work and in a good and workmanlike manner. \r\nSpecifically, McAllen alleged that Vega Roofing failed to properly\r\nprepare the roof before laying a new coating by failing to clean the roof\r\nand by failing to grind the old foam smooth, thus preventing adequate\r\nadhesion of the coating to the underlying foam; that Vega Roofing\r\ncoated over gas lines and conduits, causing poor drainage; that Vega\r\nRoofing had failed to locate and remove all of the wet or saturated\r\nurethane foam insulation; that Vega Roofing sealed the weep holes\r\nretarding drainage; that Vega Roofing failed to slope the roof, causing\r\npoor drainage; that Vega Roofing had applied too much primer and too\r\nlittle coating; and that the roof leaked.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen's expert, Edis Oliver, presented testimonial and\r\ndocumentary evidence regarding the foregoing instances.  Oliver\r\ntestified that Vega Roofing applied coating over gas lines and conduit\r\nthat ran across the roof, which caused dams preventing drainage from\r\nthe roof.  Oliver testified that Vega Roofing had full responsibility for\r\nexamining the conditions affecting his ability to perform the work, and\r\nthat Vega Roofing had failed to locate and remove all of the wet or\r\nsaturated polyurethane foam insulation.  Further, Oliver found evidence\r\nof dirt between the layers of coating, indicating that the roof surface\r\nhad not been properly cleaned. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn so testifying, however, Oliver admitted that he did not compare\r\nthe pre-repair and post-repair infra-red scans of the roof to determine\r\nthe amount of polyurethane insulation to be replaced, as provided by\r\nthe contract.  Oliver further agreed that the dirt found between the\r\nlayers of coating could have resulted from water drifting into the area\r\nrather than the result of coating over dirt.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOliver testified that his only experience in connection with\r\npolyurethane foam roofs was approximately twenty years earlier when\r\nhe spent around two hours watching two separate roof installations. \r\nOliver had never installed a polyurethane roof, and had not seen a\r\npolyurethane roof in the last decade.  Oliver performed no testing on the\r\nroof.  Oliver was unable to say whether the coating that Vega applied\r\nwas acrylic or urethane.  Further, Oliver disagreed with another of\r\nMcAllen's experts regarding whether a sample of the roof showed signs\r\nof delamination or reversion.  Significantly, Oliver admitted that the\r\nVega Roofing personnel who were at the job site at the time of the\r\nperformance were in a better position to know whether the job was\r\ndone correctly than someone else reviewing the work four years after\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMichael Hamilton, a registered roof consultant who provided\r\nexpert testimony for McAllen, testified that the flow to the existing roof\r\ndrains had been blocked by the application of foam and subsequent\r\nblistering, that weep holes had been sealed in the rise walls, and that\r\nVega Roofing failed to slope the roof to the drains.  However, Hamilton\r\nconceded that he could not tell whether Vega Roofing had replaced any\r\nfoam in the location of the weep holes.  Hamilton also testified that\r\nwhile he believed that moisture in the roof might cause blisters, he\r\nadmitted that there could be other causes.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHamilton admitted that he had never sprayed polyurethane foam\r\nand that he was not an expert in polyurethane foam.  Hamilton\r\nadmitted that whether the roof in question was applied properly was\r\noutside his area of expertise.  Further,  Hamilton admitted that he stood\r\nto gain financially if the roof were determined to be defective. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tLamoine \"Buzz\" Lackey, another of McAllen's experts, testified\r\nthat a \"glaze\" existed between the old coating and the new coating\r\nwhich made it difficult for adhesion to occur, and that the glazing was\r\ncaused by Vega Roofing applying too much primer.  Lackey further\r\nfound that Vega Roofing had applied an insufficient amount of coating. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOn cross-examination, Lackey admitted that he had not done any\r\ntesting to determine whether Vega Roofing had used a primer. \r\nMoreover, Lackey testified that he believed the coating had been on the\r\nroof for just two years when he inspected it, although the roof was\r\nactually four years old at that time.  Lackey admitted that in order to\r\ncalculate the thickness of the coating at the time it was applied, he\r\nshould have taken into account four years of degradation.  Lackey only\r\ninspected the roof on one occasion, and he testified that he did not have\r\nenough time to adequately inspect the roof.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tDaniel Vela, a maintenance employee for McAllen, testified that he\r\nobserved Vega Roofing applying coating to the roof without cleaning it\r\nfirst, and showed photographs of the roof illustrating the dirt.  Vela\r\nfurther identified areas along the walls where weep holes should have\r\nbeen found, but were not because of the application of coating.  The\r\nphotographs depicting dirt were taken in 1995, after completion of the\r\nroofing project; none were taken during the roofing project. Vela\r\nadmitted that he did not personally observe anyone spray any weep\r\nholes, and that he could not remember whether the weep holes had\r\nbeen sprayed prior to Vega Roofing's work under the contract.   While\r\nVela was a lead maintenance foreman for McAllen at the time of trial,\r\nVela served as a plumbing supervisor at the time that the roofing repair\r\nwork was performed.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tRichard Martell, Jr., a contractor who performed the infra-red\r\nscans of the roof, testified regarding the pre-repair and post-repair infra-red scans.  Martell testified that infra-red scanning locates focal hot\r\nspots, which are areas of suspected moisture.  Martell identified the\r\nsame focal hot spot on both the pre-repair and post-repair infra-red\r\nscans of the roof.  Martell admitted that he did not know whether that\r\narea in fact had any moisture in it.  Martell testified that the existence\r\nof moisture in such areas should be confirmed by cutting into the foam. \r\nThe contract required the removal of moisture saturated areas, not\r\nremoval of spots identified as focal hot spots.  Martell's testimony was\r\nnot that Vega Roofing had failed to remove a moisture saturated area,\r\nbut rather that an area that had been identified by the first infra-red\r\nscan was also subsequently identified by the second scan.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tLionel Frederick, a McAllen employee, prepared a report showing\r\nleak locations, and documenting multiple leaks over an extended period\r\nof time.  However, McAllen only performed one test to determine the\r\nsource of the leaks, and that test showed that the leaks were coming\r\nfrom a side wall rather than the roof.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tJuan Vega testified that Vega Roofing had been in existence for\r\nthirty years, and that it had performed hundreds of foam roof\r\napplications.  Vega testified that Vega Roofing performed all work\r\nrequired by the contract, and that he provided proper insurance under\r\nthe contract.  He testified that none of the reported leaks were roof\r\nrelated, and that Vega Roofing had corrected all defective materials and\r\nworkmanship under the contract. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe note that the evidence in this case was sharply conflicting\r\nregarding whether Vega Roofing did the work it contracted to do in a\r\ngood and workmanlike manner, or whether, as McAllen claimed, the\r\nwork was defective.  Simply put, the jury resolved these issues in favor\r\nof Vega Roofing and against McAllen.  Although McAllen presented\r\nevidence of defects in Vega Roofing's performance, Vega Roofing's\r\nevidence is sufficient to support the jury's verdict.  Certainly, the jury's\r\nfindings are not \"so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the\r\nevidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.\"  <em>Cain</em>, 709 S.W.2d at 175. \r\nMcAllen's third issue is overruled.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Consequential Damages</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its fourth issue, McAllen argues that there is no evidence of\r\nconsequential damages, and therefore the trial court erred in awarding\r\na judgment that included actual and consequential damages.  The trial\r\ncourt submitted a broad form damage question, instructing the jury to\r\nconsider both actual and consequential damages, but asking for just\r\none total amount. The jury received the following instructions:\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tYou are instructed that the measure of damages for breach\r\nof contract is the actual amount of the complaining party's\r\nmonetary losses suffered as a direct consequence of the\r\ncontract breach.  In other words, it is the amount that places\r\nthe complaining party as nearly as possible in the position it\r\nwould have occupied had the defaulting party performed the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>\tYou are further instructed that, in addition to direct\r\ndamages, the complaining party may also recover\r\nconsequential damages that it proves to be the natural,\r\nprobable and foreseeable consequence of the other party's\r\nbreach.  A complaining party's proof of consequential\r\ndamages cannot be merely speculative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>McAllen objected to the failure to segregate damage findings.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe jury awarded Vega Roofing the sum of $100,171.40 in actual\r\nand consequential damages.  According to the evidence adduced at\r\ntrial, the balance remaining on the contract was $40,130.40.  Vega\r\nRoofing testified to an additional $40,000 for extra work and extra\r\ncontractual unit price work.  McAllen thus argues that for purposes of\r\nthis appeal, it is therefore \"assumed\" that the jury awarded $80,132.40\r\nin actual damages, and that the remaining sum, or $20,039.00, \"had to\r\nhave been\" awarded as consequential damages.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen's argument requires this Court to speculate about the\r\ncomponents of the jury's award.  It is improper for a reviewing court to\r\nengage in conjecture about the composition of a damage award. \r\n<em>Duggan v.

Sanchez</em>, 886\r\nS.W.2d 823, 826 (Tex.App.­San Antonio 1994, no writ).  The jury may\r\nor may not have awarded the full balance remaining on the contract,\r\nand may or may not have awarded the full amount for extra-contractual\r\nwork.  We cannot merely assume that the jury awarded these full\r\namounts, however, because the jury had before it additional evidence\r\nconcerning lost actual damages.  We do not know, for example,\r\nwhether the jury's award included any amount for contractual interest\r\non payments due and unpaid.   It would be improper for us to speculate\r\non how the jury divided its award of $100,171.40 among the various\r\nelements of damages.  <em>See Hernandez v. American Appliance Mfg.\r\nCorp</em>., 827 S.W.2d 383, 389 (Tex.App.­Corpus Christi 1992, writ\r\ndenied).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe only way that an appellant can successfully challenge a multi-element damages award is to address all of the elements and show that\r\nthe evidence is insufficient to support the damages award considering\r\nall of the elements.  <em>Price v. Short</em>, 931 S.W.2d 677, 688\r\n(Tex.App.­Dallas 1996, no writ); <em>Greater Houston Transp. Co. v.\r\nZrubeck</em>, 850 S.W.2d 579, 589 (Tex.App.­Corpus Christi 1993, writ\r\ndenied).  The failure to address an element of damages results in waiver\r\nof the sufficiency challenge.  <em>Greater Houston Transp. Co.</em>, 850 S.W.2d\r\nat 579.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen does not argue that the evidence favorable to this verdict,\r\nconsidered as a whole, is legally insufficient to support it.  McAllen fails\r\nto address the legal sufficiency of the actual damages.  We therefore\r\nreject McAllen's no evidence challenge regarding Vega Roofing's\r\ndamages.  <em>See Thomas v. Oldham</em>, 895 S.W.2d 352, 359-60 (Tex.\r\n1995).\r\n\r\n</p><p>  \tHowever, even if McAllen had not waived the issue, its challenge\r\nto the sufficiency of the evidence of consequential damages would lack\r\nmerit.  Vega Roofing presented uncontradicted evidence at trial\r\nregarding its entitlement to contractual interest on amounts due and\r\nunpaid.  Vega Roofing further presented evidence that it incurred\r\nsubstantial insufficient fund charges as a result of McAllen's failure to\r\nmake payment under the contract.  As a result of the dispute at issue,\r\nVega Roofing lost its ability to obtain bonding, and thus was unable to\r\nbid for large jobs.  Therefore, if McAllen had preserved its right to\r\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence, we would hold that the jury's\r\ndamages award is supported by sufficient evidence.  We overrule\r\nMcAllen's fourth issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Attorney's Fees</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its fifth issue, McAllen argues that the trial court erred in\r\nawarding attorney's fees to Vega Roofing because attorney's fees are\r\nnot recoverable against a school district as a matter of law. Because\r\nMcAllen failed to object to Vega Roofing's request for attorney's fees,\r\nMcAllen has waived this issue on appeal.  <em>City of Port Isabel</em>, 976\r\nS.W.2d at 860-61.  In fact, in pleadings filed with the trial court,\r\nMcAllen essentially conceded that attorney's fees might be recovered\r\nagainst it (\"Both MISD and Vega Roofing have made claims for recovery\r\nof their attorney's fees in this case.  Neither party's entitlement to such\r\nfees, of course, can be determined until liability is first determined by\r\nthe jury....\").  We overrule McAllen's fifth issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Directed Verdict</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its sixth issue, McAllen contends that the trial court erred in\r\ngranting a directed verdict for Vega Roofing on McAllen's claim for\r\nnegligent performance.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen had requested an issue regarding whether or not Vega\r\nRoofing was negligent in performing its work.  The trial court granted\r\na directed verdict on this issue on grounds that only \"contractual\"\r\ndamages were involved in McAllen's claim against Vega Roofing. \r\nMcAllen argues that it presented evidence of damage to the school\r\nseparate and apart from the roof contract in question; therefore, its\r\nnegligence cause of action should have been presented to the jury.  In\r\nmaking this argument, McAllen refers this Court to evidence concerning\r\nreports of roof leaks.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIf the defendant's conduct would give rise to liability independent\r\nof the fact that a contract exists between the parties, the plaintiff's\r\nclaim may sound in tort.  Conversely, if the defendant's conduct would\r\ngive rise to liability only because it breaches the parties' agreement, the\r\nplaintiff's claim ordinarily sounds only in contract.  <em>See DeWitt County\r\nElec. Coop., Inc. v. Parks</em>, 1 S.W.3d 96, 105 (Tex. 1999).  Thus, as a\r\ngeneral rule, if an express or implied contractual duty is negligently\r\nperformed,  causing only economic loss, only a breach of contract\r\naction may be maintained and a tort action for negligence is precluded. \r\n<em>See, e.g., Formosa Plastics Corp. USA v. Presidio Eng'rs and\r\nContractors, Inc</em>., 960 S.W.2d 41, 45-46 (Tex. 1998).   \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn  <em>Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. DeLanney</em>, 809 S.W.2d 493,\r\n493-95 (Tex. 1991), the Texas Supreme Court reviewed a plaintiff's\r\naction against a telephone company for its failure to publish an\r\nadvertisement in accordance with the contract between the parties. \r\nThe supreme court held that the claim arose solely from the contract\r\nand the plaintiff's alleged damages were only for economic loss,\r\ntherefore, the action sounded in contract and not in tort.  <em>Southwestern\r\nBell Tel. Co.</em>, 809 S.W.2d at 495.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSimilarly, in the instant case, McAllen's claim for negligent\r\nperformance arose from the contract, and the damages sought were\r\nonly for economic loss.  <em>See</em> <em>Parks</em>, 1 S.W.3d at 105; <em>Southwestern Bell\r\nTel. Co.</em>, 809 S.W.2d at 495.  Therefore, we overrule McAllen's sixth\r\nissue.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Attorney's Fees on Appeal</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its seventh issue, McAllen argues that the trial court erred by\r\nawarding unconditional attorney's fees on appeal.  In so arguing,\r\nMcAllen directs the Court's attention to the \"applicable\" part of the\r\njudgment as follows:\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Plaintiff VEGA\r\nROOFING COMPANY recover an additional ELEVEN\r\nTHOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($11,000.00) as\r\nattorney's fees, should MCALLEN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL\r\nDISTRICT file a notice of appeal or otherwise attempt to\r\nperfect an appeal to the Court of Appeals; that Plaintiff VEGA\r\nROOFING COMPANY recover an additional FIVE THOUSAND\r\nNO/100THS DOLLARS ($5,000.00) as attorney's fees should\r\nMCALLEN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT file a Petition\r\nfor Review with the Texas Supreme Court; and that Plaintiff\r\nVEGA ROOFING COMPANY recover an additional THREE\r\nTHOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($3,000.00) as\r\nattorney's fees, should a Petition for Review be granted by\r\nthe Texas Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>We agree that any award of attorney's fees on appeal must be\r\nconditioned on the receiving parties' success.  <em>Southwestern Bell Tel.\r\nCo. v. Vollmer</em>, 805 S.W.2d 825, 834 (Tex.App.­Corpus Christi 1991)\r\n(holding that an award of appellate attorney's fees must be conditioned\r\non the outcome of the appeal), <em>rev'd on other grounds</em>, 995 S.W.2d 668\r\n(Tex. 1998); <em>Stable Energy, L.P. v. Newberry</em>, 999 S.W.2d 538, 557\r\n(Tex.App.-Austin 1999, pet. denied).   However, the charge of the court\r\nexpressly provides such a condition in the paragraph immediately\r\npreceding the award.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED, should MCALLEN\r\nINDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT appeal this case and\r\nshould Plaintiff VEGA ROOFING COMPANY eventually prevail\r\non appeal, that Plaintiff VEGA ROOFING COMPANY recover\r\nits appellate attorney's fees as found by the jury. \r\nAccordingly, it is further. . . .\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Inexplicably, McAllen fails to reference this language in its brief or\r\nargument.  We find that the plain language of the judgment provides\r\nthat the award of additional attorney's fees to Vega Roofing is\r\nconditioned upon Vega Roofing's success on appeal.  McAllen's\r\nseventh issue lacks merit, and we overrule it accordingly.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHaving overruled each of McAllen's issues, we affirm the\r\njudgment of the trial court.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\t\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>\t<u>                                                  </u>\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tROBERT J.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Factual and Procedural Background</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn June of 1994, McAllen Independent School District (\"McAllen\")\r\nentered into a contract with Vega Roofing Company, Inc. (\"Vega\r\nRoofing\") for roofing repair work at  McAllen High School.  The roof\r\nconsisted of a metal deck layered with concrete, tar impregnated felt,\r\ngravel, foam, and a final acrylic coating applied on top.  Under the\r\ncontract, Vega Roofing was to remove and replace areas of wet foam as\r\nidentified by infra-red scan, clean and dry the roof, and apply a new\r\nacrylic coating to the roof.  \tMcAllen failed to complete payments\r\nto Vega Roofing under the contract, and Juan Vega and Vega Roofing\r\nfiled the underlying action alleging breach of contract against McAllen. \r\nMcAllen counterclaimed for breach of contract, breach of express and\r\nimplied warranties, and negligence.  McAllen also filed a third party\r\npetition against Commercial Indemnity Insurance Company\r\n(\"Commercial Indemnity\"), the bonding company for Vega Roofing,\r\nseeking enforcement of the payment and performance bonds and\r\nalleging fraud.  \t\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAt trial, the court granted a directed verdict against Juan Vega\r\nregarding his individual claims, a directed verdict for Commercial\r\nIndemnity regarding the fraud claim against it, and a directed verdict\r\nagainst McAllen on its negligence cause of action against Vega Roofing. \r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAccording to the jury's findings, McAllen failed to comply with the\r\ncontract and its failure to comply was not excused. Vega Roofing did\r\nnot breach the contract, it substantially performed its obligations under\r\nthe contract, and it did not breach its warranty to repair the roof in a\r\ngood and workmanlike manner.  The jury found that Commercial\r\nIndemnity did not breach its performance bond.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe trial court entered judgment for Vega Roofing for actual and\r\nconsequential damages of $100,171.40, and $92,000.00 in attorney's\r\nfees, plus attorney's fees on appeal.  Neither Juan Vega nor Commercial\r\nIndemnity are parties to this appeal. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen appeals the judgment against it by seven issues.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Substantial Performance</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tBy its first issue, McAllen asserts that Vega Roofing cannot\r\nrecover on a theory of substantial performance because it failed to prove\r\nthe appropriate credit due McAllen under the contract.  Vega Roofing\r\nresponds that it performed its part of the contract completely and\r\nMcAllen was not entitled to a credit on the contract price.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe doctrine of substantial performance allows a party to a\r\ncontract, who is himself in breach but who nevertheless substantially\r\ncompleted performance, to recover damages for that performance. \r\n<em>Dobbins v.

A party that has\r\nsubstantially performed a building contract is entitled to recover the full\r\ncontract price less the cost of remedying those defects which are\r\nremediable.  <em>Id.</em>; <em>Vance v.

In such cases, the party seeking to recover on the contract has\r\nthe burden of proving that he substantially performed under the\r\ncontract, the consideration due to him under the contract, and the cost\r\nof remedying the defects due to his errors or omissions.  <em>Vance</em>, 677\r\nS.W.2d at 483; <em>Sheldon L. Pollack Corp.</em>, 794 S.W.2d at 380.  The\r\ndoctrine of substantial performance is  inapplicable to non-breaching\r\nparties.   <em>Tacon Mechanical Contractors v. Grant Sheet</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1633835\"><a href=\"/opinion/1633835/tacon-mech-contractors-v-grant-sheet-metal-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span>\r\n<span class=\"page\">666</span></a></span>, 670 (Tex. App.­Houston [14<sup>th</sup> Dist.] 1994, writ denied)(refusing to\r\napply substantial performance doctrine to bar recovery by non-breaching party); <em>see</em> <em>Dobbins</em>, 785 S.W.2d at 377-78 (substantial\r\nperformance allows defaulting party to recover on contract).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen argues that Vega Roofing's recovery was predicated on\r\nsubstantial performance because Vega Roofing failed to submit an issue\r\non full performance and the jury was asked about substantial\r\nperformance rather than full performance.  McAllen further argues that\r\nbecause Vega Roofing failed to present evidence regarding the\r\nreasonable and necessary cost of repairing, correcting, or completing\r\nthe work to achieve final completion, Vega Roofing failed to carry its\r\nburden to establish any credit due to McAllen, thus barring recovery\r\nunder substantial performance.  Ultimately, McAllen contends that the\r\ndeficiency under the substantial performance standard is fatal to Vega\r\nRoofing's recovery because McAllen assumes that the jury's negative\r\nanswer to the question of whether Vega Roofing breached the contract\r\ndoes not satisfy Vega Roofing's burden to prove complete performance. \r\n\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe disagree with McAllen's assumption that Vega Roofing's\r\nrecovery was based on substantial performance.  Vega Roofing's\r\npleadings do not invoke the substantial performance doctrine, but rather\r\nallege breach of contract.  At trial, Juan Vega testified that all the work\r\nrequired by the contract documents was performed; that he believed\r\nthat the proper insurance was provided and accepted; that none of the\r\nreported leaks were related to the roof; and that all defective materials\r\nor workmanship was corrected.  Vega Roofing further objected to the\r\nsubmission of the substantial performance issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe jury found that McAllen failed to comply with the contract;\r\nthat McAllen's breach of contract was unexcused; that  Vega Roofing\r\ndid not breach the contract; that Vega Roofing did not breach its\r\nwarranty to repair the roofs in a good and workmanlike manner; and\r\nthat Vega Roofing substantially performed its obligations under the\r\ncontract.  These fact findings necessarily imply that Vega Roofing\r\nperformed its obligations under the contract.  This conclusion is\r\nessentially acknowledged by McAllen in its second point of error, which\r\nstates: \"the jury found that Vega Roofing did not breach the\r\nsubcontract.\"  Moreover, \"substantial performance\" means that the\r\nessential elements of a contract have been performed and is the legal\r\nequivalent to full performance.  <em>Anderson v.

Accordingly, we overrule McAllen's first point of\r\nerror.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Conflict in Jury's Answers</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its second point of error, McAllen alleges that a fatal conflict\r\nexists between the jury's answer to question four finding that Vega\r\nRoofing substantially completed the work on December 15, 1994, and\r\nthe jury's answer to question five finding that Vega Roofing did not\r\nbreach the contract.  McAllen argues that these findings are in conflict\r\nbecause the contract provided that time was of the essence, and Vega\r\nRoofing did not perform the contract in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn order to preserve error when jury answers are alleged to be in\r\nfatal conflict, an appellant must object to the conflict before the jury is\r\ndischarged.  <em>City of Port Isabel v.

McAllen's second issue is overruled.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Factual Sufficiency</u>    </center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tBy its third issue, McAllen argues that the jury's finding that Vega\r\nRoofing did not breach the contract is supported by factually insufficient\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn conducting a factual sufficiency review, an appellate court must\r\nconsider and weigh all of the evidence, not just that evidence which\r\nsupports the judgment. <em>Maritime Overseas Corp. v.

The jury\r\nfound that Vega Roofing reached substantial completion on December\r\n15, 1994, more than seventy days after it commenced work.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe contract at issue includes the following language in a\r\nliquidated damages provision:\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOWNER and CONTRACTOR recognize that time is of the\r\nessence in this Agreement and that OWNER will suffer\r\nfinancial loss if the Work is not completed within the time\r\nspecified in Paragraph 3.1 above, plus any extensions\r\nthereof allowed in accordance with Article 8 of the General\r\nConditions.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Both Article 8 and the \"notice to proceed\" under the contract authorized\r\nthe completion date to be extended for causes beyond the control and\r\nwithout fault or negligence of the contractor.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tAt trial, Vega Roofing presented several reasons for extension of\r\nthe completion date.  Although disputed, Vega presented some\r\ntestimony that he was unable to begin work in a timely manner due to\r\ndelay in receipt of an infra-red survey of the roof.  Vega further testified\r\nthat McAllen diverted Vega Roofing from the roofing project at issue in\r\norder to perform emergency repairs on other buildings not relating to\r\nthe contract itself.  Testimony in the record also indicated that McAllen\r\non occasion ordered Vega Roofing not to work on the roofs because of\r\nan election and because of the noise level created by the roofing repairs. \r\nFinally, Vega testified that there were some occasions on which Vega\r\nRoofing was unable to work due to weather.  According to Vega, the\r\ncontract was completed in late October of 1994.  While the jury found\r\nthat the project was not substantially completed until December 15,\r\n1994, the jury could have determined that the delays were for\r\nunforeseeable causes beyond the control and without fault or\r\nnegligence of Vega Roofing. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tPointing to discrepancies within the insurance documents,\r\nMcAllen also contended that Vega Roofing breached the contract by\r\nfailing to provide insurance as specified by the contract.  The contract\r\nrequired that Vega Roofing procure $2,000,000 in insurance listing\r\nMcAllen as an insured.  The jury had before it a certificate of insurance\r\nwith the required $2,000,000 coverage which listed McAllen as an\r\ninsured.  At trial, Vega testified that he complied with the contract, and\r\nthat McAllen did not complain about the provided insurance.  Given this\r\ntestimony, the jury could have found that Vega Roofing did not breach\r\nthe contract by failing to provide the requisite insurance.  Moreover,\r\neven if the jury had found that Vega failed to provide the specified\r\ninsurance, we do not see how any such breach could be a proximate\r\ncause of McAllen's alleged damages in the instant case.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tFinally, McAllen contends that Vega Roofing breached the contract\r\nby failing to perform its work in accordance with the plans and\r\nspecifications for work and in a good and workmanlike manner. \r\nSpecifically, McAllen alleged that Vega Roofing failed to properly\r\nprepare the roof before laying a new coating by failing to clean the roof\r\nand by failing to grind the old foam smooth, thus preventing adequate\r\nadhesion of the coating to the underlying foam; that Vega Roofing\r\ncoated over gas lines and conduits, causing poor drainage; that Vega\r\nRoofing had failed to locate and remove all of the wet or saturated\r\nurethane foam insulation; that Vega Roofing sealed the weep holes\r\nretarding drainage; that Vega Roofing failed to slope the roof, causing\r\npoor drainage; that Vega Roofing had applied too much primer and too\r\nlittle coating; and that the roof leaked.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen's expert, Edis Oliver, presented testimonial and\r\ndocumentary evidence regarding the foregoing instances.  Oliver\r\ntestified that Vega Roofing applied coating over gas lines and conduit\r\nthat ran across the roof, which caused dams preventing drainage from\r\nthe roof.  Oliver testified that Vega Roofing had full responsibility for\r\nexamining the conditions affecting his ability to perform the work, and\r\nthat Vega Roofing had failed to locate and remove all of the wet or\r\nsaturated polyurethane foam insulation.  Further, Oliver found evidence\r\nof dirt between the layers of coating, indicating that the roof surface\r\nhad not been properly cleaned. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn so testifying, however, Oliver admitted that he did not compare\r\nthe pre-repair and post-repair infra-red scans of the roof to determine\r\nthe amount of polyurethane insulation to be replaced, as provided by\r\nthe contract.  Oliver further agreed that the dirt found between the\r\nlayers of coating could have resulted from water drifting into the area\r\nrather than the result of coating over dirt.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOliver testified that his only experience in connection with\r\npolyurethane foam roofs was approximately twenty years earlier when\r\nhe spent around two hours watching two separate roof installations. \r\nOliver had never installed a polyurethane roof, and had not seen a\r\npolyurethane roof in the last decade.  Oliver performed no testing on the\r\nroof.  Oliver was unable to say whether the coating that Vega applied\r\nwas acrylic or urethane.  Further, Oliver disagreed with another of\r\nMcAllen's experts regarding whether a sample of the roof showed signs\r\nof delamination or reversion.  Significantly, Oliver admitted that the\r\nVega Roofing personnel who were at the job site at the time of the\r\nperformance were in a better position to know whether the job was\r\ndone correctly than someone else reviewing the work four years after\r\ncompletion.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMichael Hamilton, a registered roof consultant who provided\r\nexpert testimony for McAllen, testified that the flow to the existing roof\r\ndrains had been blocked by the application of foam and subsequent\r\nblistering, that weep holes had been sealed in the rise walls, and that\r\nVega Roofing failed to slope the roof to the drains.  However, Hamilton\r\nconceded that he could not tell whether Vega Roofing had replaced any\r\nfoam in the location of the weep holes.  Hamilton also testified that\r\nwhile he believed that moisture in the roof might cause blisters, he\r\nadmitted that there could be other causes.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tHamilton admitted that he had never sprayed polyurethane foam\r\nand that he was not an expert in polyurethane foam.  Hamilton\r\nadmitted that whether the roof in question was applied properly was\r\noutside his area of expertise.  Further,  Hamilton admitted that he stood\r\nto gain financially if the roof were determined to be defective. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tLamoine \"Buzz\" Lackey, another of McAllen's experts, testified\r\nthat a \"glaze\" existed between the old coating and the new coating\r\nwhich made it difficult for adhesion to occur, and that the glazing was\r\ncaused by Vega Roofing applying too much primer.  Lackey further\r\nfound that Vega Roofing had applied an insufficient amount of coating. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tOn cross-examination, Lackey admitted that he had not done any\r\ntesting to determine whether Vega Roofing had used a primer. \r\nMoreover, Lackey testified that he believed the coating had been on the\r\nroof for just two years when he inspected it, although the roof was\r\nactually four years old at that time.  Lackey admitted that in order to\r\ncalculate the thickness of the coating at the time it was applied, he\r\nshould have taken into account four years of degradation.  Lackey only\r\ninspected the roof on one occasion, and he testified that he did not have\r\nenough time to adequately inspect the roof.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tDaniel Vela, a maintenance employee for McAllen, testified that he\r\nobserved Vega Roofing applying coating to the roof without cleaning it\r\nfirst, and showed photographs of the roof illustrating the dirt.  Vela\r\nfurther identified areas along the walls where weep holes should have\r\nbeen found, but were not because of the application of coating.  The\r\nphotographs depicting dirt were taken in 1995, after completion of the\r\nroofing project; none were taken during the roofing project. Vela\r\nadmitted that he did not personally observe anyone spray any weep\r\nholes, and that he could not remember whether the weep holes had\r\nbeen sprayed prior to Vega Roofing's work under the contract.   While\r\nVela was a lead maintenance foreman for McAllen at the time of trial,\r\nVela served as a plumbing supervisor at the time that the roofing repair\r\nwork was performed.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tRichard Martell, Jr., a contractor who performed the infra-red\r\nscans of the roof, testified regarding the pre-repair and post-repair infra-red scans.  Martell testified that infra-red scanning locates focal hot\r\nspots, which are areas of suspected moisture.  Martell identified the\r\nsame focal hot spot on both the pre-repair and post-repair infra-red\r\nscans of the roof.  Martell admitted that he did not know whether that\r\narea in fact had any moisture in it.  Martell testified that the existence\r\nof moisture in such areas should be confirmed by cutting into the foam. \r\nThe contract required the removal of moisture saturated areas, not\r\nremoval of spots identified as focal hot spots.  Martell's testimony was\r\nnot that Vega Roofing had failed to remove a moisture saturated area,\r\nbut rather that an area that had been identified by the first infra-red\r\nscan was also subsequently identified by the second scan.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tLionel Frederick, a McAllen employee, prepared a report showing\r\nleak locations, and documenting multiple leaks over an extended period\r\nof time.  However, McAllen only performed one test to determine the\r\nsource of the leaks, and that test showed that the leaks were coming\r\nfrom a side wall rather than the roof.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tJuan Vega testified that Vega Roofing had been in existence for\r\nthirty years, and that it had performed hundreds of foam roof\r\napplications.  Vega testified that Vega Roofing performed all work\r\nrequired by the contract, and that he provided proper insurance under\r\nthe contract.  He testified that none of the reported leaks were roof\r\nrelated, and that Vega Roofing had corrected all defective materials and\r\nworkmanship under the contract. \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tWe note that the evidence in this case was sharply conflicting\r\nregarding whether Vega Roofing did the work it contracted to do in a\r\ngood and workmanlike manner, or whether, as McAllen claimed, the\r\nwork was defective.  Simply put, the jury resolved these issues in favor\r\nof Vega Roofing and against McAllen.  Although McAllen presented\r\nevidence of defects in Vega Roofing's performance, Vega Roofing's\r\nevidence is sufficient to support the jury's verdict.  Certainly, the jury's\r\nfindings are not \"so contrary to the overwhelming weight of the\r\nevidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.\"  <em>Cain</em>, 709 S.W.2d at 175. \r\nMcAllen's third issue is overruled.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Consequential Damages</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its fourth issue, McAllen argues that there is no evidence of\r\nconsequential damages, and therefore the trial court erred in awarding\r\na judgment that included actual and consequential damages.  The trial\r\ncourt submitted a broad form damage question, instructing the jury to\r\nconsider both actual and consequential damages, but asking for just\r\none total amount. The jury received the following instructions:\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tYou are instructed that the measure of damages for breach\r\nof contract is the actual amount of the complaining party's\r\nmonetary losses suffered as a direct consequence of the\r\ncontract breach.  In other words, it is the amount that places\r\nthe complaining party as nearly as possible in the position it\r\nwould have occupied had the defaulting party performed the\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>\tYou are further instructed that, in addition to direct\r\ndamages, the complaining party may also recover\r\nconsequential damages that it proves to be the natural,\r\nprobable and foreseeable consequence of the other party's\r\nbreach.  A complaining party's proof of consequential\r\ndamages cannot be merely speculative.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>McAllen objected to the failure to segregate damage findings.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe jury awarded Vega Roofing the sum of $100,171.40 in actual\r\nand consequential damages.  According to the evidence adduced at\r\ntrial, the balance remaining on the contract was $40,130.40.  Vega\r\nRoofing testified to an additional $40,000 for extra work and extra\r\ncontractual unit price work.  McAllen thus argues that for purposes of\r\nthis appeal, it is therefore \"assumed\" that the jury awarded $80,132.40\r\nin actual damages, and that the remaining sum, or $20,039.00, \"had to\r\nhave been\" awarded as consequential damages.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen's argument requires this Court to speculate about the\r\ncomponents of the jury's award.  It is improper for a reviewing court to\r\nengage in conjecture about the composition of a damage award. \r\n<em>Duggan v. Marshall</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1870471\"><a href=\"/opinion/1870471/duggan-v-marshall/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>, 894 (Tex.App.­Houston [1<sup>st</sup> Dist.]\r\n1999, no pet.);  <em>Transit Management Co. of Laredo v.

The jury may\r\nor may not have awarded the full balance remaining on the contract,\r\nand may or may not have awarded the full amount for extra-contractual\r\nwork.  We cannot merely assume that the jury awarded these full\r\namounts, however, because the jury had before it additional evidence\r\nconcerning lost actual damages.  We do not know, for example,\r\nwhether the jury's award included any amount for contractual interest\r\non payments due and unpaid.   It would be improper for us to speculate\r\non how the jury divided its award of $100,171.40 among the various\r\nelements of damages.  <em>See Hernandez v. American Appliance Mfg.\r\nCorp</em>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2428119\"><a href=\"/opinion/2428119/hernandez-v-american-appliance-mfg/\"><span class=\"volume\">827</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></a></span>, 389 (Tex.App.­Corpus Christi 1992, writ\r\ndenied).\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tThe only way that an appellant can successfully challenge a multi-element damages award is to address all of the elements and show that\r\nthe evidence is insufficient to support the damages award considering\r\nall of the elements.  <em>Price v. Short</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1777777\"><a href=\"/opinion/1777777/price-v-short/\"><span class=\"volume\">931</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, 688\r\n(Tex.App.­Dallas 1996, no writ); <em>Greater Houston Transp.

The failure to address an element of damages results in waiver\r\nof the sufficiency challenge.  <em>Greater Houston Transp. Co.</em>, 850 S.W.2d\r\nat 579.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen does not argue that the evidence favorable to this verdict,\r\nconsidered as a whole, is legally insufficient to support it.  McAllen fails\r\nto address the legal sufficiency of the actual damages.  We therefore\r\nreject McAllen's no evidence challenge regarding Vega Roofing's\r\ndamages.  <em>See Thomas v. Oldham</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2457165\"><a href=\"/opinion/2457165/thomas-v-oldham/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span>, 359-60 (Tex.\r\n1995).\r\n\r\n</p><p>  \tHowever, even if McAllen had not waived the issue, its challenge\r\nto the sufficiency of the evidence of consequential damages would lack\r\nmerit.  Vega Roofing presented uncontradicted evidence at trial\r\nregarding its entitlement to contractual interest on amounts due and\r\nunpaid.  Vega Roofing further presented evidence that it incurred\r\nsubstantial insufficient fund charges as a result of McAllen's failure to\r\nmake payment under the contract.  As a result of the dispute at issue,\r\nVega Roofing lost its ability to obtain bonding, and thus was unable to\r\nbid for large jobs.  Therefore, if McAllen had preserved its right to\r\nchallenge the sufficiency of the evidence, we would hold that the jury's\r\ndamages award is supported by sufficient evidence.  We overrule\r\nMcAllen's fourth issue.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Attorney's Fees</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its fifth issue, McAllen argues that the trial court erred in\r\nawarding attorney's fees to Vega Roofing because attorney's fees are\r\nnot recoverable against a school district as a matter of law. Because\r\nMcAllen failed to object to Vega Roofing's request for attorney's fees,\r\nMcAllen has waived this issue on appeal.  <em>City of Port Isabel</em>, 976\r\nS.W.2d at 860-61.  In fact, in pleadings filed with the trial court,\r\nMcAllen essentially conceded that attorney's fees might be recovered\r\nagainst it (\"Both MISD and Vega Roofing have made claims for recovery\r\nof their attorney's fees in this case.  Neither party's entitlement to such\r\nfees, of course, can be determined until liability is first determined by\r\nthe jury....\").  We overrule McAllen's fifth issue.\r\n\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Directed Verdict</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its sixth issue, McAllen contends that the trial court erred in\r\ngranting a directed verdict for Vega Roofing on McAllen's claim for\r\nnegligent performance.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tMcAllen had requested an issue regarding whether or not Vega\r\nRoofing was negligent in performing its work.  The trial court granted\r\na directed verdict on this issue on grounds that only \"contractual\"\r\ndamages were involved in McAllen's claim against Vega Roofing. \r\nMcAllen argues that it presented evidence of damage to the school\r\nseparate and apart from the roof contract in question; therefore, its\r\nnegligence cause of action should have been presented to the jury.  In\r\nmaking this argument, McAllen refers this Court to evidence concerning\r\nreports of roof leaks.\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIf the defendant's conduct would give rise to liability independent\r\nof the fact that a contract exists between the parties, the plaintiff's\r\nclaim may sound in tort.  Conversely, if the defendant's conduct would\r\ngive rise to liability only because it breaches the parties' agreement, the\r\nplaintiff's claim ordinarily sounds only in contract.  <em>See DeWitt County\r\nElec. Coop., Inc. v. Parks</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1788493\"><a href=\"/opinion/1788493/dewitt-county-elec-co-op-v-parks/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">96</span></a></span>, 105 (Tex. 1999).  Thus, as a\r\ngeneral rule, if an express or implied contractual duty is negligently\r\nperformed,  causing only economic loss, only a breach of contract\r\naction may be maintained and a tort action for negligence is precluded. \r\n<em>See, e.g., Formosa Plastics Corp. USA v. Presidio Eng'rs and\r\nContractors, Inc</em>., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2427974\"><a href=\"/opinion/2427974/formosa-plastics-corp-usa-v-presidio-engineers-and-contractors-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 45-46 (Tex. 1998).   \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tIn  <em>Southwestern Bell Tel. Co. v. DeLanney</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2425092\"><a href=\"/opinion/2425092/southwestern-bell-tel-co-v-delanney/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">493</span></a></span>,\r\n493-95 (Tex. 1991), the Texas Supreme Court reviewed a plaintiff's\r\naction against a telephone company for its failure to publish an\r\nadvertisement in accordance with the contract between the parties. \r\nThe supreme court held that the claim arose solely from the contract\r\nand the plaintiff's alleged damages were only for economic loss,\r\ntherefore, the action sounded in contract and not in tort.  <em>Southwestern\r\nBell Tel. Co.</em>, 809 S.W.2d at 495.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tSimilarly, in the instant case, McAllen's claim for negligent\r\nperformance arose from the contract, and the damages sought were\r\nonly for economic loss.  <em>See</em> <em>Parks</em>, 1 S.W.3d at 105; <em>Southwestern Bell\r\nTel. Co.</em>, 809 S.W.2d at 495.  Therefore, we overrule McAllen's sixth\r\nissue.  \r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p></p><center><u>Attorney's Fees on Appeal</u></center>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>\tIn its seventh issue, McAllen argues that the trial court erred by\r\nawarding unconditional attorney's fees on appeal.  In so arguing,\r\nMcAllen directs the Court's attention to the \"applicable\" part of the\r\njudgment as follows:\r\n\r\n</p><p>\tORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED that Plaintiff VEGA\r\nROOFING COMPANY recover an additional ELEVEN\r\nTHOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($11,000.00) as\r\nattorney's fees, should MCALLEN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL\r\nDISTRICT file a notice of appeal or otherwise attempt to\r\nperfect an appeal to the Court of Appeals; that Plaintiff VEGA\r\nROOFING COMPANY recover an additional FIVE THOUSAND\r\nNO/100THS DOLLARS ($5,000.00) as attorney's fees should\r\nMCALLEN INDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT file a Petition\r\nfor Review with the Texas Supreme Court; and that Plaintiff\r\nVEGA ROOFING COMPANY recover an additional THREE\r\nTHOUSAND AND NO/100THS DOLLARS ($3,000.00) as\r\nattorney's fees, should a Petition for Review be granted by\r\nthe Texas Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>We agree that any award of attorney's fees on appeal must be\r\nconditioned on the receiving parties' success.  <em>Southwestern Bell Tel.\r\nCo. v.

However, the charge of the court\r\nexpressly provides such a condition in the paragraph immediately\r\npreceding the award.  \r\n\r\n</p><p>\tORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED, should MCALLEN\r\nINDEPENDENT SCHOOL DISTRICT appeal this case and\r\nshould Plaintiff VEGA ROOFING COMPANY eventually prevail\r\non appeal, that Plaintiff VEGA ROOFING COMPANY recover\r\nits appellate attorney's fees as found by the jury. \r\nAccordingly, it is further. . . .\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n</p><p>Inexplicably, McAllen fails to reference this language in its brief or\r\nargument.
