Appellants Lorenzo Muñoz-Franco,\n\nFrancisco Sánchez-Arán, Ariel Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, and Wilfredo\n\nUmpierre-Hernández    appeal   their    convictions    for   bank     fraud,\n\nconspiracy, and misapplication of bank funds, stemming from conduct\n\nthat persisted for nearly a decade.       Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán\n\nappeal their convictions for bank fraud and conspiracy for a\n\nsimilar but separate series of transactions also involving the\n\nimproper use of bank funds.     Appellants challenge the sufficiency\n\nof the evidence and raise many other substantive and procedural\n\nclaims relating to their fifteen-month trial. After careful review\n\nof this immense record, we affirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\nA. Factual Overview\n\n          We provide here an overview of the relevant conduct drawn\n\nfrom the record, saving additional details for our sufficiency\n\nanalysis. Throughout the opinion, we consider the evidence \"in the\n\nlight most favorable to the prosecution.\" See Jackson v. Virginia,\n\n443 U.S. 307, 319 (1979).\n\n          1. The Gutiérrez Loans\n\n          During the relevant time period charged in the Third\n\nSuperseding    Indictment,   Muñoz-Franco    was    President   and   Chief\n\nExecutive Officer of Caguas Central Federal Savings Bank of Puerto\n\nRico   (\"Caguas\"),    a   federally     chartered     savings   and     loan\n\nassociation.    Sánchez-Arán was Executive Vice President and Chief\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fLending Officer of Caguas.          Gutiérrez was a land developer who\n\nowned several companies that received loans from Caguas. Umpierre-\n\nHernández    was   an   officer    of    several    companies      belonging   to\n\nGutiérrez.\n\n            For    nearly   a   decade,       Muñoz-Franco   and   Sánchez-Arán\n\nsupervised a scheme to use proceeds from various loans for purposes\n\nnot authorized by Caguas' Board of Directors (\"Board\").1               The loans\n\nwere granted for land development projects involving companies that\n\nGutiérrez owned and Umpierre-Hernández helped to operate, including\n\nTransglobe,    Modules,      and   Transhore.        In   many   instances     the\n\nappellants used proceeds from loans to Gutiérrez-owned companies to\n\nmake payments on prior loans to Gutiérrez-owned companies without\n\nBoard approval.      In other instances Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán\n\nsubmitted loans to Gutiérrez-owned companies to the Board for\n\napproval without disclosing the Gutiérrez-owned companies' failure\n\nto complete work on previous projects. On many occasions Gutiérrez\n\nand Umpierre-Hernández submitted certifications for construction\n\nwork that had not yet been completed, and Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-\n\nArán accepted the certifications and ordered disbursement of funds\n\nfor the projects.           The Board also was not informed of this\n\n\n     1\n       The Board was a body of ten to fifteen members responsible\nfor establishing policy for the operation of Caguas and overseeing\nthe general operation of the bank. The Board oversaw the Executive\nCommittee (which reviewed and approved commercial and real estate\nconstruction loans in excess of $500,000) and the Loan Committee\n(which reviewed and approved commercial and real estate loans under\n$500,000).\n\n                                        -3-\n\fpractice. In January 1988, Muñoz-Franco drafted and obtained Board\n\napproval to send a letter to Richard Denby, the Federal Home Loan\n\nBank Board auditor supervising Caguas, which responded to Denby's\n\nconcerns regarding Caguas' lending practices (\"Denby letter\"). The\n\nletter contained many misrepresentations regarding the status of\n\nGutiérrez-related projects and loans.\n\n           As the government explained in its opening statement,\n\nthis scheme contributed to the appearance that Caguas remained a\n\nfinancially viable institution under the leadership of Muñoz-Franco\n\nand Sánchez-Arán.       If the problems with the bank became known and\n\nMuñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán were removed from their positions,\n\n\"not only would that have deprived them of a very lucrative job,\n\nbut it also would have made it very difficult for them to obtain\n\nnew   employment   in    the   banking    industry.\"   The   scheme   also\n\nmaintained the appearance of solvency for the Gutiérrez companies,\n\nthus protecting the livelihood and professional reputation of\n\nGutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández.\n\n           The projects for which Gutiérrez-owned companies received\n\nloans included La Marina, Los Mameyes, Cerrovista, and Jardines de\n\nVilla Alba.   We provide a brief overview of these projects here.2\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       Similar conduct also occurred on other Gutiérrez projects,\nincluding Levittown, Country Club, Los Caciques, Quintas de\nHumacao, and Quintas de Fajardo.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f                      a. La Marina\n\n             In June 1980, Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán caused Caguas\n\nto   grant    a    $1,450,000       loan    to   Transglobe     to    finance      the\n\nconstruction of seventy-five units of residential housing, with\n\nconstruction to begin within one month and to be completed within\n\none year.    As of September 1981, the loan limit had been increased\n\nfour times, adding a total of $1.8 million, yet not a single house\n\nhad been built.     Funds were disbursed from the loan for the project\n\nbased   on   certifications         submitted    by    Gutiérrez     and   Umpierre-\n\nHernández    and    approved    by    Sánchez-Arán,       and   approximately       $2\n\nmillion was used to pay unrelated Gutiérrez debts with a different\n\nbank. In October 1984, Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán caused Caguas\n\nto finance the sale of the La Marina project to DO.W Group.                        The\n\nagreement for this sale provided that Transglobe would remain the\n\ncontractor for the project despite its failure to build a single\n\nhouse in the preceding four years.                In approving the loan, the\n\nBoard was not informed of Transglobe's prior poor performance.\n\nAfter this sale, appellants continued to apply funds from the La\n\nMarina loan to other projects and to disburse funds for work not\n\ncompleted.    Not a single house was ever built on the project, and,\n\nin 1989, Caguas entered into a settlement agreement with DO.W\n\nreleasing    DO.W's    debt    on    the    project,    which   totaled     over    $2\n\nmillion.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f                   b. Los Mameyes\n\n            In late 1985, Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán caused the\n\nBoard to grant Modules a commercial line of credit to build two\n\nhundred housing units.        Between December 1985 and March 1986,\n\nGutiérrez    and      Umpierre-Hernández        submitted   a    series    of\n\ncertifications stating that a total of two hundred housing units\n\nhad been built.    Even though Caguas' inspector reported that only\n\nfifty-five    units    had   been   completed,      Sánchez-Arán   approved\n\ndisbursements totaling about $800,000. In March 1986 Gutiérrez and\n\nUmpierre-Hernández submitted a certification requesting $69,000 for\n\n\"payment of subcontractors,\" but attached a list of interest\n\npayments due on the Jardines de Villa Alba, Levittown, Country\n\nClub, La Marina, and Los Caciques projects totalling exactly\n\n$69,000.     Sánchez-Arán    approved     the    certification   and    Caguas\n\ndisbursed the funds.\n\n                   c. Cerrovista\n\n            In the spring of 1986, John Burns, a developer, applied\n\nto Caguas for a loan to build residential housing on land he owned\n\nbut his application was denied.            After meeting with Umpierre-\n\nHernández and agreeing to use Modules as a contractor, Caguas\n\napproved Burns' application for a loan to build twenty-three units\n\nof housing in what became known as the Cerrovista project.              Burns'\n\nloan was approved on the condition that he sign a $2 million note\n\nas a down payment to Modules.         Burns signed the note.           Shortly\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fthereafter, however, Umpierre-Hernández told Burns that the project\n\nneeded   a   new    \"sponsor\"    because       Burns    had   been   \"gossiping.\"\n\nUmpierre-Hernández then began to negotiate the sale of Cerrovista\n\nto Iantho, a company owned by Walter Frambes.                        In August or\n\nSeptember 1986, Burns read newspaper articles indicating that the\n\nCerrovista project might be affected by the Puerto Rico Department\n\nof Transportation's plans to build a hospital and an expressway.\n\nHe inquired with the Department and received confirmation that the\n\ndevelopment of four lots would be \"frozen.\"                   When Burns brought\n\nthis information to Umpierre-Hernández, Umpierre-Hernández told him\n\nto \"hide it, boy.\"\n\n             On    September    10,    1986,    Sánchez-Arán     received   Board\n\napproval to offer Iantho an $8.9 million loan, specifying that\n\n$1,412,177 would be used to purchase land for the Cerrovista\n\nproject.     The sale was then finalized on September 28.                However,\n\nthe actual land cost was only $480,000, and the remaining $932,000\n\nwas used to make principal and interest payments on other loans to\n\nGutiérrez-owned companies.            Over the next few months Gutiérrez and\n\nUmpierre-Hernández submitted certifications showing approximately\n\n$908,000 for \"premanufacture\" of housing units, and Sánchez-Arán\n\nauthorized disbursement of these funds.                As of May 1988, however,\n\nnot a single unit had been built on the project.\n\n                      d. Jardines de Villa Alba\n\n             In    1985,   a   developer       named   Emilio   Montilla    sought\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\ffinancing to build housing units on land he owned, and Caguas\n\nrepeatedly denied his requests.      Montilla then met with Umpierre-\n\nHernández, who told him that if he used Modules as a contractor his\n\nrequest would be approved.    In July 1985, the Board considered a\n\nproposed loan to Montilla with Modules as contractor.     Although by\n\nthis time Modules had failed to perform on the La Marina project\n\nfor several years, the Board was not informed of this information\n\nwhen it considered the Jardines de Villa Alba project.     Moreover,\n\nover $231,000 was disbursed before the Jardines de Villa Alba loan\n\nagreement was signed.    Although the Board eventually approved the\n\nloan, this prior disbursement took place without Board knowledge or\n\napproval.    Only one unit was ever completed on the Jardines de\n\nVilla Alba project.     However, the Board was not informed of this\n\nfact.    The Denby letter, which was drafted by Muñoz-Franco in\n\nJanuary 1988 and signed by the Board members, refers to the \"units\"\n\ncompleted on this project.\n\n            2. The Mirandes Loans\n\n            As will be described in more detail in our sufficiency\n\ndiscussion, Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán supervised a similar\n\nscheme to use loan proceeds for purposes not authorized by the\n\nBoard with respect to companies owned by Francisco Mirandes.3\n\nMirandes received construction loans from Caguas for at least\n\n\n\n     3\n       The Third Superseding Indictment did not charge Gutiérrez\nand Umpierre-Hernández with involvement in this scheme.\n\n                                    -8-\n\ffourteen different projects.               In December 1989, the Mirandes\n\ncorporations collapsed due to insolvency, owing Caguas a total of\n\n$23    million.        In   1997,    Mirandes    pled    guilty   to   charges    of\n\nparticipating in a conspiracy to defraud Caguas, the Board, and the\n\nregulatory institution, and to misapplication of bank funds.                      As\n\npart of his plea agreement, he testified for the government at\n\nappellants' trial.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n               On November 22, 1995, the government filed an indictment\n\ncharging appellants with conspiracy, bank fraud, misapplication of\n\nbank       funds,   and     making    false    entries.        Three   superseding\n\nindictments subsequently were filed on March 5, 1997; May 13, 1997;\n\nand March 6, 1998.4            The third superseding indictment charged\n\nMuñoz-Franco, Sánchez-Arán, Gutiérrez, Umpierre-Hernández, Enrique\n\nGutiérrez (Ariel Gutiérrez's brother, who was also involved in\n\nrunning the Gutiérrez corporations), and Rafael Domínguez Wolff\n\n(who purchased several projects from the Gutiérrez brothers)5 with\n\nbank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344; conspiracy to commit\n\nbank       fraud,   misapply   bank    funds,   and     make   false   entries,   in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; and misapplication of bank funds, in\n\n\n\n       4\n       Appellants protest the delay both preceding and resulting\nfrom this series of superseding indictments on Fifth and Sixth\nAmendment grounds. We will discuss the events surrounding this\nseries of indictments in more detail in Section IV.C, infra.\n       5\n           Wolff died prior to trial.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 657.        The indictment also charged Muñoz-\n\nFranco and Sánchez-Arán with bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. § 1344 and\n\nconspiracy under § 18 U.S.C. § 371 with respect to the Mirandes\n\nloans.\n\n            The trial began in federal district court in Puerto Rico\n\nin January 2001 and the presentation of evidence concluded in April\n\n2002.    On May 16, 2002, the jury convicted Muñoz-Franco, Sánchez-\n\nArán,    Ariel   Gutiérrez,   and   Umpierre-Hernández   on   all    charged\n\ncounts, but acquitted Enrique Gutiérrez.          Following the verdict,\n\nappellants filed motions for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to\n\nFederal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, raising numerous grounds,\n\nincluding   the   sufficiency   of    the   evidence.    In   a   thoughtful\n\nseventy-seven page opinion, the district court denied all of the\n\nmotions.6\n\n            Sentencing proceedings began on December 15, 2003.           On\n\nFebruary 12, 2004, the district court sentenced Muñoz-Franco and\n\nSánchez-Arán to a term of forty-six months on the conspiracy and\n\nbank fraud counts and a concurrent term of sixty months on the\n\nmisapplication count.     It also imposed a fine of $50,000 on each\n\ndefendant. The court sentenced Gutiérrez to a term of thirty-seven\n\nmonths on the conspiracy and bank fraud counts, and imposed a\n\n\n     6\n       In addition to the sufficiency of the evidence, the district\ncourt considered and rejected claims of prosecutorial misconduct,\nimproper jury instructions, inconsistent verdicts, and violation of\nthe right to a speedy trial, as well as challenges to the admission\nof certain evidence and testimony.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fconcurrent term of sixty months on the misapplication count.                 It\n\nalso imposed a $60,000 fine.             Finally, it sentenced Umpierre-\n\nHernández to a term of twenty-four months on all counts.\n\nC. Issues on Appeal\n\n           Appellants     raise        thirteen   major     issues     for   our\n\nconsideration on appeal.         Three of these claims — concerning the\n\nstatute of limitations, the Ex Post Facto Clause, and the pre-\n\nindictment and pre-trial delay — implicate what might be termed the\n\nvalidity of the entire proceedings. Although courts often begin by\n\naddressing such issues, we find, in light of the exceptionally\n\nlarge record, that we must review the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nin order to assess the viability of any of appellants' other\n\nclaims.   Thus, we will first resolve two evidentiary issues to\n\ndetermine the content of the record properly before us.                 We will\n\nthen   employ   that    record    in    conducting    our   analysis    of   the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence.           Informed by a full understanding of\n\nthe record, we will then turn to the host of other issues raised by\n\nappellants.\n\n                                        II.\n\n           We   begin    with    two    evidentiary   issues:    whether     the\n\ndistrict court allowed witnesses to testify beyond their personal\n\nknowledge, and whether the minutes from the Board meetings were\n\nimproperly admitted.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fA. Personal Knowledge\n\n            Appellants   argue   that   the   district   court    improperly\n\npermitted prosecution witnesses to testify beyond their personal\n\nknowledge, in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 602.              Rule 602\n\nstates, in pertinent part: \"A witness may not testify to a matter\n\nunless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that\n\nthe witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\"          Fed. R. Evid.\n\n602. Interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a question\n\nof law subject to de novo review, but the application of a rule is\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion.         United States v. Sposito, 106\n\nF.3d 1042, 1046 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n            1. Arturo Somohano\n\n            Appellants argue that Arturo Somohano (the vice president\n\nof Caguas' commercial loan department until 1988, at which time he\n\nbecame Caguas' chief lending officer) testified beyond his personal\n\nknowledge on three occasions: (1) in claiming that the bank's\n\noutside auditors were replaced for improper reasons; (2) in stating\n\nthat Caguas' loan classifications for the loans to Modules were\n\nimproper;    and   (3)   in   questioning     the   propriety    of   certain\n\nconstruction loans. The district court excluded the first of these\n\nstatements after appellants objected, and we therefore do not\n\nconsider it further.7\n\n\n     7\n       With respect to the replacement of the bank's outside\nauditors, appellants object to Somohano's testimony that he knew\nwhy Caguas' outside auditors were replaced because \"someone told\n\n                                   -12-\n\f             With respect to Somohano's testimony that Caguas' loan\n\nclassifications for Modules were improper, appellants objected on\n\nthe ground that Somohano had previously stated that he was unaware\n\nof    the   bank's     classifications         for   those   loans.         Somohano\n\nacknowledged         that   he   did    not     remember     seeing        the   loan\n\nclassifications for Modules while at Caguas, but his testimony did\n\nnot rely on such knowledge of Modules' status.                Instead, Somohano\n\nexplained that loans at Caguas were classified from one (best) to\n\nten (worst) based on the amount of risk involved in the loan, and\n\nthat the bank would attach greater reserves to riskier loans.\n\nWhile still on the witness stand, Somohano then reviewed financial\n\nstatements indicating that Modules had a negative net worth of $7.6\n\nmillion at the end of 1986, and that Caguas' reserves would not\n\ncover the loans to Modules because the reserves equalled only ten\n\nor fifteen percent of the loans Modules was sustaining.                          Based\n\nstrictly on the amount of reserves, Somohano would expect the\n\nModules loan to have received a favorable classification of either\n\ntwo   or    three;    however,   he    testified     that,   based    on    Modules'\n\n\"insolvent\" financial status, such classification would have been\n\n\n\nme.\"    This characterization is incomplete.         Upon further\nquestioning, Somohano stated that he also knew this information\nbased on \"[m]y own personal observations,\" specifically, the fact\nthat \"the reserves were totally inadequate to guarantee that the\nbank would not shake if a loss could occur.\" After the government\nasked how Somohano's observation related to the auditors' removal,\nhowever, appellants objected, and, after a lengthy sidebar and\nresearch, the court excluded the testimony altogether.\n\n                                        -13-\n\fimproper.\n\n            According to Federal Rule of Evidence 701, a lay witness\n\nmay offer opinions that are \"(a) rationally based on the perception\n\nof the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the\n\nwitness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c)\n\nnot based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\n\nwithin the scope of Rule 702.\"       Fed. R. Evid. 701.      Under Rule 701,\n\ncourts have allowed lay witnesses to express opinions about a\n\nbusiness \"based on the witness's own perceptions and 'knowledge and\n\nparticipation     in   the   day-to-day     affairs   of   [the]    business.'\"\n\nUnited   States    v.    Polishan,    336     F.3d    234,    242    (3d   Cir.\n\n2003)(alternation in original)(quoting Lightning Lube, Inc. v.\n\nWitco Corp., 4 F.3d 1153, 1175 (3d Cir. 1993)); see also Medforms,\n\nInc. v. Healthcare Mgmt. Solutions, Inc., 290 F.3d 98, 110-11 (2d\n\nCir. 2002)(allowing a computer programmer to testify about the\n\nmeaning of terms used in the copyright registrations for programs\n\nhe had helped design); Williams Enters., Inc. v. Sherman R. Smoot\n\nCo., 938 F.2d 230, 233-34 (D.C. Cir. 1991)(allowing an insurance\n\nbroker who had personal knowledge of an insured's business to offer\n\nlay opinion testimony on the cause of an increase in the insured's\n\npremiums).    Here, Somohano's testimony was based on knowledge of\n\nCaguas' banking practices that he acquired during his employment\n\nthere, and thus the opinions he expressed were properly within the\n\nscope of Federal Rule of Evidence 701.\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f            Finally, appellants protest, without providing specific\n\nexamples,   that   Somohano   \"was    permitted   to   testify   about   the\n\npropriety of certain construction loans even though he was not part\n\nof the construction loan department and has no firsthand knowledge\n\nof those loans.\"     We find this generalized objection unfounded.\n\nSomohano's opinions about the loans were based on his firsthand\n\nobservations of Caguas' practices with respect to these loans.            He\n\ntestified that, when the Modules loan was restructured, he did not\n\nthink Caguas ever would be repaid, and he provided other examples\n\nof Gutiérrez loans receiving special treatment.          Given Somohano's\n\nbanking experience and his particular knowledge about the Gutiérrez\n\nloans, his testimony about these loans also was properly admissible\n\nas a lay opinion within the scope of Rule 701.           Consequently, we\n\nfind no abuse of discretion in the district court's handling of\n\nSomohano's testimony.\n\n            2. Anabel Enriquez\n\n            Appellants also argue that Anabel Enriquez (the senior\n\nvice president of Caguas' mortgage department from 1980-87, who\n\nreported directly to Sánchez-Arán) testified beyond her personal\n\nknowledge when she stated, based on her review of the minutes of\n\nBoard and Executive Committee meetings, that certain information\n\nwas not discussed at the meetings that should have been discussed.\n\nThis objection is unfounded.         At trial, Enriquez read the Board\n\nmeeting minutes into evidence, including minutes for meetings at\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fwhich    she   was   not   present.    Appellants      objected,   and,    after\n\nconsiderable debate, the district court ruled \"that [Enriquez] may\n\nliterally read what each paragraph [of the minutes] says.                 If the\n\nUnited States then wants an explanation as to the paragraph she\n\nmust then have an independent source of knowledge.\" Thus, Enriquez\n\ndid not testify whether certain events actually happened at a Board\n\nmeeting unless she was present; for meetings she did not attend,\n\nshe testified only \"whether the minutes reflect\" that certain\n\ninformation was discussed.            The district court enforced this\n\nlimitation, and required the prosecutor to rephrase questions on\n\nmore than one occasion.8       Similarly, Enriquez's testimony that the\n\nBoard \"should have been told\" certain information was a lay opinion\n\nproperly admitted under Rule 701.            Her position as a senior vice\n\npresident of Caguas' mortgage department and her regular attendance\n\nat Board meetings established her familiarity with Caguas' business\n\noperations     and    made   it   appropriate    for     her   testify     about\n\ninformation the Board needed to make its decisions.                Again, the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in allowing such\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n       For example, when the prosecutor asked whether the Board was\ntold certain information about Modules, the court interrupted: \"You\ndon't know what the board was told unless you're there. The most\nyou can state is whether or not the minutes reflect that\ninformation.\" The prosecutor rephrased the question, and Enriquez\nthen responded that \"from what I remember of having reviewed the\nminutes, there is no mention anywhere of that fact.\"\n\n                                      -16-\n\f            3. Victor Lugo\n\n            As part of its case, the government sought to prove that\n\nMuñoz-Franco    and    Sánchez-Arán      concealed   material    information\n\nrelating to the Gutiérrez loans from the Board.            Victor Lugo, the\n\nBoard president, offered testimony that he was not told or was not\n\naware of significant information.             Appellants claim that Lugo's\n\ntestimony showed that he had no independent recollection of the\n\nevents in question, some of which occurred nearly twenty years\n\nbefore trial.     However, appellants misconstrue Lugo's testimony\n\nabout his own memory.        For example, when asked whether he was\n\ninformed of Modules' performance history when the Board was making\n\ndecisions on the company's loans in July 1985, he stated: \"I don't\n\nrecall that it was discussed.          I believe that if it was discussed\n\nI   would   remember   and   it   is    not   reflected   in   the   minutes.\"\n\nSimilarly, when asked whether the number of houses built on Modules\n\nprojects was discussed when the Board was again making decisions on\n\nthe loans in September 1986, he stated definitively: \"No . . . that\n\nwas not discussed.\" These statements show that Lugo had sufficient\n\nrecall to testify from his personal knowledge about the information\n\ngiven to the Board.\n\n            Appellants also complain that the government improperly\n\nsuggested the truth of hypothetical scenarios presented in certain\n\nquestions to Lugo.      The purpose of these questions was to probe\n\n\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fwhether the Board would have considered Gutiérrez companies' past\n\nperformance in deciding to approve later loans.    For example, the\n\nprosecutor asked Lugo: \"[I]f the Gutiérrez company, out of these 96\n\n[housing] units only built 22, would that have been information\n\n. . . which you would have been interested in knowing for purposes\n\nof voting on the approval of this loan?\"    The court explained at\n\nsidebar that it would only allow such hypotheticals when the\n\ngovernment had already introduced evidence that was the basis for\n\nthe hypothetical — specifically, when \"there is a document from the\n\nbank that clearly establishes a certain fact.\"    It also instructed\n\nthe jurors that they should not take the facts that were the basis\n\nfor the hypotheticals as true:\n\n          Okay. The fact that the Court has authorized\n          that question, ladies and gentlemen of the\n          jury, does not mean . . . that the Court is\n          concluding it is a foregoing fact that you\n          should take those facts as true. Those facts\n          are subject to your analysis and your\n          credibility.\n                 In other words, you have to decide in\n          your deliberations whether or not this project\n          called for 96 houses and you have to decide\n          whether or not actually 22 were built or\n          whatever number was built, that is subject to\n          your credibility.\n                 The fact that the Court is authorizing\n          that this question be expressed in these terms\n          does not at all mean that the Court has\n          already determined that it is a fact at all.\n          You have to decide. That's one of the issues\n          that you're going to have to decide in this\n          case.\n\nThe court reiterated this instruction several times. This detailed\n\ninstruction was sufficient to advise the jury that it should not\n\n                                 -18-\n\faccept the facts set forth in the hypotheticals as true.                       Thus,\n\nLugo's response to these questions did not have the effect of\n\nallowing him to testify beyond his personal knowledge to the\n\nfactual correctness of the hypothetical.                   The district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in allowing such testimony.\n\n              4. Victor Kareh\n\n              Finally,    appellants      assert     that     Victor   Kareh    (the\n\nassistant vice president of the construction loan department from\n\n1980 to 1990) \"was permitted . . . to opine about what the project\n\ndocuments and ledger cards indicated, without any clear memory of\n\nthe events and mixing summary testimony with what was improper\n\nexpert testimony.\" To support this proposition, appellants cite to\n\nthree    thirty-page      sections   of      the    trial    transcript,   without\n\nspecifying the testimony to which they object or the grounds for\n\ntheir objections.          Although Kareh did not author all of the\n\ndocuments about which he testified, this in itself is not a basis\n\nfor excluding his testimony about the documents. Without developed\n\nargumentation on this issue, we cannot conclude that the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in allowing Kareh's testimony.                     United\n\nStates   v.    Zannino,    895   F.2d   1,     17   (1st    Cir.   1990)(\"[I]ssues\n\nadverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort\n\nat developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fB. Admission of Minutes from Board Meetings\n\n           At    trial,     the    prosecution    introduced     the     Board   and\n\nExecutive Committee meeting minutes under Federal Rule of Evidence\n\n803(6), which states that business records are not excluded by the\n\nrule   against    hearsay    \"if    kept   in   the    course   of   a   regularly\n\nconducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of\n\nthat business activity to make the . . . record . . . unless the\n\nsource of information or the method or circumstances of preparation\n\nindicate lack of trustworthiness.\"              Appellants do not claim that\n\nthe minutes themselves were improperly admitted, but rather protest\n\nthe prosecution's reliance on the absence of certain information\n\nfrom the minutes to prove that the Board was not informed about\n\nsuch matters. Appellants argue that this use violated their rights\n\nunder the Confrontation Clause and the rule against hearsay.                     We\n\nexamine these claims in turn.          We review alleged violations of the\n\nSixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause de novo.                 United States v.\n\nRondeau, 430 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir. 2005).                 As discussed above,\n\ninterpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is subject to de\n\nnovo review, but application of a rule is reviewed for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.      Sposito, 106 F.3d at 1046.\n\n           1. Confrontation Clause\n\n           The     Confrontation       Clause     of    the     Sixth    Amendment\n\nguarantees defendants the right to confront adverse witnesses. The\n\nSupreme Court has explained that only \"testimonial\" statements\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\f\"cause the declarant to be a 'witness' within the meaning of the\n\nConfrontation Clause.\"      Davis v. Washington, 126 S. Ct. 2266, 2273\n\n(2006)(citing Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 51 (2004)).9\n\nThus, \"[i]t is the testimonial character of the statement that\n\nseparates it from other hearsay that, while subject to traditional\n\nlimitations     upon   hearsay    evidence,   is    not    subject      to    the\n\nConfrontation    Clause.\"       Id.    Although    the    Court   has   yet    to\n\narticulate a precise definition of \"testimonial,\"10 it is beyond\n\ndebate that the Board minutes are nontestimonial in character and,\n\nconsequently, outside the class of statements prohibited by the\n\nConfrontation Clause.     The Court in Crawford plainly characterized\n\nbusiness records as \"statements that by their nature [are] not\n\ntestimonial.\"      541   U.S.    at    56.    If   business       records     are\n\nnontestimonial, it follows that the absence of information from\n\nthose records also must be nontestimonial. Thus, the Confrontation\n\nClause presents no bar to reliance on the absence of certain\n\n\n\n     9\n      Appellants filed their briefs before the Court's decision in\nDavis, and thus do not discuss its significance.\n     10\n       The Court has held that the term \"testimonial\" includes \"at\na minimum . . . prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a\ngrand jury, or at a former trial; and . . . police interrogations.\"\nCrawford, 541 U.S. at 68. In the context of police interrogations,\nthe Court indicated that a key factor is whether \"the primary\npurpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events\npotentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\" Davis, 126 S.\nCt. at 2274. In United States v. Hansen, 434 F.3d 92, 100 (1st\nCir. 2006), we also found that statements that \"the declarant would\nnot reasonably expect to be available for use at a later trial\"\nwere nontestimonial in character.\n\n                                      -21-\n\finformation from the Board meeting minutes to prove that the Board\n\nwas not given that information.\n\n          2. Hearsay\n\n           Appellants also complain that, once the minutes were\n\nadmitted, the prosecution used the absence of certain information\n\nfrom the minutes to demonstrate that Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán\n\nfailed to inform the Board of these matters in violation of the\n\nrule against hearsay.    Appellants argue that the minutes were\n\nintended to be a summary, rather than an exhaustive record, of the\n\nevents that took place at Board meetings, and that, consequently,\n\nthe minutes do not indicate whether such information was disclosed\n\nto the Board.\n\n          Federal Rule of Evidence 803(7) states that the rule\n\nagainst hearsay does not exclude\n\n          [e]vidence that a matter is not included in\n          the . . . records . . . kept in accordance\n          with the provisions of [Fed. R. Evid. 803(6)],\n          to prove the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of\n          the matter, if the matter was of a kind of\n          which a . . . record . . . was regularly made\n          and   preserved,   unless   the   sources   of\n          information or other circumstances indicate\n          lack of trustworthiness.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 803(7).   The Advisory Committee Note to Rule 803(7)\n\nalso states that the \"[f]ailure of a record to mention a matter\n\nwhich would ordinarily be mentioned is satisfactory evidence of its\n\n\n\n\n                               -22-\n\fnonexistence.\"11            Thus, the absence of certain information in\n\nminutes admissible under Rule 803(6) would be admissible to show\n\nthat    the        Board    was    not   given       that    information       unless    the\n\ncircumstances indicated some reason that these omissions from the\n\nrecord were untrustworthy.\n\n               We note that Rule 803(6) excludes business records if\n\n\"the source of information or the method or circumstances of\n\npreparation         indicate      lack   of    trustworthiness,\"          Fed.   R.     Evid.\n\n803(6), while Rule 803(7) excludes records otherwise admissible\n\nunder       Rule    803(6)    if    \"the      sources       of    information    or     other\n\ncircumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness,\" Id. 803(7).                              We\n\nthink this repetition indicates that even if a business record is\n\ndeemed sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible for its contents\n\nunder Rule 803(6), other circumstances might render omissions in\n\nthat record untrustworthy to show that the events omitted did not\n\noccur.         Thus,       appellants'     concession            that   the   records    are\n\nadmissible under Rule 803(6) does not necessarily preclude them\n\n\n\n       11\n       The Advisory Committee Notes leave open the possibility that\nthe absence of evidence from a record is not hearsay at all. Fed.\nR. Evid. 803(7) advisory committee notes (\"While probably not\nhearsay as defined in Rule 801, decisions may be found which class\nthe evidence not only as hearsay but also as not within any\nexception.   In order to set the question at rest in favor of\nadmissibility, it is specifically treated here.\"). Moreover, at\nleast one court recently has noted the possibility that \"evidence\nthat a record does not exist arguably is not hearsay at all.\"\nUnited States v. Cervantes-Flores, 421 F.3d 825, 832 n.4 (9th Cir.\n2005).   For present purposes we assume that such evidence is\nhearsay, but admissible under Rule 803(7).\n\n                                              -23-\n\ffrom arguing that omissions from the records are not admissible\n\nunder Rule 803(7).\n\n          The government introduced testimony from Enriquez, the\n\nvice-president who reported directly to Sánchez-Arán, explaining\n\nthat the minutes were prepared by one of the executive vice\n\npresidents before 1982, by Luis Pastor (an administrative assistant\n\nto Muñoz-Franco) from 1982 to 1986, and by Enriquez after that\n\ntime.    Enriquez stated that the records prior to 1982 \"were\n\nprepared and reviewed by the board, they were set forth in a record\n\nbook and the secretary of the board and the president would sign\n\nthem.\"   The government submitted an affidavit from Pastor, dated\n\nMarch 21, 2001, verifying that the documents it introduced were, in\n\nfact, the minutes from 1982 to 1986 and explaining that the minutes\n\n\"consist of transcriptions made from notes taken by someone who was\n\npresent at each meeting\" and that the minutes \"were kept in the\n\nregular course of business of Caguas . . . . [I]t was the regular\n\nbusiness practice of Caguas to compile and prepare [the minutes]\n\nand to maintain them in its files.\"\n\n          Finally, Enriquez explained that, after 1986, \"[w]hen I\n\nwas present I would take notes, subject to the agenda and what was\n\napproved.\"   When Enriquez was not present, Eliza Balina, the\n\nexecutive secretary for Muñoz-Franco, would take notes at the\n\nmeetings, and Enriquez would then \"review the files that were\n\nprepared for use by the directors.    And upon that review, if there\n\n\n                               -24-\n\fwas something I did not understand then I could ask the president.\"\n\nEnriquez noted that the minutes \"were always ratified at the\n\nfollowing board meeting,\" and that, after ratification, the minutes\n\nwould be stored either in the president's office or in the bank\n\nvault.\n\n          Appellants emphasize that Lugo (the president of the\n\nBoard) acknowledged on cross-examination that the minutes were only\n\na summary of the meetings and did not \"word for word report\n\ndiscussions.\"      However,    a    review   of   the   Board    and   Executive\n\nCommittee minutes reveals that, while not word for word renditions\n\nof the meetings, the minutes capture more than a skeletal outline\n\nof each meeting and include descriptions of the considerations\n\nrelevant to each loan rather than simply the fact that the loan was\n\ndiscussed and approved.12\n\n          After considering this evidence, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the use of\n\nthe minutes to demonstrate that the Board did not receive material\n\ninformation     about   many   of    the     transactions       it   considered.\n\n\n     12\n       In a typical example involving a loan to a developer on a\nproject that did not involve any of the appellants, the Executive\nCommittee Minutes report: \"Mr. Kareh explained that as a result of\ndiscrepancies between the developer and the builder, this project\nwas par[y]lized for many months. The developer requested that he\nbe allowed to substitute builders in order to finish the project.\nOriginal builder was Las Américas Construction and the new builder\nwould be a local small contractor known as D.C. Inc. with ample\nexperience in this field. Mr. Kareh also explained that further\ndelay in the conclusion of the project would probably affect the\nfinal outcome of the project.\"\n\n                                     -25-\n\fEnriquez's testimony and Pastor's affidavit demonstrate that the\n\nbusiness records were prepared regularly after every meeting,\n\nreviewed and ratified by the Board, and stored securely following\n\nratification.        These    circumstances      do    not   indicate   lack    of\n\ntrustworthiness. Indeed, they permit a finding of trustworthiness.\n\nMoreover, given the minutes' thorough description of information\n\ndiscussed at the meetings, we conclude that the missing information\n\nrelating to the loan transactions was a \"matter . . . of a kind of\n\nwhich     a   memorandum,    report,   record,    or    data   compilation     was\n\nregularly made and preserved.\"          Fed.

Bank Fraud with Respect to the Gutiérrez Loans\n\n              The jury found all four appellants guilty of bank fraud\n\nwith respect to the Gutiérrez loans.            To prove bank fraud under 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   1344,   the   government   must    show   that   the   appellants\n\nknowingly engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain\n\nmoney from a federally insured financial institution by means of\n\nmaterially false statements or misrepresentations.                   See United\n\nStates v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir. 2000).14                  We first\n\nconsider      the   evidence   against   bank    officers   Muñoz-Franco    and\n\n\n\n\n     14\n        In full, 18 U.S.C. § 1344 provides: \"Whoever knowingly\nexecutes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice (1) to\ndefraud a financial institution; or (2) to obtain any of the\nmoneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned\nby, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by\nmeans of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or\npromises; shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not\nmore than 30 years, or both.\"\n\n                                     -27-\n\fSánchez-Arán, and then the evidence against Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández.\n\n            1. Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán\n\n            In    their   positions     as    President   and   Executive     Vice\n\nPresident,       respectively,     Muñoz-Franco     and     Sánchez-Arán      were\n\nresponsible for keeping the Board informed of information relevant\n\nto current and prospective loans.             Moreover, Sánchez-Arán was the\n\nprimary supervisor of the construction and commercial loans to\n\nModules,    a    Gutiérrez-owned       company   involved    in   many   of   the\n\nfraudulent transactions.          Muñoz-Franco supported Sánchez-Arán's\n\nrecommendations on these projects.             At trial, Lugo, the president\n\nof the Board of Directors, explained that he and the other Board\n\nmembers relied on the reports prepared by Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-\n\nArán in making decisions regarding loans.             Lugo explained that it\n\nwas not his job to \"verify the accuracy of information that was\n\nbeing given\" to him by the management of the bank, and added that\n\nhe \"trusted fully that the information that was being provided me\n\nwas whole and true.\"\n\n            Despite their responsibility to keep the Board fully\n\napprised,       Muñoz-Franco     and   Sánchez-Arán       concealed   important\n\ninformation on many occasions.           For example, in July 1985 Caguas\n\nconsidered the Jardines de Villa Alba project, for which Modules\n\nwould be the contractor.           As of October 29, 1984, Modules had\n\ncompleted none of the 212 units planned for the La Marina project,\n\neven though the original loan agreement from June 25, 1980 called\n\n\n                                       -28-\n\ffor construction to begin in thirty days and for seventy-five units\n\nto   be    completed    within     twelve    months.      Despite     the     lack   of\n\nprogress, the loan amount had been increased four times between\n\nAugust 7, 1980 and September 17, 1981.                 Lugo testified that this\n\npoor      performance    history    was     not    discussed      during    the   loan\n\npresentation for the Jardines de Villa Alba project.                    Lugo stated\n\nunequivocally      that    he    would      have    wanted     to    know     Modules'\n\nperformance history in evaluating the Jardines de Villa Alba loan,\n\ndemonstrating the materiality of such information.\n\n              Lugo further testified that, after the original loan\n\npresentation,     Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán continued to withhold\n\ninformation from the Board regarding the Jardines de Villa Alba\n\nloan.      Although the record shows $231,000 was paid to Modules\n\nbefore the Jardines de Villa Alba loan agreement was signed, even\n\nat trial Lugo expressed surprise that this had happened and stated\n\nthat \"it would have been difficult for me to believe that\" this\n\noccurred.      More than a year after the Jardines de Villa Alba loan\n\nwas approved, in September 1986, Lugo did not know that only one\n\nhouse had been built on the project.               Lugo also testified that as\n\nof   September    1986    the    performance       history   of     Modules    \"as   to\n\nconstruction of homes that were to be constructed versus the ones\n\nthat were constructed . . . was not discussed.\"                        Finally, on\n\nJanuary 10, 1988, Lugo signed the Denby letter, which was prepared\n\nby Muñoz-Franco and which referred to the \"units\" built on Jardines\n\n\n                                         -29-\n\fde Villa Alba, without realizing that only one house had been built\n\non the project.\n\n               Lugo also testified that Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán\n\ndid not inform him and the Board of other material information\n\nrelating to Modules.          For example, he did not know that Modules\n\nremained the contractor after the La Marina, Country Club, and\n\nLevittown projects were sold from Transglobe to DO.W in October\n\n1984.        He also did not know that, between 1984 and 1986, Modules\n\ndid not make any principal or interest payment on any loan to\n\nCaguas with funds generated from its own business as opposed to\n\nproceeds from other loans. Likewise, he was not informed, when the\n\nBoard approved the sale of Modules to Camero on September 10, 1986,\n\nin    conjunction      with    a    restructuring      of     its   loans,   that\n\napproximately seventy percent of Modules' debt was with Caguas and\n\nthat over seventy-one percent of Modules' assets were intangibles.15\n\n               Finally, Lugo testified that when the board approved a\n\nloan of $1,412,077 for land acquisition for the Cerrovista project,\n\nfor   which      Modules   also    was   the    contractor,   Muñoz-Franco   and\n\nSánchez-Arán did not advise him or the Board that the cost of the\n\nland was actually only $480,000 — in other words, that $932,177\n\nwould be used to make principal and interest payments on other\n\nModules loans.\n\n\n        15\n        The high percentage of assets that were intangible might\nraise concerns about the ability of Modules to pay off its debts.\nSuch information would be relevant to the Board's decision process.\n\n                                         -30-\n\f             Lugo's testimony is corroborated by the absence of this\n\nand other material information from the Board minutes.                         Although\n\nthe   government     did    not    rely    heavily      on   the    absence    of    such\n\ninformation, we have found these omissions properly admissible\n\nunder Federal Rule of Evidence 803(7) and note that they lend\n\nsupport to the prosecution's case.\n\n             There was substantial evidence that Muñoz-Franco and\n\nSánchez-Arán withheld all of this information from the Board with\n\nfull knowledge of the problems with Modules and other Gutiérrez\n\ncompanies. Anabel Enriquez, who reported directly to Sánchez-Arán,\n\nexplained that the handling of Gutiérrez certifications at Caguas\n\nconcerned    her    \"[b]ecause      practically       monthly,       each   time     they\n\ninvoiced[,] the certifications would be ahead of the construction.\"\n\nShe discussed her concerns with Muñoz-Franco at least by the time\n\nLa Marina was going to be sold to DO.W in 1984, and with Sánchez-\n\nArán around the same time.               She also discussed her concern with\n\nMuñoz-Franco that, following the sale, Modules would remain a\n\ncontractor for La Marina, Levittown, and Country Club.                         However,\n\nMuñoz-Franco       and   Sánchez-Arán       took   no    action      in   response    to\n\nEnriquez's concerns.\n\n             Finally, Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán took steps to\n\nconceal their misrepresentations from both internal and external\n\nauditors.     Juan Hernández, Caguas' internal auditor, testified\n\nthat,   in   1981,       Kareh    (the    assistant      vice      president    of    the\n\n\n                                          -31-\n\fconstruction loan department) initially provided information in\n\nconnection with an audit of the construction loan department, but,\n\nafter a short meeting with Sánchez-Arán, Kareh stopped providing\n\nthe information Hernández requested.         Hernández further testified\n\nthat, although he requested the auditing committee \"several times\"\n\nbetween 1980 and 1990 to allow him to audit the construction loan\n\ndepartment, Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán did not allow the audit\n\nto take place.    In a letter dated January 22, 1985, an external\n\nauditing firm, Stephen P. Bradics and Company, recommended \"that\n\nthe scope of internal auditing be expanded to include . . .\n\nconstruction loans.\"     After Caguas received this letter, Hernández\n\nagain recommended to the audit committee on several occasions that\n\nhe should be allowed to audit the construction department, but he\n\nstill was not allowed to do so.            The audit committee minutes\n\nreflect his recommendation at several meetings at which Muñoz-\n\nFranco and Sánchez-Arán were present.        At one meeting, on January\n\n28,   1988,   Muñoz-Franco     responded   by    telling   Hernández    that\n\n\"construction    loans   was    the   area      most   audited   by    senior\n\nmanagement.\"16   Sánchez-Arán heard and agreed with Muñoz-Franco's\n\nresponse, and Sánchez-Arán had also made similar statements to\n\nHernández in the past.    However, Hernández was never provided with\n\nany internal audit conducted by either Muñoz-Franco or Sánchez-\n\n\n\n      16\n       Hernández testified that \"senior management\" consisted of\nMuñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán.\n\n                                   -32-\n\fArán.\n\n             Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán also concealed information\n\nregarding Caguas' lending practices from external authorities.\n\nCritically, Muñoz-Franco drafted and obtained Board approval to\n\nsend the Denby letter, which states: \"This Board of Directors\n\nwishes to state in no unclear and uncertain terms that it has never\n\nconsidered    and    much    less    approved     any    policy     or   practice        of\n\npermitting borrowers to use construction loan proceeds to satisfy\n\nor make interest payment[s] on other unrelated loans.\"17                          At the\n\ntime of the letter, however, Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán had, as\n\ndiscussed     above,     approved     loans      for    such    purposes      on    many\n\noccasions.\n\n             Taken in the light most favorable to the government, the\n\nevidence demonstrates that Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán repeatedly\n\nconcealed     material      information      regarding       the    status     of    the\n\nGutiérrez loans from the Board, approved disbursements for work\n\nthat was not completed, and prevented audits.                  Such conduct caused\n\nCaguas to continue lending money to Gutiérrez-owned companies\n\ndespite the companies' financial instability, which demonstrates\n\nappellants' knowing scheme to defraud Caguas by means of material\n\nmisrepresentations        within     the    meaning     of     18   U.S.C.    §    1344.\n\nConsequently,       we   affirm     the    district     court's     finding       that    a\n\n\n        17\n       At trial, Joseph Gonzalez (an examiner for the Federal Home\nLoan Bank) testified that \"[a] loan that has a different borrower,\ndifferent property to me would be an unrelated loan.\"\n\n                                          -33-\n\frational jury could have found Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán guilty\n\nof bank fraud.\n\n            2. Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández\n\n            The record also contained considerable evidence from\n\nwhich a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández knowingly engaged in a scheme\n\nto defraud Caguas by misrepresenting material information.                     The\n\ncertifications     they     submitted     and    signed     contained         many\n\nmisrepresentations.       For example, on the Los Mameyes project,\n\nbetween December 9, 1985 and January 10, 1986, Gutiérrez and\n\nUmpierre-Hernández submitted nine certifications attesting to the\n\nmanufacture of 74 housing units and requesting payments totaling\n\n$380,000, even though the inspector's report stated that only 19\n\nhouses had been built.      Between January 16 and February 21, 1986,\n\nGutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández submitted 10 more certifications\n\nattesting to the manufacture of 90 additional housing units and\n\nrequesting   payment   of   approximately       $500,000,       at    which   point\n\npayment had been disbursed for at least 164 housing units even\n\nthough only 40 units had been manufactured.             As of February 25,\n\n1986, Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández had certified the completion\n\nof 200 units, but an inspection report dated March 23, 1986,\n\nindicated that only 55 units had been built.              On March 31, 1986,\n\nGutiérrez    and   Umpierre-Hernández       submitted       a        certification\n\nrequesting $69,000 for \"payment of subcontractors\" along with a\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\flist   of   interest    payments    they       had    made   on   other    projects,\n\nincluding Jardines de Villa Alba, Levittown, Country Club, La\n\nMarina, and Los Caciques, which equalled exactly $69,000. Finally,\n\non June 26, 1986, Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández submitted a\n\n\"special certification\" of $85,000 with no justification for work\n\nallegedly completed; Kareh testified that such a certification was\n\nnot a usual practice.       Sánchez-Arán authorized the disbursements\n\nbased on these certifications.\n\n            Gutiérrez     and     Umpierre-Hernández           submitted     similar\n\ncertifications for work not completed on other projects.                           For\n\nexample,    on   the   Jardines    de   Villa        Alba   project,   Modules    had\n\ninstalled only one unit as of the time of the Denby letter on\n\nJanuary 10, 1988; however, on October 22, 1985 Gutiérrez and\n\nUmpierre-Hernández      certified       that     twenty-two       units    had   been\n\ncompleted, causing $626,000 to be disbursed to Modules.\n\n            Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández perpetuated their scheme\n\nby recruiting other developers to obtain loans from Caguas on the\n\ncondition that they use Modules as the contractor.                     This conduct\n\nallowed Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández to obtain new funding for\n\nModules, which they would then use to pay down prior loans and keep\n\nModules from collapsing.          Developer Burns, the original owner of\n\nthe    Cerrovista      project,     was    a     typical       example.          After\n\nunsuccessfully applying to Caguas for a loan to build residential\n\nhousing on land he owned, Burns met with Umpierre-Hernández, who\n\n\n                                        -35-\n\ftold him that if he used Modules as his contractor and signed a $2\n\nmillion note he would be approved for a loan.             A week later Burns\n\nreceived financing for the Cerrovista project.                He testified that\n\nthe approval was \"[d]efinitely[] because of the use of Modules.\"\n\nBurns met with Umpierre-Hernández on \"many other occasions,\" and,\n\nafter problems arose with the Cerrovista project, with Umpierre-\n\nHernández and Sánchez-Arán in Sánchez-Arán's office. Subsequently,\n\nUmpierre-Hernández told Burns that the project would be sold to\n\nIantho, and explained that \"this project was going to contribute to\n\npaying off some interest for some of the projects that were in\n\ndefault,\"          which   caused   Burns   to   understand    \"that   was   the\n\nreason . . . I was rejected as sponsor.\"18\n\n                  On September 10, 1986, Sánchez-Arán presented, and the\n\nBoard approved, a loan of $8.9 million to Iantho Corporation to\n\ntake over the Cerrovista project; the loan agreement specified that\n\nModules would be the contractor for the project's two hundred\n\nunits. Burns testified that, around the time the project was being\n\nsold,        he     received   confirmation      that   the     Department    of\n\nTransportation's plans to build a hospital and expressway would\n\ncause the development of four lots of the project to be \"frozen.\"\n\nWhen told the news, Umpierre-Hernández responded, \"hide it, boy.\"\n\n\n        18\n       Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández implemented similar schemes\ninvolving developer Montilla on the Jardines de Villa Alba project\nand developer Santiago on the Caciques project. The contours of\nthese schemes are similar to that involving Burns, and thus we need\nnot recount them in detail here.\n\n                                        -36-\n\fOn September 28, 1986, Cerrovista was sold to Iantho with no\n\nmention of the impending development.\n\n              Taken in the light most favorable to the government, the\n\nevidence shows that Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández knowingly\n\nconcealed information relevant to the viability of the Cerrovista\n\nproject and submitted many certifications for work that was not\n\ncompleted.       To   sustain     their        schemes,    they     recruited     other\n\ndevelopers and helped them receive funding from Caguas on the\n\ncondition that these developers use Modules as a contractor. These\n\nactivities caused Caguas to continue lending money to Gutiérrez-\n\nowned    companies    despite     the    companies'       financial     instability,\n\nproviding an ample basis for a jury to find that appellants\n\nknowingly      schemed   to     defraud        Caguas     by   means    of    material\n\nmisrepresentations       within       the   meaning       of   18   U.S.C.    §   1344.\n\nConsequently, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found\n\nbeyond    a   reasonable      doubt     that    both    Gutiérrez      and   Umpierre-\n\nHernández were guilty of bank fraud.\n\nB. Conspiracy with Respect to the Gutiérrez Loans\n\n              The four appellants were charged with conspiring, in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 371, to commit bank fraud (18 U.S.C. §\n\n1344), misapply bank funds (18 U.S.C. § 657), and make false\n\nentries in the books and records of the bank (18 U.S.C. § 1006).\n\nTo establish a conspiracy, the government must prove beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that (1) a conspiracy existed; (2) the defendant\n\n\n                                         -37-\n\fknew of and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy; and (3)\n\nthere was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy.

United States, 328 U.S. 781, 809 (1946); rather,\n\n\"[t]he agreement may be shown by a concert of action, all the\n\nparties working together understandingly, with a single design for\n\nthe accomplishment of a common purpose.\" Am. Tobacco Co. v. United\n\nStates, 147 F.2d 93, 107 (6th Cir. 1944); see also Adver. Special\n\nNat'l Ass'n v. FTC, 238 F.2d 108, 115 (1st Cir. 1956).   Where, as\n\nhere, the indictment alleges a conspiracy to commit multiple\n\noffenses, the charge may be sustained by sufficient evidence of\n\nconspiracy to commit any one of the offenses.      See Griffin v.\n\nUnited States, 502 U.S. 46, 56-57 (1991); see also United States v.\n\nWedelstedt, 589 F.2d 339, 341-42 (8th Cir. 1978)(\"[P]roof that\n\n[defendant] agreed to commit one of the multiple illegal objectives\n\nof the conspiracy sufficed to sustain the conviction on that\n\ncount.\").\n\n\n\n     19\n       In pertinent part, 18 U.S.C. § 371 states: \"If two or more\npersons conspire either to commit any offense against the United\nStates, or to defraud the United States, . . . and one or more of\nsuch persons do any act to effect the object of the conspiracy,\neach shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than\nfive years, or both.\"\n\n                               -38-\n\f            On    the    verdict    form,    the   jury   found   Muñoz-Franco,\n\nSánchez-Arán,      Gutiérrez,        and     Umpierre-Hernández      guilty    of\n\nconspiracy \"as charged in the indictment.\" Docket Nos. 1291, 1292,\n\n1294, 1295.       In considering appellants' motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal, the district court found that there was more than enough\n\nevidence with respect to bank fraud to sustain the conspiracy\n\nconviction, and thus did not review the evidence concerning the\n\nmisapplication and false entry crimes.\n\n            We agree with the district court's assessment.                 First,\n\nthere was substantial evidence of an agreement among the four men\n\nto   defraud     the    bank.      Sánchez-Arán     directly   supervised     the\n\nGutiérrez loans and worked closely with Muñoz-Franco on the loans.\n\nEnriquez    testified      that    Muñoz-Franco     and   Sánchez-Arán    always\n\nreached an agreement regarding the treatment of these loans.\n\nGutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández submitted many certifications for\n\nwork not yet completed, and Sánchez-Arán then repeatedly approved\n\ndisbursements      for    this    work.      Sánchez-Arán     also   facilitated\n\nGutiérrez's efforts to secure new borrowers by ensuring that a loan\n\nwould be approved if Modules was used as a contractor.                   Sánchez-\n\nArán and Umpierre-Hernández met frequently regarding the status of\n\nthe Gutiérrez companies. Burns testified, for example, that he met\n\nwith   Umpierre-Hernández          many    times   in   Sánchez-Arán's    office\n\nregarding   the    Cerrovista       project.       Finally,   Muñoz-Franco    and\n\nSánchez-Arán failed to disclose material information to the Board\n\n\n                                          -39-\n\fon many occasions, and this joint failure further demonstrates\n\ntheir collaboration in defrauding the bank.\n\n             Given the many instances of concealing the Gutiérrez\n\ncompanies' performance from the Board of Directors, submitting\n\ncertifications for work not completed, authorizing disbursements\n\nfor such work and preventing audits, a reasonable jury could easily\n\nfind the other two elements of conspiracy: that appellants knew of\n\nand participated voluntarily in the conspiracy, and that each\n\ncommitted overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy.                  Viewed as\n\na   whole,    this    synchronized      pattern       of   conduct    demonstrates\n\nappellants' agreement to maintain the appearance of financial\n\nviability of the Gutiérrez corporations by securing new loans to\n\nmake    payments     on   outstanding    loans.        Thus,    we   find   that   a\n\nreasonable jury could have found each element of conspiracy beyond\n\na reasonable doubt with respect to each of the four appellants.\n\nC. Misapplication of Bank Funds\n\n             The     jury   found    all       four    appellants      guilty      of\n\nmisapplication of bank funds under 18 U.S.C. § 657 for a single\n\ntransaction related to the Cerrovista project.                       The crime of\n\nmisapplication eludes easy definition.20                   As we have previously\n\n\n       20\n       In pertinent part, 18 U.S.C. § 657 provides: \"Whoever, being\nan officer, agent or employee of or connected in any capacity with\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation . . . or savings and loan\ncorporation or association authorized or acting under the laws of\nthe United States . . . embezzles, abstracts, purloins or willfully\nmisapplies any moneys, funds, credits, securities or other things\nof value belonging to such institution . . . [is guilty of\n\n                                        -40-\n\fnoted, \"[t]he problem that has confronted and perplexed the courts\n\nis that there is no statutory definition or common law heritage\n\nthat gives content to the phrase 'willfully misapplies.'\"             United\n\nStates v. Wester, 90 F.3d 592, 595 (1st Cir. 1996).              However, we\n\nhave held that misapplication has two key elements: (1) wrongful\n\nuse of bank funds; and (2) intent to injure or defraud a bank.\n\nBlasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d at 63. We have also explained that “the\n\nsame facts can easily be the basis for deeming the conduct to be\n\nwrongful   and   the   intent    fraudulent;    both   misapplication     and\n\nscienter are required.”         Wester, 90 F.3d at 595.         Finally, the\n\nmisapplication    statute    applies   only    to   officers,   agents,   and\n\nemployees of a bank.    Thus, appellants who do not hold one of these\n\npositions — here Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández — may not be\n\nconvicted as principals for misapplication, but may be convicted as\n\naiders and abettors.        See Giragosian v. United States, 349 F.2d\n\n166, 167 (1st Cir. 1965)(\"Since [defendant] was not an officer,\n\ndirector, agent or employee of the bank, he could not be guilty as\n\na principal . . . for misapplication of the bank's funds, but only\n\nas an aider and abettor.\").21\n\n\n\nmisapplication of bank funds].\"\n     21\n       Giragosian construed 18 U.S.C. § 656, which deals with banks\nrather than savings and loan associations.      However, \"[i]n the\nabsence of legislative history to suggest that there is any\nsubstantive difference in meaning, we find the reasoning in cases\nconstruing § 656 equally applicable to our reasoning\" in cases\ninvolving § 657. Blasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d at 63 n.8.\n\n                                    -41-\n\f            A reasonable jury could have concluded that appellants'\n\nhandling of the Cerrovista loan constituted misapplication.           The\n\noriginal loan offering, which was prepared according to Sánchez-\n\nArán's instructions, designated $1,412,177 for land costs and\n\n$855,323 for \"partial assumption of other loans.\"22        This document\n\ndid not disclose the purpose for which the funds were actually\n\nused.     Of the $1,412,177 designated for land, only $480,000 was\n\nused to purchase land for the project.      The remaining $932,177 was\n\ndisbursed to the Gutiérrez-owned Quintas de Humacao company and\n\nimmediately applied to other Gutiérrez projects: principal and\n\ninterest on the Quintas de Fajardo loan, interest on the Las\n\nGaviotas loan, and interest on a Modules commercial loan.\n\n            The   documents   associated   with   the   Cerrovista   loan\n\ndemonstrate appellants' intent to defraud Caguas by redirecting\n\nthese funds. Although the settlement statement23 for the Cerrovista\n\nloan, dated September 29, 1986, lists a disbursement of $932,177\n\nfor \"repayment of other loan\" and lists the payee as \"Quintas de\n\nHumacao Inc. & Caguas Federal Savings,\" these disclosures appear in\n\n\n     22\n       The loan offering was a document prepared by bank management\n(often Sánchez-Arán) that proposed the terms of a loan to be\noffered to a borrower and was then submitted to the Board for\napproval.\n     23\n       Kareh testified that the settlement statement \"sums up the\nconditions for the loan, the amount of the money, the payouts that\nhave been made for the loan and whatever pending balances may\nremain for the loan in process\" and was \"created and maintained in\nthe regular course of business of the construction loan\ndepartment.\"\n\n                                  -42-\n\fa markedly different type, as does the total loan amount.                   Kareh\n\ntestified that this different type indicates that \"the entry was\n\nmade later or at another place,\" allowing an inference that the\n\ndocument was amended to make it appear that the Board had approved\n\nthe use of loan proceeds to make payments on other loans.                       This\n\ninference      is   bolstered   by   the    fact   that   the    loan   settlement\n\nstatement was not prepared until after the Board had approved a\n\nloan.        Kareh also testified that, although the $855,323 amount\n\ndesignated for \"partial assumption of other loans\" was listed on\n\nthe loan offering and disbursed on the date of closing, the\n\n$855,323 amount was omitted from the settlement statement at\n\nSánchez-Arán's instruction.24 This omission concealed the fact that\n\ntwo   separate      disbursements,     in    the   amounts      of   $932,177    and\n\n$855,323, were used to pay down other loans.\n\n               Each appellant was sufficiently involved in concealing\n\nthe use of funds to allow an inference of intent to defraud.\n\nSánchez-Arán drafted the original loan offering, which did not\n\ndisclose that the $932,177 difference between the amount allocated\n\nfor land purchase and the amount spent on land would be used to pay\n\nprincipal and interest on other loans.                Moreover, according to\n\nKareh, Sánchez-Arán explicitly instructed him to omit the $855,323\n\n\n\n        24\n       The district court's discussion of this issue suggests that\n$932,177 was disbursed instead of $855,323, when in fact both\namounts were disbursed but the $855,323 was not disclosed on the\nsettlement statement.\n\n                                      -43-\n\famount from the loan settlement document.            A jury could infer that\n\nMuñoz-Franco helped to conceal this wrongful use of funds, thereby\n\nintentionally defrauding Caguas, based on his supervisory role on\n\nthe Gutiérrez loans and his regular responsibility of conveying\n\ninformation to the Board.          Gutiérrez and Umpierre-Hernández were\n\nalso involved in the wrongful use of funds: they endorsed the\n\nchecks, accepted the funds, and immediately applied these funds to\n\npay down their other loans with the bank.                Although appellants\n\nassert that the loan settlement documents demonstrate that the\n\ntransaction was disclosed to the Board, the record indicates that\n\nthe loan settlement statement was prepared after the loan had\n\nalready been approved.\n\n          Appellants attempt to counter the charge by segregating\n\nthe activities relating to the Cerrovista loan into two separate\n\ntransactions:   the    disbursement       of   the   $932,177   land   purchase\n\ndifferential to Quintas de Humacao, and the use of those funds to\n\npay down other Gutiérrez loans.           They argue that, at the time the\n\nfunds were disbursed to the Gutiérrez-owned Quintas de Humacao,\n\nthey ceased to be \"bank funds\" under 18 U.S.C. § 657 and thus\n\ncannot support a misapplication violation.\n\n          We    do    not   find   this    technicality    pertinent.       The\n\ndisbursement of funds from the Cerrovista loan to Gutiérrez-owned\n\ncompanies, and the subsequent use of these loans to pay down other\n\nGutiérrez loans, was a single unified transaction.               The district\n\n\n                                     -44-\n\fcourt explained:\n\n            The funds did not cease to be controlled by\n            the express purpose for which they were\n            disbursed.   The fact the $932,177 check was\n            endorsed does not change the express purpose\n            for which said funds were to be used.     The\n            second transfer, the Gutiérrez's endorsement\n            back to Caguas Central for the repayment of\n            four separate loans, is still the use of bank\n            funds and subject to misapplication.\n\nBy expressly designating these funds for \"repayment of other\n\nloan[s],\" Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán retained control over the\n\nfunds even if the funds nominally changed hands.                  Moreover, Muñoz-\n\nFranco and Sánchez-Arán supervised the entire transaction, as\n\ndemonstrated      by   four   entries    in    Caguas'    ledgers     showing   the\n\ntransfer of funds to the Gutiérrez accounts.\n\n            Critically,       appellants       also      ignore     the   separate\n\nconcealment of the $855,323, which, although it was listed on the\n\noriginal loan application, was left off of the loan settlement\n\nstatement    of    September    29,     1986    at    Sánchez-Arán's      explicit\n\ninstruction.       Although    the    disbursement       of   the    $855,323   was\n\ndisclosed to the Board, the fact that this disbursement was left\n\noff the loan settlement statement indicates the bank officials'\n\nefforts to conceal the fact that two separate disbursements, in the\n\namounts of $855,323 and $932,177, were used to pay down other\n\nloans.   In short, there was more than sufficient evidence for a\n\nreasonable jury to conclude that appellants engaged in wrongful use\n\nof bank funds with the intent to defraud the bank.\n\n\n                                        -45-\n\fD. Bank Fraud with Respect to Mirandes Loans\n\n          The jury also found appellants Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-\n\nArán guilty of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344 with\n\nrespect to the Mirandes loans.    The Mirandes scheme involved many\n\nof the same elements as the Gutiérrez loans.      In September 1981,\n\nMuñoz-Franco asked Mirandes to take over ownership of a project\n\ncalled Reparto Valenciano, and Mirandes, then the contractor for\n\nthe project, agreed.   At the time the project was in debt to Caguas\n\nfor $2.2 million, and delays and other problems continued after\n\nMirandes assumed ownership.   On an ongoing basis, Muñoz-Franco and\n\nSánchez-Arán supervised the transfer of funds from other projects\n\nto pay down the debt on the Reparto Valenciano project.             For\n\nexample, on September 30, 1986, approximately $2.2 million was\n\napplied to the Reparto Valenciano project from other Mirandes\n\nprojects.25   Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán did not disclose these\n\ntransfers of money among various Mirandes projects to the Board.\n\nAfter the Reparto Valenciano debt increased to $3.2 million,\n\nMirandes received five contracts from the Puerto Rico Housing\n\nDepartment to build basic housing.      Although Caguas initially\n\ndenied Mirandes' application for funding for these projects, it\n\nsubsequently agreed to finance the Villas de Gurabo project if\n\nMirandes would agree to apply the profits of that project to the\n\n\n     25\n        These transfers occurred on the last day of the bank's\nfiscal year, thus improving the appearance of Caguas' finances to\nanyone reviewing the bank's records.\n\n                                 -46-\n\fdebt   and   interest    of   the   Reparto    Valenciano   project.      These\n\ntransfers temporarily sustained the Mirandes projects, but the\n\ndecreased funds available to successive projects ultimately made it\n\nimpossible for those projects to be completed or to yield profits.\n\n             Both   Muñoz-Franco     and     Sánchez-Arán   were   intimately\n\ninvolved with the administration of the Mirandes loans.                Sánchez-\n\nArán met with Mirandes on many occasions, including, during one\n\nseven or eight month period, meetings every fifteen days. Sánchez-\n\nArán was involved in most of the disbursements for the Mirandes\n\nprojects, whereas for other loans he was typically involved only if\n\na problem arose.        Muñoz-Franco was also involved in the Mirandes\n\nloans: he originally met with Mirandes to get him to take over the\n\nloans, met with Mirandes several times thereafter, was regularly\n\ninformed of the loans' progress, and reported on the loans' status\n\nto the Board.\n\n             Beginning thirty days after the Reparto Valenciano loan\n\nagreement was signed, Sánchez-Arán authorized many certifications\n\nfor completed work.       With two exceptions, no work on the project\n\nhad been completed at the time of the authorizations.              On several\n\noccasions, a transfer of funds from one loan to another or an\n\nincrease in the amount of a loan was authorized without the\n\napproval of the loan committee or the Board.                  Mirandes also\n\ntestified that the disbursement schedule for loans \"normally . . .\n\nwasn't complied with because money was taken out to pay interest.\"\n\n\n                                      -47-\n\fThus, the disbursement schedule that the Board approved was not the\n\nschedule that Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán subsequently followed.\n\n           Enriquez testified such practices were not standard at\n\nCaguas; along with the Gutiérrez loans, the Mirandes loans were the\n\nonly ones for which disbursements were authorized for work that was\n\nnot completed.        According to Enriquez, the Mirandes projects\n\ncommonly   received    \"special\"   certifications,   which   meant   that\n\n\"[w]hen one project didn't have a line [of credit] it would be\n\ntaken from another project.\"        When regular certifications were\n\nsubmitted, they would have an itemization of expenses attached;\n\nspecial certifications would not include such an itemization and\n\nthus would not disclose the destination of the funds.\n\n           Sánchez-Arán also caused Caguas to finance the sale of\n\nland from one Mirandes company to another in order to pay interest\n\non the Reparto Valenciano loan.      On September 11, 1984, Mirandes'\n\ncompany Deproco purchased property for $60,000, and, three months\n\nlater, sold the property to Bubao, another Mirandes company, for\n\n$94,000.   The proceeds from the sale were used to pay interest on\n\nthe Reparto Valenciano loan.       The sale occurred despite the fact\n\nthat, according to Mirandes, the land was not worth the purchase\n\nprice and no improvements to the land were made in the interim.\n\nThe minutes did not reflect that the Board was informed of the\n\ntransaction.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -48-\n\f             After Mirandes was unable to improve the finances of the\n\nReparto Valenciano project, he was awarded five projects from the\n\nHousing Department, including Villas de Gurabo, but was denied\n\nfunding from Caguas. At that point, Mirandes met with Muñoz-Franco\n\nand Sánchez-Arán and asked to be released from the debt on the\n\nReparto Valenciano project because he \"felt that the debt was not\n\nmy problem\" and \"needed to seek financing for the project from\n\nanother bank.\"      Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán refused to release\n\nMirandes from the debt.           Subsequently, however, Kareh informed\n\nMirandes that Caguas would give him financing on Villas de Gurabo,\n\nbut that the proceeds from that loan would have to be used to pay\n\noff   the   debt   on     the   Reparto   Valenciano   project.     Mirandes\n\nreluctantly agreed, and this plan was implemented.                Again, the\n\nminutes did not reflect that the Board was informed of this\n\ntransaction.\n\n             The Denby letter provides further support for the jury's\n\nfinding     of   fraud.      Drafted   and    signed   by   Muñoz-Franco,   it\n\nexplicitly denies that Caguas' Board approved the practice of\n\nborrowers using construction loan proceeds to pay interest on\n\nunrelated loans.        At the time of the letter, however, Muñoz-Franco\n\nand Sánchez-Arán had on many occasions authorized the payment of\n\ndebts on the Reparto Valenciano project with funds from other\n\nMirandes loans.      The fact that the Denby letter was signed by all\n\nthe members of the Board would allow a reasonable jury to conclude\n\n\n                                       -49-\n\fbeyond a reasonable doubt that Muñoz-Franco misrepresented the\n\npractices associated with the Mirandes loans to the Board.\n\n           This circumstantial evidence of the requisite intent was\n\nbolstered by more explicit evidence of appellants' knowledge.\n\nMirandes was concerned that, on the Reparto Valenciano project,\n\n\"some projects were being emptied out in order to deal with others\"\n\nand worried that \"it was going to become paralyzed.\"            Mirandes\n\ntestified that he and Sánchez-Arán \"spoke constantly\" about his\n\nconcerns, and that he also expressed his concerns to Muñoz-Franco.\n\nDespite Mirandes' repeated statements of concern, Sánchez-Arán\n\nexplicitly told Mirandes that the practices had to continue.         In\n\nmany cases, the bank authorized the disbursements directly rather\n\nthan seeking authorization from Mirandes, and Mirandes testified\n\nthat, although he knew of these disbursements, he was not in\n\nagreement with them.      The evidence that appellants continued with\n\ntheir scheme even over Mirandes' objections demonstrated that they\n\nacted deliberately to defraud the bank.\n\n           Taken in the light most favorable to the government, the\n\nevidence   shows   that   Muñoz-Franco   and   Sánchez-Arán   repeatedly\n\nauthorized disbursements for work that was not completed and\n\nconcealed relevant information from the Board.         As a result of\n\nthese activities, Caguas continued lending money to Mirandes-owned\n\ncompanies despite their financial instability.          This course of\n\nconduct constitutes a knowing scheme to defraud Caguas by means of\n\n\n                                  -50-\n\fmaterial misrepresentations within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. § 1344.\n\nConsequently, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán were\n\nguilty of bank fraud with respect to the Mirandes loans.\n\nE. Conspiracy with Respect to Mirandes Loans\n\n            The jury also found Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán guilty\n\nof conspiracy with respect to the Mirandes loans.              Although there\n\nwas   no   formal   agreement   among    Muñoz-Franco,   Sánchez-Arán      and\n\nMirandes, the three acted in concert to defraud the bank.                  As\n\ndescribed above, Muñoz-Franco originally approached Mirandes to\n\nassume the Reparto Valenciano loans, and Mirandes agreed.               After\n\nthis initial agreement, Mirandes met frequently with Sánchez-Arán\n\nand on several occasions with Muñoz-Franco.\n\n            The appellants participated voluntarily in the conspiracy\n\nand took overt actions in its furtherance.               When the Reparto\n\nValenciano project was unable to pay its debts, Muñoz-Franco and\n\nSánchez-Arán always attempted to find solutions to sustain the\n\nproject, frequently by transferring funds from one project to\n\nanother.       Such   transfers,    as     well   as   their    approval   of\n\ncertifications for work not completed, constituted overt acts in\n\nfurtherance of the conspiracy.          Thus, we find sufficient evidence\n\nto sustain the jury's verdict on charges of conspiracy to commit\n\nbank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1344 with respect to the\n\nMirandes loans.\n\n\n                                   -51-\n\f             The district court held that the evidence of conspiracy\n\nto commit bank fraud was sufficient in itself to sustain the\n\nconspiracy charges, but also noted that there was sufficient\n\nevidence that appellants conspired to misapply bank funds in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 657 and make false entries in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1006.       However, because we agree with that court's\n\nassessment of the bank fraud conspiracy, we need not discuss the\n\nother two bases for the conspiracy conviction.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n             Having   found   sufficient   evidence   to   support   the\n\nconvictions, we must now address three of appellants' claims that\n\nchallenge the validity of the proceedings. First, appellants claim\n\nthat the charges filed against them were barred by the statute of\n\nlimitations.     Second, they argue that their convictions violated\n\nthe Ex Post Facto Clause.         Finally, they contend that their\n\nconvictions were invalid because of pre-indictment and pre-trial\n\ndelay.\n\nA. Statute of Limitations\n\n             Under 18 U.S.C. § 3293, an individual may not be charged\n\nwith bank fraud or conspiracy to commit bank fraud unless the\n\nindictment is returned within ten years after the commission of the\n\noffense.26   Appellants raise three arguments regarding this statute\n\n\n\n     26\n       Appellants do not contend that the misapplication charges\nagainst them were outside the statute of limitations.\n\n                                  -52-\n\fof limitations. First, they argue that the original indictment was\n\nuntimely.     Next, they argue that the First, Second, and Third\n\nSuperseding     Indictments         substantially     amended     the     original\n\nindictment, do not relate back, and consequently were untimely.\n\nFinally, they argue that the district court erred in failing to\n\ninstruct the jury on the statute of limitations.\n\n             1. Timeliness of Original Indictment\n\n             We review de novo a district court’s decision not to\n\ndismiss on statute of limitations grounds.                López-Gonzáles v. Mun.\n\nof Comerío, 404 F.3d 548, 551 (1st Cir. 2005).               Here, the original\n\nindictment was returned on November 22, 1995.                Appellants contend\n\nthat the Board was fully informed of the practices at issue in two\n\nof the alleged violations — bank fraud and conspiracy on the\n\nGutiérrez loans — by a regulator report dated August 31, 1985.\n\nConsequently, they argue, any deception in the scheme ended more\n\nthan   ten   years    prior    to   the    original   indictment,     making    the\n\nindictment untimely for those charges.\n\n             In light of the activities discussed in Section III,\n\nsupra,   most    of    which    took      place   after    November     22,   1985,\n\nappellants' argument overstates the significance of the regulator\n\nreport in question. The report describes several Modules loans and\n\nexpresses general concern about Modules' financial state.                      The\n\nreport notes that the loans \"are considered to be substandard loans\n\nsubject to special comment since the future viability of the main\n\n\n                                          -53-\n\fborrower, Modules, could be impaired by uncertainties involving the\n\ncollectibility of an accounts receivable due from an affiliated\n\nparty.\" These general statements do nothing to inform the Board of\n\nsuch practices as the use of proceeds from one loan to make\n\npayments on another loan or the ongoing certification of and\n\npayment for work that was not completed.              Moreover, the report\n\nitself contains certain misleading statements by Sánchez-Arán. For\n\nexample, despite his knowledge of Modules' uncertain financial\n\nstatus and poor performance on several projects, he defended the\n\nloans to Modules by explaining that \"the borrower should have\n\nsufficient funds to satisfy the loans in a timely manner.\"               Thus,\n\nthe   district   court   did   not   err    in   ruling   that   the   original\n\nindictment was timely.\n\n           2. Relation Back of Superseding Indictments\n\n           Appellants next argue that each of the three superseding\n\nindictments materially broadened and substantially amended the\n\ncharges against them and, consequently, do not relate back to the\n\ndate of the original indictment.            As a result, they argue that\n\nthese indictments are untimely because they allege conduct that\n\nconcluded more than ten years previously.\n\n           In United States v. O'Bryant, 998 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir.\n\n1993), we held that \"a superseding indictment which supplants a\n\ntimely-filed indictment . . . is itself to be regarded as timely\n\n. . . so long as it neither materially broadens nor substantially\n\n\n                                     -54-\n\famends the charges against the defendant.\"                        Consequently, \"the\n\nsuperseding indictment relates back to the filing date of the\n\noriginal indictment so long as a strong chain of continuity links\n\nthe earlier and later charges.\"                    Id. at 24.     We emphasized that\n\n\"notice-related         concerns     .    .    .    comprise     the   touchstone   for\n\ndetermining when a superseding indictment materially broadens or\n\nsubstantially amends earlier charges,\" explaining that a timely\n\nindictment serves notice by apprising defendants \"'that they will\n\nbe called to account for their activities and should prepare a\n\ndefense.'\"       Id. (quoting United States v. Grady, 544 F.2d 598, 601\n\n(2d Cir. 1976)).\n\n             In this case, the original indictment charged the four\n\nappellants with bank fraud and conspiracy, alleging fifty-eight\n\novert     acts    spanning      nearly     a   decade     and     involving   unlawful\n\ndisbursement       of    bank   funds     by       Muñoz-Franco    and    Sánchez-Arán,\n\nunlawful receipt of the funds by Gutiérrez, Umpierre-Hernández, and\n\nMirandes, and concealment of these activities from Caguas' Board of\n\ndirectors        and    regulatory       agencies.         The    First     Superseding\n\nIndictment, returned on March 5, 1997, added allegations concerning\n\nfive additional loan projects and forty-four overt acts and added\n\ntwo additional defendants.27             It also changed the alleged starting\n\ndate of the conspiracy from December 1981 to June 1980, lengthening\n\n\n\n     27\n       Defendant Enrique Gutiérrez was acquitted by the jury, and\ndefendant Rafael Dominguez Wolff died before trial.\n\n                                           -55-\n\fthe duration of the conspiracy from eight years and five months to\n\nnine years and eleven months.           The Second Superseding Indictment,\n\nreturned on May 13, 1997, added allegations about two more loan\n\nprojects and ten overt acts.              Finally, the Third Superseding\n\nIndictment, returned on March 6, 1998, separated the allegations\n\nrelating to the Gutiérrez and Mirandes loans, which the previous\n\nindictments had presented as a single unitary conspiracy, into two\n\nseparate conspiracies set forth in separate counts.\n\n             We   conclude     that   these    revisions    do     not    materially\n\nbroaden or substantially amend the original indictment.                            The\n\ngovernment \"is not limited in its proof at trial to those overt\n\nacts alleged in the indictment.\"          United States v. Adamo, 534 F.2d\n\n31, 38 (3d Cir. 1976).         Therefore, allegations of additional loan\n\nprojects and overt acts in the superseding indictments do not\n\nbroaden the original indictment; they simply provide more specific\n\nexamples to substantiate the original fraud and conspiracy charges.\n\n             Similarly,      the   addition     of   eighteen      months    to    the\n\nbeginning    of   a   conspiracy      spanning    nearly    a    decade     does   not\n\nmaterially broaden the scope of the indictment.                 Virtually none of\n\nthe conduct supporting appellants' convictions occurred between\n\nJune 1980 and December 1981, and the dates were expanded primarily\n\nto   allow   factual    completeness      by    including    the    dates     of   the\n\noriginal     loans    Caguas   extended    to    various    companies.         Thus,\n\n\n\n\n                                       -56-\n\fappellants had adequate notice of the charges against them despite\n\nthe expanded time frame.28\n\n            Finally, we find that the separation of the original\n\nunitary bank fraud and conspiracy scheme into two separate schemes,\n\none   alleging     bank   fraud   and    conspiracy    with     respect    to   the\n\nGutiérrez loans and one alleging bank fraud and conspiracy with\n\nrespect to the Mirandes loans, did not materially broaden or\n\nsubstantially amend the indictment.            Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán\n\nstill had to explain the same set of actions.                   With respect to\n\nGutiérrez    and    Umpierre-Hernández,        the   division    also     provided\n\nadequate notice.      The only difference was that they no longer had\n\nto contend with the allegations that related only to the Mirandes\n\nloans.     Thus, we conclude that the Third Superseding Indictment\n\nrelates back to November 22, 1995, the date of the original\n\nindictment, and find no error in the district court's refusal to\n\ndismiss the indictment for untimeliness.29\n\n\n      28\n        Courts have recognized an expanded time span as a\nsubstantial amendment only when the expansion was far more\nsignificant than the one here, and then only in conjunction with\nnumerous other factors. See, e.g., United States v. Ratcliff, 245\nF.3d 1246, 1253-54 (11th Cir. 2001)(finding that a superseding\nindictment materially broadened or substantially amended the\noriginal indictment when it increased the length of time of the\nconspiracy from six or seven months to thirteen years, increased\nthe number of conspirators from five to fifteen, and increased the\namount of marijuana imported from 1,500 pounds to 6,800 pounds).\n      29\n        Appellants present various arguments that the alleged\nconduct concluded more than ten years prior to the dates of the\nFirst, Second, and Third Superseding Indictments. However, because\nwe find that the superseding indictments did not materially broaden\n\n                                        -57-\n\f           3. Jury Instruction on Statute of Limitations\n\n           Appellants also argue that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to instruct the jury on the statute of limitations on the\n\nground that the jury could have relied on conduct outside the\n\nlimitations   period    in   finding   defendants   guilty.   At   trial,\n\nhowever, Gutiérrez's attorney explicitly declined to seek a statute\n\nof limitations instruction, and the other appellants made no\n\nrequest for such an instruction.\n\n           We addressed a similar situation in United States v.\n\nWalsh, 928 F.2d 7, 11-12 (1st Cir. 1991).       There, we rejected the\n\ndefendant's claim that the district court should have issued an\n\ninstruction on the statute of limitations, explaining that the\n\ndefendant \"failed to identify any point in the record where such an\n\ninstruction was requested.       Absent such a request, the point was\n\nwaived.\"   Id. at 12.    This holding is logical because \"[a] statute\n\nof limitations claim presents ‘an affirmative defense’ that is ‘not\n\ncognizable on appeal unless properly raised below.’\" United States\n\nv. Spero, 331 F.3d 57, 60 n.2 (2d Cir. 2003)(quoting United States\n\nv. Walsh, 700 F.2d 846, 855-56 (2d Cir. 1983)).       The situation here\n\nis identical. We hold that because appellants failed to request an\n\ninstruction, the district court had no obligation to instruct sua\n\n\n\n\nor substantially amend the charges, we need not address these\narguments.\n\n                                   -58-\n\fsponte on the limitations issue.30\n\nB. Ex Post Facto\n\n          Appellants claim that their convictions for bank fraud\n\nand conspiracy violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art.\n\nI, § 9, cl. 3, because the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. § 1344,\n\nwas not enacted until October 12, 1984, and the jury could have\n\nconvicted them entirely on the basis of conduct that occurred prior\n\nto that date.31\n\n          The Ex Post Facto Clause \"'forbids the application of any\n\nlaw or rule that increases punishment for pre-existing conduct.'\"\n\nUnited States v. Regan, 989 F.2d 44, 48 (1st Cir. 1993)(quoting\n\nUnited States v. Havener, 905 F.2d 3, 5 (1st Cir. 1990)).      For\n\n\"continuing offenses\" such as the bank fraud and conspiracy charges\n\n\n     30\n       We also note that there was more than sufficient evidence\nto allow a reasonable jury to conclude that the alleged offenses\nwere completed within the limitations period, see supra Section\nIII, and thus our holding that appellants waived their right to\nrequest an instruction on the statute of limitations in no way\nrisks a miscarriage of justice.\n     31\n       With respect to the Gutiérrez loans, the indictment alleged\na conspiracy to commit bank fraud among all four appellants from\napproximately June 25, 1980 through May 25, 1990. It also charged\nthose appellants with bank fraud with respect to those loans \"on or\nabout the dates listed below\" and listed a series of fifty-eight\novert acts, of which the earliest took place on March 24, 1977, and\nthe latest took place on December 19, 1989. With respect to the\nMirandes loans, the indictment alleged a conspiracy to commit bank\nfraud between Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán from approximately\nDecember 1981 through May 25, 1990. It also charged Muñoz-Franco\nand Sánchez-Arán with bank fraud with respect to the Mirandes loans\n\"on or about the dates listed below\" and listed a series of forty-\nseven overt acts, of which the earliest took place in December 1981\nand the latest took place on December 7, 1989.\n\n                               -59-\n\fat issue here, however, the critical question is when the conduct\n\nended.32    As we have explained, \"[w]here a ‘continuing offense’\n\nstraddles the old and new law . . . applying the new is recognized\n\nas constitutionally sound.\"       Id.   In other words, \"[a] conviction\n\nfor a continuing offense straddling enactment of a statute will not\n\nrun afoul of the Ex Post Facto clause unless it was possible for\n\nthe    jury,   following    the   court's    instructions,     to   convict\n\n'exclusively' on pre-enactment conduct.\"       United States v. Monaco,\n\n194 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir. 1999)(citation omitted).          As suggested,\n\n\"the    question   of   whether   the   violation   extended   beyond   the\n\neffective date of [the statute is] one that ha[s] to be resolved by\n\nthe jury.\"     United States v. Tykarsky, 446 F.3d 458, 480 (3d Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n            Appellants contend that the district court should have\n\nissued instructions informing the jury that it must find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt that the bank fraud and the conspiracy to commit\n\nsuch fraud continued past October 12, 1984.         In the absence of such\n\n\n       32\n        We have held that conspiracy is \"often a continuing\noffense,\" United States v. Welch, 15 F.3d 1202, 1207 (1st Cir.\n1993), and, in the context of determining venue, we have\nacknowledged that \"[b]ank fraud is also a continuing offense,\"\nUnited States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 36 (1st Cir. 2001). The other\ncircuits that have considered the issue generally have agreed that\nboth conspiracy and bank fraud are continuing offenses. See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Lemmon, 372 F.3d 535, 541 n.8 (3d Cir.\n2004)(conspiracy); United States v. Nash, 115 F.3d 1431, 1440-41\n(9th Cir. 1997)(bank fraud); United States v. Duncan, 42 F.3d 97,\n104 (2d Cir. 1994)(bank fraud and conspiracy).          Under the\ncircumstances present here, there is no question that the\nconspiracy and bank fraud charges reflect continuing offenses.\n\n                                   -60-\n\fan instruction, they argue, the jury's verdict was ambiguous\n\nbecause it could have been premised exclusively on conduct that\n\noccurred prior to the date of enactment. Under such circumstances,\n\na conviction either for bank fraud or conspiracy to commit bank\n\nfraud would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.\n\n          Appellants failed to raise the possibility of an ex post\n\nfacto violation at any time prior to or during trial, including in\n\ntheir proposed jury instructions.     They also failed to raise the\n\nissue in their post-trial Rule 29 motions. In their pre-sentencing\n\nbriefs, they argued for the first time that their convictions\n\nshould be vacated on ex post facto grounds.     The district court\n\nrejected the claim.33\n\n          An unpreserved ex post facto claim is subject to plain\n\nerror review.   See, e.g., Tykarsky, 446 F.3d at 479; United States\n\nv. Julian, 427 F.3d 471, 481 (7th Cir. 2005).    Under such review,\n\nan appellant must show: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was\n\nclear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"    United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n     33\n       The court applied plain error review, finding that: (1) the\noverwhelming weight of the evidence established bank fraud\ncontinuing beyond the date § 1344 was enacted; (2) the conspiracy\nstatute, § 371, was valid prior to any of the conduct alleged; and\n(3) the jury's conviction on the misapplication counts occurring in\n1986 substantiated a finding of culpable conduct continuing beyond\nthe date § 1344 was enacted.\n\n                               -61-\n\f            In its brief, the government agrees that the district\n\ncourt should have issued an instruction that the jury must find\n\nthat the conduct continued past the enactment date of the bank\n\nfraud statute.      Its position is consistent with recent circuit\n\ncourt   decisions    holding   that   the   failure   to    issue   such   an\n\ninstruction satisfies the first two prongs of the plain error\n\nanalysis by establishing that an error occurred that was obvious.\n\nSee Tykarsky, 446 F.3d at 479-80 (\"[B]ecause the communications\n\nspanned two different versions of the statute with different\n\nminimum penalties, the question of whether the violation extended\n\nbeyond the effective date of the amended version was one that had\n\nto be resolved by the jury . . . . We also conclude that the error\n\nin not requiring a special jury finding was 'plain' in that it was\n\nan obvious mistake in retrospect.\"); Julian, 427 F.3d at 482 (\"This\n\nwas a plain error in the sense of being an obvious mistake in\n\nretrospect.\").      Thus, our task is to determine whether this error\n\naffected appellants' substantial rights, and, if so, whether the\n\nfairness,    integrity    or   public    reputation    of    the    judicial\n\nproceedings was impaired.\n\n            The other circuits have taken varying approaches to\n\napplying these prongs of the plain error test in assessing a\n\nclaimed ex post facto violation.         In United States v. Calabrese,\n\n825 F.2d 1342, 1346 (9th Cir. 1987), the Ninth Circuit held that\n\nthe \"jury's verdict represents a finding that a crime was committed\n\n\n                                  -62-\n\fas alleged in the indictment.\"             Because the indictment alleged an\n\noffense that continued past the date of enactment, the court\n\nconcluded that there was no plain error in the court's failure to\n\nissue an instruction.        Id.\n\n           The Fifth Circuit has examined the record to see whether\n\nthe bulk of the evidence occurred after the enactment of the\n\nstatute.   In United States v. Todd, 735 F.2d 146 (5th Cir. 1984),\n\nthat court held that where \"[m]ost of the evidence focused on\n\nevents that occurred within the effective date of the amendments,\"\n\nand \"the record . . . clearly establishes violations of the amended\n\nact by the appellants during the relevant time period,\" the failure\n\nto give the jury instruction did not \"result in the likelihood of\n\na grave miscarriage of justice or circumstances that seriously\n\naffect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.\"      Id. at 150.\n\n           The Second and Third Circuits have adopted an approach in\n\nwhich   prejudice     is    established          if    there   was      a    reasonable\n\npossibility that the jury convicted appellant on the basis of pre-\n\nenactment conduct.         In Tykarsky, for example, the Third Circuit\n\nexplained that a district court's failure to issue an instruction\n\nmeans   that   a   defendant       \"has    been       prejudiced   if       there   is   a\n\nreasonable possibility that a jury, properly instructed on this\n\npoint, might have found [the defendant] guilty based exclusively on\n\nacts that occurred before the increased penalty took effect.\"                        446\n\n\n                                          -63-\n\fF.3d at 480.    The court noted that \"[t]he most that can be said\n\nhere is that it is improbable, rather than impossible, as a factual\n\nmatter, that the jury convicted Tykarsky exclusively on the basis\n\nof\" pre-enactment conduct, which was \"insufficient to persuade us\n\nthat [the defendant's] substantial rights were not affected.\"               Id.\n\nat 482.34    The court concluded that this prejudice \"tainted the\n\nintegrity and reputation of the judicial process\" and consequently\n\nvacated the defendant's sentence and remanded to the district\n\ncourt.    Id. at 483.\n\n            Finally, in Julian, the Seventh Circuit considered an\n\nalleged conspiracy and found, on the third prong of the plain error\n\nanalysis,   that   a    court's   failure   to   issue   an    ex   post   facto\n\ninstruction \"affected [the defendant's] substantial rights in the\n\nsense that it exposed him to a longer sentence.\"              427 F.3d at 482.\n\nIt then focused on the fourth prong, explaining that \"[i]f a jury,\n\n\n     34\n       The Third Circuit's holding is similar to that of the Second\nCircuit. See United States v. Harris, 79 F.3d 223, 229 (2d Cir.\n1996)(\"Because the [ ] statute is a continuing crime statute, we\nmust determine whether it was possible for the jury, following the\ndistrict court's instructions, to convict [the defendant]\nexclusively on pre-[ ]enactment conduct. After examining the jury\ninstructions, we think that such a scenario was impossible.\").\nAppellants also refer to United States v. Torres, 901 F.2d 205 (2d\nCir. 1990).     However, that case is distinguishable because\nappellants did raise a general ex post facto challenge before the\ndistrict court.    Id. at 228.     On appeal, the Second Circuit\ndiscussed plain error review but did not explicitly apply such\nreview. Id. It concluded only that \"it is inappropriate to impose\na mandatory life sentence upon [the defendants] where there was an\nex post facto violation in the instruction actually given, and the\ndefendants brought the general ex post facto question to the\nattention of the district court.\" Id. at 229.\n\n                                    -64-\n\fproperly instructed on this point, might have found that the\n\nconspiracy had come to an end before the increased penalty took\n\neffect or that [defendant] had withdrawn from the conspiracy before\n\nthat date, then the error is one that implicates the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of the judicial process.\"              Id.    It\n\nconcluded that a reasonable jury could not have found that the\n\nconspiracy at issue ended prior to the enactment date of the\n\nstatute.    Id. at 483.\n\n            Ultimately, we need not settle on a rule here. The plain\n\nerror analysis used by the Second and Third Circuits is most\n\nfavorable to defendants because it requires a finding of prejudice\n\nif there was a \"reasonable possibility\" that the jury convicted\n\nappellants solely on the basis of pre-enactment conduct.                Here,\n\neven under that test, appellants cannot demonstrate an ex post\n\nfacto violation because no reasonable jury would have convicted\n\nappellants based exclusively on conduct that occurred prior to the\n\nenactment    date.    Moreover,   even        if   we   were   to   apply    the\n\n\"miscarriage of justice\" approach of the Seventh Circuit, we would\n\nconclude there was no miscarriage of justice here because the\n\ngovernment presented so much evidence of the involvement of the\n\ndefendants in the ongoing conspiracy and bank fraud following the\n\nenactment of the bank fraud statute in 1984.\n\n            As the district court correctly noted, the government\n\npresented    overwhelming   evidence     of    appellants'     conduct,      the\n\n\n                                  -65-\n\fmajority of which occurred after October 12, 1984.         Relatively few\n\nof the overt acts for any of the charges alleged in the indictment\n\noccurred prior to October 12, 1984:        only twelve of fifty-eight\n\novert acts on the charges of conspiracy and bank fraud with respect\n\nto the Gutiérrez loans, and only ten of forty-seven acts on the\n\ncharges of conspiracy and bank fraud with respect to the Mirandes\n\nloans.    The    government   presented     considerable     evidence   of\n\nactivities occurring after October 12, 1984, including all of the\n\ntransactions    involving   the   Los   Mameyes   project,   all   of   the\n\ntransactions involving the Jardines de Villa Alba project, and many\n\nof the transactions involving the Reparto Valenciano project.           The\n\nDenby letter, which contained several material misrepresentations,\n\nwas not signed until 1987.        Indeed, the bulk of our sufficiency\n\nanalysis details conduct occurring after the enactment date.            See\n\nSection III, supra.\n\n          Moreover, we find nothing to differentiate appellants'\n\npre-enactment conduct from subsequent conduct.         The government's\n\nkey witnesses — Lugo, Mirandes, Enriquez, Somohano and Kareh —\n\ntestified to conduct that occurred both before and after the\n\nenactment date.     Given that the testimony of these witnesses\n\nspanned the enactment date, we find it implausible that the jury\n\nwould find such testimony compelling only for events that occurred\n\nprior to October 12, 1984.        Similarly, no transformative event\n\noccurred prior to October 12, 1984 that would alter a reasonable\n\n\n                                   -66-\n\fjury's perception of the nature of any appellant's involvement.\n\nAlthough appellant Gutiérrez protests that he sold his construction\n\nloans with Caguas on October 29, 1984, and sold Modules on December\n\n31, 1985, it is uncontested that he and Umpierre-Hernández remained\n\nemployed by the company, and the record contains evidence that\n\ntheir culpable conduct (such as submitting certifications for\n\nincomplete work) continued uninterrupted after the sale of the\n\ncompany.\n\n            Because we see no reason to differentiate the conduct\n\noccurring prior to the enactment date, we find that a reasonable\n\njury would not have convicted the appellants based solely on pre-\n\nenactment conduct.      Thus, appellants were not prejudiced, nor did\n\ntheir convictions implicate the fairness or integrity of the\n\njudicial process.       We conclude that there is no plain error from\n\nthe absence of a limiting instruction on the ex post facto issue.\n\nC. Pre-Indictment and Pre-Trial Delay\n\n            Appellants    argue   that    the   district    court   erred    in\n\nrefusing to dismiss on the grounds that (1) the five-year pre-\n\nindictment delay violated their Fifth Amendment right to due\n\nprocess, and (2) the five-year pre-trial delay violated their Sixth\n\nAmendment right to a speedy trial.        We review both claims for abuse\n\nof discretion.     United States v. Picciandra, 788 F.2d 39, 43 (1st\n\nCir. 1986)(\"[T]he district court did not abuse its discretion in\n\nholding    that   the   pre-indictment    delays   did     not   violate    the\n\n\n                                   -67-\n\fdefendants' fifth amendment rights of due process.\"); United States\n\nv. Salimonu, 182 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir. 1997)(\"This circuit reviews\n\na district court's ruling on a Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim\n\nfor abuse of discretion.\").\n\n           1. Pre-Indictment Delay\n\n           In United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783 (1977), the\n\nSupreme Court noted that \"statutes of limitations, which provide\n\npredictable, legislatively enacted limits on prosecutorial delay,\n\nprovide the primary guarantee[] against bringing overly stale\n\ncriminal charges.\"      Id. at 789 (citations and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted). However, the Court also acknowledged that \"the Due\n\nProcess Clause has a limited role to play in protecting against\n\noppressive delay.\"       Id.    A prosecutor is not obliged to file\n\ncharges as soon as probable cause exists, id. at 791, and has \"wide\n\ndiscretion\" in delaying indictment \"limited only by the requirement\n\nthat it not violate those 'fundamental conceptions of justice which\n\nlie at the base of our civil and political institutions,'\"              United\n\nStates v. Ciampaglia, 628 F.2d 632, 639 (1st Cir. 1980)(quoting\n\nLovasco,   431   U.S.   at   790).    To    show   a   violation   of   \"those\n\n'fundamental conceptions of justice' a defendant must prove that\n\n(1) pre-indictment delay caused substantial prejudice to his right\n\nto a fair trial and, (2) the Government intentionally delayed\n\nindictment in order to gain a tactical advantage over the accused.\"\n\nPicciandra, 788 F.2d at 42 (citation omitted).              With respect to\n\n\n                                     -68-\n\fprejudice, a defendant must do more than allege that witnesses'\n\nmemories had faded or that evidence had been lost that might have\n\nbeen helpful to him.       United States v. Lieberman, 608 F.2d 889, 902\n\n(1st Cir. 1979).\n\n              Appellants have failed to meet that burden here.               They\n\nassert that they suffered prejudice from the unavailability of\n\nnineteen potential defense witnesses.35             However, we find that the\n\nunavailability      of    these    nineteen      individuals   did   not   impair\n\nappellants' defense, either because appellants could have, but did\n\nnot, obtain testimony from similarly situated individuals who were\n\navailable to testify; or because appellants failed to demonstrate\n\nthat    the   testimony    of     these    individuals   would   have   included\n\nexculpatory evidence.\n\n              Of the nineteen unavailable witnesses, appellants contend\n\nthat the deaths of two individuals — Phillip Saffold and Luis Dorta\n\n— prevented cross-examination relating to reports these witnesses\n\nprepared.      Saffold was an investigator who authored reports that\n\nappellants claim would have allowed them to impeach Roman Cruz, a\n\nplant manager who testified that buildings were not built at the\n\nModules plant; however, Cruz's testimony was a minor part of the\n\ngovernment's case against appellants and appellants' inability to\n\nimpeach Cruz did not significantly prejudice them.                   Similarly,\n\n\n\n       35\n       Of these nineteen unavailable witnesses, fifteen had died,\nthree were seriously ill, and one could not be located.\n\n                                          -69-\n\fDorta inspected the Transglobe and Modules sites and prepared\n\nreports that were admitted at trial; appellants emphasize that his\n\ndeath prevented them from cross-examining him, but do not specify\n\nhow this opportunity would have helped their case.\n\n              Appellants claim that nine other unavailable witnesses\n\n(Gilberto Pol Segarra, Luis Acevedo Gonzalez, Jaime Sitiriche, Juan\n\nHernández, Celestino Seneriz, Pedro Bull Nater, Francisco Susoni\n\nLens, Jose Feliciano, and Rafael Toro Nazario) were members of the\n\nBoard who \"could have testified to the extent of the disclosures\n\nmade to the Board, in response to Lugo[]'s imprecise testimony.\"\n\nHowever, appellants offer no reason to believe that these Board\n\nmembers would have offered testimony contradictory to Lugo's.\n\nMoreover, appellants do not explain why they did not call as\n\nwitnesses     other   Board    members    who   were    available       to   testify\n\nthroughout the trial.\n\n              Finally, appellants contend that the remaining eight\n\nunavailable witnesses (Gilberto Mayo Aguayo, Nelson Soto Velasquez,\n\nStephen   P.    Radics,    Emil    de    Pentima,      Troy   Chapman,       Stanley\n\nOrenstein, Hugo Lopez, and Fernando Rivera) \"could have testified\"\n\nor   \"could    have   confirmed\"       information     relating    to    financial\n\npractices at Caguas, without offering any evidence that these\n\nindividuals     would,    in   fact,    have    been   able   to   provide      such\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -70-\n\f             Similarly, appellants protest the unavailability of three\n\nsets of documents: inspection reports, commercial loan files, and\n\nmiscellaneous Modules documents.                With respect to the first two\n\nsets of documents, however, appellants make no attempt to establish\n\nthat the reports disappeared after indictment but prior to trial.\n\nWith   respect      to    the   third,   appellants    claim   only   that   \"the\n\nunavailability of the Modules documents made it impossible to\n\nfairly cross examine [Transhore and Modules accountant Jorge]\n\nFabrigas\" and that, generally, the evidence might have allowed them\n\nto refresh witness recollection and corroborate their defense.\n\nHowever, Fabrigas' testimony was a minor part of the trial, and\n\nthese generalized objections do not establish prejudice resulting\n\nfrom an impaired defense.\n\n             Even    if    appellants    had    demonstrated   some   degree   of\n\nprejudice from the delay, they have made no concomitant showing\n\nthat   the   government         intentionally    delayed   indictment   to   gain\n\ntactical advantage.         Thus, we conclude that the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying their motion to dismiss for\n\npre-indictment delay.\n\n             2. Pre-Trial Delay\n\n             The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy and public trial\n\nattaches upon arrest or indictment, whichever occurs first. United\n\nStates v. MacDonald, 456 U.S. 1, 6-7 (1982).               Thus, the time frame\n\nrelevant to appellants' claim extends from the date of indictment,\n\n\n                                         -71-\n\fNovember 22, 1995, until the date of trial, January 29, 2001 — a\n\nspan of over five years.    We note that appellants do not raise a\n\nclaim under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161, and thus their\n\nclaim is based exclusively on constitutional rather than statutory\n\ngrounds.\n\n           In Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), the Supreme\n\nCourt established a four-part balancing test to determine whether\n\na defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial has been\n\nviolated. Under Barker, a court should consider: (1) the length of\n\nthe delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the defendant's\n\nassertion of his speedy trial right; and (4) the prejudice to the\n\ndefendant caused by the delay.      Id. at 530.       However, the Court\n\nidentified the first factor, the length of the delay, as \"to some\n\nextent a triggering mechanism.     Until there is some delay which is\n\npresumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into\n\nthe other factors that go into the balance.\"         Id.    The Court also\n\nhas indicated that post-accusation delay approaching one year is\n\npresumptively prejudicial. Doggett v. United States, 505 U.S. 647,\n\n652 n.1 (1992).   Consequently, the five-and-a-half year delay in\n\nthis case creates a presumption of prejudice.\n\n           Under Barker, we must then consider the remaining three\n\nfactors.   We have described the second factor, the reasons for the\n\ndelay, as \"'the focal inquiry.'\"         See, e.g., United States v.\n\nSantiago-Becerril,   130   F.3d   11,    22   (1st   Cir.   1997)(citation\n\n\n                                  -72-\n\fomitted).    Here, there are two main reasons for the pre-trial\n\ndelay.      First,   the   appellants    filed   numerous   requests   for\n\ncontinuances, some of which the district court granted, as well as\n\nmany motions requiring time and consideration by the district\n\ncourt.36 Second, two days before the trial was originally scheduled\n\nto begin on May 26, 1998, the government filed a motion to\n\ndisqualify the trial judge assigned to the case on the ground that\n\nshe had a banking relationship with Caguas that might prejudice her\n\nin the trial of the case. The district court originally denied the\n\nmotion to disqualify and the government sought mandamus from this\n\ncourt.    We denied mandamus, but noted that \"the judge would have\n\nbeen well-advised either to bow out of the case or to ask that the\n\nrecusal motion be assigned to a different judge for hearing\" and\n\nthat \"the government hardly can be faulted for bringing\" the\n\nmotion.   In re United States, 158 F.3d 26, 33-34 (1st Cir. 1998).37\n\n\n     36\n        For example, on August 27, 1997, Muñoz-Franco filed\nseventeen separate motions, including one entitled \"Motion\nRequesting Order Concerning Additional Motions.\"   Similarly, on\nMarch 24, 1998, Gutiérrez filed what the district court termed a\n\"deluge\" of \"ten separate and distinct motions of varying\ncomplexity.\"\n     37\n       Appellants imply that the government acted in bad faith by\nwaiting to file the recusal motion until immediately prior to\ntrial.   However, the government explains that it did not learn\nabout the banking relationship until one year prior to trial, and\nwas delayed in learning the details of the relationship due to\nresistance to the subpoenas it filed.     In fact, the government\nstill had not been able to obtain some of the documents it\nrequested by the time it filed the recusal motion. In light of\nthis explanation, and the fact that appellants produced no evidence\nof bad faith on the part of the government below, we still have no\n\n                                  -73-\n\fThe   trial    judge   assigned    to   the   case    then   recused   herself\n\nvoluntarily,      resulting   in    a   delay    in    the   proceedings      of\n\napproximately one year.       In sum, the pre-trial delay arose largely\n\nfrom the complexity of the case and the events related to the\n\nrecusal.\n\n              The third Barker factor weighs in favor of appellants.\n\nThey raised their speedy trial objection three times during the\n\nproceedings below, and now renew that objection.\n\n              The Supreme Court has held that the final Barker factor\n\n— prejudice to appellants — \"should be assessed in the light of the\n\ninterests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed\n\nto protect.\"     Barker, 407 U.S. at 532.       The Court identified three\n\nsuch interests: \"(i) to protect oppressive pretrial incarceration;\n\n(ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to\n\nlimit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\"              Id.   The\n\nfirst of these interests has no bearing here because appellants\n\nremained free prior to trial. With respect to the second interest,\n\n\"considerable anxiety normally attends the initiation and pendency\n\nof criminal charges; hence only 'undue pressures' are considered.\"\n\nSantiago-Becerril, 130 F.3d at 23 (citations omitted).            Appellants\n\nallege no such \"undue pressure,\" and therefore we assign negligible\n\nweight to this interest.           Finally, in our discussion of pre-\n\nindictment delay, we have already analyzed appellants' arguments\n\n\nbasis for questioning the government's explanation.\n\n                                    -74-\n\fthat their defense was impaired.        These arguments are equally\n\napplicable to the pre-trial time frame, and we find no material\n\nprejudice resulting from the delay.38\n\n          The five years that elapsed between indictment and trial\n\nis a troublesome length of time.      Nonetheless, our inquiry has\n\nrevealed no constitutional violation.    Thus, after considering the\n\nfactors listed in Barker, we conclude that the district court did\n\nnot abuse its discretion in denying appellants' motion to dismiss\n\nfor pre-trial delay.\n\n                                V.\n\n          Appellants also raise several challenges to evidence they\n\ncontend was improperly admitted.   We address these claims in turn.\n\nA. Evidence Regarding Loss\n\n          Appellants challenge three aspects of the admission and\n\ntreatment of evidence regarding financial loss to Caguas.    First,\n\nthey protest that such evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial in\n\nviolation of Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Second, they argue more\n\nspecifically that the government's Exhibit 40, aspects of which\n\nwere later shown to be inaccurate, was erroneously admitted.\n\n\n\n     38\n        We note that, of the nineteen unavailable witnesses that\nappellants name in their brief, five of these witnesses (Hugo\nLopez, Celestino Seneriz, Pedro Bull Nater, Francisco Susoni Lens,\nand Jose Feliciano) died prior to indictment and, consequently,\ntheir unavailability does not implicate the Sixth Amendment\nanalysis under Barker. See MacDonald, 456 U.S. at 7 (\"[N]o Sixth\nAmendment right to a speedy trial arises until charges are\npending.\").\n\n                               -75-\n\fFinally, they argue that, even if evidence of loss and Exhibit 40\n\nwere properly admitted, the district court erred in refusing to\n\nguide the jury with an instruction about the enactment of the\n\nFinancial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of\n\n1989 (\"FIRREA\"), Pub. L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (codified in\n\nscattered sections of 12 U.S.C.).\n\n           1. General Evidence of Loss\n\n           We review evidentiary rulings on relevance and unfair\n\nprejudice for abuse of discretion.             United States v. Richardson,\n\n421 F.3d 17, 37-38 (1st Cir. 2005).            Loss is not an element of bank\n\nfraud.    United States v. Blasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d 57, 65 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).      However, courts have held repeatedly that loss is\n\nrelevant in fraud cases to demonstrate a defendant's knowledge or\n\nintent to commit fraud.        See, e.g., United States v. Heimann, 705\n\nF.2d 662, 669 (2d Cir. 1983)(\"While technically the success or\n\nfailure of a scheme to defraud is irrelevant in a mail fraud case,\n\nrealistically, when the contested issue is intent, whether or not\n\nvictims   lost   money   can   be   a    substantial    factor   in   a   jury's\n\ndetermination of guilt or innocence.\" (citation omitted)).                 Thus,\n\nwhile \"an ultimate purpose of either causing some financial loss to\n\nanother or bringing about some financial gain to oneself is not the\n\nessence of fraudulent intent,\" United States v. Kenrick, 221 F.3d\n\n19, 29 (1st Cir. 2000)(citation and internal quotation marks\n\n\n\n\n                                        -76-\n\fomitted), the knowledge that one's actions are, in fact, bringing\n\nabout such losses may demonstrate one's intent to commit fraud.\n\n          In this case, the government referred to loss throughout\n\nthe trial to demonstrate appellants' knowledge of the consequences\n\nof their ongoing practices of using loan proceeds to make principal\n\nand interest payments on unrelated loans, authorizing disbursements\n\nfor work not completed, and using funds for purposes not authorized\n\nby the Board.     For example, during its opening statement and\n\nclosing argument, the government noted that federal regulators\n\nclosed Caguas in 1990 due to the bank's lack of funds.    On a few\n\noccasions, the government also questioned witnesses about the\n\namount of loss that certain projects sustained and whether those\n\nlosses would have caused concern.     However, these references did\n\nnot dominate the evidence because the government also presented\n\nconsiderable other evidence of defendants' conduct, as we have\n\ndiscussed at length in Section III, supra.   Moreover, the district\n\ncourt carefully managed the effect of evidence relating to loss on\n\nthe jury by preventing both parties from addressing loss in their\n\nclosing arguments and instructing the jury that loss was not an\n\nelement of the offenses charged.      Finally, the court permitted\n\nappellants to cross-examine vigorously the government witnesses who\n\ndiscussed loss.\n\n          In sum, the general references to loss were relevant as\n\na means of demonstrating appellants' intent to defraud Caguas, and,\n\n\n                               -77-\n\fgiven the carefully limited presentation of this evidence to the\n\njury, were not unduly prejudicial.              The district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.\n\n            2. Exhibit 40\n\n            Following    Caguas'    closure      in   1990,    Banco    Santander\n\nacquired many of its assets, and prepared a document — government\n\nExhibit 40 — listing hundreds of Caguas' loans, the outstanding\n\nbalances on those loans, Banco Santander's valuation of the loans,\n\nand the resulting discount (the difference between the outstanding\n\nbalance of the loan and the loan's value).                    At trial, Banco\n\nSantander's comptroller attested that the bank had acquired all of\n\nthe loans summarized in Exhibit 40, and the exhibit served as part\n\nof the basis for expert testimony regarding accounting practices by\n\nKathy McKinless, a partner at an accounting firm.               By the time of\n\nsentencing, however, the government discovered that the Resolution\n\nTrust Company (\"RTC\"), a government-owned asset management company,\n\nhad retained many of the loans.                Thus, the exhibit could not\n\nactually have reflected valuations of the loans made by Banco\n\nSantander    upon     purchase,    and   was    not   a     reliable    means     of\n\nestablishing the magnitude of the loss experienced by Caguas.\n\n            Appellants     now    contend      that   Exhibit    40     was      both\n\ntestimonial, in violation of the Confrontation Clause, and that the\n\nexhibit   was   improperly       admitted    under    the    Federal     Rules    of\n\nEvidence.       The    government's      acknowledgment       that     Exhibit    40\n\n\n                                      -78-\n\fcontained inaccurate information indicates that the exhibit should\n\nhave been excluded on that basis alone.            However, we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that any error in its admission was harmless. Under\n\nFahy v. Connecticut, 375 U.S. 85, 86-87 (1963), the critical\n\nquestion    in    assessing    harmless    error    is     \"whether   there      is    a\n\nreasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have\n\ncontributed to the conviction.\"\n\n            Several     circumstances          indicate     that    there     is      no\n\nreasonable       possibility    that    Exhibit     40     contributed      to     the\n\nconvictions here.       First, the exhibit was relevant only to prove\n\nappellants'      fraudulent     intent,    and     the     government     presented\n\nconsiderable evidence of this intent from other sources.                    Second,\n\nthe court explicitly instructed the jury that loss was not an\n\nelement of bank fraud.          Third, the exhibit was the subject of\n\ndirect examination for less than one-half of one day of a trial\n\nspanning    fifteen     months.        Fourth,    defense       counsel   subjected\n\nMcKinless to searching cross-examination regarding the exhibit,\n\nrevealing     several    typographical         errors     and   inaccuracies       and\n\neliciting McKinless' acknowledgment that she could not confirm the\n\ndocument's completeness. Finally, even if the loss calculations in\n\nExhibit 40 were not entirely accurate, other evidence at trial\n\ndemonstrated that Caguas suffered large losses on many of the loans\n\nat issue.    To some extent, the Exhibit 40 calculations replicated\n\nevidence already in the record.           Taking into account all of these\n\n\n                                        -79-\n\fcircumstances, there is no reasonable possibility that the isolated\n\nuse   of    Exhibit     40   could   have      contributed    to   appellants'\n\nconvictions, and thus any error in its admission was harmless.\n\n            3. Jury Instruction on Loss\n\n            Appellants also challenge the district court's refusal to\n\ngive an instruction explaining that, when FIRREA was enacted in\n\n1989, \"many institutions immediately fell out of compliance with\n\nregulatory capital requirements, making them subject to seizure by\n\nthrift regulators.\"      United States v. Winstar Corp., 518 U.S. 839,\n\n857-58 (1996).        Appellants contend that, given the admission of\n\nevidence relating to financial loss, the jury should have been\n\ninstructed that bank failures were common in the aftermath of\n\nFIRREA's enactment. In other words, the jury should have been told\n\nthat banks commonly lost money in the absence of fraud.\n\n            A district court's refusal to issue a jury instruction\n\n\"'constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction\n\nwas   (1)   correct     as   a   matter   of    substantive    law,   (2)   not\n\nsubstantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3)\n\nintegral to an important point in the case.'\"           White v. N.H. Dep't\n\nof Corrs., 221 F.3d 254, 263-64 (1st Cir. 2000)(citation omitted).\n\nNo such error occurred here.              The FIRREA instruction was not\n\nintegral to an important point in the case because loss is not an\n\nelement of bank fraud.       Moreover, the jury was instructed that the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -80-\n\fgovernment need not prove loss.           Thus, we find no reversible error\n\nin the distrct court's decision.\n\nB. Forgery and Check-Kiting Evidence\n\n            Appellants        assert   that     the   admission    of      evidence\n\nregarding forged signatures on checks and evidence of a check-\n\nkiting   scheme        constructively     amended      the    indictment.          A\n\nconstructive amendment occurs “‘when the charging terms of the\n\nindictment are altered’ at trial so that they are different from\n\nthose handed up by the grand jury.”              United States v. Rodriguez,\n\n215 F.3d 110, 118 (1st Cir. 2000)(quoting United States v. Portela,\n\n167 F.3d 687, 701 (1st Cir. 1999)).               Appellants also argue that\n\nthis evidence constituted an improper variance from the indictment.\n\nA variance occurs when the proof differs from the indictment's\n\nallegations,     and    \"is    material   and    reversible    only   if    it    has\n\naffected the defendant's 'substantial rights': to be informed of\n\nthe charges; and to prevent a second prosecution for the same\n\noffense.\"    United States v. Vavlitis, 9 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)(citation omitted).\n\n            At   trial,       the   government    introduced      evidence       that\n\nnumerous checks issued by Caguas and made payable jointly to\n\nGutiérrez companies and third party contractors were deposited in\n\nthe accounts of the Gutiérrez companies after the contractor's\n\n\n\n\n                                       -81-\n\fendorsement was fraudulently added to the checks.39                   The government\n\nelicited this testimony as evidence of appellants' intent to\n\ndefraud the bank.\n\n                The district court addressed the forgery evidence in an\n\norder denying appellants' motion to exclude it.                      The court found\n\nthat such evidence caused neither a constructive amendment nor a\n\nvariance, explaining that, \"[s]ince some of the checks issued by\n\nCaguas [that were ultimately used to make payments on failing\n\nloans] were jointly issued to innocent third party payees, these\n\npayees' endorsement would have been required before the checks\n\ncould        actually   be   cashed     or   deposited   in    the   bank.\"    Since\n\n\"disbursement of the funds could not be completed until the checks\n\nwere     cashed    .    .    .   in   some    cases   forged   endorsements    would\n\nnecessarily be required.\"              The court concluded that, rather than\n\nconstructively amending or varying the indictment, the forged\n\nendorsements were direct evidence of one component of appellants'\n\nscheme.        Finally, to foreclose any possibility that the jury would\n\nconvict appellants based on the forgery evidence, the court issued\n\nthorough instructions regarding the elements of bank fraud and\n\n\n\n        39\n       For example, the government elicited testimony from Luis\nGarate, the former vice president of Bermudez and Longo, Inc., a\nconstruction contractor in electrical and building mechanics.\nBermudez and Longo worked with the Gutiérrez company Transglobe on\nthe Modules project. Garate testified that he did not recognize\nthe endorsements on fifteen checks, totalling over $67,000, that\nwere issued by Caguas and made payable jointly to Transglobe and\nBermudez and Longo.\n\n                                             -82-\n\fconspiracy as well as an instruction specifically tailored to the\n\nevidence of forgery:       \"You have heard evidence about checks with\n\nallegedly forged endorsements. The crime of forgery is not charged\n\n. . . .    The fact that endorsements may be forged may only be used\n\nto assist you, as you may find useful, in your evaluation of all\n\nthe evidence in the case . . . .\"40\n\n            The district court's order accurately assesses the value\n\nof the forgery evidence, and the admission of such evidence did not\n\nconstructively amend the indictment or result in a variance.             We\n\nfurther conclude that its instruction was more than sufficient to\n\ninform the jury of the proper role of that evidence.\n\n            We   view   the   check-kiting   evidence    similarly.      The\n\ndisputed evidence consisted of testimony from Somohano (the vice\n\npresident of Caguas' commercial loan department) that in 1983 he\n\ndetected     a   check-kiting       scheme   involving    two      Gutiérrez\n\ncorporations' accounts at Caguas and Banco de Ponce.                When he\n\ninformed    Muñoz-Franco      and   Sánchez-Arán,   Muñoz-Franco    scolded\n\nSomohano and denied that check-kiting was occurring.               Somohano\n\nfurther testified that Sánchez-Arán continued to honor the checks\n\nsent to Caguas even after Banco de Ponce stopped honoring checks\n\n\n     40\n         Appellants did not object to the instruction, and\nconsequently the objections to the instruction that they raise on\nappeal are reviewable only for plain error. See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n30(d)(\"A party who objects to any portion of the instructions or to\na failure to give a requested instruction must inform the court .\n. . before the jury retires to deliberate.\"). We see no such error\nin the clear instruction issued here.\n\n                                     -83-\n\fdeposited with them.          The check-kiting continued, resulting in\n\noverdrafts of more than $900,000 on the Gutiérrez-owned companies'\n\naccounts at Caguas.        This overdraft ultimately was converted into\n\na loan.\n\n            The    district    court    did    not    err   in    admitting    this\n\nevidence.       The reactions of Muñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán when\n\nSomohano told them about the check-kiting scheme demonstrate both\n\ntheir goal of preserving the Gutiérrez-owned companies' financial\n\nstatus    and     the   preferential    treatment       that     these   companies\n\nreceived.       This evidence was directly relevant to the charges of\n\nbank fraud and conspiracy, and was not outside the scope of the\n\noriginal indictment.          Thus, we conclude that no constructive\n\namendment or improper variance occurred.\n\nC. Evidence of Civil and Regulatory Violations\n\n            Appellants      also   protest       that    the     district     court\n\nimproperly      admitted   evidence    of     civil   and   regulatory      banking\n\nviolations.      Again, we review this evidentiary ruling for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.      Richardson, 421 F.3d at 37-38.\n\n            Evidence of civil or regulatory violations is admissible\n\nso long as \"the evidence is not presented in such a way that the\n\njury's attention is focused on the civil violations rather than the\n\ncriminal ones.\" United States v. Stefan, 784 F.2d 1093, 1098 (11th\n\nCir. 1986).       The concern is that such evidence could create an\n\n\"alternative standard of guilt.\"              United States v. Christo, 614\n\n\n                                       -84-\n\fF.2d 486, 491 (5th Cir. 1980)(prohibiting the introduction of civil\n\nbanking statutory violations solely for the purpose of proving\n\ncriminal misapplication).\n\n              Courts have allowed the introduction of evidence of civil\n\nand regulatory violations in a variety of situations.                      In United\n\nStates v. Devin, 918 F.2d 280, 287 (1st Cir. 1990), we found no\n\nabuse   of    discretion      in   a    district   court's    decision     to   allow\n\nevidence      of   violations      of    police    department    regulations       to\n\ndemonstrate the knowledge and intent of a police officer charged\n\nwith RICO violations and attempted extortion.                  We explained that\n\n\"[s]uch      evidence   was    unquestionably       helpful     to   the    jury   in\n\ndetermining whether . . . [the officer] was willing to disregard\n\nhis sworn obligations and accept things of value which influenced\n\nhis performance of official duties.\"               Id.   Similarly, in Stefan,\n\nthe district court permitted the government to introduce testimony\n\nregarding violations of a civil regulatory banking statute and\n\ncharts illustrating how certain loans at issue contravened the\n\nstatute.     It also allowed the government to refer to the statutory\n\nviolations in its opening statement and closing argument, and even\n\n\"focused the jury's attention\" on the statute in the instructions.\n\n784 F.2d at 1097.       On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found that the\n\ndefendant's scheme included efforts to avoid this statute, and that\n\nthe district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in\n\nadmitting such evidence to help the jury understand the scheme. In\n\n\n                                          -85-\n\fboth    of   these   cases,   the      courts   placed    emphasis     on     a    jury\n\ninstruction which made clear that civil or regulatory violations\n\ndid not equate to criminal conduct.               See Devin, 918 F.2d at 288\n\nn.9; Stefan, 784 F.2d at 1099.41\n\n             Here, the court allowed the government to introduce\n\nevidence     that    defendants     violated    certain    regulations        of    the\n\nFederal Home Loan Bank to provide context for their actions and to\n\nestablish their knowledge of the impropriety of their activities.\n\nAlthough such evidence was discussed from time to time, it was not\n\ncentral to the government's case, as our lengthy discussion of the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence demonstrates, see Section III, supra.\n\n             Moreover,      the   district      court     issued       a    limiting\n\ninstruction     on    the   use   of   evidence    of    civil   and       regulatory\n\nviolations:\n\n                    You have heard testimony and evidence\n             that certain civil rules and/or regulations\n             which govern the conduct of banks may not have\n             been followed at times at Caguas.\n                    You are hereby instructed that a\n             violation   of   any  of   these   rules   and\n             regulations is not a crime in and of itself,\n             and is not determinative of a defendant's\n             guilt or innocence.\n                    The fact that certain civil rules and\n             regulations may have been violated at Caguas\n\n\n       41\n       For example, the instruction in Devin stated: \"[R]ules and\nregulations of the Boston Police Department were admitted into\nevidence in this case. And while they may be relevant in order to\nshow a guideline or a code of conduct to a particular job, the\ndefendant is not here because he violated a rule or regulation. He\nis charged here with violations of certain specific laws, not rules\nor regulations.\" 918 F.2d at 288.\n\n                                        -86-\n\f            may only be used by you to assist you, as you\n            may find useful, in determining a particular\n            defendant's motive or intent as to the crimes\n            charged in the third superseding indictment.\n\nThis    instruction   clearly    conveys       that    civil    and     regulatory\n\nviolations do not establish criminal culpability.                       Appellants\n\nprotest that the instruction exacerbated the problem because the\n\nreference to \"the fact that certain rules and regulations may have\n\nbeen violated\" improperly suggested that such rules and regulations\n\nhad been violated.     However, we see no such suggestion because the\n\nphrase \"may have been violated\" makes clear to the jury that, if it\n\nfound   that   such   violations      had    occurred,   it    could    use   those\n\nviolations as one piece of evidence in determining the ultimate\n\nquestion of criminal guilt or innocence.               Given this appropriate\n\nlimiting instruction, we find that the district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion by admitting evidence of regulatory violations to\n\nprovide context and to demonstrate appellants' knowledge of their\n\ncriminal conduct.\n\n                                       VI.\n\n            Appellants challenge other aspects of the proceedings\n\nagainst   them,   including     the    length     of   the     trial,    allegedly\n\ndisparaging and misleading statements by the prosecutor, the jury\n\ninstruction on misapplication, and alleged error in sentencing. We\n\nnow turn to these remaining issues.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -87-\n\fA. Length of Trial\n\n            Appellants argue that the sheer length of the trial and\n\nthe repetitive nature of the government's evidence denied them due\n\nprocess.    In denying appellants' motions for judgment of acquittal\n\non these grounds, the district court devoted more than ten pages of\n\nits seventy-seven page opinion to a thorough examination of this\n\nissue.     We largely agree with its analysis.      Thus, we merely\n\nsummarize its conclusions here and note only a few additional\n\npoints.\n\n            The trial lasted for fifteen months and the prosecution's\n\ncase lasted far longer than appellants' case.    However, appellants\n\nbore much of the responsibility for the length of the trial.    They\n\neither requested or agreed to several continuances after the trial\n\nbegan.42    In response to the jury's request that the trial occur\n\nfive days per week, they requested that trial occur only four days\n\nper week.    Moreover, much of the time devoted to the government's\n\ncase consisted of the vigorous and lengthy cross-examination to\n\nwhich the defense subjected government witnesses.    Finally, nearly\n\nall of the witnesses testified in Spanish and required the use of\n\n\n\n\n     42\n        In July 2001, the trial judge notified the parties that he\nhad a vacation scheduled for two weeks in September but stated that\nhe was \"willing to forego, if there is absolutely any objection\nfrom anyone,\" emphasizing that \"if [there] is any problem\nwhatsoever, be it a due process claim or some sort of mistrial, I\nwant to know now.\" Defense counsel responded that there was \"[n]o\nobjection whatsoever.\"\n\n                                 -88-\n\finterpreters, which contributed significantly to the length of the\n\ntrial.43\n\n           The government's presentation was not repetitive.            For\n\nexample, although Enriquez (the senior vice president of the\n\nmortgage department) and Kareh (the assistant vice president of the\n\nconstruction loan department) both testified at length about the\n\nsame projects, Kareh offered more detailed information about the\n\nloans themselves, while Enriquez provided insight into appellants'\n\nknowledge about the loans and whether appellants provided certain\n\ninformation   to   the   Board.   Although   appellants   can   point    to\n\ninstances in which the same story was told more than once, such\n\nrepetition often encompassed new and relevant details, and was not\n\nunduly frequent given the complexity of the violations alleged and\n\nthe length of the trial.\n\n           Finally, there is no indication that the length of the\n\ntrial and the arguably cumulative nature of the evidence affected\n\nthe outcome of the trial in any way.     In fact, the jury convicted\n\nthe four appellants while acquitting Enrique Gutiérrez on all\n\ncounts, which suggests that the jury was able to carefully weigh\n\nthe evidence against each defendant. See United States v. LiCausi,\n\n\n     43\n       Although procedures vary from trial to trial, questions from\nattorneys are usually translated into Spanish upon completion.\nWith respect to witness testimony, the interpreter typically\ninstructs the witness to pause every few sentences to allow\ntranslation of the testimony into English, and will stop the\nwitness if the witness does not remember to pause in giving a\nlonger answer.\n\n                                  -89-\n\f167 F.3d 36, 49 (1st Cir. 1999)(explaining that a jury's acquittal\n\nof one defendant on two counts indicates that it \"was not prevented\n\nfrom making reliable judgments about guilt or innocence\").                 Given\n\nappellants' failure to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the\n\nlength of the trial, we find no due process violation under these\n\ncircumstances.\n\nB. Prosecutorial Misconduct\n\n           Appellants      claim     that,   throughout    the    trial,     the\n\nprosecutor made disparaging and misleading comments that prejudiced\n\nthe jury against them and require us to vacate their convictions.\n\nThe district court denied motions for a mistrial on such grounds on\n\nat least six occasions.\n\n           We must first resolve the threshold question of whether\n\nthese comments were improper.         Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168,\n\n180-81 (1986).       If we answer that question in the affirmative, we\n\nmust   determine     whether   the   impropriety   warrants      vacating    the\n\nconvictions.    The issue is not whether \"'the prosecutors' remarks\n\nwere undesirable or even universally condemned'\"; rather, \"[t]he\n\nrelevant question is whether the prosecutors' comments 'so infected\n\nthe trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a\n\ndenial of due process.'\"         Id. at 181 (citations omitted).      We have\n\nheld   that    the    relevant     factors   include:     \"(1)   whether     the\n\nprosecutor's misconduct was isolated and/or deliberate; (2) whether\n\nthe trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary instruction;\n\n\n                                      -90-\n\fand (3) whether any prejudice surviving the court's instruction\n\nlikely could have affected the outcome of the case.\" United States\n\nv. Auch, 187 F.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir. 1999).                We may overturn the\n\nconvictions only if \"the prosecutor's misguided tactic . . . could\n\nhave affected the outcome of the trial.\"             Id. at 130.\n\n            1. Disparagement\n\n            Appellants first object to comments, made in the presence\n\nof the jury, that they term “disparagement.”                     For example, the\n\nprosecutor, on one occasion, stated that defense counsel “just lied\n\nto   the    court”     and      referred       to    his     statement      as   a\n\n“misrepresentation.” On another occasion, the prosecutor asked the\n\ncourt to “please direct [defense counsel] to refrain from his\n\noffensive odious comment that [has] characterized [ ] this trial,”\n\nconcluding, “I don’t think that I need to endure this sort of\n\ntreatment    from    him.”      On   several    occasions,        the   prosecutor\n\ninterrupted defense counsel’s objections with such comments as “say\n\nsomething new,” and “Improper question.               First year law school.\n\nImproper question.”\n\n            Such    comments    are    unfortunate         and    unprofessional.\n\nHowever, the trial was highly contentious, and the record reveals\n\nthat appellants' trial counsel made a number of similar comments.\n\nAlthough    such    exchanges    between     the    prosecution      and   defense\n\noccurred intermittently, their impact was diluted by the length of\n\nthe trial. Immediately following such exchanges, the court usually\n\n\n                                      -91-\n\fcommented on their inappropriateness.      For example, the court on\n\none occasion ordered “all counsel to measure their words, measure\n\ntheir conduct, and measure their civility towards each other,”\n\nnoting, “I have observed both sides step over the line.”            On\n\nanother occasion the court admonished counsel for improper comments\n\nand stated: “And by counsel I included both sides.      This is not an\n\nadmonition to one side or the other, both sides are included.”\n\nSuch statements from the court adequately informed the jury that\n\nsuch conduct was inappropriate and assigned blame equally to both\n\nsides.   Finally, any prejudice that resulted from the prosecutor’s\n\nrole in these exchanges and survived the court’s instruction could\n\nnot have influenced the outcome in this case because, as we\n\nexplained in Section III, supra, the evidence of appellants’ guilt\n\nwas overwhelming.    Thus, the prosecutor’s occasional remarks in\n\nthis long and contentious trial, although unfortunate, did not\n\ninfect the trial with such unfairness as to make the resulting\n\nconvictions a denial of due process.     Darden, 477 U.S. at 181.\n\n           2. Misleading Statements\n\n           Appellants   also   assert   that   the   prosecutors   made\n\nmisleading statements and referred to information outside the\n\nrecord. Many of appellants’ characterizations of the prosecution’s\n\npresentation are simply inaccurate.     For example, appellants claim\n\nthat the prosecutor falsely stated that Lugo (the Board president)\n\nhad testified that the Board was not told of Modules’ performance\n\n\n                                 -92-\n\fhistory, when Lugo had at most said he could not remember those\n\nstatements.   This claim is unsupported by the record.   Lugo in fact\n\ntestified:    “I don’t recall that it was discussed.   I believe that\n\nif it was discussed I would remember and it is not reflected in the\n\nminutes. . . . The best of my recollection is that it was not\n\ndiscussed.”     In another instance, appellants protest that the\n\nprosecutor improperly suggested to Joseph Gonzalez (an examiner for\n\nthe Federal Home Loan Bank) that bank management, rather than the\n\nBoard, was responsible for Caguas' lending practices, when in fact\n\nthe prosecutor only elicited testimony that the Board relied on\n\nMuñoz-Franco and Sánchez-Arán to provide information relevant to\n\nits decisions, and often accepted Muñoz-Franco's recommendations\n\nregarding these decisions.    Such comments were not improper, let\n\nalone prejudicial.\n\n          In other instances, even if we found the challenged\n\nstatements improper, any resulting prejudice was negated either by\n\nappellants' own cross-examination or by a curative instruction from\n\nthe district court.      For example, appellants assert that the\n\nprosecution elicited testimony from Montilla (the developer on the\n\nJardines de Villa Alba project) that Caguas sued him but then\n\ndismissed its claim, when in fact the bank settled with Montilla\n\nand obtained title to all but one of the Jardines de Villa Alba\n\n\n\n\n                                -93-\n\flots.44     However,     appellants      then    elicited    the    terms   of   the\n\nsettlement on cross-examination, remedying any prejudice.                         On\n\nanother occasion, the court addressed defense counsel’s allegations\n\nthat the prosecution's closing argument mentioned loans not charged\n\nin the indictment and mischaracterized Victor Kareh's testimony\n\nwith a detailed curative instruction.45\n\n            In    sum,   any    impact        resulting    from    these    alleged\n\nmisleading       statements     must     be    evaluated    in     light    of   the\n\noverwhelming evidence presented at this fifteen-month trial. Under\n\nsuch    circumstances,     we    again    conclude    that    the    prosecutor's\n\ncomments could not have caused unfairness that resulted in a denial\n\nof due process.\n\nC. Jury Instruction on Misapplication\n\n            Appellants argue that the jury instructions improperly\n\npermitted the jury to convict them on the misapplication charge if\n\nit found them merely reckless.           We review de novo a claim that the\n\n\n\n       44\n        Appellants did not object to this testimony at trial, and\nthus we review their claim only for plain error. See United States\nv. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).\n       45\n        The complete instruction spanned several pages of trial\ntranscript, but a representative paragraph will demonstrate the\nlevel of detail: \"You heard reference to the Coamo loan during the\ngovernment's closing argument and entries on the Coamo ledger card.\nBecause the Coamo loan is not part of the charges in this case I\ninstruct you to disregard the prosecutor's comment about the Coamo\nledger card as they refer specifically to the Coamo loan. You may\nconsider, in evaluating all the evidence, whether any payments from\nother loans were used or not used to make any payment in the Coamo\nloan.\"\n\n                                       -94-\n\fdistrict      court   erred    in   instructing     the    jury   on        the   intent\n\nnecessary to support a conviction.             United States v. Woodward, 149\n\nF.3d 46, 68-69 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n              The contested instruction stated that the government must\n\nprove beyond a reasonable doubt\n\n              that the defendants acted with the intent to\n              injure, defraud or deceive the bank. You may\n              also   consider   whether   defendants   acted\n              recklessly, that is, in reckless disregard of\n              the interests of the bank. If you find that\n              defendants acted recklessly, with respect to\n              the alleged misapplications, you may find that\n              the defendants acted with intent to injure,\n              defraud or deceive the bank.\n\nRelying on a Fifth Circuit case, United States v. Adamson, 700 F.2d\n\n953, 965 (5th Cir. 1983), appellants contend that, contrary to this\n\ninstruction,      reckless     behavior       is   insufficient        to    establish\n\nmisapplication under 18 U.S.C. § 657.46                   Contrary to the Fifth\n\nCircuit, however, we have specifically held that \"'the sine qua non\n\nof charges of willful misapplication of bank funds is action taken\n\nwith    the   knowledge   of     harm   to,    intent     to   harm,    or    reckless\n\ndisregard for, the financial health of the bank.'\"                     United States\n\nv.     Brennan,   994     F.2d      918,   923     (1st    Cir.    1993)(emphasis\n\n\n\n       46\n       In Adamson, the trial court instructed the jury: \"A reckless\ndisregard of the interest of the bank is the equivalent of intent\nto injure or defraud the bank.\" 700 F.2d at 965. In reversing the\nmisapplication conviction, the court held that, \"[i]n order to\nconvict a defendant for willfully misapplying funds with intent to\ninjure or defraud a bank, the government must prove that the\ndefendant knowingly participated in a deceptive or fraudulent\ntransaction.\" Id.\n\n                                        -95-\n\fadded)(quoting United States v. Fusaro, 708 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n1983)); see also United States v. London, 66 F.3d 1227, 1241 (1st\n\nCir. 1995)(\"[T]he cases applying § 656 [the misapplication statute\n\nthat deals with banks rather than savings and loans institutions]\n\n. . . have generally held reckless disregard to establish the\n\nrequisite    intent   to   defraud.\");     United   States    v.   Rodriguez-\n\nAlvarado, 952 F.2d 586, 590 (1st Cir. 1991)(\"A reckless disregard\n\nby a bank officer of his bank's interest . . . is sufficient to\n\nestablish the requisite intent to defraud . . . .\").               In light of\n\nthese binding decisions, appellants' arguments are futile. We find\n\nno error in the district court's instruction on the misapplication\n\ncharge.\n\nD. Booker Error\n\n            Appellants     were   sentenced   pursuant   to    a     mandatory\n\nsentencing scheme that has since been deemed unconstitutional,\n\nUnited States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245 (2005), but they did not\n\npreserve their claims that they were improperly sentenced. We have\n\nheld that such unpreserved claims are reviewed only for plain\n\nerror.    United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).    Appellants challenge their sentences on the ground that\n\n\"the Antonakopoulos plain error analysis does not comport with the\n\nSupreme Court's decisions in [United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n734-36 (1993)] and Booker because it imposes on defendants the\n\nburden of proving that error materially affected the proceedings\n\n\n                                    -96-\n\fbelow.\"      Absent en banc or Supreme Court review, however, we are\n\nbound   to    follow    the    Antonakopoulos        framework,       and   thus    we\n\nacknowledge only that appellants have preserved this issue for\n\nlater review.\n\n                                       VII.\n\n             After concluding our review of the immense record in this\n\ncomplicated     case,    we    agree    with       the     district    court       that\n\noverwhelming     evidence      supported      the    jury     verdicts.        Also,\n\nappellants have raised no other grounds that would justify vacating\n\ntheir convictions.\n\n             We have been greatly aided in our review by the district\n\ncourt's sensible management of this lengthy trial, as well as its\n\ncareful and thorough analysis of the issues that arose throughout\n\nthe   proceedings.       Its    handling      of    this   burdensome       case    was\n\nexemplary.\n\n             We affirm the convictions and sentences of the appellants\n\non all counts.\n\n             So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -97-\n\f",

S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n was Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer of Caguas. Guti&#233;rrez was a land developer who owned several companies that received loans from Caguas. Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez was an officer of several companies belonging to Guti&#233;rrez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For nearly a decade, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n supervised a scheme to use proceeds from various loans for purposes not authorized by Caguas' Board of Directors (\"Board\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The loans were granted for land development projects involving companies that Guti&#233;rrez owned and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez helped to operate, including Transglobe, Modules, and Transhore. In many instances the appellants used proceeds from loans to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies to make payments on prior loans to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies without Board approval. In other instances Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n submitted loans to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies to the Board for approval without disclosing the Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies' failure to complete work on previous projects. On many occasions Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted certifications for construction work that had not yet been completed, and Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n accepted the certifications and ordered disbursement of funds for the projects. The Board also was not informed of this practice. In January 1988, Mu&#241;oz-Franco drafted and obtained Board approval to send a letter to Richard Denby, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board auditor supervising Caguas, which responded to Denby's concerns regarding Caguas' lending practices (\"Denby letter\").

If the problems with the bank became known and Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n were removed from their positions, \"not only would that have deprived them of a very lucrative job, but it also would have made it very difficult for them to obtain new employment in the banking industry.\" The scheme also maintained the appearance of solvency for the Guti&#233;rrez companies, thus protecting the livelihood and professional reputation of Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The projects for which Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies received loans included La Marina, Los Mameyes, Cerrovista, and Jardines de Villa Alba.

As of September 1981, the loan limit had been increased four times, adding a total of $1.8 million, yet not a single house had been built. Funds were disbursed from the loan for the project based on certifications submitted by Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez and approved by S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, and approximately $2 million was used to pay unrelated Guti&#233;rrez debts with a different bank. In October 1984, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n caused Caguas to finance the sale of the La Marina project to DO.W Group. The agreement for this sale provided that Transglobe would remain the contractor for the project despite its failure to build a single house in the preceding four years. In approving the loan, the Board was not informed of Transglobe's prior poor performance. After this sale, appellants continued to apply funds from the La Marina loan to other projects and to disburse funds for work not completed. Not a single house was ever built on the project, and, in 1989, Caguas entered into a settlement agreement with DO.W releasing DO.W's debt on the project, which totaled over $2 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Between December 1985 and March 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted a series of certifications stating that a total of two hundred housing units had been built. Even though Caguas' inspector reported that only fifty-five units had been completed, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n approved disbursements totaling about $800,000. In March 1986 Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted a certification requesting $69,000 for \"payment of subcontractors,\" but attached a list of interest payments due on the Jardines de Villa Alba, Levittown, Country Club, La Marina, and Los Caciques projects totalling exactly $69,000. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n approved the certification and Caguas disbursed the funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c.

After meeting with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez and agreeing to use Modules as a contractor, Caguas approved Burns' application for a loan to build twenty-three units of housing in what became known as the Cerrovista project. Burns' loan was approved on the condition that he sign a $2 million note as a down payment to Modules. Burns signed the note. Shortly thereafter, however, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez told Burns that the project needed a new \"sponsor\" because Burns had been \"gossiping.\" Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez then began to negotiate the sale of Cerrovista to Iantho, a company owned by Walter Frambes. In August or September 1986, Burns read newspaper articles indicating that the Cerrovista project might be affected by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation's plans to build a hospital and an expressway. He inquired with the Department and received confirmation that the development of four lots would be \"frozen.\" When Burns brought this information to Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez told him to \"hide it, boy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1986, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n received Board approval to offer Iantho an $8.9 million loan, specifying that $1,412,177 would be used to purchase land for the Cerrovista project. The sale was then finalized on September 28. However, the actual land cost was only $480,000, and the remaining $932,000 was used to make principal and interest payments on other loans to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies. Over the next few months Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted certifications showing approximately $908,000 for \"premanufacture\" of housing units, and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n authorized disbursement of these funds. As of May 1988, however, not a single unit had been built on the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. Jardines de Villa Alba</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, a developer named Emilio Montilla sought financing to build housing units on land he owned, and Caguas repeatedly denied his requests. Montilla then met with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, who told him that if he used Modules as a contractor his request would be approved. In July 1985, the Board considered a proposed loan to Montilla with Modules as contractor. Although by this time Modules had failed to perform on the La Marina project for several years, the Board was not informed of this information when it considered the Jardines de Villa Alba project. Moreover, over $231,000 was disbursed before the Jardines de Villa Alba loan agreement was signed. Although the Board eventually approved the loan, this prior disbursement took place without Board knowledge or approval. Only one unit was ever completed on the Jardines de Villa Alba project. However, the Board was not informed of this fact. The Denby letter, which was drafted by Mu&#241;oz-Franco in January 1988 and signed by the Board members, refers to the \"units\" completed on this project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Mirandes Loans</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As will be described in more detail in our sufficiency discussion, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n supervised a similar scheme to use loan proceeds for purposes not authorized by the Board with respect to companies owned by Francisco Mirandes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Mirandes received construction loans from Caguas for at least fourteen different projects. In December 1989, the Mirandes corporations collapsed due to insolvency, owing Caguas a total of $23 million. In 1997, Mirandes pled guilty to charges of participating in a conspiracy to defraud Caguas, the Board, and the regulatory institution, and to misapplication of bank funds. As part of his plea agreement, he testified for the government at appellants' trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1995, the government filed an indictment charging appellants with conspiracy, bank fraud, misapplication of bank funds, and making false entries. Three superseding indictments subsequently were filed on March 5, 1997; May 13, 1997; and March 6, 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The third superseding indictment charged Mu&#241;oz-Franco, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, Guti&#233;rrez, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, Enrique Guti&#233;rrez (Ariel Guti&#233;rrez's brother, who was also involved in running the Guti&#233;rrez corporations), and Rafael Dom&#237;nguez Wolff (who purchased several projects from the Guti&#233;rrez brothers)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> with bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344; conspiracy to commit bank fraud, misapply bank funds, and make false entries, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; and misapplication of bank funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 657. The indictment also charged Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n with bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 and conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 with respect to the Mirandes loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial began in federal district court in Puerto Rico in January 2001 and the presentation of evidence concluded in April 2002. On May 16, 2002, the jury convicted Mu&#241;oz-Franco, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, Ariel Guti&#233;rrez, and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez on all charged counts, but acquitted Enrique Guti&#233;rrez. Following the verdict, appellants filed motions for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, raising numerous grounds, including the sufficiency of the evidence. In a thoughtful seventy-seven page opinion, the district court denied all of the motions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sentencing proceedings began on December 15, 2003. On February 12, 2004, the district court sentenced Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n to a term of forty-six months on the conspiracy and bank fraud counts and a concurrent term of sixty months on the misapplication count. It also imposed a fine of $50,000 on each defendant. The court sentenced Guti&#233;rrez to a term of thirty-seven months on the conspiracy and bank fraud counts, and imposed a concurrent term of sixty months on the misapplication count. It also imposed a $60,000 fine. Finally, it sentenced Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez to a term of twenty-four months on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Issues on Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants raise thirteen major issues for our consideration on appeal. Three of these claims&#8212;concerning the statute of limitations, the Ex Post Facto Clause, and the pre-indictment and pre-trial delay&#8212;implicate what might be termed the validity of the entire proceedings. Although courts often begin by addressing such issues, we find, in light of the exceptionally large record, that we must review the sufficiency of the evidence in order to assess the viability of any of appellants' other claims. Thus, we will first resolve two evidentiary issues to determine the content of the record properly before us. We will then employ that record in conducting our analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence. Informed by a full understanding of the record, we will then turn to the host of other issues raised by appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with two evidentiary issues: whether the district court allowed witnesses to testify beyond their personal knowledge, and whether the minutes from the Board meetings were improperly admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Personal Knowledge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the district court improperly permitted prosecution witnesses to testify beyond their personal knowledge, in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 602. Rule 602 states, in pertinent part: \"A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\" Fed.R.Evid. 602. Interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a question of law subject to de novo review, but the application of a rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Sposito,</i> 106 F.3d 1042, 1046 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Arturo Somohano</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that Arturo Somohano (the vice president of Caguas' commercial loan department until 1988, at which time he became Caguas' chief lending officer) testified beyond his personal knowledge on three occasions: (1) in claiming that the bank's outside auditors were replaced for improper reasons; (2) in stating that Caguas' loan classifications for the loans to Modules were improper; and (3) in questioning the propriety of certain construction loans. The district court excluded the first of these statements after appellants objected, and we therefore do not consider it further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Somohano's testimony that Caguas' loan classifications for Modules were improper, appellants objected on the ground that Somohano had previously stated that he was unaware of the bank's classifications for those loans. Somohano acknowledged that he did not remember seeing the loan classifications for Modules while at Caguas, but his testimony did not rely on such knowledge of Modules' status. Instead, Somohano explained that loans at Caguas were classified from one (best) to ten (worst) based on the amount of risk involved in the loan, and that the bank would attach greater reserves to riskier loans. While still on the witness stand, Somohano then reviewed financial statements indicating that Modules had a negative net worth of $7.6 million at the end of 1986, and that Caguas' reserves would not cover the loans to Modules because the reserves equalled only ten or fifteen percent of the loans Modules was sustaining. Based strictly on the amount of reserves, Somohano would expect the Modules loan to have received a favorable classification of either two or three; however, he testified that, based on Modules' \"insolvent\" financial status, such classification would have been improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Federal Rule of Evidence 701, a lay witness may offer opinions that are \"(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\" Fed.R.Evid. 701. Under Rule 701, courts have allowed lay witnesses to express opinions about a business \"based on the witness's own perceptions and `knowledge and participation in the day-to-day affairs of [the] business.'\" <i>United States v. Polishan,</i> 336 F.3d 234, 242 (3d Cir.2003)(alternation in original)(quoting <i>Lightning Lube, Inc. v. Witco Corp.,</i> 4 F.3d 1153, 1175 (3d Cir.1993)); <i>see also Medforms, Inc. v. Healthcare Mgmt. Solutions, Inc.,</i> 290 F.3d 98, 110-11 (2d Cir.2002)(allowing a computer programmer to testify about the meaning of terms used in the copyright registrations for programs he had helped design); <i>Williams Enters., Inc. v. Sherman R. Smoot Co.,</i> 938 F.2d 230, 233-34 (D.C.Cir.1991)(allowing an insurance broker who had personal knowledge of an insured's business to offer lay opinion testimony on the cause of an increase in the insured's premiums). Here, Somohano's testimony was based on knowledge of Caguas' banking practices that he acquired during his employment there, and thus the opinions he expressed were properly within the scope of Federal Rule of Evidence 701.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellants protest, without providing specific examples, that Somohano \"was permitted to testify about the propriety of certain construction loans even though he was not part of the construction loan department and has no firsthand knowledge of those loans.\" We find this generalized objection unfounded. Somohano's opinions about the loans were based on his firsthand observations of Caguas' practices with respect to these loans. He testified that, when the Modules loan was restructured, he did not think Caguas ever would be repaid, and he provided other examples of Guti&#233;rrez loans receiving special treatment. Given Somohano's banking experience and his particular knowledge about the Guti&#233;rrez loans, his testimony about these loans also was properly admissible as a lay opinion within the scope of Rule 701. Consequently, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's handling of Somohano's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Anabel Enriquez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also argue that Anabel Enriquez (the senior vice president of Caguas' mortgage department from 1980-87, who reported directly to S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n) testified beyond her personal knowledge when she stated, based on her review of the minutes of Board and Executive Committee meetings, that certain information was not discussed at the meetings that should have been discussed. This objection is unfounded. At trial, Enriquez read the Board meeting minutes into evidence, including minutes for meetings at which she was not present. Appellants objected, and, after considerable debate, the district court ruled \"that [Enriquez] may literally read what each paragraph [of the minutes] says. If the United States then wants an explanation as to the paragraph she must then have an independent source of knowledge.\" Thus, Enriquez did not testify whether certain events actually happened at a Board meeting unless she was present; for meetings she did not attend, she testified only \"whether the minutes reflect\" that certain information was discussed. The district court enforced this limitation, and required the prosecutor to rephrase questions on more than one occasion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Similarly, Enriquez's testimony that the Board \"should have been told\" certain information was a lay opinion properly admitted under Rule 701. Her position as a senior vice president of Caguas' mortgage department and her regular attendance at Board meetings established her familiarity with Caguas' business operations and made it appropriate for her testify about information the Board needed to make its decisions. Again, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing such testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Victor Lugo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of its case, the government sought to prove that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n concealed material information relating to the Guti&#233;rrez loans from the Board. Victor Lugo, the Board president, offered testimony that he was not told or was not aware of significant information. Appellants claim that Lugo's testimony showed that he had no independent recollection of the events in question, some of which occurred nearly twenty years before trial. However, appellants misconstrue Lugo's testimony about his own memory. For example, when asked whether he was informed of Modules' performance history when the Board was making decisions on the company's loans in July 1985, he stated: \"I don't recall that it was discussed. I believe that if it was discussed I would remember and it is not reflected in the minutes.\" Similarly, when asked whether the number of houses built on Modules projects was discussed when the Board was again making decisions on the loans in September 1986, he stated definitively: \"No ... that was not discussed.\" These statements show that Lugo had sufficient recall to testify from his personal knowledge about the information given to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also complain that the government improperly suggested the truth of hypothetical scenarios presented in certain questions to Lugo. The purpose of these questions was to probe whether the Board would have considered Guti&#233;rrez companies' past performance in deciding to approve later loans. For example, the prosecutor asked Lugo: \"[I]f the Guti&#233;rrez company, out of these 96 [housing] units only built 22, would that have been information . . . which you would have been interested in knowing for purposes of voting on the approval of this loan?\" The court explained at sidebar that it would only allow such hypotheticals when the government had already introduced evidence that was the basis for the hypothetical &#8212;specifically, when \"there is a document from the bank that clearly establishes a certain fact.\" It also instructed the jurors that they should not take the facts that were the basis for the hypotheticals as true:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Okay. The fact that the Court has authorized that question, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, does not mean . . . that the Court is concluding it is a foregoing fact that you should take those facts as true. Those facts are subject to your analysis and your credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, you have to decide in your deliberations whether or not this project called for 96 houses and you have to decide whether or not actually 22 were built or whatever number was built, that is subject to your credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the Court is authorizing that this question be expressed in these terms does not at all mean that the Court has already determined that it is a fact at all. You have to decide. That's one of the issues that you're going to have to decide in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court reiterated this instruction several times. This detailed instruction was sufficient to advise the jury that it should not accept the facts set forth in the hypotheticals as true. Thus, Lugo's response to these questions did not have the effect of allowing him to testify beyond his personal knowledge to the factual correctness of the hypothetical. The district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing such testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Victor Kareh</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellants assert that Victor Kareh (the assistant vice president of the construction loan department from 1980 to 1990) \"was permitted . . . to opine about what the project documents and ledger cards indicated, without any clear memory of the events and mixing summary testimony with what was improper expert testimony.\" To support this proposition, appellants cite to three thirty-page sections of the trial transcript, without specifying the testimony to which they object or the grounds for their objections. Although Kareh did not author all of the documents about which he testified, this in itself is not a basis for excluding his testimony about the documents. Without developed argumentation on this issue, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in allowing Kareh's testimony. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990)(\"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Admission of Minutes from Board Meetings</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the prosecution introduced the Board and Executive Committee meeting minutes under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(6), which states that business records are not excluded by the rule against hearsay \"if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity, and if it was the regular practice of that business activity to make the ... record . . . unless the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness.\" Appellants do not claim that the minutes themselves were improperly admitted, but rather protest the prosecution's reliance on the absence of certain information from the minutes to prove that the Board was not informed about such matters. Appellants argue that this use violated their rights under the Confrontation Clause and the rule against hearsay. We examine these claims in turn. We review alleged violations of the Sixth Amendment's Confrontation Clause de novo. <i>United States v. Rondeau,</i> 430 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir.2005). As discussed above, interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is subject to de novo review, but application of a rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>Sposito,</i> 106 F.3d at 1046.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Confrontation Clause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees defendants the right to confront adverse witnesses. The Supreme Court has explained that only \"testimonial\" statements \"cause the declarant to be a `witness' within the meaning of the Confrontation Clause.\" <i>Davis v. Washington,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 2273, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006)(citing <i>Crawford v. Washington,</i> 541 U.S. 36, 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Thus, \"[i]t is the testimonial character of the statement that separates it from other hearsay that, while subject to traditional limitations upon hearsay evidence, is not subject to the Confrontation Clause.\" <i>Id.</i> Although the Court has yet to articulate a precise definition of \"testimonial,\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> it is beyond debate that the Board minutes are nontestimonial in character and, consequently, outside the class of statements prohibited by the Confrontation Clause. The Court in <i>Crawford</i> plainly characterized business records as \"statements that by their nature [are] not testimonial.\" 541 U.S. at 56, 124 S.Ct. 1354. If business records are nontestimonial, it follows that the absence of information from those records also must be nontestimonial. Thus, the Confrontation Clause presents no bar to reliance on the absence of certain information from the Board meeting minutes to prove that the Board was not given that information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Hearsay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also complain that, once the minutes were admitted, the prosecution used the <i>absence</i> of certain information from the minutes to demonstrate that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n failed to inform the Board of these matters in violation of the rule against hearsay. Appellants argue that the minutes were intended to be a summary, rather than an exhaustive record, of the events that took place at Board meetings, and that, consequently, the minutes do not indicate whether such information was disclosed to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Evidence 803(7) states that the rule against hearsay does not exclude</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[e]vidence that a matter is not included in the . . . records . . . kept in accordance with the provisions of [Fed. R.Evid. 803(6)], to prove the nonoccurrence or nonexistence of the matter, if the matter was of a kind of which a . . . record . . . was regularly made and preserved, unless the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 803(7). The Advisory Committee Note to Rule 803(7) also states that the \"[f]ailure of a record to mention a matter which would ordinarily be mentioned is satisfactory evidence of its nonexistence.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Thus, the absence of certain information in minutes admissible under Rule 803(6) would be admissible to show that the Board was not given that information unless the circumstances indicated some reason that these omissions from the record were untrustworthy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note that Rule 803(6) excludes business records if \"the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate lack of trustworthiness,\" Fed.R.Evid. 803(6), while Rule 803(7) excludes records otherwise admissible under Rule 803(6) if \"the sources of information or other circumstances indicate lack of trustworthiness,\" Id. 803(7). We think this repetition indicates that even if a business record is deemed sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible for its contents under Rule 803(6), other circumstances might render omissions in that record untrustworthy to show that the events omitted did not occur. Thus, appellants' concession that the records are admissible under Rule 803(6) does not necessarily preclude them from arguing that omissions from the records are not admissible under Rule 803(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced testimony from Enriquez, the vice-president who reported directly to S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, explaining that the minutes were prepared by one of the executive vice presidents before 1982, by Luis Pastor (an administrative assistant to Mu&#241;oz-Franco) from 1982 to 1986, and by Enriquez after that time. Enriquez stated that the records prior to 1982 \"were prepared and reviewed by the board, they were set forth in a record book and the secretary of the board and the president would sign them.\" The government submitted an affidavit from Pastor, dated March 21, 2001, verifying that the documents it introduced were, in fact, the minutes from 1982 to 1986 and explaining that the minutes \"consist of transcriptions made from notes taken by someone who was present at each meeting\" and that the minutes \"were kept in the regular course of business of Caguas . . . . [I]t was the regular business practice of Caguas to compile and prepare [the minutes] and to maintain them in its files.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Enriquez explained that, after 1986, \"[w]hen I was present I would take notes, subject to the agenda and what was approved.\" When Enriquez was not present, Eliza Balina, the executive secretary for Mu&#241;oz-Franco, would take notes at the meetings, and Enriquez would then \"review the files that were prepared for use by the directors. And upon that review, if there was something I did not understand then I could ask the president.\" Enriquez noted that the minutes \"were always ratified at the following board meeting,\" and that, after ratification, the minutes would be stored either in the president's office or in the bank vault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants emphasize that Lugo (the president of the Board) acknowledged on cross-examination that the minutes were only a summary of the meetings and did not \"word for word report discussions.\" However, a review of the Board and Executive Committee minutes reveals that, while not word for word renditions of the meetings, the minutes capture more than a skeletal outline of each meeting and include descriptions of the considerations relevant to each loan rather than simply the fact that the loan was discussed and approved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering this evidence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the use of the minutes to demonstrate that the Board did not receive material information about many of the transactions it considered. Enriquez's testimony and Pastor's affidavit demonstrate that the business records were prepared regularly after every meeting, reviewed and ratified by the Board, and stored securely following ratification. These circumstances do not indicate lack of trustworthiness. Indeed, they permit a finding of trustworthiness.

To prove bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, the government must show that the appellants knowingly engaged in a scheme or artifice to defraud or obtain money from a federally insured financial institution by means of materially false statements or misrepresentations. <i>See United States v. Kenrick,</i> 221 F.3d 19, 30 (1st Cir.2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> We first consider the evidence against bank officers Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, and then the evidence against Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In their positions as President and Executive Vice President, respectively, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n were responsible for keeping the Board informed of information relevant to current and prospective loans. Moreover, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n was the primary supervisor of the construction and commercial loans to Modules, a Guti&#233;rrez-owned company involved in many of the fraudulent transactions. Mu&#241;oz-Franco supported S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's recommendations on these projects. At trial, Lugo, the president of the Board of Directors, explained that he and the other Board members relied on the reports prepared by Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n in making decisions regarding loans. Lugo explained that it was not his job to \"verify the accuracy of information that was being given\" to him by the management of the bank, and added that he \"trusted fully that the information that was being provided me was whole and true.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite their responsibility to keep the Board fully apprised, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n concealed important information on many occasions. For example, in July 1985 Caguas considered the Jardines de Villa Alba project, for which Modules would be the contractor. As of October 29, 1984, Modules had completed none of the 212 units planned for the La Marina project, even though the original loan agreement from June 25, 1980 called for construction to begin in thirty days and for seventy-five units to be completed within twelve months. Despite the lack of progress, the loan amount had been increased four times between August 7, 1980 and September 17, 1981. Lugo testified that this poor performance history was not discussed during the loan presentation for the Jardines de Villa Alba project. Lugo stated unequivocally that he would have wanted to know Modules' performance history in evaluating the Jardines de Villa Alba loan, demonstrating the materiality of such information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo further testified that, after the original loan presentation, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n continued to withhold information from the Board regarding the Jardines de Villa Alba loan. Although the record shows $231,000 was paid to Modules before the Jardines de Villa Alba loan agreement was signed, even at trial Lugo expressed surprise that this had happened and stated that \"it would have been difficult for me to believe that\" this occurred. More than a year after the Jardines de Villa Alba loan was approved, in September 1986, Lugo did not know that only one house had been built on the project. Lugo also testified that as of September 1986 the performance history of Modules \"as to construction of homes that were to be constructed versus the ones that were constructed . . . was not discussed.\" Finally, on January 10, 1988, Lugo signed the Denby letter, which was prepared by Mu&#241;oz-Franco and which referred to the \"units\" built on Jardines de Villa Alba, without realizing that only one house had been built on the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo also testified that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n did not inform him and the Board of other material information relating to Modules. For example, he did not know that Modules remained the contractor after the La Marina, Country Club, and Levittown projects were sold from Transglobe to DO.W in October 1984. He also did not know that, between 1984 and 1986, Modules did not make any principal or interest payment on any loan to Caguas with funds generated from its own business as opposed to proceeds from other loans. Likewise, he was not informed, when the Board approved the sale of Modules to Camero on September 10, 1986, in conjunction with a restructuring of its loans, that approximately seventy percent of Modules' debt was with Caguas and that over seventy-one percent of Modules' assets were intangibles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Lugo testified that when the board approved a loan of $1,412,077 for land acquisition for the Cerrovista project, for which Modules also was the contractor, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n did not advise him or the Board that the cost of the land was actually only $480,000&#8212;in other words, that $932,177 would be used to make principal and interest payments on other Modules loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo's testimony is corroborated by the absence of this and other material information from the Board minutes. Although the government did not rely heavily on the absence of such information, we have found these omissions properly admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(7) and note that they lend support to the prosecution's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was substantial evidence that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n withheld all of this information from the Board with full knowledge of the problems with Modules and other Guti&#233;rrez companies. Anabel Enriquez, who reported directly to S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, explained that the handling of Guti&#233;rrez certifications at Caguas concerned her \"[b]ecause practically monthly, each time they invoiced[,] the certifications would be ahead of the construction.\" She discussed her concerns with Mu&#241;oz-Franco at least by the time La Marina was going to be sold to DO.W in 1984, and with S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n around the same time. She also discussed her concern with Mu&#241;oz-Franco that, following the sale, Modules would remain a contractor for La Marina, Levittown, and Country Club. However, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n took no action in response to Enriquez's concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n took steps to conceal their misrepresentations from both internal and external auditors. Juan Hern&#225;ndez, Caguas' internal auditor, testified that, in 1981, Kareh (the assistant vice president of the construction loan department) initially provided information in connection with an audit of the construction loan department, but, after a short meeting with S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, Kareh stopped providing the information Hern&#225;ndez requested. Hern&#225;ndez further testified that, although he requested the auditing committee \"several times\" between 1980 and 1990 to allow him to audit the construction loan department, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n did not allow the audit to take place. In a letter dated January 22, 1985, an external auditing firm, Stephen P. Bradics and Company, recommended \"that the scope of internal auditing be expanded to include . . . construction loans.\" After Caguas received this letter, Hern&#225;ndez again recommended to the audit committee on several occasions that he should be allowed to audit the construction department, but he still was not allowed to do so. The audit committee minutes reflect his recommendation at several meetings at which Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n were present. At one meeting, on January 28, 1988, Mu&#241;oz-Franco responded by telling Hern&#225;ndez that \"construction loans was the area most audited by senior management.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n heard and agreed with Mu&#241;oz-Franco's response, and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n had also made similar statements to Hern&#225;ndez in the past. However, Hern&#225;ndez was never provided with any internal audit conducted by either Mu&#241;oz-Franco or S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n also concealed information regarding Caguas' lending practices from external authorities. Critically, Mu&#241;oz-Franco drafted and obtained Board approval to send the Denby letter, which states: \"This Board of Directors wishes to state in no unclear and uncertain terms that it has never considered and much less approved any policy or practice of permitting borrowers to use construction loan proceeds to satisfy or make interest payment[s] on other unrelated loans.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> At the time of the letter, however, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n had, as discussed above, approved loans for such purposes on many occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence demonstrates that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n repeatedly concealed material information regarding the status of the Guti&#233;rrez loans from the Board, approved disbursements for work that was not completed, and prevented audits. Such conduct caused Caguas to continue lending money to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies despite the companies' financial instability, which demonstrates appellants' knowing scheme to defraud Caguas by means of material misrepresentations within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344. Consequently, we affirm the district court's finding that a rational jury could have found Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n guilty of bank fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also contained considerable evidence from which a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez knowingly engaged in a scheme to defraud Caguas by misrepresenting material information. The certifications they submitted and signed contained many misrepresentations. For example, on the Los Mameyes project, between December 9, 1985 and January 10, 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted nine certifications attesting to the manufacture of 74 housing units and requesting payments totaling $380,000, even though the inspector's report stated that only 19 houses had been built. Between January 16 and February 21, 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted 10 more certifications attesting to the manufacture of 90 additional housing units and requesting payment of approximately $500,000, at which point payment had been disbursed for at least 164 housing units even though only 40 units had been manufactured. As of February 25, 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez had certified the completion of 200 units, but an inspection report dated March 23, 1986, indicated that only 55 units had been built. On March 31, 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted a certification requesting $69,000 for \"payment of subcontractors\" along with a list of interest payments they had made on other projects, including Jardines de Villa Alba, Levittown, Country Club, La Marina, and Los Caciques, which equalled exactly $69,000. Finally, on June 26, 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted a \"special certification\" of $85,000 with no justification for work allegedly completed; Kareh testified that such a certification was not a usual practice. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n authorized the disbursements based on these certifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted similar certifications for work not completed on other projects. For example, on the Jardines de Villa Alba project, Modules had installed only one unit as of the time of the Denby letter on January 10, 1988; however, on October 22, 1985 Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez certified that twenty-two units had been completed, causing $626,000 to be disbursed to Modules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez perpetuated their scheme by recruiting other developers to obtain loans from Caguas on the condition that they use Modules as the contractor. This conduct allowed Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez to obtain new funding for Modules, which they would then use to pay down prior loans and keep Modules from collapsing. Developer Burns, the original owner of the Cerrovista project, was a typical example. After unsuccessfully applying to Caguas for a loan to build residential housing on land he owned, Burns met with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, who told him that if he used Modules as his contractor and signed a $2 million note he would be approved for a loan. A week later Burns received financing for the Cerrovista project. He testified that the approval was \"[d]efinitely[] because of the use of Modules.\" Burns met with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez on \"many other occasions,\" and, after problems arose with the Cerrovista project, with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n in S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's office. Subsequently, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez told Burns that the project would be sold to Iantho, and explained that \"this project was going to contribute to paying off some interest for some of the projects that were in default,\" which caused Burns to understand \"that was the reason . . . I was rejected as sponsor.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1986, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n presented, and the Board approved, a loan of $8.9 million to Iantho Corporation to take over the Cerrovista project; the loan agreement specified that Modules would be the contractor for the project's two hundred units. Burns testified that, around the time the project was being sold, he received confirmation that the Department of Transportation's plans to build a hospital and expressway would cause the development of four lots of the project to be \"frozen.\" When told the news, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez responded, \"hide it, boy.\" On September 28, 1986, Cerrovista was sold to Iantho with no mention of the impending development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence shows that Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez knowingly concealed information relevant to the viability of the Cerrovista project and submitted many certifications for work that was not completed. To sustain their schemes, they recruited other developers and helped them receive funding from Caguas on the condition that these developers use Modules as a contractor. These activities caused Caguas to continue lending money to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies despite the companies' financial instability, providing an ample basis for a jury to find that appellants knowingly schemed to defraud Caguas by means of material misrepresentations within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344. Consequently, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that both Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez were guilty of bank fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

To establish a conspiracy, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that (1) a conspiracy existed; (2) the defendant knew of and voluntarily participated in the conspiracy; and (3) there was an overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy. <i>United States v. Blasini-Lluberas,</i> 169 F.3d 57, 67 (1st Cir.1999).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a> The government must prove both intent to agree and intent to commit the substantive offense. <i>United States v. Rivera-Santiago,</i> 872 F.2d 1073, 1079 (1st Cir.1989). A formal agreement is not required, <i>Am. Tobacco Co. v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 781, 809, 66 S.Ct. 1125, 90 L.Ed. 1575 (1946); rather, \"[t]he agreement may be shown by a concert of action, all the parties working together understandingly, with a single design for the accomplishment of a common purpose.\" <i>Am.

Where, as here, the indictment alleges a conspiracy to commit multiple offenses, the charge may be sustained by sufficient evidence of conspiracy to commit any one of the offenses. <i>See Griffin v. United States,</i> 502 U.S. 46, 56-57, 112 S.Ct. 466, 116 L.Ed.2d 371 (1991); <i>see also United States v.

In considering appellants' motion for judgment of acquittal, the district court found that there was more than enough evidence with respect to bank fraud to sustain the conspiracy conviction, and thus did not review the evidence concerning the misapplication and false entry crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's assessment. First, there was substantial evidence of an agreement among the four men to defraud the bank. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n directly supervised the Guti&#233;rrez loans and worked closely with Mu&#241;oz-Franco on the loans. Enriquez testified that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n always reached an agreement regarding the treatment of these loans. Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted many certifications for work not yet completed, and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n then repeatedly approved disbursements for this work. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n also facilitated Guti&#233;rrez's efforts to secure new borrowers by ensuring that a loan would be approved if Modules was used as a contractor. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez met frequently regarding the status of the Guti&#233;rrez companies. Burns testified, for example, that he met with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez many times in S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's office regarding the Cerrovista project. Finally, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n failed to disclose material information to the Board on many occasions, and this joint failure further demonstrates their collaboration in defrauding the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the many instances of concealing the Guti&#233;rrez companies' performance from the Board of Directors, submitting certifications for work not completed, authorizing disbursements for such work and preventing audits, a reasonable jury could easily find the other two elements of conspiracy: that appellants knew of and participated voluntarily in the conspiracy, and that each committed overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. Viewed as a whole, this synchronized pattern of conduct demonstrates appellants' agreement to maintain the appearance of financial viability of the Guti&#233;rrez corporations by securing new loans to make payments on outstanding loans. Thus, we find that a reasonable jury could have found each element of conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to each of the four appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Misapplication of Bank Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found all four appellants guilty of misapplication of bank funds under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 657 for a single transaction related to the Cerrovista project. The crime of misapplication eludes easy definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> As we have previously noted, \"[t]he problem that has confronted and perplexed the courts is that there is no statutory definition or common law heritage that gives content to the phrase `willfully misapplies.'\" <i>United States v. Wester,</i> 90 F.3d 592, 595 (1st Cir.1996). However, we have held that misapplication has two key elements: (1) wrongful use of bank funds; and (2) intent to injure or defraud a bank. <i>Blasini-Lluberas,</i> 169 F.3d at 63. We have also explained that \"the same facts can easily be the basis for deeming the conduct to be wrongful and the intent fraudulent; both misapplication and scienter are required.\" <i>Wester,</i> 90 F.3d at 595. Finally, the misapplication statute applies only to officers, agents, and employees of a bank. Thus, appellants who do not hold one of these positions&#8212;here Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez&#8212;may not be convicted as principals for misapplication, but may be convicted as aiders and abettors. <i>See Giragosian v. United States,</i> 349 F.2d 166, 167 (1st Cir.1965)(\"Since [defendant] was not an officer, director, agent or employee of the bank, he could not be guilty as a principal . . . for misapplication of the bank's funds, but only as an aider and abettor.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could have concluded that appellants' handling of the Cerrovista loan constituted misapplication. The original loan offering, which was prepared according to S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's instructions, designated $1,412,177 for land costs and $855,323 for \"partial assumption of other loans.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> This document did not disclose the purpose for which the funds were actually used. Of the $1,412,177 designated for land, only $480,000 was used to purchase land for the project. The remaining $932,177 was disbursed to the Guti&#233;rrez-owned Quintas de Humacao company and immediately applied to other Guti&#233;rrez projects: principal and interest on the Quintas de Fajardo loan, interest on the Las Gaviotas loan, and interest on a Modules commercial loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The documents associated with the Cerrovista loan demonstrate appellants' intent to defraud Caguas by redirecting these funds. Although the settlement statement<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> for the Cerrovista loan, dated September 29, 1986, lists a disbursement of $932,177 for \"repayment of other loan\" and lists the payee as \"Quintas de Humacao Inc. &amp; Caguas Federal Savings,\" these disclosures appear in a markedly different type, as does the total loan amount. Kareh testified that this different type indicates that \"the entry was made later or at another place,\" allowing an inference that the document was amended to make it appear that the Board had approved the use of loan proceeds to make payments on other loans. This inference is bolstered by the fact that the loan settlement statement was not prepared until after the Board had approved a loan. Kareh also testified that, although the $855,323 amount designated for \"partial assumption of other loans\" was listed on the loan offering and disbursed on the date of closing, the $855,323 amount was omitted from the settlement statement at S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> This omission concealed the fact that two <i>separate</i> disbursements, in the amounts of $932,177 and $855,323, were used to pay down other loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each appellant was sufficiently involved in concealing the use of funds to allow an inference of intent to defraud. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n drafted the original loan offering, which did not disclose that the $932,177 difference between the amount allocated for land purchase and the amount spent on land would be used to pay principal and interest on other loans. Moreover, according to Kareh, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n explicitly instructed him to omit the $855,323 amount from the loan settlement document. A jury could infer that Mu&#241;oz-Franco helped to conceal this wrongful use of funds, thereby intentionally defrauding Caguas, based on his supervisory role on the Guti&#233;rrez loans and his regular responsibility of conveying information to the Board. Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez were also involved in the wrongful use of funds: they endorsed the checks, accepted the funds, and immediately applied these funds to pay down their other loans with the bank. Although appellants assert that the loan settlement documents demonstrate that the transaction was disclosed to the Board, the record indicates that the loan settlement statement was prepared after the loan had already been approved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants attempt to counter the charge by segregating the activities relating to the Cerrovista loan into two separate transactions: the disbursement of the $932,177 land purchase differential to Quintas de Humacao, and the use of those funds to pay down other Guti&#233;rrez loans. They argue that, at the time the funds were disbursed to the Guti&#233;rrez-owned Quintas de Humacao, they ceased to be \"bank funds\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 657 and thus cannot support a misapplication violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find this technicality pertinent. The disbursement of funds from the Cerrovista loan to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies, and the subsequent use of these loans to pay down other Guti&#233;rrez loans, was a single unified transaction. The district court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The funds did not cease to be controlled by the express purpose for which they were disbursed. The fact the $932,177 check was endorsed does not change the express purpose for which said funds were to be used. The second transfer, the Guti&#233;rrez's endorsement back to Caguas Central for the repayment of four separate loans, is still the use of bank funds and subject to misapplication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By expressly designating these funds for \"repayment of other loan[s],\" Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n retained control over the funds even if the funds nominally changed hands. Moreover, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n supervised the entire transaction, as demonstrated by four entries in Caguas' ledgers showing the transfer of funds to the Guti&#233;rrez accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Critically, appellants also ignore the separate concealment of the $855,323, which, although it was listed on the original loan application, was left off of the loan settlement statement of September 29, 1986 at S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's explicit instruction. Although the disbursement of the $855,323 was disclosed to the Board, the fact that this disbursement was left off the loan settlement statement indicates the bank officials' efforts to conceal the fact that two separate disbursements, in the amounts of $855,323 and $932,177, were used to pay down other loans. In short, there was more than sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that appellants engaged in wrongful use of bank funds with the intent to defraud the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Bank Fraud with Respect to Mirandes Loans</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also found appellants Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n guilty of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 with respect to the Mirandes loans. The Mirandes scheme involved many of the same elements as the Guti&#233;rrez loans. In September 1981, Mu&#241;oz-Franco asked Mirandes to take over ownership of a project called Reparto Valenciano, and Mirandes, then the contractor for the project, agreed. At the time the project was in debt to Caguas for $2.2 million, and delays and other problems continued after Mirandes assumed ownership. On an ongoing basis, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n supervised the transfer of funds from other projects to pay down the debt on the Reparto Valenciano project. For example, on September 30, 1986, approximately $2.2 million was applied to the Reparto Valenciano project from other Mirandes projects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n did not disclose these transfers of money among various Mirandes projects to the Board. After the Reparto Valenciano debt increased to $3.2 million, Mirandes received five contracts from the Puerto Rico Housing Department to build basic housing. Although Caguas initially denied Mirandes' application for funding for these projects, it subsequently agreed to finance the Villas de Gurabo project if Mirandes would agree to apply the profits of that project to the debt and interest of the Reparto Valenciano project. These transfers temporarily sustained the Mirandes projects, but the decreased funds available to successive projects ultimately made it impossible for those projects to be completed or to yield profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n were intimately involved with the administration of the Mirandes loans. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n met with Mirandes on many occasions, including, during one seven or eight month period, meetings every fifteen days. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n was involved in most of the disbursements for the Mirandes projects, whereas for other loans he was typically involved only if a problem arose. Mu&#241;oz-Franco was also involved in the Mirandes loans: he originally met with Mirandes to get him to take over the loans, met with Mirandes several times thereafter, was regularly informed of the loans' progress, and reported on the loans' status to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning thirty days after the Reparto Valenciano loan agreement was signed, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n authorized many certifications for completed work. With two exceptions, no work on the project had been completed at the time of the authorizations. On several occasions, a transfer of funds from one loan to another or an increase in the amount of a loan was authorized without the approval of the loan committee or the Board. Mirandes also testified that the disbursement schedule for loans \"normally . . . wasn't complied with because money was taken out to pay interest.\" Thus, the disbursement schedule that the Board approved was not the schedule that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n subsequently followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enriquez testified such practices were not standard at Caguas; along with the Guti&#233;rrez loans, the Mirandes loans were the only ones for which disbursements were authorized for work that was not completed. According to Enriquez, the Mirandes projects commonly received \"special\" certifications, which meant that \"[w]hen one project didn't have a line [of credit] it would be taken from another project.\" When regular certifications were submitted, they would have an itemization of expenses attached; special certifications would not include such an itemization and thus would not disclose the destination of the funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n also caused Caguas to finance the sale of land from one Mirandes company to another in order to pay interest on the Reparto Valenciano loan. On September 11, 1984, Mirandes' company Deproco purchased property for $60,000, and, three months later, sold the property to Bubao, another Mirandes company, for $94,000. The proceeds from the sale were used to pay interest on the Reparto Valenciano loan. The sale occurred despite the fact that, according to Mirandes, the land was not worth the purchase price and no improvements to the land were made in the interim. The minutes did not reflect that the Board was informed of the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Mirandes was unable to improve the finances of the Reparto Valenciano project, he was awarded five projects from the Housing Department, including Villas de Gurabo, but was denied funding from Caguas. At that point, Mirandes met with Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n and asked to be released from the debt on the Reparto Valenciano project because he \"felt that the debt was not my problem\" and \"needed to seek financing for the project from another bank.\" Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n refused to release Mirandes from the debt. Subsequently, however, Kareh informed Mirandes that Caguas would give him financing on Villas de Gurabo, but that the proceeds from that loan would have to be used to pay off the debt on the Reparto Valenciano project. Mirandes reluctantly agreed, and this plan was implemented. Again, the minutes did not reflect that the Board was informed of this transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Denby letter provides further support for the jury's finding of fraud. Drafted and signed by Mu&#241;oz-Franco, it explicitly denies that Caguas' Board approved the practice of borrowers using construction loan proceeds to pay interest on unrelated loans. At the time of the letter, however, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n had on many occasions authorized the payment of debts on the Reparto Valenciano project with funds from other Mirandes loans. The fact that the Denby letter was signed by all the members of the Board would allow a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Mu&#241;oz-Franco misrepresented the practices associated with the Mirandes loans to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circumstantial evidence of the requisite intent was bolstered by more explicit evidence of appellants' knowledge. Mirandes was concerned that, on the Reparto Valenciano project, \"some projects were being emptied out in order to deal with others\" and worried that \"it was going to become paralyzed.\" Mirandes testified that he and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n \"spoke constantly\" about his concerns, and that he also expressed his concerns to Mu&#241;oz-Franco. Despite Mirandes' repeated statements of concern, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n explicitly told Mirandes that the practices had to continue. In many cases, the bank authorized the disbursements directly rather than seeking authorization from Mirandes, and Mirandes testified that, although he knew of these disbursements, he was not in agreement with them. The evidence that appellants continued with their scheme even over Mirandes' objections demonstrated that they acted deliberately to defraud the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence shows that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n repeatedly authorized disbursements for work that was not completed and concealed relevant information from the Board. As a result of these activities, Caguas continued lending money to Mirandes-owned companies despite their financial instability. This course of conduct constitutes a knowing scheme to defraud Caguas by means of material misrepresentations within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344. Consequently, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n were guilty of bank fraud with respect to the Mirandes loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Conspiracy with Respect to Mirandes Loans</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also found Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n guilty of conspiracy with respect to the Mirandes loans. Although there was no formal agreement among Mu&#241;oz-Franco, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n and Mirandes, the three acted in concert to defraud the bank. As described above, Mu&#241;oz-Franco originally approached Mirandes to assume the Reparto Valenciano loans, and Mirandes agreed. After this initial agreement, Mirandes met frequently with S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n and on several occasions with Mu&#241;oz-Franco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants participated voluntarily in the conspiracy and took overt actions in its furtherance. When the Reparto Valenciano project was unable to pay its debts, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n always attempted to find solutions to sustain the project, frequently by transferring funds from one project to another. Such transfers, as well as their approval of certifications for work not completed, constituted overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. Thus, we find sufficient evidence to sustain the jury's verdict on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 with respect to the Mirandes loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the evidence of conspiracy to commit bank fraud was sufficient in itself to sustain the conspiracy charges, but also noted that there was sufficient evidence that appellants conspired to misapply bank funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 657 and make false entries in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1006. However, because we agree with that court's assessment of the bank fraud conspiracy, we need not discuss the other two bases for the conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found sufficient evidence to support the convictions, we must now address three of appellants' claims that challenge the validity of the proceedings. First, appellants claim that the charges filed against them were barred by the statute of limitations. Second, they argue that their convictions violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Finally, they contend that their convictions were invalid because of pre-indictment and pre-trial delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3293, an individual may not be charged with bank fraud or conspiracy to commit bank fraud unless the indictment is returned within ten years after the commission of the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Appellants raise three arguments regarding this statute of limitations. First, they argue that the original indictment was untimely. Next, they argue that the First, Second, and Third Superseding Indictments substantially amended the original indictment, do not relate back, and consequently were untimely. Finally, they argue that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Timeliness of Original Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo a district court's decision not to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds. <i>L&#243;pez-Gonz&#225;lez v. Mun. of Comer&#237;o,</i> 404 F.3d 548, 551 (1st Cir.2005). Here, the original indictment was returned on November 22, 1995. Appellants contend that the Board was fully informed of the practices at issue in two of the alleged violations&#8212;bank fraud and conspiracy on the Guti&#233;rrez loans&#8212;by a regulator report dated August 31, 1985. Consequently, they argue, any deception in the scheme ended more than ten years prior to the original indictment, making the indictment untimely for those charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the activities discussed in Section III, <i>supra,</i> most of which took place after November 22, 1985, appellants' argument overstates the significance of the regulator report in question. The report describes several Modules loans and expresses general concern about Modules' financial state. The report notes that the loans \"are considered to be substandard loans subject to special comment since the future viability of the main borrower, Modules, could be impaired by uncertainties involving the collectibility of an accounts receivable due from an affiliated party.\" These general statements do nothing to inform the Board of such practices as the use of proceeds from one loan to make payments on another loan or the ongoing certification of and payment for work that was not completed. Moreover, the report itself contains certain misleading statements by S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n. For example, despite his knowledge of Modules' uncertain financial status and poor performance on several projects, he defended the loans to Modules by explaining that \"the borrower should have sufficient funds to satisfy the loans in a timely manner.\" Thus, the district court did not err in ruling that the original indictment was timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Relation Back of Superseding Indictments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next argue that each of the three superseding indictments materially broadened and substantially amended the charges against them and, consequently, do not relate back to the date of the original indictment. As a result, they argue that these indictments are untimely because they allege conduct that concluded more than ten years previously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. O'Bryant,</i> 998 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir.1993), we held that \"a superseding indictment which supplants a timely-filed indictment . . . is itself to be regarded as timely . . . so long as it neither materially broadens nor substantially amends the charges against the defendant.\" Consequently, \"the superseding indictment relates back to the filing date of the original indictment so long as a strong chain of continuity links the earlier and later charges.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24. We emphasized that \"notice-related concerns . . . comprise the touchstone for determining when a superseding indictment materially broadens or substantially amends earlier charges,\" explaining that a timely indictment serves notice by apprising defendants \"`that they will be called to account for their activities and should prepare a defense.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Grady,</i> 544 F.2d 598, 601 (2d Cir.1976)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the original indictment charged the four appellants with bank fraud and conspiracy, alleging fifty-eight overt acts spanning nearly a decade and involving unlawful disbursement of bank funds by Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, unlawful receipt of the funds by Guti&#233;rrez, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, and Mirandes, and concealment of these activities from Caguas' Board of directors and regulatory agencies. The First Superseding Indictment, returned on March 5, 1997, added allegations concerning five additional loan projects and forty-four overt acts and added two additional defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> It also changed the alleged starting date of the conspiracy from December 1981 to June 1980, lengthening the duration of the conspiracy from eight years and five months to nine years and eleven months. The Second Superseding Indictment, returned on May 13, 1997, added allegations about two more loan projects and ten overt acts. Finally, the Third Superseding Indictment, returned on March 6, 1998, separated the allegations relating to the Guti&#233;rrez and Mirandes loans, which the previous indictments had presented as a single unitary conspiracy, into two separate conspiracies set forth in separate counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that these revisions do not materially broaden or substantially amend the original indictment. The government \"is not limited in its proof at trial to those overt acts alleged in the indictment.\" <i>United States v. Adamo,</i> 534 F.2d 31, 38 (3d Cir.1976). Therefore, allegations of additional loan projects and overt acts in the superseding indictments do not broaden the original indictment; they simply provide more specific examples to substantiate the original fraud and conspiracy charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the addition of eighteen months to the beginning of a conspiracy spanning nearly a decade does not materially broaden the scope of the indictment. Virtually none of the conduct supporting appellants' convictions occurred between June 1980 and December 1981, and the dates were expanded primarily to allow factual completeness by including the dates of the original loans Caguas extended to various companies. Thus, appellants had adequate notice of the charges against them despite the expanded time frame.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we find that the separation of the original unitary bank fraud and conspiracy scheme into two separate schemes, one alleging bank fraud and conspiracy with respect to the Guti&#233;rrez loans and one alleging bank fraud and conspiracy with respect to the Mirandes loans, did not materially broaden or substantially amend the indictment. Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n still had to explain the same set of actions. With respect to Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, the division also provided adequate notice. The only difference was that they no longer had to contend with the allegations that related only to the Mirandes loans. Thus, we conclude that the Third Superseding Indictment relates back to November 22, 1995, the date of the original indictment, and find no error in the district court's refusal to dismiss the indictment for untimeliness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. Jury Instruction on Statute of Limitations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also argue that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the statute of limitations on the ground that the jury could have relied on conduct outside the limitations period in finding defendants guilty. At trial, however, Guti&#233;rrez's attorney explicitly declined to seek a statute of limitations instruction, and the other appellants made no request for such an instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We addressed a similar situation in <i>United States v. Walsh,</i> 928 F.2d 7, 11-12 (1st Cir.1991). There, we rejected the defendant's claim that the district court should have issued an instruction on the statute of limitations, explaining that the defendant \"failed to identify any point in the record where such an instruction was requested. Absent such a request, the point was waived.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12. This holding is logical because \"[a] statute of limitations claim presents `an affirmative defense' that is `not cognizable on appeal unless properly raised below.'\" <i>United States v. Spero,</i> 331 F.3d 57, 60 n. 2 (2d Cir.2003)(quoting <i>United States v. Walsh,</i> 700 F.2d 846, 855-56 (2d Cir.1983)). The situation here is identical. We hold that because appellants failed to request an instruction, the district court had no obligation to instruct sua sponte on the limitations issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn30\" id=\"fn30_ref\">30</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Ex Post Facto</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim that their convictions for bank fraud and conspiracy violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, &#167; 9, cl. 3, because the bank fraud statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, was not enacted until October 12, 1984, and the jury could have convicted them entirely on the basis of conduct that occurred prior to that date.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn31\" id=\"fn31_ref\">31</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Ex Post Facto Clause \"`forbids the application of any law or rule that increases punishment for pre-existing conduct.'\" <i>United States v. Regan,</i> 989 F.2d 44, 48 (1st Cir.1993)(quoting <i>United States v. Havener,</i> 905 F.2d 3, 5 (1st Cir.1990)). For \"continuing offenses\" such as the bank fraud and conspiracy charges at issue here, however, the critical question is when the conduct ended.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn32\" id=\"fn32_ref\">32</a> As we have explained, \"[w]here a `continuing offense' straddles the old and new law . . . applying the new is recognized as constitutionally sound.\" <i>Id.</i> In other words, \"[a] conviction for a continuing offense straddling enactment of a statute will not run afoul of the Ex Post Facto clause unless it was possible for the jury, following the court's instructions, to convict `<i>exclusively</i>' on pre-enactment conduct.\" <i>United States v. Monaco,</i> 194 F.3d 381, 386 (2d Cir.1999) (citation omitted). As suggested, \"the question of whether the violation extended beyond the effective date of [the statute is] one that ha[s] to be resolved by the jury.\" <i>United States v. Tykarsky,</i> 446 F.3d 458, 480 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants contend that the district court should have issued instructions informing the jury that it must find beyond a reasonable doubt that the bank fraud and the conspiracy to commit such fraud continued past October 12, 1984. In the absence of such an instruction, they argue, the jury's verdict was ambiguous because it could have been premised exclusively on conduct that occurred prior to the date of enactment. Under such circumstances, a conviction either for bank fraud or conspiracy to commit bank fraud would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants failed to raise the possibility of an ex post facto violation at any time prior to or during trial, including in their proposed jury instructions. They also failed to raise the issue in their post-trial Rule 29 motions. In their pre-sentencing briefs, they argued for the first time that their convictions should be vacated on ex post facto grounds. The district court rejected the claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn33\" id=\"fn33_ref\">33</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p110\">\n      <span class=\"num\">110</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An unpreserved ex post facto claim is subject to plain error review. <i>See, e.g., Tykarsky,</i> 446 F.3d at 479; <i>United States v. Julian,</i> 427 F.3d 471, 481 (7th Cir.2005). Under such review, an appellant must show: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United</i> <i>States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p111\">\n      <span class=\"num\">111</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its brief, the government agrees that the district court should have issued an instruction that the jury must find that the conduct continued past the enactment date of the bank fraud statute. Its position is consistent with recent circuit court decisions holding that the failure to issue such an instruction satisfies the first two prongs of the plain error analysis by establishing that an error occurred that was obvious. <i>See Tykarsky,</i> 446 F.3d at 479-80 (\"[B]ecause the communications spanned two different versions of the statute with different minimum penalties, the question of whether the violation extended beyond the effective date of the amended version was one that had to be resolved by the jury . . . . We also conclude that the error in not requiring a special jury finding was `plain' in that it was an obvious mistake in retrospect.\"); <i>Julian,</i> 427 F.3d at 482 (\"This was a plain error in the sense of being an obvious mistake in retrospect.\"). Thus, our task is to determine whether this error affected appellants' substantial rights, and, if so, whether the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings was impaired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other circuits have taken varying approaches to applying these prongs of the plain error test in assessing a claimed ex post facto violation. In <i>United States v. Calabrese,</i> 825 F.2d 1342, 1346 (9th Cir. 1987), the Ninth Circuit held that the \"jury's verdict represents a finding that a crime was committed as alleged in the indictment.\" Because the indictment alleged an offense that continued past the date of enactment, the court concluded that there was no plain error in the court's failure to issue an instruction. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p113\">\n      <span class=\"num\">113</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fifth Circuit has examined the record to see whether the bulk of the evidence occurred after the enactment of the statute. In <i>United States v. Todd,</i> 735 F.2d 146 (5th Cir.1984), that court held that where \"[m]ost of the evidence focused on events that occurred within the effective date of the amendments,\" and \"the record . . . clearly establishes violations of the amended act by the appellants during the relevant time period,\" the failure to give the jury instruction did not \"result in the likelihood of a grave miscarriage of justice or circumstances that seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second and Third Circuits have adopted an approach in which prejudice is established if there was a reasonable possibility that the jury convicted appellant on the basis of pre-enactment conduct. In <i>Tykarsky,</i> for example, the Third Circuit explained that a district court's failure to issue an instruction means that a defendant \"has been prejudiced if there is a reasonable possibility that a jury, properly instructed on this point, might have found [the defendant] guilty based exclusively on acts that occurred before the increased penalty took effect.\" 446 F.3d at 480. The court noted that \"[t]he most that can be said here is that it is improbable, rather than impossible, as a <i>factual matter,</i> that the jury convicted Tykarsky exclusively on the basis of\" pre-enactment conduct, which was \"insufficient to persuade us that [the defendant's] substantial rights were not affected.\" <i>Id.</i> at 482.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> The court concluded that this prejudice \"tainted the integrity and reputation of the judicial process\" and consequently vacated the defendant's sentence and remanded to the district court. <i>Id.</i> at 483.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in <i>Julian,</i> the Seventh Circuit considered an alleged conspiracy and found, on the third prong of the plain error analysis, that a court's failure to issue an ex post facto instruction \"affected [the defendant's] substantial rights in the sense that it exposed him to a longer sentence.\" 427 F.3d at 482. It then focused on the fourth prong, explaining that \"[i]f a jury, properly instructed on this point, might have found that the conspiracy had come to an end before the increased penalty took effect or that [defendant] had withdrawn from the conspiracy before that date, then the error is one that implicates the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process.\" <i>Id.</i> It concluded that a reasonable jury could not have found that the conspiracy at issue ended prior to the enactment date of the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 483.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, we need not settle on a rule here. The plain error analysis used by the Second and Third Circuits is most favorable to defendants because it requires a finding of prejudice if there was a \"reasonable possibility\" that the jury convicted appellants solely on the basis of pre-enactment conduct. Here, even under that test, appellants cannot demonstrate an ex post facto violation because no reasonable jury would have convicted appellants based exclusively on conduct that occurred prior to the enactment date. Moreover, even if we were to apply the \"miscarriage of justice\" approach of the Seventh Circuit, we would conclude there was no miscarriage of justice here because the government presented so much evidence of the involvement of the defendants in the ongoing conspiracy and bank fraud following the enactment of the bank fraud statute in 1984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly noted, the government presented overwhelming evidence of appellants' conduct, the majority of which occurred after October 12, 1984. Relatively few of the overt acts for any of the charges alleged in the indictment occurred prior to October 12, 1984: only twelve of fifty-eight overt acts on the charges of conspiracy and bank fraud with respect to the Guti&#233;rrez loans, and only ten of forty-seven acts on the charges of conspiracy and bank fraud with respect to the Mirandes loans. The government presented considerable evidence of activities occurring after October 12, 1984, including all of the transactions involving the Los Mameyes project, all of the transactions involving the Jardines de Villa Alba project, and many of the transactions involving the Reparto Valenciano project. The Denby letter, which contained several material misrepresentations, was not signed until 1987. Indeed, the bulk of our sufficiency analysis details conduct occurring after the enactment date. <i>See</i> Section III, <i>supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we find nothing to differentiate appellants' pre-enactment conduct from subsequent conduct. The government's key witnesses&#8212;Lugo, Mirandes, Enriquez, Somohano and Kareh&#8212;testified to conduct that occurred both before and after the enactment date. Given that the testimony of these witnesses spanned the enactment date, we find it implausible that the jury would find such testimony compelling only for events that occurred prior to October 12, 1984. Similarly, no transformative event occurred prior to October 12, 1984 that would alter a reasonable jury's perception of the nature of any appellant's involvement. Although appellant Guti&#233;rrez protests that he sold his construction loans with Caguas on October 29, 1984, and sold Modules on December 31, 1985, it is uncontested that he and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez remained employed by the company, and the record contains evidence that their culpable conduct (such as submitting certifications for incomplete work) continued uninterrupted after the sale of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we see no reason to differentiate the conduct occurring prior to the enactment date, we find that a reasonable jury would not have convicted the appellants based solely on pre-enactment conduct. Thus, appellants were not prejudiced, nor did their convictions implicate the fairness or integrity of the judicial process. We conclude that there is no plain error from the absence of a limiting instruction on the ex post facto issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Pre-Indictment and Pre-Trial Delay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss on the grounds that (1) the five-year pre-indictment delay violated their Fifth Amendment right to due process, and (2) the five-year pre-trial delay violated their Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial. We review both claims for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Picciandra,</i> 788 F.2d 39, 43 (1st Cir.1986)(\"[T]he district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that the pre-indictment delays did not violate the defendants' fifth amendment rights of due process.\"); <i>United States v. Salimonu,</i> 182 F.3d 63, 69 (1st Cir.1999)(\"This circuit reviews a district court's ruling on a Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim for abuse of discretion.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Pre-Indictment Delay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p121\">\n      <span class=\"num\">121</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Lovasco,</i> 431 U.S. 783, 97 S.Ct. 2044, 52 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977), the Supreme Court noted that \"statutes of limitations, which provide predictable, legislatively enacted limits on prosecutorial delay, provide the primary guarantee[] against bringing overly stale criminal charges.\" <i>Id.</i> at 789, 97 S.Ct. 2044 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). However, the Court also acknowledged that \"the Due Process Clause has a limited role to play in protecting against oppressive delay.\" <i>Id.</i> A prosecutor is not obliged to file charges as soon as probable cause exists, <i>id.</i> at 791, 97 S.Ct. 2044, and has \"wide discretion\" in delaying indictment \"limited only by the requirement that it not violate those `fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions,'\" <i>United States v. Ciampaglia,</i> 628 F.2d 632, 639 (1st Cir.1980)(quoting <i>Lovasco,</i> 431 U.S. at 790, 97 S.Ct. 2044). To show a violation of \"those `fundamental conceptions of justice' a defendant must prove that (1) pre-indictment delay caused substantial prejudice to his right to a fair trial and, (2) the Government intentionally delayed indictment in order to gain a tactical advantage over the accused.\" <i>Picciandra,</i> 788 F.2d at 42 (citation omitted). With respect to prejudice, a defendant must do more than allege that witnesses' memories had faded or that evidence had been lost that might have been helpful to him. <i>United States v. Lieberman,</i> 608 F.2d 889, 902 (1st Cir.1979).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p122\">\n      <span class=\"num\">122</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants have failed to meet that burden here. They assert that they suffered prejudice from the unavailability of nineteen potential defense witnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> However, we find that the unavailability of these nineteen individuals did not impair appellants' defense, either because appellants could have, but did not, obtain testimony from similarly situated individuals who were available to testify; or because appellants failed to demonstrate that the testimony of these individuals would have included exculpatory evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the nineteen unavailable witnesses, appellants contend that the deaths of two individuals&#8212;Phillip Saffold and Luis Dorta&#8212;prevented cross-examination relating to reports these witnesses prepared. Saffold was an investigator who authored reports that appellants claim would have allowed them to impeach Roman Cruz, a plant manager who testified that buildings were not built at the Modules plant; however, Cruz's testimony was a minor part of the government's case against appellants and appellants' inability to impeach Cruz did not significantly prejudice them. Similarly, Dorta inspected the Transglobe and Modules sites and prepared reports that were admitted at trial; appellants emphasize that his death prevented them from cross-examining him, but do not specify how this opportunity would have helped their case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim that nine other unavailable witnesses (Gilberto Pol Segarra, Luis Acevedo Gonzalez, Jaime Sitiriche, Juan Hern&#225;ndez, Celestino Seneriz, Pedro Bull Nater, Francisco Susoni Lens, Jose Feliciano, and Rafael Toro Nazario) were members of the Board who \"could have testified to the extent of the disclosures made to the Board, in response to Lugo[]'s imprecise testimony.\" However, appellants offer no reason to believe that these Board members would have offered testimony contradictory to Lugo's. Moreover, appellants do not explain why they did not call as witnesses other Board members who were available to testify throughout the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p125\">\n      <span class=\"num\">125</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellants contend that the remaining eight unavailable witnesses (Gilberto Mayo Aguayo, Nelson Soto Velasquez, Stephen P. Radics, Emil de Pentima, Troy Chapman, Stanley Orenstein, Hugo Lopez, and Fernando Rivera) \"could have testified\" or \"could have confirmed\" information relating to financial practices at Caguas, without offering any evidence that these individuals would, in fact, have been able to provide such testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p126\">\n      <span class=\"num\">126</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, appellants protest the unavailability of three sets of documents: inspection reports, commercial loan files, and miscellaneous Modules documents. With respect to the first two sets of documents, however, appellants make no attempt to establish that the reports disappeared after indictment but prior to trial. With respect to the third, appellants claim only that \"the unavailability of the Modules documents made it impossible to fairly cross examine [Transhore and Modules accountant Jorge] Fabrigas\" and that, generally, the evidence might have allowed them to refresh witness recollection and corroborate their defense. However, Fabrigas' testimony was a minor part of the trial, and these generalized objections do not establish prejudice resulting from an impaired defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if appellants had demonstrated some degree of prejudice from the delay, they have made no concomitant showing that the government intentionally delayed indictment to gain tactical advantage. Thus, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying their motion to dismiss for pre-indictment delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Pre-Trial Delay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p128\">\n      <span class=\"num\">128</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment right to a speedy and public trial attaches upon arrest or indictment, whichever occurs first. <i>United States v. MacDonald,</i> 456 U.S. 1, 6-7, 102 S.Ct. 1497, 71 L.Ed.2d 696 (1982). Thus, the time frame relevant to appellants' claim extends from the date of indictment, November 22, 1995, until the date of trial, January 29, 2001&#8212;a span of over five years. We note that appellants do not raise a claim under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161, and thus their claim is based exclusively on constitutional rather than statutory grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p129\">\n      <span class=\"num\">129</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Barker v. Wingo,</i> 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101 (1972), the Supreme Court established a four-part balancing test to determine whether a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial has been violated. Under <i>Barker,</i> a court should consider: (1) the length of the delay; (2) the reasons for the delay; (3) the defendant's assertion of his speedy trial right; and (4) the prejudice to the defendant caused by the delay. <i>Id.</i> at 530, 92 S.Ct. 2182. However, the Court identified the first factor, the length of the delay, as \"to some extent a triggering mechanism. Until there is some delay which is presumptively prejudicial, there is no necessity for inquiry into the other factors that go into the balance.\" <i>Id.</i> The Court also has indicated that post-accusation delay approaching one year is presumptively prejudicial. <i>Doggett v. United States,</i> 505 U.S. 647, 652 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 2686, 120 L.Ed.2d 520 (1992). Consequently, the five-and-a-half year delay in this case creates a presumption of prejudice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p130\">\n      <span class=\"num\">130</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under <i>Barker,</i> we must then consider the remaining three factors. We have described the second factor, the reasons for the delay, as \"`the focal inquiry.'\" <i>See, e.g., United States v. Santiago-Becerril,</i> 130 F.3d 11, 22 (1st Cir.1997) (citation omitted). Here, there are two main reasons for the pre-trial delay. First, the appellants filed numerous requests for continuances, some of which the district court granted, as well as many motions requiring time and consideration by the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn36\" id=\"fn36_ref\">36</a> Second, two days before the trial was originally scheduled to begin on May 26, 1998, the government filed a motion to disqualify the trial judge assigned to the case on the ground that she had a banking relationship with Caguas that might prejudice her in the trial of the case. The district court originally denied the motion to disqualify and the government sought mandamus from this court. We denied mandamus, but noted that \"the judge would have been well-advised either to bow out of the case or to ask that the recusal motion be assigned to a different judge for hearing\" and that \"the government hardly can be faulted for bringing\" the motion. <i>In re United States,</i> 158 F.3d 26, 33-34 (1st Cir.1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> The trial judge assigned to the case then recused herself voluntarily, resulting in a delay in the proceedings of approximately one year. In sum, the pre-trial delay arose largely from the complexity of the case and the events related to the recusal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p131\">\n      <span class=\"num\">131</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third <i>Barker</i> factor weighs in favor of appellants. They raised their speedy trial objection three times during the proceedings below, and now renew that objection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p132\">\n      <span class=\"num\">132</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has held that the final <i>Barker</i> factor&#8212;prejudice to appellants &#8212;\"should be assessed in the light of the interests of defendants which the speedy trial right was designed to protect.\" <i>Barker,</i> 407 U.S. at 532, 92 S.Ct. 2182. The Court identified three such interests: \"(i) to protect oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\" <i>Id.</i> The first of these interests has no bearing here because appellants remained free prior to trial. With respect to the second interest, \"considerable anxiety normally attends the initiation and pendency of criminal charges; hence only `undue pressures' are considered.\" <i>Santiago-Becerril,</i> 130 F.3d at 23 (citations omitted). Appellants allege no such \"undue pressure,\" and therefore we assign negligible weight to this interest. Finally, in our discussion of pre-indictment delay, we have already analyzed appellants' arguments that their defense was impaired. These arguments are equally applicable to the pre-trial time frame, and we find no material prejudice resulting from the delay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The five years that elapsed between indictment and trial is a troublesome length of time. Nonetheless, our inquiry has revealed no constitutional violation. Thus, after considering the factors listed in <i>Barker,</i> we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellants' motion to dismiss for pre-trial delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p134\">\n      <span class=\"num\">134</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also raise several challenges to evidence they contend was improperly admitted. We address these claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Evidence Regarding Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge three aspects of the admission and treatment of evidence regarding financial loss to Caguas. First, they protest that such evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Second, they argue more specifically that the government's Exhibit 40, aspects of which were later shown to be inaccurate, was erroneously admitted. Finally, they argue that, even if evidence of loss and Exhibit 40 were properly admitted, the district court erred in refusing to guide the jury with an instruction about the enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (\"FIRREA\"), Pub.L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (codified in scattered sections of 12 U.S.C.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. General Evidence of Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review evidentiary rulings on relevance and unfair prejudice for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 421 F.3d 17, 37-38 (1st Cir.2005). Loss is not an element of bank fraud. <i>United States v. Blasini-Lluberas,</i> 169 F.3d 57, 65 (1st Cir.1999). However, courts have held repeatedly that loss is relevant in fraud cases to demonstrate a defendant's knowledge or intent to commit fraud. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Heimann,</i> 705 F.2d 662, 669 (2d Cir.1983)(\"While technically the success or failure of a scheme to defraud is irrelevant in a mail fraud case, realistically, when the contested issue is intent, whether or not victims lost money can be a substantial factor in a jury's determination of guilt or innocence.\" (citation omitted)). Thus, while \"an ultimate purpose of either causing some financial loss to another or bringing about some financial gain to oneself is not the essence of fraudulent intent,\" <i>United States v. Kenrick,</i> 221 F.3d 19, 29 (1st Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), the knowledge that one's actions are, in fact, bringing about such losses may demonstrate one's intent to commit fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government referred to loss throughout the trial to demonstrate appellants' knowledge of the consequences of their ongoing practices of using loan proceeds to make principal and interest payments on unrelated loans, authorizing disbursements for work not completed, and using funds for purposes not authorized by the Board. For example, during its opening statement and closing argument, the government noted that federal regulators closed Caguas in 1990 due to the bank's lack of funds. On a few occasions, the government also questioned witnesses about the amount of loss that certain projects sustained and whether those losses would have caused concern. However, these references did not dominate the evidence because the government also presented considerable other evidence of defendants' conduct, as we have discussed at length in Section III, <i>supra.</i> Moreover, the district court carefully managed the effect of evidence relating to loss on the jury by preventing both parties from addressing loss in their closing arguments and instructing the jury that loss was not an element of the offenses charged. Finally, the court permitted appellants to cross-examine vigorously the government witnesses who discussed loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the general references to loss were relevant as a means of demonstrating appellants' intent to defraud Caguas, and, given the carefully limited presentation of this evidence to the jury, were not unduly prejudicial. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Exhibit 40</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Caguas' closure in 1990, Banco Santander acquired many of its assets, and prepared a document&#8212;government Exhibit 40&#8212;listing hundreds of Caguas' loans, the outstanding balances on those loans, Banco Santander's valuation of the loans, and the resulting discount (the difference between the outstanding balance of the loan and the loan's value). At trial, Banco Santander's comptroller attested that the bank had acquired all of the loans summarized in Exhibit 40, and the exhibit served as part of the basis for expert testimony regarding accounting practices by Kathy McKinless, a partner at an accounting firm. By the time of sentencing, however, the government discovered that the Resolution Trust Company (\"RTC\"), a government-owned asset management company, had retained many of the loans. Thus, the exhibit could not actually have reflected valuations of the loans made by Banco Santander upon purchase, and was not a reliable means of establishing the magnitude of the loss experienced by Caguas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants now contend that Exhibit 40 was both testimonial, in violation of the Confrontation Clause, and that the exhibit was improperly admitted under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The government's acknowledgment that Exhibit 40 contained inaccurate information indicates that the exhibit should have been excluded on that basis alone. However, we agree with the district court that any error in its admission was harmless. Under <i>Fahy v. Connecticut,</i> 375 U.S. 85, 86-87, 84 S.Ct. 229, 11 L.Ed.2d 171 (1963), the critical question in assessing harmless error is \"whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several circumstances indicate that there is no reasonable possibility that Exhibit 40 contributed to the convictions here. First, the exhibit was relevant only to prove appellants' fraudulent intent, and the government presented considerable evidence of this intent from other sources. Second, the court explicitly instructed the jury that loss was not an element of bank fraud. Third, the exhibit was the subject of direct examination for less than one-half of one day of a trial spanning fifteen months. Fourth, defense counsel subjected McKinless to searching cross-examination regarding the exhibit, revealing several typographical errors and inaccuracies and eliciting McKinless' acknowledgment that she could not confirm the document's completeness. Finally, even if the loss calculations in Exhibit 40 were not entirely accurate, other evidence at trial demonstrated that Caguas suffered large losses on many of the loans at issue. To some extent, the Exhibit 40 calculations replicated evidence already in the record. Taking into account all of these circumstances, there is no reasonable possibility that the isolated use of Exhibit 40 could have contributed to appellants' convictions, and thus any error in its admission was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Jury Instruction on Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also challenge the district court's refusal to give an instruction explaining that, when FIRREA was enacted in 1989, \"many institutions immediately fell out of compliance with regulatory capital requirements, making them subject to seizure by thrift regulators.\" <i>United States v. Winstar Corp.,</i> 518 U.S. 839, 857-58, 116 S.Ct. 2432, 135 L.Ed.2d 964 (1996). Appellants contend that, given the admission of evidence relating to financial loss, the jury should have been instructed that bank failures were common in the aftermath of FIRREA's enactment. In other words, the jury should have been told that banks commonly lost money in the absence of fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's refusal to issue a jury instruction \"`constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction was (1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3) integral to an important point in the case.'\" <i>White v. N.H. Dep't of Corrs.,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 263-64 (1st Cir.2000) (citation omitted). No such error occurred here. The FIRREA instruction was not integral to an important point in the case because loss is not an element of bank fraud. Moreover, the jury was instructed that the government need not prove loss. Thus, we find no reversible error in the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Forgery and Check-Kiting Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that the admission of evidence regarding forged signatures on checks and evidence of a check-kiting scheme constructively amended the indictment. A constructive amendment occurs \"`when the charging terms of the indictment are altered' at trial so that they are different from those handed up by the grand jury.\" <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 215 F.3d 110, 118 (1st Cir.2000)(quoting <i>United States v. Portela,</i> 167 F.3d 687, 701 (1st Cir.1999)). Appellants also argue that this evidence constituted an improper variance from the indictment. A variance occurs when the proof differs from the indictment's allegations, and \"is material and reversible only if it has affected the defendant's `substantial rights': to be informed of the charges; and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.\" <i>United States v. Vavlitis,</i> 9 F.3d 206, 210 (1st Cir.1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government introduced evidence that numerous checks issued by Caguas and made payable jointly to Guti&#233;rrez companies and third party contractors were deposited in the accounts of the Guti&#233;rrez companies after the contractor's endorsement was fraudulently added to the checks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> The government elicited this testimony as evidence of appellants' intent to defraud the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court addressed the forgery evidence in an order denying appellants' motion to exclude it. The court found that such evidence caused neither a constructive amendment nor a variance, explaining that, \"[s]ince some of the checks issued by Caguas [that were ultimately used to make payments on failing loans] were jointly issued to innocent third party payees, these payees' endorsement would have been required before the checks could actually be cashed or deposited in the bank.\" Since \"disbursement of the funds could not be completed until the checks were cashed . . . in some cases forged endorsements would necessarily be required.\" The court concluded that, rather than constructively amending or varying the indictment, the forged endorsements were direct evidence of one component of appellants' scheme. Finally, to foreclose any possibility that the jury would convict appellants based on the forgery evidence, the court issued thorough instructions regarding the elements of bank fraud and conspiracy as well as an instruction specifically tailored to the evidence of forgery: \"You have heard evidence about checks with allegedly forged endorsements. The crime of forgery is not charged . . . . The fact that endorsements may be forged may only be used to assist you, as you may find useful, in your evaluation of all the evidence in the case. . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order accurately assesses the value of the forgery evidence, and the admission of such evidence did not constructively amend the indictment or result in a variance. We further conclude that its instruction was more than sufficient to inform the jury of the proper role of that evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We view the check-kiting evidence similarly. The disputed evidence consisted of testimony from Somohano (the vice president of Caguas' commercial loan department) that in 1983 he detected a check-kiting scheme involving two Guti&#233;rrez corporations' accounts at Caguas and Banco de Ponce. When he informed Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, Mu&#241;oz-Franco scolded Somohano and denied that check-kiting was occurring. Somohano further testified that S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n continued to honor the checks sent to Caguas even after Banco de Ponce stopped honoring checks deposited with them. The check-kiting continued, resulting in overdrafts of more than $900,000 on the Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies' accounts at Caguas. This overdraft ultimately was converted into a loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not err in admitting this evidence. The reactions of Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n when Somohano told them about the check-kiting scheme demonstrate both their goal of preserving the Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies' financial status and the preferential treatment that these companies received. This evidence was directly relevant to the charges of bank fraud and conspiracy, and was not outside the scope of the original indictment. Thus, we conclude that no constructive amendment or improper variance occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Evidence of Civil and Regulatory Violations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also protest that the district court improperly admitted evidence of civil and regulatory banking violations. Again, we review this evidentiary ruling for abuse of discretion. <i>Richardson,</i> 421 F.3d at 37-38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p152\">\n      <span class=\"num\">152</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence of civil or regulatory violations is admissible so long as \"the evidence is not presented in such a way that the jury's attention is focused on the civil violations rather than the criminal ones.\" <i>United States v. Stefan,</i> 784 F.2d 1093, 1098 (11th Cir.1986). The concern is that such evidence could create an \"alternative standard of guilt.\" <i>United States v. Christo,</i> 614 F.2d 486, 491 (5th Cir.1980)(prohibiting the introduction of civil banking statutory violations solely for the purpose of proving criminal misapplication).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p153\">\n      <span class=\"num\">153</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Courts have allowed the introduction of evidence of civil and regulatory violations in a variety of situations. In <i>United States v. Devin,</i> 918 F.2d 280, 287 (1st Cir.1990), we found no abuse of discretion in a district court's decision to allow evidence of violations of police department regulations to demonstrate the knowledge and intent of a police officer charged with RICO violations and attempted extortion. We explained that \"[s]uch evidence was unquestionably helpful to the jury in determining whether ... [the officer] was willing to disregard his sworn obligations and accept things of value which influenced his performance of official duties.\" <i>Id.</i> Similarly, in <i>Stefan,</i> the district court permitted the government to introduce testimony regarding violations of a civil regulatory banking statute and charts illustrating how certain loans at issue contravened the statute. It also allowed the government to refer to the statutory violations in its opening statement and closing argument, and even \"focused the jury's attention\" on the statute in the instructions. 784 F.2d at 1097. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found that the defendant's scheme included efforts to avoid this statute, and that the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in admitting such evidence to help the jury understand the scheme. In both of these cases, the courts placed emphasis on a jury instruction which made clear that civil or regulatory violations did not equate to criminal conduct. <i>See Devin,</i> 918 F.2d at 288 n. 9; <i>Stefan,</i> 784 F.2d at 1099.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the court allowed the government to introduce evidence that defendants violated certain regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank to provide context for their actions and to establish their knowledge of the impropriety of their activities. Although such evidence was discussed from time to time, it was not central to the government's case, as our lengthy discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence demonstrates, <i>see</i> Section III, <i>supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court issued a limiting instruction on the use of evidence of civil and regulatory violations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have heard testimony and evidence that certain civil rules and/or regulations which govern the conduct of banks may not have been followed at times at Caguas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You are hereby instructed that a violation of any of these rules and regulations is not a crime in and of itself, and is not determinative of a defendant's guilt or innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that certain civil rules and regulations may have been violated at Caguas may only be used by you to assist you, as you may find useful, in determining a particular defendant's motive or intent as to the crimes charged in the third superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This instruction clearly conveys that civil and regulatory violations do not establish criminal culpability. Appellants protest that the instruction exacerbated the problem because the reference to \"the <i>fact</i> that certain rules and regulations may have been violated\" improperly suggested that such rules and regulations had been violated. However, we see no such suggestion because the phrase \"<i>may</i> have been violated\" makes clear to the jury that, <i>if</i> it found that such violations had occurred, it could use those violations as one piece of evidence in determining the ultimate question of criminal guilt or innocence. Given this appropriate limiting instruction, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of regulatory violations to provide context and to demonstrate appellants' knowledge of their criminal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge other aspects of the proceedings against them, including the length of the trial, allegedly disparaging and misleading statements by the prosecutor, the jury instruction on misapplication, and alleged error in sentencing. We now turn to these remaining issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Length of Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p161\">\n      <span class=\"num\">161</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the sheer length of the trial and the repetitive nature of the government's evidence denied them due process. In denying appellants' motions for judgment of acquittal on these grounds, the district court devoted more than ten pages of its seventy-seven page opinion to a thorough examination of this issue. We largely agree with its analysis. Thus, we merely summarize its conclusions here and note only a few additional points.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p162\">\n      <span class=\"num\">162</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial lasted for fifteen months and the prosecution's case lasted far longer than appellants' case. However, appellants bore much of the responsibility for the length of the trial. They either requested or agreed to several continuances after the trial began.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn42\" id=\"fn42_ref\">42</a> In response to the jury's request that the trial occur five days per week, they requested that trial occur only four days per week. Moreover, much of the time devoted to the government's case consisted of the vigorous and lengthy cross-examination to which the defense subjected government witnesses. Finally, nearly all of the witnesses testified in Spanish and required the use of interpreters, which contributed significantly to the length of the trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's presentation was not repetitive. For example, although Enriquez (the senior vice president of the mortgage department) and Kareh (the assistant vice president of the construction loan department) both testified at length about the same projects, Kareh offered more detailed information about the loans themselves, while Enriquez provided insight into appellants' knowledge about the loans and whether appellants provided certain information to the Board. Although appellants can point to instances in which the same story was told more than once, such repetition often encompassed new and relevant details, and was not unduly frequent given the complexity of the violations alleged and the length of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is no indication that the length of the trial and the arguably cumulative nature of the evidence affected the outcome of the trial in any way. In fact, the jury convicted the four appellants while acquitting Enrique Guti&#233;rrez on all counts, which suggests that the jury was able to carefully weigh the evidence against each defendant. <i>See United States v. LiCausi,</i> 167 F.3d 36, 49 (1st Cir.1999)(explaining that a jury's acquittal of one defendant on two counts indicates that it \"was not prevented from making reliable judgments about guilt or innocence\"). Given appellants' failure to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the length of the trial, we find no due process violation under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim that, throughout the trial, the prosecutor made disparaging and misleading comments that prejudiced the jury against them and require us to vacate their convictions. The district court denied motions for a mistrial on such grounds on at least six occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must first resolve the threshold question of whether these comments were improper. <i>Darden v. Wainwright,</i> 477 U.S. 168, 180-81, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986). If we answer that question in the affirmative, we must determine whether the impropriety warrants vacating the convictions. The issue is not whether \"`the prosecutors' remarks were undesirable or even universally condemned'\"; rather, \"[t]he relevant question is whether the prosecutors' comments `so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464 (citations omitted). We have held that the relevant factors include: \"(1) whether the prosecutor's misconduct was isolated and/or deliberate; (2) whether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary instruction; and (3) whether any prejudice surviving the court's instruction likely could have affected the outcome of the case.\" <i>United States v. Auch,</i> 187 F.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir.1999). We may overturn the convictions only if \"the prosecutor's misguided tactic . . . could have affected the outcome of the trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Disparagement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants first object to comments, made in the presence of the jury, that they term \"disparagement.\" For example, the prosecutor, on one occasion, stated that defense counsel \"just lied to the court\" and referred to his statement as a \"misrepresentation.\" On another occasion, the prosecutor asked the court to \"please direct [defense counsel] to refrain from his offensive odious comment that [has] characterized [] this trial,\" concluding, \"I don't think that I need to endure this sort of treatment from him.\" On several occasions, the prosecutor interrupted defense counsel's objections with such comments as \"say something new,\" and \"Improper question. First year law school. Improper question.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such comments are unfortunate and unprofessional. However, the trial was highly contentious, and the record reveals that appellants' trial counsel made a number of similar comments. Although such exchanges between the prosecution and defense occurred intermittently, their impact was diluted by the length of the trial. Immediately following such exchanges, the court usually commented on their inappropriateness. For example, the court on one occasion ordered \"all counsel to measure their words, measure their conduct, and measure their civility towards each other,\" noting, \"I have observed both sides step over the line.\" On another occasion the court admonished counsel for improper comments and stated: \"And by counsel I included both sides. This is not an admonition to one side or the other, both sides are included.\" Such statements from the court adequately informed the jury that such conduct was inappropriate and assigned blame equally to both sides. Finally, any prejudice that resulted from the prosecutor's role in these exchanges and survived the court's instruction could not have influenced the outcome in this case because, as we explained in Section III, <i>supra,</i> the evidence of appellants' guilt was overwhelming. Thus, the prosecutor's occasional remarks in this long and contentious trial, although unfortunate, did not infect the trial with such unfairness as to make the resulting convictions a denial of due process. <i>Darden,</i> 477 U.S. at 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Misleading Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also assert that the prosecutors made misleading statements and referred to information outside the record. Many of appellants' characterizations of the prosecution's presentation are simply inaccurate. For example, appellants claim that the prosecutor falsely stated that Lugo (the Board president) had testified that the Board was not told of Modules' performance history, when Lugo had at most said he could not remember those statements. This claim is unsupported by the record. Lugo in fact testified: \"I don't recall that it was discussed. I believe that if it was discussed I would remember and it is not reflected in the minutes. . . . The best of my recollection is that it was not discussed.\" In another instance, appellants protest that the prosecutor improperly suggested to Joseph Gonzalez (an examiner for the Federal Home Loan Bank) that bank management, rather than the Board, was responsible for Caguas' lending practices, when in fact the prosecutor only elicited testimony that the Board relied on Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n to provide information relevant to its decisions, and often accepted Mu&#241;oz-Franco's recommendations regarding these decisions. Such comments were not improper, let alone prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other instances, even if we found the challenged statements improper, any resulting prejudice was negated either by appellants' own cross-examination or by a curative instruction from the district court. For example, appellants assert that the prosecution elicited testimony from Montilla (the developer on the Jardines de Villa Alba project) that Caguas sued him but then dismissed its claim, when in fact the bank settled with Montilla and obtained title to all but one of the Jardines de Villa Alba lots.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> However, appellants then elicited the terms of the settlement on cross-examination, remedying any prejudice. On another occasion, the court addressed defense counsel's allegations that the prosecution's closing argument mentioned loans not charged in the indictment and mischaracterized Victor Kareh's testimony with a detailed curative instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, any impact resulting from these alleged misleading statements must be evaluated in light of the overwhelming evidence presented at this fifteen-month trial. Under such circumstances, we again conclude that the prosecutor's comments could not have caused unfairness that resulted in a denial of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Jury Instruction on Misapplication</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the jury instructions improperly permitted the jury to convict them on the misapplication charge if it found them merely reckless. We review de novo a claim that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the intent necessary to support a conviction. <i>United States v. Woodward,</i> 149 F.3d 46, 68-69 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p173\">\n      <span class=\"num\">173</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contested instruction stated that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p174\">\n      <span class=\"num\">174</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">that the defendants acted with the intent to injure, defraud or deceive the bank. You may also consider whether defendants acted recklessly, that is, in reckless disregard of the interests of the bank. If you find that defendants acted recklessly, with respect to the alleged misapplications, you may find that the defendants acted with intent to injure, defraud or deceive the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p175\">\n      <span class=\"num\">175</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relying on a Fifth Circuit case, <i>United States v. Adamson,</i> 700 F.2d 953, 965 (5th Cir.1983), appellants contend that, contrary to this instruction, reckless behavior is insufficient to establish misapplication under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 657.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn46\" id=\"fn46_ref\">46</a> Contrary to the Fifth Circuit, however, we have specifically held that \"`the sine qua non of charges of willful misapplication of bank funds is action taken with the knowledge of harm to, intent to harm, <i>or reckless disregard for,</i> the financial health of the bank.'\" <i>United States v. Brennan,</i> 994 F.2d 918, 923 (1st Cir.1993)(emphasis added)(quoting <i>United States v. Fusaro,</i> 708 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1983)); <i>see also United States v. London,</i> 66 F.3d 1227, 1241 (1st Cir. 1995)(\"[T]he cases applying &#167; 656 [the misapplication statute that deals with banks rather than savings and loans institutions] . . . have generally held reckless disregard to establish the requisite intent to defraud.\"); <i>United States v.

The Guti&#233;rrez Loans</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the relevant time period charged in the Third Superseding Indictment, Mu&#241;oz-Franco was President and Chief Executive Officer of Caguas Central Federal Savings Bank of Puerto Rico (\"Caguas\"), a federally chartered savings and loan association. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n was Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer of Caguas. Guti&#233;rrez was a land developer who owned several companies that received loans from Caguas. Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez was an officer of several companies belonging to Guti&#233;rrez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For nearly a decade, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n supervised a scheme to use proceeds from various loans for purposes not authorized by Caguas' Board of Directors (\"Board\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The loans were granted for land development projects involving companies that Guti&#233;rrez owned and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez helped to operate, including Transglobe, Modules, and Transhore. In many instances the appellants used proceeds from loans to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies to make payments on prior loans to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies without Board approval. In other instances Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n submitted loans to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies to the Board for approval without disclosing the Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies' failure to complete work on previous projects. On many occasions Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted certifications for construction work that had not yet been completed, and Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n accepted the certifications and ordered disbursement of funds for the projects. The Board also was not informed of this practice. In January 1988, Mu&#241;oz-Franco drafted and obtained Board approval to send a letter to Richard Denby, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board auditor supervising Caguas, which responded to Denby's concerns regarding Caguas' lending practices (\"Denby letter\"). The letter contained many misrepresentations regarding the status of Guti&#233;rrez-related projects and loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the government explained in its opening statement, this scheme contributed to the appearance that Caguas remained a financially viable institution under the leadership of Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n. If the problems with the bank became known and Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n were removed from their positions, \"not only would that have deprived them of a very lucrative job, but it also would have made it very difficult for them to obtain new employment in the banking industry.\" The scheme also maintained the appearance of solvency for the Guti&#233;rrez companies, thus protecting the livelihood and professional reputation of Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The projects for which Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies received loans included La Marina, Los Mameyes, Cerrovista, and Jardines de Villa Alba. We provide a brief overview of these projects here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. La Marina</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1980, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n caused Caguas to grant a $1,450,000 loan to Transglobe to finance the construction of seventy-five units of residential housing, with construction to begin within one month and to be completed within one year. As of September 1981, the loan limit had been increased four times, adding a total of $1.8 million, yet not a single house had been built. Funds were disbursed from the loan for the project based on certifications submitted by Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez and approved by S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, and approximately $2 million was used to pay unrelated Guti&#233;rrez debts with a different bank. In October 1984, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n caused Caguas to finance the sale of the La Marina project to DO.W Group. The agreement for this sale provided that Transglobe would remain the contractor for the project despite its failure to build a single house in the preceding four years. In approving the loan, the Board was not informed of Transglobe's prior poor performance. After this sale, appellants continued to apply funds from the La Marina loan to other projects and to disburse funds for work not completed. Not a single house was ever built on the project, and, in 1989, Caguas entered into a settlement agreement with DO.W releasing DO.W's debt on the project, which totaled over $2 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Los Mameyes</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In late 1985, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n caused the Board to grant Modules a commercial line of credit to build two hundred housing units. Between December 1985 and March 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted a series of certifications stating that a total of two hundred housing units had been built. Even though Caguas' inspector reported that only fifty-five units had been completed, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n approved disbursements totaling about $800,000. In March 1986 Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted a certification requesting $69,000 for \"payment of subcontractors,\" but attached a list of interest payments due on the Jardines de Villa Alba, Levittown, Country Club, La Marina, and Los Caciques projects totalling exactly $69,000. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n approved the certification and Caguas disbursed the funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Cerrovista</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1986, John Burns, a developer, applied to Caguas for a loan to build residential housing on land he owned but his application was denied. After meeting with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez and agreeing to use Modules as a contractor, Caguas approved Burns' application for a loan to build twenty-three units of housing in what became known as the Cerrovista project. Burns' loan was approved on the condition that he sign a $2 million note as a down payment to Modules. Burns signed the note. Shortly thereafter, however, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez told Burns that the project needed a new \"sponsor\" because Burns had been \"gossiping.\" Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez then began to negotiate the sale of Cerrovista to Iantho, a company owned by Walter Frambes. In August or September 1986, Burns read newspaper articles indicating that the Cerrovista project might be affected by the Puerto Rico Department of Transportation's plans to build a hospital and an expressway. He inquired with the Department and received confirmation that the development of four lots would be \"frozen.\" When Burns brought this information to Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez told him to \"hide it, boy.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1986, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n received Board approval to offer Iantho an $8.9 million loan, specifying that $1,412,177 would be used to purchase land for the Cerrovista project. The sale was then finalized on September 28. However, the actual land cost was only $480,000, and the remaining $932,000 was used to make principal and interest payments on other loans to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies. Over the next few months Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted certifications showing approximately $908,000 for \"premanufacture\" of housing units, and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n authorized disbursement of these funds. As of May 1988, however, not a single unit had been built on the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">d. Jardines de Villa Alba</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1985, a developer named Emilio Montilla sought financing to build housing units on land he owned, and Caguas repeatedly denied his requests. Montilla then met with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, who told him that if he used Modules as a contractor his request would be approved. In July 1985, the Board considered a proposed loan to Montilla with Modules as contractor. Although by this time Modules had failed to perform on the La Marina project for several years, the Board was not informed of this information when it considered the Jardines de Villa Alba project. Moreover, over $231,000 was disbursed before the Jardines de Villa Alba loan agreement was signed. Although the Board eventually approved the loan, this prior disbursement took place without Board knowledge or approval. Only one unit was ever completed on the Jardines de Villa Alba project. However, the Board was not informed of this fact. The Denby letter, which was drafted by Mu&#241;oz-Franco in January 1988 and signed by the Board members, refers to the \"units\" completed on this project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Mirandes Loans</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As will be described in more detail in our sufficiency discussion, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n supervised a similar scheme to use loan proceeds for purposes not authorized by the Board with respect to companies owned by Francisco Mirandes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Mirandes received construction loans from Caguas for at least fourteen different projects. In December 1989, the Mirandes corporations collapsed due to insolvency, owing Caguas a total of $23 million. In 1997, Mirandes pled guilty to charges of participating in a conspiracy to defraud Caguas, the Board, and the regulatory institution, and to misapplication of bank funds. As part of his plea agreement, he testified for the government at appellants' trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Procedural History</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 22, 1995, the government filed an indictment charging appellants with conspiracy, bank fraud, misapplication of bank funds, and making false entries. Three superseding indictments subsequently were filed on March 5, 1997; May 13, 1997; and March 6, 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The third superseding indictment charged Mu&#241;oz-Franco, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, Guti&#233;rrez, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, Enrique Guti&#233;rrez (Ariel Guti&#233;rrez's brother, who was also involved in running the Guti&#233;rrez corporations), and Rafael Dom&#237;nguez Wolff (who purchased several projects from the Guti&#233;rrez brothers)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> with bank fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344; conspiracy to commit bank fraud, misapply bank funds, and make false entries, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; and misapplication of bank funds, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 657. The indictment also charged Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n with bank fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 and conspiracy under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371 with respect to the Mirandes loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial began in federal district court in Puerto Rico in January 2001 and the presentation of evidence concluded in April 2002. On May 16, 2002, the jury convicted Mu&#241;oz-Franco, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, Ariel Guti&#233;rrez, and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez on all charged counts, but acquitted Enrique Guti&#233;rrez. Following the verdict, appellants filed motions for a judgment of acquittal pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29, raising numerous grounds, including the sufficiency of the evidence. In a thoughtful seventy-seven page opinion, the district court denied all of the motions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sentencing proceedings began on December 15, 2003. On February 12, 2004, the district court sentenced Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n to a term of forty-six months on the conspiracy and bank fraud counts and a concurrent term of sixty months on the misapplication count. It also imposed a fine of $50,000 on each defendant. The court sentenced Guti&#233;rrez to a term of thirty-seven months on the conspiracy and bank fraud counts, and imposed a concurrent term of sixty months on the misapplication count. It also imposed a $60,000 fine. Finally, it sentenced Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez to a term of twenty-four months on all counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Issues on Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants raise thirteen major issues for our consideration on appeal. Three of these claims&#8212;concerning the statute of limitations, the Ex Post Facto Clause, and the pre-indictment and pre-trial delay&#8212;implicate what might be termed the validity of the entire proceedings. Although courts often begin by addressing such issues, we find, in light of the exceptionally large record, that we must review the sufficiency of the evidence in order to assess the viability of any of appellants' other claims. Thus, we will first resolve two evidentiary issues to determine the content of the record properly before us. We will then employ that record in conducting our analysis of the sufficiency of the evidence. Informed by a full understanding of the record, we will then turn to the host of other issues raised by appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with two evidentiary issues: whether the district court allowed witnesses to testify beyond their personal knowledge, and whether the minutes from the Board meetings were improperly admitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Personal Knowledge</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the district court improperly permitted prosecution witnesses to testify beyond their personal knowledge, in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 602. Rule 602 states, in pertinent part: \"A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is introduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal knowledge of the matter.\" Fed.R.Evid. 602. Interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a question of law subject to de novo review, but the application of a rule is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v.

Arturo Somohano</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that Arturo Somohano (the vice president of Caguas' commercial loan department until 1988, at which time he became Caguas' chief lending officer) testified beyond his personal knowledge on three occasions: (1) in claiming that the bank's outside auditors were replaced for improper reasons; (2) in stating that Caguas' loan classifications for the loans to Modules were improper; and (3) in questioning the propriety of certain construction loans. The district court excluded the first of these statements after appellants objected, and we therefore do not consider it further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Somohano's testimony that Caguas' loan classifications for Modules were improper, appellants objected on the ground that Somohano had previously stated that he was unaware of the bank's classifications for those loans. Somohano acknowledged that he did not remember seeing the loan classifications for Modules while at Caguas, but his testimony did not rely on such knowledge of Modules' status. Instead, Somohano explained that loans at Caguas were classified from one (best) to ten (worst) based on the amount of risk involved in the loan, and that the bank would attach greater reserves to riskier loans. While still on the witness stand, Somohano then reviewed financial statements indicating that Modules had a negative net worth of $7.6 million at the end of 1986, and that Caguas' reserves would not cover the loans to Modules because the reserves equalled only ten or fifteen percent of the loans Modules was sustaining. Based strictly on the amount of reserves, Somohano would expect the Modules loan to have received a favorable classification of either two or three; however, he testified that, based on Modules' \"insolvent\" financial status, such classification would have been improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Federal Rule of Evidence 701, a lay witness may offer opinions that are \"(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness, (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\" Fed.R.Evid. 701.

Somohano's opinions about the loans were based on his firsthand observations of Caguas' practices with respect to these loans. He testified that, when the Modules loan was restructured, he did not think Caguas ever would be repaid, and he provided other examples of Guti&#233;rrez loans receiving special treatment. Given Somohano's banking experience and his particular knowledge about the Guti&#233;rrez loans, his testimony about these loans also was properly admissible as a lay opinion within the scope of Rule 701. Consequently, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court's handling of Somohano's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Anabel Enriquez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also argue that Anabel Enriquez (the senior vice president of Caguas' mortgage department from 1980-87, who reported directly to S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n) testified beyond her personal knowledge when she stated, based on her review of the minutes of Board and Executive Committee meetings, that certain information was not discussed at the meetings that should have been discussed. This objection is unfounded. At trial, Enriquez read the Board meeting minutes into evidence, including minutes for meetings at which she was not present. Appellants objected, and, after considerable debate, the district court ruled \"that [Enriquez] may literally read what each paragraph [of the minutes] says. If the United States then wants an explanation as to the paragraph she must then have an independent source of knowledge.\" Thus, Enriquez did not testify whether certain events actually happened at a Board meeting unless she was present; for meetings she did not attend, she testified only \"whether the minutes reflect\" that certain information was discussed. The district court enforced this limitation, and required the prosecutor to rephrase questions on more than one occasion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Similarly, Enriquez's testimony that the Board \"should have been told\" certain information was a lay opinion properly admitted under Rule 701. Her position as a senior vice president of Caguas' mortgage department and her regular attendance at Board meetings established her familiarity with Caguas' business operations and made it appropriate for her testify about information the Board needed to make its decisions. Again, the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing such testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Victor Lugo</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of its case, the government sought to prove that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n concealed material information relating to the Guti&#233;rrez loans from the Board. Victor Lugo, the Board president, offered testimony that he was not told or was not aware of significant information. Appellants claim that Lugo's testimony showed that he had no independent recollection of the events in question, some of which occurred nearly twenty years before trial. However, appellants misconstrue Lugo's testimony about his own memory. For example, when asked whether he was informed of Modules' performance history when the Board was making decisions on the company's loans in July 1985, he stated: \"I don't recall that it was discussed. I believe that if it was discussed I would remember and it is not reflected in the minutes.\" Similarly, when asked whether the number of houses built on Modules projects was discussed when the Board was again making decisions on the loans in September 1986, he stated definitively: \"No ... that was not discussed.\" These statements show that Lugo had sufficient recall to testify from his personal knowledge about the information given to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also complain that the government improperly suggested the truth of hypothetical scenarios presented in certain questions to Lugo. The purpose of these questions was to probe whether the Board would have considered Guti&#233;rrez companies' past performance in deciding to approve later loans. For example, the prosecutor asked Lugo: \"[I]f the Guti&#233;rrez company, out of these 96 [housing] units only built 22, would that have been information . . . which you would have been interested in knowing for purposes of voting on the approval of this loan?\" The court explained at sidebar that it would only allow such hypotheticals when the government had already introduced evidence that was the basis for the hypothetical &#8212;specifically, when \"there is a document from the bank that clearly establishes a certain fact.\" It also instructed the jurors that they should not take the facts that were the basis for the hypotheticals as true:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Okay. The fact that the Court has authorized that question, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, does not mean . . . that the Court is concluding it is a foregoing fact that you should take those facts as true. Those facts are subject to your analysis and your credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other words, you have to decide in your deliberations whether or not this project called for 96 houses and you have to decide whether or not actually 22 were built or whatever number was built, that is subject to your credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that the Court is authorizing that this question be expressed in these terms does not at all mean that the Court has already determined that it is a fact at all. You have to decide. That's one of the issues that you're going to have to decide in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court reiterated this instruction several times. This detailed instruction was sufficient to advise the jury that it should not accept the facts set forth in the hypotheticals as true. Thus, Lugo's response to these questions did not have the effect of allowing him to testify beyond his personal knowledge to the factual correctness of the hypothetical. The district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing such testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. Victor Kareh</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellants assert that Victor Kareh (the assistant vice president of the construction loan department from 1980 to 1990) \"was permitted . . . to opine about what the project documents and ledger cards indicated, without any clear memory of the events and mixing summary testimony with what was improper expert testimony.\" To support this proposition, appellants cite to three thirty-page sections of the trial transcript, without specifying the testimony to which they object or the grounds for their objections. Although Kareh did not author all of the documents about which he testified, this in itself is not a basis for excluding his testimony about the documents. Without developed argumentation on this issue, we cannot conclude that the district court abused its discretion in allowing Kareh's testimony. <i>United States v.

Appellants argue that the minutes were intended to be a summary, rather than an exhaustive record, of the events that took place at Board meetings, and that, consequently, the minutes do not indicate whether such information was disclosed to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Evidence 803(7) states that the rule against hearsay does not exclude</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[e]vidence that a matter is not included in the . . . records . . . kept in accordance with the provisions of [Fed.

We think this repetition indicates that even if a business record is deemed sufficiently trustworthy to be admissible for its contents under Rule 803(6), other circumstances might render omissions in that record untrustworthy to show that the events omitted did not occur. Thus, appellants' concession that the records are admissible under Rule 803(6) does not necessarily preclude them from arguing that omissions from the records are not admissible under Rule 803(7).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government introduced testimony from Enriquez, the vice-president who reported directly to S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, explaining that the minutes were prepared by one of the executive vice presidents before 1982, by Luis Pastor (an administrative assistant to Mu&#241;oz-Franco) from 1982 to 1986, and by Enriquez after that time. Enriquez stated that the records prior to 1982 \"were prepared and reviewed by the board, they were set forth in a record book and the secretary of the board and the president would sign them.\" The government submitted an affidavit from Pastor, dated March 21, 2001, verifying that the documents it introduced were, in fact, the minutes from 1982 to 1986 and explaining that the minutes \"consist of transcriptions made from notes taken by someone who was present at each meeting\" and that the minutes \"were kept in the regular course of business of Caguas . . . .

And upon that review, if there was something I did not understand then I could ask the president.\" Enriquez noted that the minutes \"were always ratified at the following board meeting,\" and that, after ratification, the minutes would be stored either in the president's office or in the bank vault.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants emphasize that Lugo (the president of the Board) acknowledged on cross-examination that the minutes were only a summary of the meetings and did not \"word for word report discussions.\" However, a review of the Board and Executive Committee minutes reveals that, while not word for word renditions of the meetings, the minutes capture more than a skeletal outline of each meeting and include descriptions of the considerations relevant to each loan rather than simply the fact that the loan was discussed and approved.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After considering this evidence, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the use of the minutes to demonstrate that the Board did not receive material information about many of the transactions it considered. Enriquez's testimony and Pastor's affidavit demonstrate that the business records were prepared regularly after every meeting, reviewed and ratified by the Board, and stored securely following ratification. These circumstances do not indicate lack of trustworthiness. Indeed, they permit a finding of trustworthiness. Moreover, given the minutes' thorough description of information discussed at the meetings, we conclude that the missing information relating to the loan transactions was a \"matter . . . of a kind of which a memorandum, report, record, or data compilation was regularly made and preserved.\" Fed.

Mu&#241;oz-Franco supported S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's recommendations on these projects. At trial, Lugo, the president of the Board of Directors, explained that he and the other Board members relied on the reports prepared by Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n in making decisions regarding loans. Lugo explained that it was not his job to \"verify the accuracy of information that was being given\" to him by the management of the bank, and added that he \"trusted fully that the information that was being provided me was whole and true.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite their responsibility to keep the Board fully apprised, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n concealed important information on many occasions. For example, in July 1985 Caguas considered the Jardines de Villa Alba project, for which Modules would be the contractor. As of October 29, 1984, Modules had completed none of the 212 units planned for the La Marina project, even though the original loan agreement from June 25, 1980 called for construction to begin in thirty days and for seventy-five units to be completed within twelve months. Despite the lack of progress, the loan amount had been increased four times between August 7, 1980 and September 17, 1981. Lugo testified that this poor performance history was not discussed during the loan presentation for the Jardines de Villa Alba project. Lugo stated unequivocally that he would have wanted to know Modules' performance history in evaluating the Jardines de Villa Alba loan, demonstrating the materiality of such information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo further testified that, after the original loan presentation, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n continued to withhold information from the Board regarding the Jardines de Villa Alba loan. Although the record shows $231,000 was paid to Modules before the Jardines de Villa Alba loan agreement was signed, even at trial Lugo expressed surprise that this had happened and stated that \"it would have been difficult for me to believe that\" this occurred. More than a year after the Jardines de Villa Alba loan was approved, in September 1986, Lugo did not know that only one house had been built on the project. Lugo also testified that as of September 1986 the performance history of Modules \"as to construction of homes that were to be constructed versus the ones that were constructed . . . was not discussed.\" Finally, on January 10, 1988, Lugo signed the Denby letter, which was prepared by Mu&#241;oz-Franco and which referred to the \"units\" built on Jardines de Villa Alba, without realizing that only one house had been built on the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo also testified that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n did not inform him and the Board of other material information relating to Modules. For example, he did not know that Modules remained the contractor after the La Marina, Country Club, and Levittown projects were sold from Transglobe to DO.W in October 1984. He also did not know that, between 1984 and 1986, Modules did not make any principal or interest payment on any loan to Caguas with funds generated from its own business as opposed to proceeds from other loans. Likewise, he was not informed, when the Board approved the sale of Modules to Camero on September 10, 1986, in conjunction with a restructuring of its loans, that approximately seventy percent of Modules' debt was with Caguas and that over seventy-one percent of Modules' assets were intangibles.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Lugo testified that when the board approved a loan of $1,412,077 for land acquisition for the Cerrovista project, for which Modules also was the contractor, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n did not advise him or the Board that the cost of the land was actually only $480,000&#8212;in other words, that $932,177 would be used to make principal and interest payments on other Modules loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lugo's testimony is corroborated by the absence of this and other material information from the Board minutes. Although the government did not rely heavily on the absence of such information, we have found these omissions properly admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(7) and note that they lend support to the prosecution's case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was substantial evidence that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n withheld all of this information from the Board with full knowledge of the problems with Modules and other Guti&#233;rrez companies. Anabel Enriquez, who reported directly to S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, explained that the handling of Guti&#233;rrez certifications at Caguas concerned her \"[b]ecause practically monthly, each time they invoiced[,] the certifications would be ahead of the construction.\" She discussed her concerns with Mu&#241;oz-Franco at least by the time La Marina was going to be sold to DO.W in 1984, and with S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n around the same time. She also discussed her concern with Mu&#241;oz-Franco that, following the sale, Modules would remain a contractor for La Marina, Levittown, and Country Club. However, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n took no action in response to Enriquez's concerns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n took steps to conceal their misrepresentations from both internal and external auditors. Juan Hern&#225;ndez, Caguas' internal auditor, testified that, in 1981, Kareh (the assistant vice president of the construction loan department) initially provided information in connection with an audit of the construction loan department, but, after a short meeting with S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, Kareh stopped providing the information Hern&#225;ndez requested. Hern&#225;ndez further testified that, although he requested the auditing committee \"several times\" between 1980 and 1990 to allow him to audit the construction loan department, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n did not allow the audit to take place. In a letter dated January 22, 1985, an external auditing firm, Stephen P. Bradics and Company, recommended \"that the scope of internal auditing be expanded to include . . . construction loans.\" After Caguas received this letter, Hern&#225;ndez again recommended to the audit committee on several occasions that he should be allowed to audit the construction department, but he still was not allowed to do so. The audit committee minutes reflect his recommendation at several meetings at which Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n were present. At one meeting, on January 28, 1988, Mu&#241;oz-Franco responded by telling Hern&#225;ndez that \"construction loans was the area most audited by senior management.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n heard and agreed with Mu&#241;oz-Franco's response, and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n had also made similar statements to Hern&#225;ndez in the past. However, Hern&#225;ndez was never provided with any internal audit conducted by either Mu&#241;oz-Franco or S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n also concealed information regarding Caguas' lending practices from external authorities. Critically, Mu&#241;oz-Franco drafted and obtained Board approval to send the Denby letter, which states: \"This Board of Directors wishes to state in no unclear and uncertain terms that it has never considered and much less approved any policy or practice of permitting borrowers to use construction loan proceeds to satisfy or make interest payment[s] on other unrelated loans.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a> At the time of the letter, however, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n had, as discussed above, approved loans for such purposes on many occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence demonstrates that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n repeatedly concealed material information regarding the status of the Guti&#233;rrez loans from the Board, approved disbursements for work that was not completed, and prevented audits. Such conduct caused Caguas to continue lending money to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies despite the companies' financial instability, which demonstrates appellants' knowing scheme to defraud Caguas by means of material misrepresentations within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344. Consequently, we affirm the district court's finding that a rational jury could have found Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n guilty of bank fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record also contained considerable evidence from which a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez knowingly engaged in a scheme to defraud Caguas by misrepresenting material information. The certifications they submitted and signed contained many misrepresentations. For example, on the Los Mameyes project, between December 9, 1985 and January 10, 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted nine certifications attesting to the manufacture of 74 housing units and requesting payments totaling $380,000, even though the inspector's report stated that only 19 houses had been built. Between January 16 and February 21, 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted 10 more certifications attesting to the manufacture of 90 additional housing units and requesting payment of approximately $500,000, at which point payment had been disbursed for at least 164 housing units even though only 40 units had been manufactured. As of February 25, 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez had certified the completion of 200 units, but an inspection report dated March 23, 1986, indicated that only 55 units had been built. On March 31, 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted a certification requesting $69,000 for \"payment of subcontractors\" along with a list of interest payments they had made on other projects, including Jardines de Villa Alba, Levittown, Country Club, La Marina, and Los Caciques, which equalled exactly $69,000. Finally, on June 26, 1986, Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted a \"special certification\" of $85,000 with no justification for work allegedly completed; Kareh testified that such a certification was not a usual practice. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n authorized the disbursements based on these certifications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted similar certifications for work not completed on other projects. For example, on the Jardines de Villa Alba project, Modules had installed only one unit as of the time of the Denby letter on January 10, 1988; however, on October 22, 1985 Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez certified that twenty-two units had been completed, causing $626,000 to be disbursed to Modules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez perpetuated their scheme by recruiting other developers to obtain loans from Caguas on the condition that they use Modules as the contractor. This conduct allowed Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez to obtain new funding for Modules, which they would then use to pay down prior loans and keep Modules from collapsing. Developer Burns, the original owner of the Cerrovista project, was a typical example. After unsuccessfully applying to Caguas for a loan to build residential housing on land he owned, Burns met with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, who told him that if he used Modules as his contractor and signed a $2 million note he would be approved for a loan. A week later Burns received financing for the Cerrovista project. He testified that the approval was \"[d]efinitely[] because of the use of Modules.\" Burns met with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez on \"many other occasions,\" and, after problems arose with the Cerrovista project, with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n in S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's office. Subsequently, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez told Burns that the project would be sold to Iantho, and explained that \"this project was going to contribute to paying off some interest for some of the projects that were in default,\" which caused Burns to understand \"that was the reason . . . I was rejected as sponsor.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn18\" id=\"fn18_ref\">18</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 10, 1986, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n presented, and the Board approved, a loan of $8.9 million to Iantho Corporation to take over the Cerrovista project; the loan agreement specified that Modules would be the contractor for the project's two hundred units. Burns testified that, around the time the project was being sold, he received confirmation that the Department of Transportation's plans to build a hospital and expressway would cause the development of four lots of the project to be \"frozen.\" When told the news, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez responded, \"hide it, boy.\" On September 28, 1986, Cerrovista was sold to Iantho with no mention of the impending development.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence shows that Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez knowingly concealed information relevant to the viability of the Cerrovista project and submitted many certifications for work that was not completed. To sustain their schemes, they recruited other developers and helped them receive funding from Caguas on the condition that these developers use Modules as a contractor. These activities caused Caguas to continue lending money to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies despite the companies' financial instability, providing an ample basis for a jury to find that appellants knowingly schemed to defraud Caguas by means of material misrepresentations within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344. Consequently, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that both Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez were guilty of bank fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B.

In considering appellants' motion for judgment of acquittal, the district court found that there was more than enough evidence with respect to bank fraud to sustain the conspiracy conviction, and thus did not review the evidence concerning the misapplication and false entry crimes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court's assessment. First, there was substantial evidence of an agreement among the four men to defraud the bank. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n directly supervised the Guti&#233;rrez loans and worked closely with Mu&#241;oz-Franco on the loans. Enriquez testified that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n always reached an agreement regarding the treatment of these loans. Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez submitted many certifications for work not yet completed, and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n then repeatedly approved disbursements for this work. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n also facilitated Guti&#233;rrez's efforts to secure new borrowers by ensuring that a loan would be approved if Modules was used as a contractor. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez met frequently regarding the status of the Guti&#233;rrez companies. Burns testified, for example, that he met with Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez many times in S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's office regarding the Cerrovista project. Finally, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n failed to disclose material information to the Board on many occasions, and this joint failure further demonstrates their collaboration in defrauding the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the many instances of concealing the Guti&#233;rrez companies' performance from the Board of Directors, submitting certifications for work not completed, authorizing disbursements for such work and preventing audits, a reasonable jury could easily find the other two elements of conspiracy: that appellants knew of and participated voluntarily in the conspiracy, and that each committed overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. Viewed as a whole, this synchronized pattern of conduct demonstrates appellants' agreement to maintain the appearance of financial viability of the Guti&#233;rrez corporations by securing new loans to make payments on outstanding loans. Thus, we find that a reasonable jury could have found each element of conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt with respect to each of the four appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Misapplication of Bank Funds</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury found all four appellants guilty of misapplication of bank funds under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 657 for a single transaction related to the Cerrovista project. The crime of misapplication eludes easy definition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn20\" id=\"fn20_ref\">20</a> As we have previously noted, \"[t]he problem that has confronted and perplexed the courts is that there is no statutory definition or common law heritage that gives content to the phrase `willfully misapplies.'\" <i>United States v. Wester,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196877\"><a href=\"/opinion/196877/united-states-v-wester/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">592</span></a></span>, 595 (1st Cir.1996). However, we have held that misapplication has two key elements: (1) wrongful use of bank funds; and (2) intent to injure or defraud a bank. <i>Blasini-Lluberas,</i> 169 F.3d at 63. We have also explained that \"the same facts can easily be the basis for deeming the conduct to be wrongful and the intent fraudulent; both misapplication and scienter are required.\" <i>Wester,</i> 90 F.3d at 595. Finally, the misapplication statute applies only to officers, agents, and employees of a bank. Thus, appellants who do not hold one of these positions&#8212;here Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez&#8212;may not be convicted as principals for misapplication, but may be convicted as aiders and abettors. <i>See Giragosian v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"268775\"><a href=\"/opinion/268775/george-giragosian-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></a></span>, 167 (1st Cir.1965)(\"Since [defendant] was not an officer, director, agent or employee of the bank, he could not be guilty as a principal . . . for misapplication of the bank's funds, but only as an aider and abettor.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A reasonable jury could have concluded that appellants' handling of the Cerrovista loan constituted misapplication. The original loan offering, which was prepared according to S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's instructions, designated $1,412,177 for land costs and $855,323 for \"partial assumption of other loans.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> This document did not disclose the purpose for which the funds were actually used. Of the $1,412,177 designated for land, only $480,000 was used to purchase land for the project. The remaining $932,177 was disbursed to the Guti&#233;rrez-owned Quintas de Humacao company and immediately applied to other Guti&#233;rrez projects: principal and interest on the Quintas de Fajardo loan, interest on the Las Gaviotas loan, and interest on a Modules commercial loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The documents associated with the Cerrovista loan demonstrate appellants' intent to defraud Caguas by redirecting these funds. Although the settlement statement<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn23\" id=\"fn23_ref\">23</a> for the Cerrovista loan, dated September 29, 1986, lists a disbursement of $932,177 for \"repayment of other loan\" and lists the payee as \"Quintas de Humacao Inc. &amp; Caguas Federal Savings,\" these disclosures appear in a markedly different type, as does the total loan amount. Kareh testified that this different type indicates that \"the entry was made later or at another place,\" allowing an inference that the document was amended to make it appear that the Board had approved the use of loan proceeds to make payments on other loans. This inference is bolstered by the fact that the loan settlement statement was not prepared until after the Board had approved a loan. Kareh also testified that, although the $855,323 amount designated for \"partial assumption of other loans\" was listed on the loan offering and disbursed on the date of closing, the $855,323 amount was omitted from the settlement statement at S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a> This omission concealed the fact that two <i>separate</i> disbursements, in the amounts of $932,177 and $855,323, were used to pay down other loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each appellant was sufficiently involved in concealing the use of funds to allow an inference of intent to defraud. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n drafted the original loan offering, which did not disclose that the $932,177 difference between the amount allocated for land purchase and the amount spent on land would be used to pay principal and interest on other loans. Moreover, according to Kareh, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n explicitly instructed him to omit the $855,323 amount from the loan settlement document. A jury could infer that Mu&#241;oz-Franco helped to conceal this wrongful use of funds, thereby intentionally defrauding Caguas, based on his supervisory role on the Guti&#233;rrez loans and his regular responsibility of conveying information to the Board. Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez were also involved in the wrongful use of funds: they endorsed the checks, accepted the funds, and immediately applied these funds to pay down their other loans with the bank. Although appellants assert that the loan settlement documents demonstrate that the transaction was disclosed to the Board, the record indicates that the loan settlement statement was prepared after the loan had already been approved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants attempt to counter the charge by segregating the activities relating to the Cerrovista loan into two separate transactions: the disbursement of the $932,177 land purchase differential to Quintas de Humacao, and the use of those funds to pay down other Guti&#233;rrez loans. They argue that, at the time the funds were disbursed to the Guti&#233;rrez-owned Quintas de Humacao, they ceased to be \"bank funds\" under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 657 and thus cannot support a misapplication violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find this technicality pertinent. The disbursement of funds from the Cerrovista loan to Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies, and the subsequent use of these loans to pay down other Guti&#233;rrez loans, was a single unified transaction. The district court explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The funds did not cease to be controlled by the express purpose for which they were disbursed. The fact the $932,177 check was endorsed does not change the express purpose for which said funds were to be used. The second transfer, the Guti&#233;rrez's endorsement back to Caguas Central for the repayment of four separate loans, is still the use of bank funds and subject to misapplication.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By expressly designating these funds for \"repayment of other loan[s],\" Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n retained control over the funds even if the funds nominally changed hands. Moreover, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n supervised the entire transaction, as demonstrated by four entries in Caguas' ledgers showing the transfer of funds to the Guti&#233;rrez accounts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Critically, appellants also ignore the separate concealment of the $855,323, which, although it was listed on the original loan application, was left off of the loan settlement statement of September 29, 1986 at S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n's explicit instruction. Although the disbursement of the $855,323 was disclosed to the Board, the fact that this disbursement was left off the loan settlement statement indicates the bank officials' efforts to conceal the fact that two separate disbursements, in the amounts of $855,323 and $932,177, were used to pay down other loans. In short, there was more than sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that appellants engaged in wrongful use of bank funds with the intent to defraud the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D. Bank Fraud with Respect to Mirandes Loans</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also found appellants Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n guilty of bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 with respect to the Mirandes loans. The Mirandes scheme involved many of the same elements as the Guti&#233;rrez loans. In September 1981, Mu&#241;oz-Franco asked Mirandes to take over ownership of a project called Reparto Valenciano, and Mirandes, then the contractor for the project, agreed. At the time the project was in debt to Caguas for $2.2 million, and delays and other problems continued after Mirandes assumed ownership. On an ongoing basis, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n supervised the transfer of funds from other projects to pay down the debt on the Reparto Valenciano project. For example, on September 30, 1986, approximately $2.2 million was applied to the Reparto Valenciano project from other Mirandes projects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n did not disclose these transfers of money among various Mirandes projects to the Board. After the Reparto Valenciano debt increased to $3.2 million, Mirandes received five contracts from the Puerto Rico Housing Department to build basic housing. Although Caguas initially denied Mirandes' application for funding for these projects, it subsequently agreed to finance the Villas de Gurabo project if Mirandes would agree to apply the profits of that project to the debt and interest of the Reparto Valenciano project. These transfers temporarily sustained the Mirandes projects, but the decreased funds available to successive projects ultimately made it impossible for those projects to be completed or to yield profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n were intimately involved with the administration of the Mirandes loans. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n met with Mirandes on many occasions, including, during one seven or eight month period, meetings every fifteen days. S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n was involved in most of the disbursements for the Mirandes projects, whereas for other loans he was typically involved only if a problem arose. Mu&#241;oz-Franco was also involved in the Mirandes loans: he originally met with Mirandes to get him to take over the loans, met with Mirandes several times thereafter, was regularly informed of the loans' progress, and reported on the loans' status to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Beginning thirty days after the Reparto Valenciano loan agreement was signed, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n authorized many certifications for completed work. With two exceptions, no work on the project had been completed at the time of the authorizations. On several occasions, a transfer of funds from one loan to another or an increase in the amount of a loan was authorized without the approval of the loan committee or the Board. Mirandes also testified that the disbursement schedule for loans \"normally . . . wasn't complied with because money was taken out to pay interest.\" Thus, the disbursement schedule that the Board approved was not the schedule that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n subsequently followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Enriquez testified such practices were not standard at Caguas; along with the Guti&#233;rrez loans, the Mirandes loans were the only ones for which disbursements were authorized for work that was not completed. According to Enriquez, the Mirandes projects commonly received \"special\" certifications, which meant that \"[w]hen one project didn't have a line [of credit] it would be taken from another project.\" When regular certifications were submitted, they would have an itemization of expenses attached; special certifications would not include such an itemization and thus would not disclose the destination of the funds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n also caused Caguas to finance the sale of land from one Mirandes company to another in order to pay interest on the Reparto Valenciano loan. On September 11, 1984, Mirandes' company Deproco purchased property for $60,000, and, three months later, sold the property to Bubao, another Mirandes company, for $94,000. The proceeds from the sale were used to pay interest on the Reparto Valenciano loan. The sale occurred despite the fact that, according to Mirandes, the land was not worth the purchase price and no improvements to the land were made in the interim. The minutes did not reflect that the Board was informed of the transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Mirandes was unable to improve the finances of the Reparto Valenciano project, he was awarded five projects from the Housing Department, including Villas de Gurabo, but was denied funding from Caguas. At that point, Mirandes met with Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n and asked to be released from the debt on the Reparto Valenciano project because he \"felt that the debt was not my problem\" and \"needed to seek financing for the project from another bank.\" Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n refused to release Mirandes from the debt. Subsequently, however, Kareh informed Mirandes that Caguas would give him financing on Villas de Gurabo, but that the proceeds from that loan would have to be used to pay off the debt on the Reparto Valenciano project. Mirandes reluctantly agreed, and this plan was implemented. Again, the minutes did not reflect that the Board was informed of this transaction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Denby letter provides further support for the jury's finding of fraud. Drafted and signed by Mu&#241;oz-Franco, it explicitly denies that Caguas' Board approved the practice of borrowers using construction loan proceeds to pay interest on unrelated loans. At the time of the letter, however, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n had on many occasions authorized the payment of debts on the Reparto Valenciano project with funds from other Mirandes loans. The fact that the Denby letter was signed by all the members of the Board would allow a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Mu&#241;oz-Franco misrepresented the practices associated with the Mirandes loans to the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circumstantial evidence of the requisite intent was bolstered by more explicit evidence of appellants' knowledge. Mirandes was concerned that, on the Reparto Valenciano project, \"some projects were being emptied out in order to deal with others\" and worried that \"it was going to become paralyzed.\" Mirandes testified that he and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n \"spoke constantly\" about his concerns, and that he also expressed his concerns to Mu&#241;oz-Franco. Despite Mirandes' repeated statements of concern, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n explicitly told Mirandes that the practices had to continue. In many cases, the bank authorized the disbursements directly rather than seeking authorization from Mirandes, and Mirandes testified that, although he knew of these disbursements, he was not in agreement with them. The evidence that appellants continued with their scheme even over Mirandes' objections demonstrated that they acted deliberately to defraud the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence shows that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n repeatedly authorized disbursements for work that was not completed and concealed relevant information from the Board. As a result of these activities, Caguas continued lending money to Mirandes-owned companies despite their financial instability. This course of conduct constitutes a knowing scheme to defraud Caguas by means of material misrepresentations within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344. Consequently, we conclude that a reasonable jury could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n were guilty of bank fraud with respect to the Mirandes loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E. Conspiracy with Respect to Mirandes Loans</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury also found Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n guilty of conspiracy with respect to the Mirandes loans. Although there was no formal agreement among Mu&#241;oz-Franco, S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n and Mirandes, the three acted in concert to defraud the bank. As described above, Mu&#241;oz-Franco originally approached Mirandes to assume the Reparto Valenciano loans, and Mirandes agreed. After this initial agreement, Mirandes met frequently with S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n and on several occasions with Mu&#241;oz-Franco.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants participated voluntarily in the conspiracy and took overt actions in its furtherance. When the Reparto Valenciano project was unable to pay its debts, Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n always attempted to find solutions to sustain the project, frequently by transferring funds from one project to another. Such transfers, as well as their approval of certifications for work not completed, constituted overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. Thus, we find sufficient evidence to sustain the jury's verdict on charges of conspiracy to commit bank fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344 with respect to the Mirandes loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the evidence of conspiracy to commit bank fraud was sufficient in itself to sustain the conspiracy charges, but also noted that there was sufficient evidence that appellants conspired to misapply bank funds in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 657 and make false entries in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1006. However, because we agree with that court's assessment of the bank fraud conspiracy, we need not discuss the other two bases for the conspiracy conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found sufficient evidence to support the convictions, we must now address three of appellants' claims that challenge the validity of the proceedings. First, appellants claim that the charges filed against them were barred by the statute of limitations. Second, they argue that their convictions violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. Finally, they contend that their convictions were invalid because of pre-indictment and pre-trial delay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Statute of Limitations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3293, an individual may not be charged with bank fraud or conspiracy to commit bank fraud unless the indictment is returned within ten years after the commission of the offense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a> Appellants raise three arguments regarding this statute of limitations. First, they argue that the original indictment was untimely. Next, they argue that the First, Second, and Third Superseding Indictments substantially amended the original indictment, do not relate back, and consequently were untimely. Finally, they argue that the district court erred in failing to instruct the jury on the statute of limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Timeliness of Original Indictment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review de novo a district court's decision not to dismiss on statute of limitations grounds. <i>L&#243;pez-Gonz&#225;lez v. Mun. of Comer&#237;o,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></span>, 551 (1st Cir.2005). Here, the original indictment was returned on November 22, 1995. Appellants contend that the Board was fully informed of the practices at issue in two of the alleged violations&#8212;bank fraud and conspiracy on the Guti&#233;rrez loans&#8212;by a regulator report dated August 31, 1985. Consequently, they argue, any deception in the scheme ended more than ten years prior to the original indictment, making the indictment untimely for those charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the activities discussed in Section III, <i>supra,</i> most of which took place after November 22, 1985, appellants' argument overstates the significance of the regulator report in question. The report describes several Modules loans and expresses general concern about Modules' financial state. The report notes that the loans \"are considered to be substandard loans subject to special comment since the future viability of the main borrower, Modules, could be impaired by uncertainties involving the collectibility of an accounts receivable due from an affiliated party.\" These general statements do nothing to inform the Board of such practices as the use of proceeds from one loan to make payments on another loan or the ongoing certification of and payment for work that was not completed. Moreover, the report itself contains certain misleading statements by S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n. For example, despite his knowledge of Modules' uncertain financial status and poor performance on several projects, he defended the loans to Modules by explaining that \"the borrower should have sufficient funds to satisfy the loans in a timely manner.\" Thus, the district court did not err in ruling that the original indictment was timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Relation Back of Superseding Indictments</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants next argue that each of the three superseding indictments materially broadened and substantially amended the charges against them and, consequently, do not relate back to the date of the original indictment. As a result, they argue that these indictments are untimely because they allege conduct that concluded more than ten years previously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v.

We emphasized that \"notice-related concerns . . . comprise the touchstone for determining when a superseding indictment materially broadens or substantially amends earlier charges,\" explaining that a timely indictment serves notice by apprising defendants \"`that they will be called to account for their activities and should prepare a defense.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Grady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"340433\"><a href=\"/opinion/340433/united-states-v-frank-grady-and-john-jankowski/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span>, 601 (2d Cir.1976)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the original indictment charged the four appellants with bank fraud and conspiracy, alleging fifty-eight overt acts spanning nearly a decade and involving unlawful disbursement of bank funds by Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, unlawful receipt of the funds by Guti&#233;rrez, Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, and Mirandes, and concealment of these activities from Caguas' Board of directors and regulatory agencies. The First Superseding Indictment, returned on March 5, 1997, added allegations concerning five additional loan projects and forty-four overt acts and added two additional defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn27\" id=\"fn27_ref\">27</a> It also changed the alleged starting date of the conspiracy from December 1981 to June 1980, lengthening the duration of the conspiracy from eight years and five months to nine years and eleven months. The Second Superseding Indictment, returned on May 13, 1997, added allegations about two more loan projects and ten overt acts. Finally, the Third Superseding Indictment, returned on March 6, 1998, separated the allegations relating to the Guti&#233;rrez and Mirandes loans, which the previous indictments had presented as a single unitary conspiracy, into two separate conspiracies set forth in separate counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that these revisions do not materially broaden or substantially amend the original indictment. The government \"is not limited in its proof at trial to those overt acts alleged in the indictment.\" <i>United States v. Adamo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"334866\"><a href=\"/opinion/334866/united-states-v-peter-adamo-appeal-of-vincent-kearney/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 38 (3d Cir.1976). Therefore, allegations of additional loan projects and overt acts in the superseding indictments do not broaden the original indictment; they simply provide more specific examples to substantiate the original fraud and conspiracy charges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, the addition of eighteen months to the beginning of a conspiracy spanning nearly a decade does not materially broaden the scope of the indictment. Virtually none of the conduct supporting appellants' convictions occurred between June 1980 and December 1981, and the dates were expanded primarily to allow factual completeness by including the dates of the original loans Caguas extended to various companies. Thus, appellants had adequate notice of the charges against them despite the expanded time frame.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn28\" id=\"fn28_ref\">28</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we find that the separation of the original unitary bank fraud and conspiracy scheme into two separate schemes, one alleging bank fraud and conspiracy with respect to the Guti&#233;rrez loans and one alleging bank fraud and conspiracy with respect to the Mirandes loans, did not materially broaden or substantially amend the indictment. Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n still had to explain the same set of actions. With respect to Guti&#233;rrez and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez, the division also provided adequate notice. The only difference was that they no longer had to contend with the allegations that related only to the Mirandes loans. Thus, we conclude that the Third Superseding Indictment relates back to November 22, 1995, the date of the original indictment, and find no error in the district court's refusal to dismiss the indictment for untimeliness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn29\" id=\"fn29_ref\">29</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3.

At trial, however, Guti&#233;rrez's attorney explicitly declined to seek a statute of limitations instruction, and the other appellants made no request for such an instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We addressed a similar situation in <i>United States v.

There, we rejected the defendant's claim that the district court should have issued an instruction on the statute of limitations, explaining that the defendant \"failed to identify any point in the record where such an instruction was requested. Absent such a request, the point was waived.\" <i>Id.</i> at 12. This holding is logical because \"[a] statute of limitations claim presents `an affirmative defense' that is `not cognizable on appeal unless properly raised below.'\" <i>United States v.

Its position is consistent with recent circuit court decisions holding that the failure to issue such an instruction satisfies the first two prongs of the plain error analysis by establishing that an error occurred that was obvious. <i>See Tykarsky,</i> 446 F.3d at 479-80 (\"[B]ecause the communications spanned two different versions of the statute with different minimum penalties, the question of whether the violation extended beyond the effective date of the amended version was one that had to be resolved by the jury . . . .

Thus, our task is to determine whether this error affected appellants' substantial rights, and, if so, whether the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings was impaired.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p112\">\n      <span class=\"num\">112</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The other circuits have taken varying approaches to applying these prongs of the plain error test in assessing a claimed ex post facto violation. In <i>United States v.

In <i>United States v. Todd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"436119\"><a href=\"/opinion/436119/united-states-v-larry-weldon-todd-and-james-clyde-short-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">146</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1984), that court held that where \"[m]ost of the evidence focused on events that occurred within the effective date of the amendments,\" and \"the record . . . clearly establishes violations of the amended act by the appellants during the relevant time period,\" the failure to give the jury instruction did not \"result in the likelihood of a grave miscarriage of justice or circumstances that seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 150.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p114\">\n      <span class=\"num\">114</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Second and Third Circuits have adopted an approach in which prejudice is established if there was a reasonable possibility that the jury convicted appellant on the basis of pre-enactment conduct. In <i>Tykarsky,</i> for example, the Third Circuit explained that a district court's failure to issue an instruction means that a defendant \"has been prejudiced if there is a reasonable possibility that a jury, properly instructed on this point, might have found [the defendant] guilty based exclusively on acts that occurred before the increased penalty took effect.\" 446 F.3d at 480. The court noted that \"[t]he most that can be said here is that it is improbable, rather than impossible, as a <i>factual matter,</i> that the jury convicted Tykarsky exclusively on the basis of\" pre-enactment conduct, which was \"insufficient to persuade us that [the defendant's] substantial rights were not affected.\" <i>Id.</i> at 482.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn34\" id=\"fn34_ref\">34</a> The court concluded that this prejudice \"tainted the integrity and reputation of the judicial process\" and consequently vacated the defendant's sentence and remanded to the district court. <i>Id.</i> at 483.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p115\">\n      <span class=\"num\">115</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in <i>Julian,</i> the Seventh Circuit considered an alleged conspiracy and found, on the third prong of the plain error analysis, that a court's failure to issue an ex post facto instruction \"affected [the defendant's] substantial rights in the sense that it exposed him to a longer sentence.\" 427 F.3d at 482. It then focused on the fourth prong, explaining that \"[i]f a jury, properly instructed on this point, might have found that the conspiracy had come to an end before the increased penalty took effect or that [defendant] had withdrawn from the conspiracy before that date, then the error is one that implicates the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial process.\" <i>Id.</i> It concluded that a reasonable jury could not have found that the conspiracy at issue ended prior to the enactment date of the statute. <i>Id.</i> at 483.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p116\">\n      <span class=\"num\">116</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, we need not settle on a rule here. The plain error analysis used by the Second and Third Circuits is most favorable to defendants because it requires a finding of prejudice if there was a \"reasonable possibility\" that the jury convicted appellants solely on the basis of pre-enactment conduct. Here, even under that test, appellants cannot demonstrate an ex post facto violation because no reasonable jury would have convicted appellants based exclusively on conduct that occurred prior to the enactment date. Moreover, even if we were to apply the \"miscarriage of justice\" approach of the Seventh Circuit, we would conclude there was no miscarriage of justice here because the government presented so much evidence of the involvement of the defendants in the ongoing conspiracy and bank fraud following the enactment of the bank fraud statute in 1984.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p117\">\n      <span class=\"num\">117</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court correctly noted, the government presented overwhelming evidence of appellants' conduct, the majority of which occurred after October 12, 1984. Relatively few of the overt acts for any of the charges alleged in the indictment occurred prior to October 12, 1984: only twelve of fifty-eight overt acts on the charges of conspiracy and bank fraud with respect to the Guti&#233;rrez loans, and only ten of forty-seven acts on the charges of conspiracy and bank fraud with respect to the Mirandes loans. The government presented considerable evidence of activities occurring after October 12, 1984, including all of the transactions involving the Los Mameyes project, all of the transactions involving the Jardines de Villa Alba project, and many of the transactions involving the Reparto Valenciano project. The Denby letter, which contained several material misrepresentations, was not signed until 1987. Indeed, the bulk of our sufficiency analysis details conduct occurring after the enactment date. <i>See</i> Section III, <i>supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p118\">\n      <span class=\"num\">118</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, we find nothing to differentiate appellants' pre-enactment conduct from subsequent conduct. The government's key witnesses&#8212;Lugo, Mirandes, Enriquez, Somohano and Kareh&#8212;testified to conduct that occurred both before and after the enactment date. Given that the testimony of these witnesses spanned the enactment date, we find it implausible that the jury would find such testimony compelling only for events that occurred prior to October 12, 1984. Similarly, no transformative event occurred prior to October 12, 1984 that would alter a reasonable jury's perception of the nature of any appellant's involvement. Although appellant Guti&#233;rrez protests that he sold his construction loans with Caguas on October 29, 1984, and sold Modules on December 31, 1985, it is uncontested that he and Umpierre-Hern&#225;ndez remained employed by the company, and the record contains evidence that their culpable conduct (such as submitting certifications for incomplete work) continued uninterrupted after the sale of the company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p119\">\n      <span class=\"num\">119</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we see no reason to differentiate the conduct occurring prior to the enactment date, we find that a reasonable jury would not have convicted the appellants based solely on pre-enactment conduct. Thus, appellants were not prejudiced, nor did their convictions implicate the fairness or integrity of the judicial process. We conclude that there is no plain error from the absence of a limiting instruction on the ex post facto issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Pre-Indictment and Pre-Trial Delay</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p120\">\n      <span class=\"num\">120</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the district court erred in refusing to dismiss on the grounds that (1) the five-year pre-indictment delay violated their Fifth Amendment right to due process, and (2) the five-year pre-trial delay violated their Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial.

They assert that they suffered prejudice from the unavailability of nineteen potential defense witnesses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn35\" id=\"fn35_ref\">35</a> However, we find that the unavailability of these nineteen individuals did not impair appellants' defense, either because appellants could have, but did not, obtain testimony from similarly situated individuals who were available to testify; or because appellants failed to demonstrate that the testimony of these individuals would have included exculpatory evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p123\">\n      <span class=\"num\">123</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the nineteen unavailable witnesses, appellants contend that the deaths of two individuals&#8212;Phillip Saffold and Luis Dorta&#8212;prevented cross-examination relating to reports these witnesses prepared. Saffold was an investigator who authored reports that appellants claim would have allowed them to impeach Roman Cruz, a plant manager who testified that buildings were not built at the Modules plant; however, Cruz's testimony was a minor part of the government's case against appellants and appellants' inability to impeach Cruz did not significantly prejudice them. Similarly, Dorta inspected the Transglobe and Modules sites and prepared reports that were admitted at trial; appellants emphasize that his death prevented them from cross-examining him, but do not specify how this opportunity would have helped their case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p124\">\n      <span class=\"num\">124</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim that nine other unavailable witnesses (Gilberto Pol Segarra, Luis Acevedo Gonzalez, Jaime Sitiriche, Juan Hern&#225;ndez, Celestino Seneriz, Pedro Bull Nater, Francisco Susoni Lens, Jose Feliciano, and Rafael Toro Nazario) were members of the Board who \"could have testified to the extent of the disclosures made to the Board, in response to Lugo[]'s imprecise testimony.\" However, appellants offer no reason to believe that these Board members would have offered testimony contradictory to Lugo's.

With respect to the first two sets of documents, however, appellants make no attempt to establish that the reports disappeared after indictment but prior to trial. With respect to the third, appellants claim only that \"the unavailability of the Modules documents made it impossible to fairly cross examine [Transhore and Modules accountant Jorge] Fabrigas\" and that, generally, the evidence might have allowed them to refresh witness recollection and corroborate their defense. However, Fabrigas' testimony was a minor part of the trial, and these generalized objections do not establish prejudice resulting from an impaired defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p127\">\n      <span class=\"num\">127</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if appellants had demonstrated some degree of prejudice from the delay, they have made no concomitant showing that the government intentionally delayed indictment to gain tactical advantage.

The district court originally denied the motion to disqualify and the government sought mandamus from this court. We denied mandamus, but noted that \"the judge would have been well-advised either to bow out of the case or to ask that the recusal motion be assigned to a different judge for hearing\" and that \"the government hardly can be faulted for bringing\" the motion. <i>In re United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198168\"><a href=\"/opinion/198168/in-re-usa-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 33-34 (1st Cir.1998).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn37\" id=\"fn37_ref\">37</a> The trial judge assigned to the case then recused herself voluntarily, resulting in a delay in the proceedings of approximately one year.

The Court identified three such interests: \"(i) to protect oppressive pretrial incarceration; (ii) to minimize anxiety and concern of the accused; and (iii) to limit the possibility that the defense will be impaired.\" <i>Id.</i> The first of these interests has no bearing here because appellants remained free prior to trial. With respect to the second interest, \"considerable anxiety normally attends the initiation and pendency of criminal charges; hence only `undue pressures' are considered.\" <i>Santiago-Becerril,</i> 130 F.3d at 23 (citations omitted). Appellants allege no such \"undue pressure,\" and therefore we assign negligible weight to this interest. Finally, in our discussion of pre-indictment delay, we have already analyzed appellants' arguments that their defense was impaired. These arguments are equally applicable to the pre-trial time frame, and we find no material prejudice resulting from the delay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn38\" id=\"fn38_ref\">38</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p133\">\n      <span class=\"num\">133</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The five years that elapsed between indictment and trial is a troublesome length of time.

We address these claims in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Evidence Regarding Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p135\">\n      <span class=\"num\">135</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge three aspects of the admission and treatment of evidence regarding financial loss to Caguas. First, they protest that such evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial in violation of Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Second, they argue more specifically that the government's Exhibit 40, aspects of which were later shown to be inaccurate, was erroneously admitted. Finally, they argue that, even if evidence of loss and Exhibit 40 were properly admitted, the district court erred in refusing to guide the jury with an instruction about the enactment of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (\"FIRREA\"), Pub.L. No. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183 (codified in scattered sections of 12 U.S.C.).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. General Evidence of Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p136\">\n      <span class=\"num\">136</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review evidentiary rulings on relevance and unfair prejudice for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201790\"><a href=\"/opinion/201790/united-states-v-richardson/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 37-38 (1st Cir.2005). Loss is not an element of bank fraud. <i>United States v.

However, courts have held repeatedly that loss is relevant in fraud cases to demonstrate a defendant's knowledge or intent to commit fraud. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Heimann,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"417710\"><a href=\"/opinion/417710/united-states-v-louis-heimann/\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span>, 669 (2d Cir.1983)(\"While technically the success or failure of a scheme to defraud is irrelevant in a mail fraud case, realistically, when the contested issue is intent, whether or not victims lost money can be a substantial factor in a jury's determination of guilt or innocence.\" (citation omitted)). Thus, while \"an ultimate purpose of either causing some financial loss to another or bringing about some financial gain to oneself is not the essence of fraudulent intent,\" <i>United States v. Kenrick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199023\"><a href=\"/opinion/199023/united-states-v-kenrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 29 (1st Cir.2000) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted), the knowledge that one's actions are, in fact, bringing about such losses may demonstrate one's intent to commit fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government referred to loss throughout the trial to demonstrate appellants' knowledge of the consequences of their ongoing practices of using loan proceeds to make principal and interest payments on unrelated loans, authorizing disbursements for work not completed, and using funds for purposes not authorized by the Board. For example, during its opening statement and closing argument, the government noted that federal regulators closed Caguas in 1990 due to the bank's lack of funds. On a few occasions, the government also questioned witnesses about the amount of loss that certain projects sustained and whether those losses would have caused concern. However, these references did not dominate the evidence because the government also presented considerable other evidence of defendants' conduct, as we have discussed at length in Section III, <i>supra.</i> Moreover, the district court carefully managed the effect of evidence relating to loss on the jury by preventing both parties from addressing loss in their closing arguments and instructing the jury that loss was not an element of the offenses charged. Finally, the court permitted appellants to cross-examine vigorously the government witnesses who discussed loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the general references to loss were relevant as a means of demonstrating appellants' intent to defraud Caguas, and, given the carefully limited presentation of this evidence to the jury, were not unduly prejudicial. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Exhibit 40</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following Caguas' closure in 1990, Banco Santander acquired many of its assets, and prepared a document&#8212;government Exhibit 40&#8212;listing hundreds of Caguas' loans, the outstanding balances on those loans, Banco Santander's valuation of the loans, and the resulting discount (the difference between the outstanding balance of the loan and the loan's value). At trial, Banco Santander's comptroller attested that the bank had acquired all of the loans summarized in Exhibit 40, and the exhibit served as part of the basis for expert testimony regarding accounting practices by Kathy McKinless, a partner at an accounting firm. By the time of sentencing, however, the government discovered that the Resolution Trust Company (\"RTC\"), a government-owned asset management company, had retained many of the loans. Thus, the exhibit could not actually have reflected valuations of the loans made by Banco Santander upon purchase, and was not a reliable means of establishing the magnitude of the loss experienced by Caguas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants now contend that Exhibit 40 was both testimonial, in violation of the Confrontation Clause, and that the exhibit was improperly admitted under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The government's acknowledgment that Exhibit 40 contained inaccurate information indicates that the exhibit should have been excluded on that basis alone. However, we agree with the district court that any error in its admission was harmless. Under <i>Fahy v. Connecticut,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106699\"><a href=\"/opinion/106699/fahy-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">85</span></a></span>, 86-87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106699\"><a href=\"/opinion/106699/fahy-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">84</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">171</span></a></span> (1963), the critical question in assessing harmless error is \"whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence complained of might have contributed to the conviction.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several circumstances indicate that there is no reasonable possibility that Exhibit 40 contributed to the convictions here. First, the exhibit was relevant only to prove appellants' fraudulent intent, and the government presented considerable evidence of this intent from other sources. Second, the court explicitly instructed the jury that loss was not an element of bank fraud. Third, the exhibit was the subject of direct examination for less than one-half of one day of a trial spanning fifteen months. Fourth, defense counsel subjected McKinless to searching cross-examination regarding the exhibit, revealing several typographical errors and inaccuracies and eliciting McKinless' acknowledgment that she could not confirm the document's completeness. Finally, even if the loss calculations in Exhibit 40 were not entirely accurate, other evidence at trial demonstrated that Caguas suffered large losses on many of the loans at issue. To some extent, the Exhibit 40 calculations replicated evidence already in the record. Taking into account all of these circumstances, there is no reasonable possibility that the isolated use of Exhibit 40 could have contributed to appellants' convictions, and thus any error in its admission was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Jury Instruction on Loss</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p142\">\n      <span class=\"num\">142</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also challenge the district court's refusal to give an instruction explaining that, when FIRREA was enacted in 1989, \"many institutions immediately fell out of compliance with regulatory capital requirements, making them subject to seizure by thrift regulators.\" <i>United States v. Winstar Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118062\"><a href=\"/opinion/118062/united-states-v-winstar-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">518</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">839</span></a></span>, 857-58, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118062\"><a href=\"/opinion/118062/united-states-v-winstar-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">964</span></a></span> (1996). Appellants contend that, given the admission of evidence relating to financial loss, the jury should have been instructed that bank failures were common in the aftermath of FIRREA's enactment. In other words, the jury should have been told that banks commonly lost money in the absence of fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p143\">\n      <span class=\"num\">143</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court's refusal to issue a jury instruction \"`constitutes reversible error only if the requested instruction was (1) correct as a matter of substantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated into the charge as rendered, and (3) integral to an important point in the case.'\" <i>White v.

No such error occurred here. The FIRREA instruction was not integral to an important point in the case because loss is not an element of bank fraud. Moreover, the jury was instructed that the government need not prove loss. Thus, we find no reversible error in the district court's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Forgery and Check-Kiting Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p144\">\n      <span class=\"num\">144</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants assert that the admission of evidence regarding forged signatures on checks and evidence of a check-kiting scheme constructively amended the indictment. A constructive amendment occurs \"`when the charging terms of the indictment are altered' at trial so that they are different from those handed up by the grand jury.\" <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198966\"><a href=\"/opinion/198966/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 118 (1st Cir.2000)(quoting <i>United States v.

Appellants also argue that this evidence constituted an improper variance from the indictment. A variance occurs when the proof differs from the indictment's allegations, and \"is material and reversible only if it has affected the defendant's `substantial rights': to be informed of the charges; and to prevent a second prosecution for the same offense.\" <i>United States v. Vavlitis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195045\"><a href=\"/opinion/195045/united-states-v-vavlitis/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 210 (1st Cir.1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p145\">\n      <span class=\"num\">145</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, the government introduced evidence that numerous checks issued by Caguas and made payable jointly to Guti&#233;rrez companies and third party contractors were deposited in the accounts of the Guti&#233;rrez companies after the contractor's endorsement was fraudulently added to the checks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn39\" id=\"fn39_ref\">39</a> The government elicited this testimony as evidence of appellants' intent to defraud the bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p146\">\n      <span class=\"num\">146</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court addressed the forgery evidence in an order denying appellants' motion to exclude it. The court found that such evidence caused neither a constructive amendment nor a variance, explaining that, \"[s]ince some of the checks issued by Caguas [that were ultimately used to make payments on failing loans] were jointly issued to innocent third party payees, these payees' endorsement would have been required before the checks could actually be cashed or deposited in the bank.\" Since \"disbursement of the funds could not be completed until the checks were cashed . . . in some cases forged endorsements would necessarily be required.\" The court concluded that, rather than constructively amending or varying the indictment, the forged endorsements were direct evidence of one component of appellants' scheme. Finally, to foreclose any possibility that the jury would convict appellants based on the forgery evidence, the court issued thorough instructions regarding the elements of bank fraud and conspiracy as well as an instruction specifically tailored to the evidence of forgery: \"You have heard evidence about checks with allegedly forged endorsements. The crime of forgery is not charged . . . . The fact that endorsements may be forged may only be used to assist you, as you may find useful, in your evaluation of all the evidence in the case. . . .\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn40\" id=\"fn40_ref\">40</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p147\">\n      <span class=\"num\">147</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order accurately assesses the value of the forgery evidence, and the admission of such evidence did not constructively amend the indictment or result in a variance. We further conclude that its instruction was more than sufficient to inform the jury of the proper role of that evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p148\">\n      <span class=\"num\">148</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We view the check-kiting evidence similarly. The disputed evidence consisted of testimony from Somohano (the vice president of Caguas' commercial loan department) that in 1983 he detected a check-kiting scheme involving two Guti&#233;rrez corporations' accounts at Caguas and Banco de Ponce. When he informed Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n, Mu&#241;oz-Franco scolded Somohano and denied that check-kiting was occurring. Somohano further testified that S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n continued to honor the checks sent to Caguas even after Banco de Ponce stopped honoring checks deposited with them. The check-kiting continued, resulting in overdrafts of more than $900,000 on the Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies' accounts at Caguas. This overdraft ultimately was converted into a loan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p149\">\n      <span class=\"num\">149</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court did not err in admitting this evidence. The reactions of Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n when Somohano told them about the check-kiting scheme demonstrate both their goal of preserving the Guti&#233;rrez-owned companies' financial status and the preferential treatment that these companies received. This evidence was directly relevant to the charges of bank fraud and conspiracy, and was not outside the scope of the original indictment. Thus, we conclude that no constructive amendment or improper variance occurred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

We explained that \"[s]uch evidence was unquestionably helpful to the jury in determining whether ... [the officer] was willing to disregard his sworn obligations and accept things of value which influenced his performance of official duties.\" <i>Id.</i> Similarly, in <i>Stefan,</i> the district court permitted the government to introduce testimony regarding violations of a civil regulatory banking statute and charts illustrating how certain loans at issue contravened the statute. It also allowed the government to refer to the statutory violations in its opening statement and closing argument, and even \"focused the jury's attention\" on the statute in the instructions. 784 F.2d at 1097. On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found that the defendant's scheme included efforts to avoid this statute, and that the district court therefore did not abuse its discretion in admitting such evidence to help the jury understand the scheme. In both of these cases, the courts placed emphasis on a jury instruction which made clear that civil or regulatory violations did not equate to criminal conduct. <i>See Devin,</i> 918 F.2d at 288 n. 9; <i>Stefan,</i> 784 F.2d at 1099.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn41\" id=\"fn41_ref\">41</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p154\">\n      <span class=\"num\">154</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the court allowed the government to introduce evidence that defendants violated certain regulations of the Federal Home Loan Bank to provide context for their actions and to establish their knowledge of the impropriety of their activities. Although such evidence was discussed from time to time, it was not central to the government's case, as our lengthy discussion of the sufficiency of the evidence demonstrates, <i>see</i> Section III, <i>supra.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p155\">\n      <span class=\"num\">155</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the district court issued a limiting instruction on the use of evidence of civil and regulatory violations:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p156\">\n      <span class=\"num\">156</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You have heard testimony and evidence that certain civil rules and/or regulations which govern the conduct of banks may not have been followed at times at Caguas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p157\">\n      <span class=\"num\">157</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You are hereby instructed that a violation of any of these rules and regulations is not a crime in and of itself, and is not determinative of a defendant's guilt or innocence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p158\">\n      <span class=\"num\">158</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that certain civil rules and regulations may have been violated at Caguas may only be used by you to assist you, as you may find useful, in determining a particular defendant's motive or intent as to the crimes charged in the third superseding indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This instruction clearly conveys that civil and regulatory violations do not establish criminal culpability. Appellants protest that the instruction exacerbated the problem because the reference to \"the <i>fact</i> that certain rules and regulations may have been violated\" improperly suggested that such rules and regulations had been violated. However, we see no such suggestion because the phrase \"<i>may</i> have been violated\" makes clear to the jury that, <i>if</i> it found that such violations had occurred, it could use those violations as one piece of evidence in determining the ultimate question of criminal guilt or innocence. Given this appropriate limiting instruction, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by admitting evidence of regulatory violations to provide context and to demonstrate appellants' knowledge of their criminal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>VI.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge other aspects of the proceedings against them, including the length of the trial, allegedly disparaging and misleading statements by the prosecutor, the jury instruction on misapplication, and alleged error in sentencing.

Moreover, much of the time devoted to the government's case consisted of the vigorous and lengthy cross-examination to which the defense subjected government witnesses. Finally, nearly all of the witnesses testified in Spanish and required the use of interpreters, which contributed significantly to the length of the trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn43\" id=\"fn43_ref\">43</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's presentation was not repetitive. For example, although Enriquez (the senior vice president of the mortgage department) and Kareh (the assistant vice president of the construction loan department) both testified at length about the same projects, Kareh offered more detailed information about the loans themselves, while Enriquez provided insight into appellants' knowledge about the loans and whether appellants provided certain information to the Board. Although appellants can point to instances in which the same story was told more than once, such repetition often encompassed new and relevant details, and was not unduly frequent given the complexity of the violations alleged and the length of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is no indication that the length of the trial and the arguably cumulative nature of the evidence affected the outcome of the trial in any way. In fact, the jury convicted the four appellants while acquitting Enrique Guti&#233;rrez on all counts, which suggests that the jury was able to carefully weigh the evidence against each defendant. <i>See United States v. LiCausi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198296\"><a href=\"/opinion/198296/united-states-v-licausi/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.1999)(explaining that a jury's acquittal of one defendant on two counts indicates that it \"was not prevented from making reliable judgments about guilt or innocence\"). Given appellants' failure to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the length of the trial, we find no due process violation under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Prosecutorial Misconduct</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p165\">\n      <span class=\"num\">165</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim that, throughout the trial, the prosecutor made disparaging and misleading comments that prejudiced the jury against them and require us to vacate their convictions. The district court denied motions for a mistrial on such grounds on at least six occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p166\">\n      <span class=\"num\">166</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We must first resolve the threshold question of whether these comments were improper. <i>Darden v. Wainwright,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111717\"><a href=\"/opinion/111717/darden-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">168</span></a></span>, 180-81, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111717\"><a href=\"/opinion/111717/darden-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span> (1986). If we answer that question in the affirmative, we must determine whether the impropriety warrants vacating the convictions. The issue is not whether \"`the prosecutors' remarks were undesirable or even universally condemned'\"; rather, \"[t]he relevant question is whether the prosecutors' comments `so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 181, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111717\"><a href=\"/opinion/111717/darden-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2464</span></a></span> (citations omitted). We have held that the relevant factors include: \"(1) whether the prosecutor's misconduct was isolated and/or deliberate; (2) whether the trial court gave a strong and explicit cautionary instruction; and (3) whether any prejudice surviving the court's instruction likely could have affected the outcome of the case.\" <i>United States v. Auch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"765610\"><a href=\"/opinion/765610/united-states-v-enrique-auch-aka-rickie-auch/\"><span class=\"volume\">187</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span>, 129 (1st Cir.1999). We may overturn the convictions only if \"the prosecutor's misguided tactic . . . could have affected the outcome of the trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 130.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Disparagement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p167\">\n      <span class=\"num\">167</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants first object to comments, made in the presence of the jury, that they term \"disparagement.\" For example, the prosecutor, on one occasion, stated that defense counsel \"just lied to the court\" and referred to his statement as a \"misrepresentation.\" On another occasion, the prosecutor asked the court to \"please direct [defense counsel] to refrain from his offensive odious comment that [has] characterized [] this trial,\" concluding, \"I don't think that I need to endure this sort of treatment from him.\" On several occasions, the prosecutor interrupted defense counsel's objections with such comments as \"say something new,\" and \"Improper question. First year law school. Improper question.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p168\">\n      <span class=\"num\">168</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such comments are unfortunate and unprofessional. However, the trial was highly contentious, and the record reveals that appellants' trial counsel made a number of similar comments. Although such exchanges between the prosecution and defense occurred intermittently, their impact was diluted by the length of the trial. Immediately following such exchanges, the court usually commented on their inappropriateness. For example, the court on one occasion ordered \"all counsel to measure their words, measure their conduct, and measure their civility towards each other,\" noting, \"I have observed both sides step over the line.\" On another occasion the court admonished counsel for improper comments and stated: \"And by counsel I included both sides. This is not an admonition to one side or the other, both sides are included.\" Such statements from the court adequately informed the jury that such conduct was inappropriate and assigned blame equally to both sides. Finally, any prejudice that resulted from the prosecutor's role in these exchanges and survived the court's instruction could not have influenced the outcome in this case because, as we explained in Section III, <i>supra,</i> the evidence of appellants' guilt was overwhelming. Thus, the prosecutor's occasional remarks in this long and contentious trial, although unfortunate, did not infect the trial with such unfairness as to make the resulting convictions a denial of due process. <i>Darden,</i> 477 U.S. at 181, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111717\"><a href=\"/opinion/111717/darden-v-wainwright/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2464</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Misleading Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p169\">\n      <span class=\"num\">169</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants also assert that the prosecutors made misleading statements and referred to information outside the record. Many of appellants' characterizations of the prosecution's presentation are simply inaccurate. For example, appellants claim that the prosecutor falsely stated that Lugo (the Board president) had testified that the Board was not told of Modules' performance history, when Lugo had at most said he could not remember those statements. This claim is unsupported by the record. Lugo in fact testified: \"I don't recall that it was discussed. I believe that if it was discussed I would remember and it is not reflected in the minutes. . . . The best of my recollection is that it was not discussed.\" In another instance, appellants protest that the prosecutor improperly suggested to Joseph Gonzalez (an examiner for the Federal Home Loan Bank) that bank management, rather than the Board, was responsible for Caguas' lending practices, when in fact the prosecutor only elicited testimony that the Board relied on Mu&#241;oz-Franco and S&#225;nchez-Ar&#225;n to provide information relevant to its decisions, and often accepted Mu&#241;oz-Franco's recommendations regarding these decisions. Such comments were not improper, let alone prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p170\">\n      <span class=\"num\">170</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In other instances, even if we found the challenged statements improper, any resulting prejudice was negated either by appellants' own cross-examination or by a curative instruction from the district court. For example, appellants assert that the prosecution elicited testimony from Montilla (the developer on the Jardines de Villa Alba project) that Caguas sued him but then dismissed its claim, when in fact the bank settled with Montilla and obtained title to all but one of the Jardines de Villa Alba lots.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn44\" id=\"fn44_ref\">44</a> However, appellants then elicited the terms of the settlement on cross-examination, remedying any prejudice. On another occasion, the court addressed defense counsel's allegations that the prosecution's closing argument mentioned loans not charged in the indictment and mischaracterized Victor Kareh's testimony with a detailed curative instruction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn45\" id=\"fn45_ref\">45</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p171\">\n      <span class=\"num\">171</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, any impact resulting from these alleged misleading statements must be evaluated in light of the overwhelming evidence presented at this fifteen-month trial. Under such circumstances, we again conclude that the prosecutor's comments could not have caused unfairness that resulted in a denial of due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Jury Instruction on Misapplication</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p172\">\n      <span class=\"num\">172</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants argue that the jury instructions improperly permitted the jury to convict them on the misapplication charge if it found them merely reckless. We review de novo a claim that the district court erred in instructing the jury on the intent necessary to support a conviction. <i>United States v.
