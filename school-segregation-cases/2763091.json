Appellant\r\nAllamon Tool Company originally sued Jackey Derryberry, a supplier of fill dirt, for fraud,\r\nDTPA violations, and removal of a mechanic's lien.  Those claims were abandoned at trial. \r\n\tDerryberry filed a counterclaim for breach of contract, along with other causes of\r\naction, against Allamon Tool.  The only issues submitted to the jury were Derryberry's\r\nclaims against Allamon Tool for breach of contract and attorney's fees.  The trial court\r\nsigned a final judgment against Allamon Tool and awarded Derryberry $39,550 in damages\r\nbased on a breach of two contracts, one written and one oral, and awarded Derryberry\r\n$12,600 in attorney's fees.  Allamon Tool filed this appeal.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude the jury's findings concerning the written agreement are immaterial.  As\r\na matter of law, the document is not an enforceable contract.  We reverse and render a take-nothing judgment on that claim.  The evidence is insufficient to support the damage award\r\non the oral contract and the award of attorney's fees.  We reverse the judgment and remand\r\nthe cause for a new trial for damages and attorney's fees for breach of that contract.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>The Facts</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's representative on the construction project was Lee Gardner.  Derryberry\r\ntestified he and Gardner agreed Derryberry would supply \"cheap dirt\" on the project in\r\nexchange for receiving the rest of the site work.  Derryberry described the agreement as\r\nfollows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>  \tQ.\t[Derryberry's Attorney]. Now, then, did you guys talk about your\r\nability to deliver dirt to the Allamon Tool site?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.\t[Derryberry]. Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.\tAnd how much dirt was being requested at that time?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.\tWell, we talked numbers, we were talking about a thousand loads.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  \tWere you willing to give a special price on that dirt?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.  \tYes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  \tIn exchange for what?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.  \tFor the rest of the site work.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. \tWhat does that [mean]?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t. . . . </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA. \t[I]f I supply this [dirt] for this lower price because fortunately I can,\r\nand even if I'm breaking even on that, I know down the line there's, I\r\nmean, looking at the site, there's going to be tons of select fill needed,\r\ntons of crushed concrete.  I will do this price if you give me the rest of\r\nit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  \tWas that something you told Lee Gardner that was a requirement for\r\nyou to give him the dirt?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.  \tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  \tThe fill dirt at a cheap price?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.  \tYes, sir. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Derryberry delivered some of the dirt before he asked Gardner to sign a document Derryberry\r\npresented.  The document states as follows:  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis is an agreement between Allamon Tool Company (representative Lee\r\nGardner) and Fairway Construction for the Freeport Road location, Lots 9 &amp;\r\n10.  Fairway Construction will supply labor and materials to include, but not\r\nlimited to, fill, rip rap, select fill, form sand, base materials, drainage pipes,\r\nmachine hours and labor.  All invoices close on Saturdays and will be due\r\nwithin 10 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Derryberry and Gardner signed and dated the document.  Derryberry testified he would not\r\nhave agreed to sell the cheap dirt (\"slick fill\") at the $25 per load price if Gardner had not\r\nagreed to give him the rest of the site work.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGardner had a different view.  He explained that the document he signed was an\r\nagreement to pay Derryberry for materials Derryberry supplied.  Derryberry was paid for the\r\ndirt he supplied.  Although Gardner acknowledged he orally agreed to purchase 1,000 loads\r\nof dirt from Derryberry for $25 a load, Gardner testified he never agreed to award Derryberry\r\nthe rest of the site work and never intended to give Derryberry the exclusive right to sell fill\r\ndirt for the project.  Gardner explained the agreement as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.\t[Appellant's attorney]: Now, there's no amounts for anything in Exhibit\r\nNo. 1 [the written agreement].  What was your understanding of what\r\nthe amounts were going to be and the prices were going to be?  Is that\r\nsomething that had to be negotiated in the future?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA. \t[Gardner] We never really discussed any specifics.  The only specifics\r\nwe ever discussed were, up front, we talked about a thousand loads of\r\nfill dirt at 25 dollars a load. . . . And so, the only thing that we ever,\r\ndiscussed was a thousand loads of dirt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tI had an agreement to buy a thousand loads of dirt. . . . And then when\r\nhe [Derryberry] brought the agreement over halfway through his part\r\non the job, I signed an agreement to pay for the dirt or anything that we\r\nbought from him, that I agreed to pay him.  That's the agreement I\r\nsigned with Mr. Derryberry on January the 8th of 2003.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Gardner further testified that any dirt delivered in the future would have to be negotiated\r\nlater.  Gardner also explained he never let Derryberry fulfill the 1,000-loads agreement,\r\nbecause he fired Derryberry. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>The Document</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue one, appellant argues the document is not a valid, enforceable contract as a\r\nmatter of law, because it lacks material and essential terms and is merely a non-binding\r\nagreement to agree in the future.  Whether an agreement is an enforceable contract is\r\ngenerally a question of law.  <em>Meru v. Huerta</em>, 136 S.W.3d 383, 390 (Tex. App.--Corpus\r\nChristi 2004, no pet.). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tFor an agreement to be legally binding, the contract's terms must be sufficiently\r\ndefinite to enable a court to understand what the promisor undertook.  <em>Fort Worth Indep. Sch.\r\nDist. v. City of Fort Worth</em>, 22 S.W.3d 831, 846 (Tex. 2000); <em>T.O. Stanley Boot Co. v. Bank\r\nof El Paso</em>, 847 S.W.2d 218, 221 (Tex. 1992).  If the court is unable to determine the parties'\r\nrights and obligations, there is no enforceable contract.  <em>See Searcy v. DDA, Inc.</em>, 201 S.W.3d\r\n319, 322 (Tex. App. Dallas--2006, no pet.);<em> Estate of Eberling v. Fair</em>, 546 S.W.2d 329, 335\r\n(Tex. Civ. App.--Dallas 1976, writ ref'd n.r.e.); <em>see also T. O. Stanley Boot Co.</em>, 847 S.W.2d\r\nat 221 (no binding contract if an essential term is left open for future negotiation; before a\r\ncourt can enforce the contract, the parties must agree to the contract's material terms).  There\r\ncan be no acceptance of an offer to form a contract unless the terms of that contract are\r\nreasonably certain.  Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 33(1) (1981); <em>Fort Worth\r\nIndep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 22 S.W.3d at 846; <em>Ski River Development, Inc. v. McCalla</em>, 167 S.W.3d\r\n121, 133 (Tex. App.--Waco 2005, pet. denied)<em>.</em>  The trial court has no authority to ask the\r\njury to supply an essential contract term that the parties were unable to complete by mutual\r\nagreement.  <em>COC Servs., Ltd. v. CompUSA, Inc.</em>, 150 S.W.3d 654, 664 (Tex. App.--Dallas\r\n2004, pet. denied).  \"Fatal indefiniteness in an agreement may concern the time of\r\nperformance, the price to be paid, the work to be done, the service to be rendered or the\r\nproperty to be transferred.\" <em> Id</em>.  Here, the written agreement does not set out the dates the\r\ncontract is to begin and end; the quantity, or range of quantity; the quality of the material to\r\nbe supplied; or the price or consideration for any material mentioned in the written contract. \r\nLike Gardner, Derryberry acknowledged these terms would have to be negotiated in the\r\nfuture. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe document states Fairway Construction<sup> (1)</sup> will provide labor and \"machine hours,\" \r\nbut there are no provisions indicating, for example, the type of labor required, the\r\nresponsibility for compensation, or the types of machines to be used.  The document contains\r\nno language making this a requirements or exclusive-dealing contract.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tCourts have implied terms when the surrounding circumstances left little doubt as to\r\nthe parties' intentions. <em> See McCalla</em>, 167 S.W.3d at 134; <em>O'Farrill Avila v. Gonzalez</em>, 974\r\nS.W.2d 237, 244 (Tex. App.--San Antonio 1998, pet. denied).  We cannot do that here.  The\r\ndocument is essentially an agreement to agree. <em> See Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist.</em>, 22 S.W.3d\r\nat 846; <em>Pine v. Gibraltar Sav. Ass'n</em>, 519 S.W.2d 238, 243-44 (Tex. Civ. App.--Houston [1st\r\nDist.] 1974, writ ref'd n.r.e.).  Neither the jury nor this Court may supply essential terms that\r\nthe parties did not or could not agree upon.  As a matter of law, the January 2003 written\r\nagreement is not a valid, enforceable contract.  We sustain issue one as to the written\r\nagreement.<sup> (2)</sup>  Because of our disposition of issue one, we need not address issues two through\r\nsix.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>The 1,000 Loads Contract</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIssues seven through ten concern the alleged oral agreement<sup> (3)</sup> regarding Derryberry's\r\nsale of 1,000 loads of dirt to Gardner at $25 per load.  Appellant argues the evidence is\r\nlegally and factually insufficient to support the findings relating to the 1,000 loads.  In a legal\r\nsufficiency challenge, the reviewing court considers the evidence in the light most favorable\r\nto the verdict, credits favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could, and disregards contrary\r\nevidence unless reasonable jurors could not. <em> City of Keller v. Wilson</em>, 168 S.W.3d 802, 807\r\n(Tex. 2005).  In a factual sufficiency challenge, the reviewing court considers all of the\r\nevidence and may set aside the verdict only if the evidence is so against the great weight and\r\npreponderance of evidence that it is clearly wrong and unjust.  <em>Dow Chem. Co. v. Francis</em>,\r\n46 S.W.3d 237, 242 (Tex. 2001).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant asserts Derryberry has no pleading to support his claim of an alleged oral\r\nagreement.  In his counterclaim, Derryberry pled the written agreement.  Derryberry, in\r\neffect, argues the parties tried the oral agreement by consent.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant called Gardner as a witness at trial.  On direct examination, Gardner\r\nexpressly testified to the existence of the oral agreement.  Derryberry testified, without\r\nobjection, that he agreed to deliver 1,000 loads of dirt at $25 a load.  The trial court\r\nsubmitted jury questions on the oral agreement claim to the jury.  Appellant did not object\r\non \"failure to plead\" grounds.  <em>See generally In re S.A.P.</em>, 156 S.W.3d 574, 576-77 (Tex.\r\n2005); <em>see also Southwestern Resolution Corp. v. Watson</em>, 964 S.W.2d 262,264 (Tex. 1997). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is essentially no factual dispute over the existence of the oral agreement to\r\npurchase a 1000 loads of dirt at $25 a load.<sup> (4)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  Both Derryberry and Gardner testified to the\r\nexistence of the oral agreement.  As acknowledged by Gardner, Derryberry began delivering\r\nthe loads and continued performance until Gardner removed him from the job.  By Gardner's\r\nown admission, a contract existed for the purchase of the 1,000 loads from Derryberry.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant appears to argue that since the oral agreement has no term of duration,\r\nGardner could terminate it at will.  Generally, contracts that are indefinite in duration and\r\ncontemplate continuing performance or successive performances can be terminated at the\r\nwill of either party.  <em>Clear Lake City Water Auth. v. Clear Lake Utils. Co.</em>,<em> </em>549 S.W.2d 385,\r\n387, 390 (Tex. 1977).  The agreement here specified a 1000-load requirement, which served\r\nas a limit.  <em>See generally Rolling Lands Invs., L.C. v. Nw. Airport Mgmt., L.P.</em>,   111 S.W.3d\r\n187, 197 (Tex. App.--Texarkana 2003, pet. denied). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant assumes the oral agreement is like an oral employment contract which by\r\nlaw is terminable at will.  <em>See Brown v. Sabre, Inc.</em>, 173 S.W.3d 581, 585 (Tex. App.--Fort\r\nWorth 2005, no pet.).  The oral agreement on the 1,000 loads is not an employment contract,\r\nbut an agreement for the sale and purchase of fill dirt.  Gardner could not, without more, \r\nunilaterally cancel an agreement to buy a specific quantity of dirt (1,000 loads) from\r\nDerryberry at the specific price of $25 per load.  The dirt, not the person delivering the dirt,\r\nwas the dominant subject of the agreement.  Appellant's refusal to allow Derryberry to enter\r\nthe work site did not terminate appellant's obligation under the contract to purchase $1000\r\nloads at $25 a load. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues there was no contract breach.  <em>See generally Aguiar v. Segal</em>, 167\r\nS.W.3d 443, 450 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied)(elements of contract\r\nclaim).  The undisputed facts as reflected in Gardner's and Derryberry's testimony --- that\r\nGardner agreed to buy 1,000 loads of dirt from Derryberry at $25 a load, that Derryberry\r\ncommenced performance and was able to deliver the dirt absent Gardner's firing him, that\r\nGardner fired Derryberry before completing the purchase agreement and would not allow\r\nDerryberry's truck on the project site to deliver the dirt --- establish appellant's breach of the\r\ncontract.  We overrule issues seven through ten. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Damages</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues eleven and twelve, appellant argues the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support the jury's $8,050 damages award for the 1,000 loads of dirt.  Appellant\r\ncharacterizes the damages as lost profits and states Derryberry's proof is \"mere ipse dixit and\r\nnot competent testimony.\"  Both Derryberry and Gardner stated Derryberry was paid for the\r\ndirt he actually delivered to the project site.  Derryberry explained his profit margin on each\r\nload, testified he delivered hundreds of loads, and testified 566 loads of \"slick fill\" were\r\ndelivered by other suppliers after he was forced to leave the job site.  What was not shown\r\nis how many of the 1000 loads Derryberry actually delivered, for which he was paid before\r\nthe contract was breached, and the number of loads, if any, for which Derryberry was paid\r\nafter Gardner forced him off the site.  While Gardner's and Derryberry's testimony provides\r\nsome evidence of damages, the evidence is factually insufficient to support the $8,050\r\ndamage award for breach of the 1000 load contract.  We overrule issue eleven and sustain\r\nissue twelve.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Attorney's Fees</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues thirteen and fourteen, appellant argues the evidence supporting the jury's\r\nfinding of $12,600 in attorney's fees is legally and factually insufficient. Appellant maintains\r\nDerryberry's counsel did not segregate the time spent on the breach of the oral contract claim\r\nfrom that spent on prosecuting and defending the other causes of action pursued in the case\r\nfor which attorney's fees are not recoverable.  Derryberry argues the attorney's fees do not\r\nhave to be segregated, because the fees arise out of the same transaction and the claims and\r\ndefenses are so interrelated that their \"prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of\r\nessentially the same facts.\"  <em>Stewart Title Guar. Co. v. Sterling</em>, 822 S.W.2d 1, 11 (Tex.\r\n1991)(quoting <em>Flint &amp; Assocs. v. Intercontinental Pipe &amp; Steel, Inc., </em>739 S.W.2d 622, 624-25\r\n(Tex. App.--Dallas 1987, writ denied). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Supreme Court modified its holding in <em>Sterling</em> after this case was tried.  <em>See Tony\r\nGullo Motors I, L.P. v. Chapa, </em>212 S.W.3d 299, 313 (Tex. 2006).  If any attorney's fees in\r\nthe case \"relate solely to a claim for which such fees are unrecoverable, a claimant must\r\nsegregate recoverable from unrecoverable fees.\"  <em>Id.</em>; <em>see also Varner v. Cardenas, </em>218\r\nS.W.3d 68, 69 (Tex. 2007).  \"Intertwined facts do not make tort fees recoverable[.] <em>Tony\r\nGullo Motors, </em>212 S.W.3d at 313.  \"It is only when legal services advance both recoverable\r\nand unrecoverable claims that the services are so intertwined that the associated fees need\r\nnot be segregated.\"  <em>A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Beyer, </em>No. 05-0580, 2007 WL 2811350,\r\nat *5 (Tex. Sept. 28, 2007) (citing <em>Chapa, </em>212 S.W.3d at 313-14).  Derryberry did not\r\nsegregate his attorney's fees.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe Supreme Court has stated unsegregated attorney's fees are some evidence of what\r\nthe segregated fees should be; therefore, we overrule the legal sufficiency challenge in issue\r\nthirteen.  <em>See Chapa, </em>212 S.W.3d at 314.  An unsegregated fee amount requires a remand. \r\n<em>Id.  </em>We sustain the factual sufficiency challenge in issue fourteen.     </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> <center>Conclusion</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThe January 8, 2003,<sup> </sup>written agreement to agree is unenforceable as a matter of law. \r\nAlthough the record establishes the existence and breach of a specific oral contract regarding\r\nthe 1,000 loads of dirt, the evidence supporting the amount of damages resulting from the\r\nbreach of the contract is factually insufficient.  Furthermore, the attorney's fees award are\r\nunsegregated.  We reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the cause for a new trial. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tREVERSED AND RENDERED IN PART; REVERSED AND REMANDED IN\r\nPART.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>  \t</span><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t_________________________________</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  DAVID GAULTNEY           </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t           Justice</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Submitted on June 14, 2007 </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Opinion Delivered November 8, 2007</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p>Before McKeithen, C.J., Gaultney and Kreger, JJ.\r\n</p><p>1.

Appellant\r\nAllamon Tool Company originally sued Jackey Derryberry, a supplier of fill dirt, for fraud,\r\nDTPA violations, and removal of a mechanic's lien.  Those claims were abandoned at trial. \r\n\tDerryberry filed a counterclaim for breach of contract, along with other causes of\r\naction, against Allamon Tool.  The only issues submitted to the jury were Derryberry's\r\nclaims against Allamon Tool for breach of contract and attorney's fees.  The trial court\r\nsigned a final judgment against Allamon Tool and awarded Derryberry $39,550 in damages\r\nbased on a breach of two contracts, one written and one oral, and awarded Derryberry\r\n$12,600 in attorney's fees.  Allamon Tool filed this appeal.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tWe conclude the jury's findings concerning the written agreement are immaterial.  As\r\na matter of law, the document is not an enforceable contract.  We reverse and render a take-nothing judgment on that claim.  The evidence is insufficient to support the damage award\r\non the oral contract and the award of attorney's fees.  We reverse the judgment and remand\r\nthe cause for a new trial for damages and attorney's fees for breach of that contract.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>The Facts</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant's representative on the construction project was Lee Gardner.  Derryberry\r\ntestified he and Gardner agreed Derryberry would supply \"cheap dirt\" on the project in\r\nexchange for receiving the rest of the site work.  Derryberry described the agreement as\r\nfollows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>  \tQ.\t[Derryberry's Attorney]. Now, then, did you guys talk about your\r\nability to deliver dirt to the Allamon Tool site?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.\t[Derryberry]. Yes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.\tAnd how much dirt was being requested at that time?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.\tWell, we talked numbers, we were talking about a thousand loads.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  \tWere you willing to give a special price on that dirt?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.  \tYes, sir.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  \tIn exchange for what?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.  \tFor the rest of the site work.    </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ. \tWhat does that [mean]?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t. . . . </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA. \t[I]f I supply this [dirt] for this lower price because fortunately I can,\r\nand even if I'm breaking even on that, I know down the line there's, I\r\nmean, looking at the site, there's going to be tons of select fill needed,\r\ntons of crushed concrete.  I will do this price if you give me the rest of\r\nit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  \tWas that something you told Lee Gardner that was a requirement for\r\nyou to give him the dirt?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.  \tYes.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.  \tThe fill dirt at a cheap price?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA.  \tYes, sir. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Derryberry delivered some of the dirt before he asked Gardner to sign a document Derryberry\r\npresented.  The document states as follows:  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThis is an agreement between Allamon Tool Company (representative Lee\r\nGardner) and Fairway Construction for the Freeport Road location, Lots 9 &amp;\r\n10.  Fairway Construction will supply labor and materials to include, but not\r\nlimited to, fill, rip rap, select fill, form sand, base materials, drainage pipes,\r\nmachine hours and labor.  All invoices close on Saturdays and will be due\r\nwithin 10 days.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<br><br>\r\n<p><span>Derryberry and Gardner signed and dated the document.  Derryberry testified he would not\r\nhave agreed to sell the cheap dirt (\"slick fill\") at the $25 per load price if Gardner had not\r\nagreed to give him the rest of the site work.   </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tGardner had a different view.  He explained that the document he signed was an\r\nagreement to pay Derryberry for materials Derryberry supplied.  Derryberry was paid for the\r\ndirt he supplied.  Although Gardner acknowledged he orally agreed to purchase 1,000 loads\r\nof dirt from Derryberry for $25 a load, Gardner testified he never agreed to award Derryberry\r\nthe rest of the site work and never intended to give Derryberry the exclusive right to sell fill\r\ndirt for the project.  Gardner explained the agreement as follows:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tQ.\t[Appellant's attorney]: Now, there's no amounts for anything in Exhibit\r\nNo. 1 [the written agreement].  What was your understanding of what\r\nthe amounts were going to be and the prices were going to be?  Is that\r\nsomething that had to be negotiated in the future?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tA. \t[Gardner] We never really discussed any specifics.  The only specifics\r\nwe ever discussed were, up front, we talked about a thousand loads of\r\nfill dirt at 25 dollars a load. . . . And so, the only thing that we ever,\r\ndiscussed was a thousand loads of dirt.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t. . . .</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\t\tI had an agreement to buy a thousand loads of dirt. . . . And then when\r\nhe [Derryberry] brought the agreement over halfway through his part\r\non the job, I signed an agreement to pay for the dirt or anything that we\r\nbought from him, that I agreed to pay him.  That's the agreement I\r\nsigned with Mr. Derryberry on January the 8th of 2003.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span> </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>Gardner further testified that any dirt delivered in the future would have to be negotiated\r\nlater.  Gardner also explained he never let Derryberry fulfill the 1,000-loads agreement,\r\nbecause he fired Derryberry. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>The Document</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issue one, appellant argues the document is not a valid, enforceable contract as a\r\nmatter of law, because it lacks material and essential terms and is merely a non-binding\r\nagreement to agree in the future.  Whether an agreement is an enforceable contract is\r\ngenerally a question of law.  <em>Meru v.

Appellant argues the evidence is\r\nlegally and factually insufficient to support the findings relating to the 1,000 loads.  In a legal\r\nsufficiency challenge, the reviewing court considers the evidence in the light most favorable\r\nto the verdict, credits favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could, and disregards contrary\r\nevidence unless reasonable jurors could not. <em> City of Keller v.

In a factual sufficiency challenge, the reviewing court considers all of the\r\nevidence and may set aside the verdict only if the evidence is so against the great weight and\r\npreponderance of evidence that it is clearly wrong and unjust.  <em>Dow Chem.

In his counterclaim, Derryberry pled the written agreement.  Derryberry, in\r\neffect, argues the parties tried the oral agreement by consent.  </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant called Gardner as a witness at trial.  On direct examination, Gardner\r\nexpressly testified to the existence of the oral agreement.  Derryberry testified, without\r\nobjection, that he agreed to deliver 1,000 loads of dirt at $25 a load.  The trial court\r\nsubmitted jury questions on the oral agreement claim to the jury.  Appellant did not object\r\non \"failure to plead\" grounds.  <em>See generally In re S.A.P.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"894636\"><a href=\"/opinion/894636/in-re-sap/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">574</span></a></span>, 576-77 (Tex.\r\n2005); <em>see also Southwestern Resolution Corp. v. Watson</em>, 964 S.W.2d 262,264 (Tex. 1997). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tThere is essentially no factual dispute over the existence of the oral agreement to\r\npurchase a 1000 loads of dirt at $25 a load.<sup> (4)</sup>\r\n<p><span>  Both Derryberry and Gardner testified to the\r\nexistence of the oral agreement.  As acknowledged by Gardner, Derryberry began delivering\r\nthe loads and continued performance until Gardner removed him from the job.  By Gardner's\r\nown admission, a contract existed for the purchase of the 1,000 loads from Derryberry.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant appears to argue that since the oral agreement has no term of duration,\r\nGardner could terminate it at will.  Generally, contracts that are indefinite in duration and\r\ncontemplate continuing performance or successive performances can be terminated at the\r\nwill of either party.  <em>Clear Lake City Water Auth. v.

App.--Texarkana 2003, pet. denied). </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant assumes the oral agreement is like an oral employment contract which by\r\nlaw is terminable at will.  <em>See Brown v. Sabre, Inc.</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1355722\"><a href=\"/opinion/1355722/brown-v-sabre-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">581</span></a></span>, 585 (Tex. App.--Fort\r\nWorth 2005, no pet.).  The oral agreement on the 1,000 loads is not an employment contract,\r\nbut an agreement for the sale and purchase of fill dirt.  Gardner could not, without more, \r\nunilaterally cancel an agreement to buy a specific quantity of dirt (1,000 loads) from\r\nDerryberry at the specific price of $25 per load.  The dirt, not the person delivering the dirt,\r\nwas the dominant subject of the agreement.  Appellant's refusal to allow Derryberry to enter\r\nthe work site did not terminate appellant's obligation under the contract to purchase $1000\r\nloads at $25 a load. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tAppellant argues there was no contract breach.  <em>See generally Aguiar v. Segal</em>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1628998\"><a href=\"/opinion/1628998/aguiar-v-segal/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">443</span></a></span>, 450 (Tex. App.--Houston [14th Dist.] 2005, pet. denied)(elements of contract\r\nclaim).  The undisputed facts as reflected in Gardner's and Derryberry's testimony --- that\r\nGardner agreed to buy 1,000 loads of dirt from Derryberry at $25 a load, that Derryberry\r\ncommenced performance and was able to deliver the dirt absent Gardner's firing him, that\r\nGardner fired Derryberry before completing the purchase agreement and would not allow\r\nDerryberry's truck on the project site to deliver the dirt --- establish appellant's breach of the\r\ncontract.  We overrule issues seven through ten. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Damages</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues eleven and twelve, appellant argues the evidence is legally and factually\r\ninsufficient to support the jury's $8,050 damages award for the 1,000 loads of dirt.  Appellant\r\ncharacterizes the damages as lost profits and states Derryberry's proof is \"mere ipse dixit and\r\nnot competent testimony.\"  Both Derryberry and Gardner stated Derryberry was paid for the\r\ndirt he actually delivered to the project site.  Derryberry explained his profit margin on each\r\nload, testified he delivered hundreds of loads, and testified 566 loads of \"slick fill\" were\r\ndelivered by other suppliers after he was forced to leave the job site.  What was not shown\r\nis how many of the 1000 loads Derryberry actually delivered, for which he was paid before\r\nthe contract was breached, and the number of loads, if any, for which Derryberry was paid\r\nafter Gardner forced him off the site.  While Gardner's and Derryberry's testimony provides\r\nsome evidence of damages, the evidence is factually insufficient to support the $8,050\r\ndamage award for breach of the 1000 load contract.  We overrule issue eleven and sustain\r\nissue twelve.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span><center>Attorney's Fees</center>\r\n</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span>\tIn issues thirteen and fourteen, appellant argues the evidence supporting the jury's\r\nfinding of $12,600 in attorney's fees is legally and factually insufficient. Appellant maintains\r\nDerryberry's counsel did not segregate the time spent on the breach of the oral contract claim\r\nfrom that spent on prosecuting and defending the other causes of action pursued in the case\r\nfor which attorney's fees are not recoverable.  Derryberry argues the attorney's fees do not\r\nhave to be segregated, because the fees arise out of the same transaction and the claims and\r\ndefenses are so interrelated that their \"prosecution or defense entails proof or denial of\r\nessentially the same facts.\"  <em>Stewart Title Guar.

Jackey Derryberry was doing business as Fairway Construction.\r\n</p><p>2. Some courts have considered rock products and the like to be \"goods\" under the\r\nUniform Commercial Code.  <em>See, e.g., Salt Lake City Corp. v. Kasler Corp., </em><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1972933\"><a href=\"/opinion/1972933/salt-lake-city-corp-v-kasler-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">855</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

App. 1987).  The parties do not assert the application of Chapter 2\r\n(Sale of Goods) of the Business and Commerce Code.  We address the issues presented.  The\r\nresolution of the appeal is the same under the Texas Business and Commerce Code.  <em>See\r\n</em>Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. § 2.201(a), § 2.204(c); § 2.306 (Vernon 1994).\r\n</p><p>3. Derryberry submitted jury questions on the oral agreement and the written agreement. \r\nWhile he asserts the two are linked, he also argues there was, at the very least, an oral\r\nagreement for 1,000 loads of dirt at $25 per load.\r\n</p><p>4. The parties do not discuss the statute of frauds presumably because the agreement\r\nwas to be performed within one year.  <em>See</em> Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. § 26.01 (Vernon\r\nSupp. 2006) (general statute of frauds) (Agreement that is not to be performed within one\r\nyear from date of agreement must be in writing).  The parties also do not discuss the\r\napplication, if any, of the statute of frauds provision in Chapter 2 (Sale of Goods) of the\r\nTexas Business and Commerce Code. <em>See</em> Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Ann. § 2.201(a) (Vernon 1994)\r\n(Contract for $500 or more must be in writing, unless, among other exceptions, the party\r\nagainst whom enforcement is sought admits in his pleading, testimony, or otherwise in court,\r\nthat a contract was made.).</p></span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n</div>",
