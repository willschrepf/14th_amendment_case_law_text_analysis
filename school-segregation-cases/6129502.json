DAVIS                         5\n\n                          OPINION\n\nIKUTA, Circuit Judge:\n\n    Jesse James Andrews appeals from the district court’s\ndenial of all but one of the claims raised in his petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2254. The state\ncross-appeals the district court’s grant of relief on Andrews’s\nclaim that his counsel’s assistance was ineffective at the\npenalty phase of his capital murder trial. We dismiss as\nunripe the claim the district court certified for appeal, and\ndeny Andrews’s motion to expand the certificate of\nappealability to include uncertified claims. We reverse the\ndistrict court’s grant of relief on the ineffective assistance\nclaim because, under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), the California\nSupreme Court did not unreasonably apply Supreme Court\nprecedent in concluding that Andrews was not prejudiced by\nany deficient performance by his counsel.\n\n                               I\n\n                               A\n\n    On December 9, 1979, police were called to a Los\nAngeles apartment, where they found the bodies of three\nmurder victims. People v. Andrews, 776 P.2d 285, 288 (Cal.\n1989). The murder victims were Preston Wheeler, who lived\nin the apartment, Patrice Brandon, and Ronald Chism. Id.\nThe California Supreme Court described the murder scene as\nfollows:\n\n       Wheeler had been stabbed in the chest six\n       times and shot in the neck at close range with\n       either a .32– or .357– caliber weapon. His\n\f6                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n       face and head were bruised, and his face had\n       been slashed with a knife. Brandon and\n       Chism had been strangled with wire coat\n       hangers. Their faces were bruised, Chism’s\n       extensively. Brandon’s anus was extremely\n       dilated, bruised, reddened and torn, consistent\n       with the insertion of a penis shortly before her\n       death. There was also redness around the\n       opening of her vagina, and vaginal samples\n       revealed the presence of semen and\n       spermatozoa. All three victims were bound\n       hand and foot.\n\nId.\n\n    Approximately a year later, police arrested Charles\nSanders in connection with the murders. Id. Sanders entered\ninto a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to three\ncounts of second degree murder, admitted a gun\nenhancement, and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution,\nin exchange for a sentence of 17 years to life in prison. Id.\nDuring his interrogation by the police, Sanders gave both a\ntape-recorded and a written statement. Id. He also testified\nat Andrews’s trial, and described the crime as follows:\n\n       Sanders testified that he and [Andrews]\n       devised a plan to rob Wheeler, a drug dealer.\n       [Andrews] armed himself with a\n       .357 magnum and gave Sanders a .38–or\n       .32–caliber automatic. On the evening of the\n       murders, they visited their friend, Carol\n       Brooks, who lived in the same apartment\n       building as Wheeler, and then went to\n       Wheeler’s apartment. In response to their\n\f             ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      7\n\nknocking, Wheeler, who apparently knew\n[Andrews], let them in. Also inside the\napartment was a woman (Patrice Brandon).\nAfter smoking some marijuana with Wheeler,\n[Andrews] and Sanders drew their guns.\nSanders tied Wheeler and Brandon with belts\nand socks, put on a pair of gloves, and began\nto search the apartment for drugs and money.\nExcept for some powder on a saucer which\nappeared to be cocaine, the search was\nunsuccessful. [Andrews] questioned Wheeler,\nwho denied having any drugs or money.\nSaying he would make Brandon talk,\n[Andrews] dragged her into the kitchen and\nclosed the door. Sanders remained in the\nliving room with Wheeler.\n\nSanders heard [Andrews] hitting Brandon and\nlater heard sounds as though they were having\nsex. When [Andrews] came out of the kitchen\nshortly thereafter, Sanders saw Brandon’s\npants around her ankles.\n\n[Andrews] put his gun in Wheeler’s mouth.\nHe threatened to kill Wheeler and Brandon\nunless Wheeler revealed the location of the\ndrugs. Wheeler said the ‘dope’ was in the\nattic, and pointed out a trap door leading up to\nit. Sanders climbed into the attic. While in\nthe attic, Sanders heard two shots. When he\ncame down, [Andrews] told him he had shot\nWheeler because the latter had tried to jump\nout the window. Sanders asked if Wheeler\nwas dead. [Andrews] responded he was\n\f8                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n       ‘standing right up’ on Wheeler when he fired\n       the gun . . . . When Sanders asked about\n       Brandon, [Andrews] replied he had killed her\n       before leaving the kitchen.\n\n       While [Andrews] and Sanders were cleaning\n       up the apartment, Ronald Chism knocked on\n       the door and asked if everything was all right.\n       [Andrews] said Wheeler was home and\n       invited him inside. [Andrews] then hit Chism\n       on the head, tied him up, and took him into\n       the bathroom. Sanders saw [Andrews] sitting\n       astride Chism’s back, joining and separating\n       his clenched fists in a tugging motion,\n       apparently strangling Chism. Sanders then\n       saw [Andrews] go into the kitchen and choke\n       Brandon with a wire clothes hanger. When\n       the two left the apartment, [Andrews] gave\n       Sanders some money, saying it was all he had\n       found.\n\nIn re Andrews, 52 P.3d 656, 658 (Cal. 2002) (alterations,\ncitations, and internal quotation marks omitted). Andrews\nwas eventually arrested, and he was charged in June 1982.\n\n    At trial, the jury heard Sanders’s testimony as well as the\ntestimony of Carol Brooks. Brooks confirmed that Andrews\nand Sanders visited her on the night of the murders and told\nher about their plan to “get some money” from Wheeler.\nPeople v. Andrews, 776 P.2d at 289. A week after the\nincident, Sanders told her about his involvement in the\nmurders. Id. Then, a few weeks later, Andrews confessed to\nher that he shot Wheeler, had sex with Brandon, and took\n$300 during the robbery. Id.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                               9\n\n    The prosecution also presented fingerprint evidence. Id.\nPolice experts analyzed 50 prints lifted from the apartment;\nthree prints belonged to Andrews. Id. One fingerprint was\nfound on a coffee table in Wheeler’s living room. Id. Two\npalm prints were found on the kitchen floor, on either side of\nthe spot where Brandon’s body was found, the left palm print\nbeing about a foot from her body.\n\n    The defense primarily focused on undermining Sanders’s\ncredibility. Id. Two jail inmates who had been incarcerated\nwith Sanders testified. Id. They stated that, while Sanders\nwas incarcerated with them, he made statements suggesting\nhe planned to lie about the murders to shift blame onto\nAndrews and away from himself. Id.\n\n    The jury deliberated for three days before finding\nAndrews guilty of murder.1 The jury also found three special\ncircumstances to be true. Two special circumstances related\nto the offense conduct: (1) multiple murder and robbery\nmurder, based on the murders of Wheeler, Brandon, and\nChism, and the robbery of Wheeler, and (2) rape-murder,\nbased on the rape and murder of Brandon. In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 659. The third special circumstance was\nAndrews’s conviction for murder of a grocery store clerk in\n1967. Id.\n\n    At the penalty phase, both the prosecutor and defense\ncounsel made brief presentations. The prosecutor presented\nevidence through a joint stipulation. Id. He noted that the\njury had already found that Andrews had been convicted of\nmurder in 1967. The parties also stipulated that Andrews had\n\n\n  1\n    Andrews was convicted after his second trial, because the jury failed\nto reach a verdict in the first trial.\n\f10                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nbeen convicted of armed robbery in May 1968, convicted of\nescape in November 1969, and convicted of robbery in June\n1977. Id. The stipulation did not describe the facts of the\noffenses underlying these additional convictions. The\nprosecution also submitted photographs of the dead bodies of\nPatrice Brandon and Ronald Chism as they were found by the\npolice in the apartment; the photos had been excluded at the\nguilt phase on the ground they were unduly inflammatory. Id.\nFinally, the parties stipulated that Andrews’s birth date was\nJuly 2, 1950. Id.\n\n    The defense evidence consisted of two sworn statements\nthat were read to the jury. Id. The statements described facts\nunderlying the incident in September 1966 that formed the\nbasis of Andrews’s 1967 conviction for murder. According\nto the statements, Andrews and a 17-year-old companion,\nboth of whom were armed, attempted to rob a grocery store,\nand the companion fired three shots, killing the grocery store\nclerk. Id.\n\n    In his closing argument, defense counsel focused on\nmitigating circumstances. He argued that Andrews’s crimes\nwere unsophisticated, occurred several years apart, and all\ninvolved the unexpected escalation of a planned robbery. Id.\nHe pointed out that Andrews was only 15 years old at the\ntime of the murder of the grocery store clerk, and was not the\nshooter. Id. He portrayed Andrews’s conduct as less\nblameworthy because the murders occurred while Andrews,\nSanders, Wheeler, and Brandon were under the influence of\nillegal drugs. Id. at 659–60. Finally, he emphasized that\nother murderers had received life without the possibility of\nparole despite the jury’s finding of special circumstances, and\ndespite more blameworthy conduct. Id. at 659. He pointed\nout that in this very case, Sanders received a sentence of only\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       11\n\n17 years to life. Id. at 660. The prosecution made no\nrebuttal.\n\n   After one day of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict\nimposing the death penalty for each of the three murder\ncounts. The court sentenced Andrews to death on June 8,\n1984. The California Supreme Court affirmed the conviction\nand sentence on direct appeal on August 3, 1989. People v.\nAndrews, 776 P.2d at 285, 288.\n\n                              B\n\n    Andrews filed petitions for state post-conviction relief,\nclaiming, among other things, that his counsel’s assistance\nwas ineffective at the penalty phase because counsel did not\nadequately investigate and present mitigating evidence. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court summarily denied all of Andrews’s\nclaims, except for his penalty phase ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim.\n\n                              1\n\n    The California Supreme Court appointed a referee to take\nevidence and make factual findings on six questions related\nto Andrews’s penalty phase ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 659. Under California law,\n“[b]ecause appellate courts are ill-suited to conduct\nevidentiary hearings, it is customary for appellate courts to\nappoint a referee to take evidence and make\nrecommendations as to the resolution of disputed factual\nissues.” People v. Romero, 883 P.2d 388, 393 (Cal. 1994), as\nmodified on denial of reh’g (Jan. 5, 1995). While a referee’s\nfindings on factual questions are not binding on the California\nSupreme Court, they “are entitled to great weight when\n\f12                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.” In re Johnson, 957 P.2d\n299, 307 (Cal. 1998). The six questions provided to the\nreferee were:\n\n       1. What mitigating character and background\n       evidence could have been, but was not,\n       presented by petitioner’s trial attorneys at his\n       penalty trial?\n\n       2. What investigative steps by trial counsel, if\n       any, would have led to each such item of\n       information?\n\n       3. What investigative steps, if any, did trial\n       counsel take in an effort to gather mitigating\n       evidence to be presented at the penalty phase?\n\n       4. What tactical or financial constraints, if\n       any, weighed against the investigation or\n       presentation of mitigating character and\n       background evidence at the penalty phase?\n\n       5. What evidence, damaging to petitioner, but\n       not presented by the prosecution at the guilt or\n       penalty trials, would likely have been\n       presented in rebuttal, if petitioner had\n       introduced any such mitigating character and\n       background evidence?\n\n       6. Did petitioner himself request that either\n       the investigation or the presentation of\n       mitigating evidence at the penalty phase be\n       curtailed in any manner? If so, what\n       specifically did petitioner request?\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       13\n\nIn re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 659.\n\n    The referee received the testimony of more than\n50 witnesses over the span of six years. Id. at 660. As a\nthreshold matter, the referee pointed out two factors that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court should take into account in\nevaluating the information obtained in the reference hearing.\nFirst, the referee acknowledged that “[t]he length of time\navailable to develop, expand and refine the depth of the\nevidence presented at this reference hearing obviously creates\nan artificial setting and this court notes that the abundance\nand massiveness of the evidence presented could not and\nwould not have been the same in an original trial.” Id. at 660\nn.2. Among other things, “[s]trategic considerations alone\nwould have undoubtedly resulted in a greater refinement of\nthe quality of evidence presented.” Id. Second, the referee’s\nconsideration of counsel’s work was hindered by the fact that\nthe lead counsel, Gerard Lenoir, died before the referee\nconducted the hearing, and only the secondary counsel,\nHalvor Miller, was available. Id. at 663 n.7. Miller could not\nrecall the full scope of Lenoir’s investigation. Id. at 663.\n\n    In her report, the referee provided one-paragraph\nsummaries and detailed factual findings in response to each\nquestion. The California Supreme Court both summarized\nthe referee’s findings and explained the weight it gave to\nthese findings. Id. at 660–65.\n\n     In response to the first question (what mitigating\ncharacter and background evidence could have been, but was\nnot, presented by petitioner’s trial attorneys at his penalty\ntrial), the referee identified three broad categories of\nmitigating evidence that were available but not presented to\nthe jury: Andrews’s family background; the conditions of his\n\f14                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nconfinement in a juvenile reform school and in the Alabama\nprison system; and his mental health. Id. at 660. As\nsummarized in the court’s opinion, the referee’s report found\nthe following regarding Andrews’s background. When he\nwas very young, Andrews’s alcoholic parents separated, and\nhis mother left him to be raised by his grandparents and aunt\nin a large family home with his siblings and cousins, located\nin a poor, segregated neighborhood of Mobile, Alabama. Id.\nThe referee described Andrews’s grandfather as “loving,\nbenevolent, and responsible,” id., and the court added that\nAndrews’s mother regularly sent money and clothing to her\nchildren and that Andrews’s upbringing and early family life\nwere “relatively stable and without serious privation or\nabuse,” id. at 670. When Andrews was around nine or ten,\nhis mother returned home with children by another marriage,\nof whom Andrews was jealous. Id. at 660, 670. Around that\ntime Andrews’s grandfather, a “pivotal figure” in his life,\ndied. Id. at 660 (internal quotation marks omitted). Andrews\nbecame withdrawn, skipped school, and at age 14, committed\ncar theft and was sent to a reform school known as Mt.\nMeigs, formally the Alabama Industrial School for Negro\nChildren. Id.\n\n    Summarizing the referee’s report, the California Supreme\nCourt stated that “[a]t Mt. Meigs, petitioner encountered\nappalling conditions.” Id. According to the referee’s report,\none witness described it as “a farming operation and a penal\ncolony for children,” while others described “inhuman\nconditions, inadequate food and clothing and severe beatings”\nwith “sticks, broom handles, tree limbs, and hoe handles . . .\nor fan belts.” Among other things, the referee found that\nAndrews “was subjected to beatings, brutality, inadequate\nconditions and sexual predators.” Id. at 661. Further, “[h]is\npassiveness and small physique caused him to be a target of\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       15\n\nolder, tougher boys, from whom no protection or separation\nwas provided.” Id.\n\n    After his release from Mt. Meigs, Andrews began to\nassociate with Freddie Square, an older boy with\n“manipulative and criminal tendencies.” Id. In September\n1966, three months after Andrews’s release, Andrews and\nSquare entered a grocery store, drew guns, and announced\nthat they were conducting a robbery. Id. When “the store\nclerk placed his hand down the front of his apron,” Square\nshot the clerk, killing him. Id. Andrews “acted as a lookout\nin the robbery, but played a more active role when he and\nSquare robbed a taxi driver during their getaway,” and used\nthe taxi as a getaway car. Id. At the reference hearing, Harry\nWoodall, the driver of the stolen taxi, testified that Andrews\nand Square robbed him at gunpoint. Id. at 665. While\npointing a gun at Woodall, Andrews twice said, “Let’s shoot\nhim.” Id. Andrews and Square stole Woodall’s wallet, then\nordered him out of the taxi and fired three shots at him;\nAndrews fired at least two of the shots. Id. In 1967,\nAndrews was convicted of murder based on the grocery store\nincident, and in 1968, he was convicted of armed robbery of\nthe taxi driver. Id. at 661 n.4. Just before he turned 18, he\nwas committed to Alabama state prison. Id. at 661. He\nescaped from prison and was convicted of that offense in\n1969. Id. at 659. He remained in prison until 1976.\n\n    Summarizing the referee’s findings about conditions in\nthe four different prisons in which Andrews was confined\nover ten years, the California Supreme Court stated:\n\n       [The referee] described conditions in these\n       institutions as abysmal, characterized by\n       severe overcrowding, racial segregation,\n\f16                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n       substandard facilities, no separation of the\n       tougher inmates from younger or smaller\n       inmates, constant violence, the persistent\n       threat of sexual assaults and the constant\n       presence of sexual pressure, the availability\n       and necessity of weapons by all inmates, and\n       degrading conditions in disciplinary modules.\n       [Andrews] not only received beatings but was\n       also personally subjected to sexual assaults.\n\nId. at 661 (internal quotation marks omitted). The referee\nstated that Andrews “was rarely the instigator of violence,”\nwas “the prey rather than the predator” when he was\ninvolved, and was often a target of violence due to his small\nstature. Id. at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted). He\nalso “appeared to adjust well when the structure permitted”\nand, “when circumstances permitted, he tended to hold\npositions of responsibility.” Id. At the same time, however,\nAndrews “was personally involved in violence, including the\nstabbings of two inmates who had been threatening him.” Id.\nat 661 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n    Shortly after his release from prison in 1976, Andrews\nengaged in an attempted robbery of a laundry. Id. According\nto testimony at the reference hearing:\n\n       Mobile Police Officer Pettis testified that on\n       March 23, 1977, he responded to a robbery\n       call. Entering the store from which the call\n       came, he and other officers saw [Andrews]\n       holding a crying young woman hostage with\n       a cocked gun at her head. He told the officers\n       to leave and “continued to repeat, ‘Someone’s\n       going to get shot, I’m going to shoot.’” The\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       17\n\n       officers withdrew. Ultimately, [Andrews]\n       surrendered to the officers after releasing the\n       young woman and another woman whom he\n       had also held hostage.\n\nId. at 665. Andrews was arrested for the robbery and held in\nMobile County Jail. Id. at 661. After a failed attempt to\nescape from the jail, he succeeded in escaping on his second\ntry, and fled to California. Id. at 661 & n.5.\n\n    In California, Andrews met Debra Pickett, with whom he\nhad a stable relationship. Id. at 661. The couple had a child,\nand Andrews held a job during this time. Id. But by\nDecember 1979, Andrews had resumed using cocaine and\nleft his job and family. Id. Soon after, he committed the\nthree murders at issue here. Id.\n\n    The referee also described the testimony from mental\nhealth experts that could have been presented at the penalty\nphase. Summarizing the referee’s report, the California\nSupreme Court noted that defense experts diagnosed\nAndrews with a range of mental disorders, including attention\ndeficit disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and\nmild to moderate organic brain impairment, in part due to\ndrug use and possibly due to a head injury in prison. Id. The\ndefense experts opined that Andrews’s learning disability, the\nadverse circumstances of his childhood, the impact of the\ncorrectional systems, and the PTSD made his commission of\nthe murders and sexual assault more understandable and less\nmorally culpable. Id. at 661–62. The experts gave specific\nexamples of how Andrews’s impairments and the brutal\nconditions of incarceration made it difficult for him to avoid\ngetting into trouble with the law. Id. at 661–62, 670. For\nexample, one defense psychiatrist testified that Wheeler, one\n\f18                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nof the three victims in the December 1979 murders, had\ncalled Andrews a “faggot” a few days before the murders\noccurred, and Andrews’s PTSD would predispose him to\noverreact to the slur. Id. at 680. The psychiatrist concluded\nthat Andrews was “affected by serious emotional disturbance\nwhen he committed the murders.” Id.\n\n     The California Supreme Court then recounted the\nreferee’s findings on questions two, three, and four. These\nquestions addressed the investigative steps trial counsel took\nto gather mitigating evidence for the penalty phase, steps the\ntrial counsel could have taken to do so, and the constraints\nthat weighed against the trial counsel investigating or\npresenting mitigating character and background evidence at\nthe penalty phase. Id. at 662–64. According to the referee,\ntrial counsel hired defense investigators for the guilt phase,\nwhile the counsel themselves did the investigative work for\nthe penalty phase. Id. at 663. The trial counsel took two trips\nto Mobile, one in 1983 and another in 1984. On the first trip,\nthey spent a day searching court records for Andrews’s prior\nconvictions and documents relating to his background. Id.\nThey also searched for relatives and potential witnesses in\nAndrews’s neighborhood. Id. On the second trip, counsel\nobtained information about Andrews’s prior murder\nconviction at the county courthouse. Id. Counsel also\ntraveled to Pensacola, Florida, where they interviewed\nAndrews’s mother. Id. During the course of the interview,\nthey obtained information that Andrews was a slow learner,\nthat his grandparents raised him, and that he started getting\ninto trouble as a teenager. Id. Miller remembered telling\nAndrews’s mother that if he obtained Andrews’s permission\nto obtain information from family members or other contacts,\nhe or Lenoir would contact her for further information. Id.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        19\n\n    The California Supreme Court also summarized the\nreferee’s findings about the constraints placed on trial counsel\nin conducting their penalty phase investigation, though the\ndeath of Lenoir limited this aspect of the referee’s\ninvestigation. Id. at 663–64. According to the referee, there\nwere tactical, rather than financial, constraints. Id. Miller\nrecalled the main tactical constraint as “the adamancy of\npetitioner’s opposition to having his family, and in particular\nhis mother, testify at the trial.” Id. at 664. According to the\nreferee, “Mr. Miller was very consistent in his testimony\nregarding petitioner’s refusal to cooperate in this area, and\nthis position is supported circumstantially by statements made\nby petitioner as well as testimony from the prosecutor.” Id.\nMiller stated that Andrews had threatened to disrupt the\nproceedings if his directions were not followed, and both\ncounsel believed this threat was genuine. Id. “Acceding to\nthese wishes,” neither Miller nor Lenoir “pursued a full\ninvestigation of petitioner’s background or family and never\nlearned the names of family members with one or two\nexceptions.” Id.\n\n    In addition to the constraints imposed by Andrews, the\nreferee found that counsel were concerned about the effects\nof using prisoners as witnesses. Id. Miller doubted that\njurors would be impressed by the credibility and demeanor of\nthe prisoners, and he was concerned that calling prisoners as\nwitnesses would risk disclosure of Andrews’s misconduct in\nprison. Id. The referee found that Andrews had been\ninvolved in two stabbings of other inmates and had escaped\nfrom custodial facilities on two occasions. Id. Further, the\nreferee found that the inmates who provided testimony at the\nreference hearing had “substantial violent criminal records\nand these offenses included a substantial number of escapes.”\nId. Finally, Miller testified that he and Lenoir decided not to\n\f20                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\npresent evidence about Andrews’s upbringing, because the\nhouse and neighborhood in which Andrews grew up\nresembled the house and neighborhood in which Miller was\nraised, and so counsel thought a “poverty-presentation”\nlacked viability. Id.\n\n    The California Supreme Court also summarized the\nreferee’s views on additional investigative steps that counsel\ncould have taken. Id. at 662–63. The referee found that\nobtaining information regarding the circumstances of\nAndrews’s upbringing, the impact of the correctional\nfacilities in Alabama and Andrews’s adult experiences, and\nthe psychiatric aspects of Andrews’s history did not call for\n“any extraordinary efforts beyond simple persistence.” Id. at\n662. The referee believed that Andrews’s mother could have\nprovided more information about Andrews’s upbringing and\ndirected counsel to other family members and acquaintances\nwho could have provided general information regarding\nschooling issues. Id. Counsel could have obtained addresses\nand information about additional witnesses through publicly\navailable documents or through word of mouth. Id. The\nreferee also believed that “[s]everal areas of inquiry were\navailable relating to petitioner’s experiences in the\ncorrectional system in Alabama.” Id. Counsel could have\nobtained prison records from the juvenile and adult\ncorrectional systems and could have contacted inmates\nreferenced in those records. Id. Or counsel could have\nconducted “standard legal research of public records relating\nto lawsuits involving these institutions.” Id. While\nacknowledging that “petitioner’s cooperativeness was a\nsignificant issue,” the referee found that counsel could have\ndeveloped the information presented at the reference hearing\n“through outside sources in the absence of any cooperation\nfrom the petitioner.” Id. at 663.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        21\n\n    In addition, although there was “no significant written\nhistory” in the area of mental health, and there was little\nevidence of “family members having mental impairments,”\nthe referee found that counsel could have appointed\npsychiatric experts. Id. at 662. The referee acknowledged\nthat “[a]ny such inquiry may not necessarily have resulted in\nthe availability of evidence of the diagnoses of organic brain\nimpairment, learning disorders, or of post traumatic stress\ndisorder.” Id. According to the referee, “[t]he quality of\nstandardized personality tests was not the same, the\nknowledge of post traumatic stress disorder was in an infancy\nstage, and the resulting diagnosis may not necessarily have\nbeen favorable to the petitioner.” Id. at 662–63.\n\n    In addressing question five (what evidence, damaging to\npetitioner, but not presented by the prosecution at the guilt or\npenalty trials, would likely have been presented in rebuttal, if\npetitioner had introduced any such mitigating character and\nbackground evidence), the referee found that the\nprosecution’s rebuttal presentation could have included\nevidence about two of Andrews’s prior convictions. Id. at\n664. First, the prosecutor could have presented testimony\nfrom the taxi driver in the 1968 robbery, who would have\ntestified he heard Andrews say “[l]et’s shoot him,” and then\nfired at least two shots at him. Id. at 665. Second, the\nprosecution could have informed the jury about Andrews’s\nattempt to rob a laundry business following his release from\nprison in 1976, which involved holding two women hostage,\none with a gun to her head. Id. at 661, 665. The jury had\nheard that Andrews was convicted of these offenses, but it did\nnot hear the facts on which the conviction was based; the\nprosecutor could have introduced a complete description of\nthe underlying events as aggravating evidence, to show\n\f22                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nAndrews’s greater moral culpability for the rape and triple-\nmurder. Id. at 659, 664.\n\n    Further, the referee determined that the prosecution could\nhave called its own mental health experts to rebut Andrews’s\nevidence. Id. at 665. The state could have presented expert\ntestimony that Andrews did not suffer from PTSD, but rather\nsuffered from antisocial personality disorder, resented\nauthority, and had a normal-range IQ of 93. Id. A second\nstate expert would have testified that Andrews’s ability to\nhold a job and maintain a stable relationship with Debra\nPickett before he committed the murders strongly indicated\nthat he had not suffered brain damage. Id. In addition, the\nexpert would have testified that Andrews’s “behavior on the\nnight of the murders showed planning and thought, and it was\ntherefore unlikely that petitioner was under the influence of\nPCP when he committed the murders.” Id.\n\n    Finally, in response to question six (did petitioner himself\nrequest that either the investigation or the presentation of\nmitigating evidence at the penalty phase be curtailed in any\nmanner, and, if so, what specifically did petitioner request),\nthe referee concluded that there was no doubt that Andrews\n“adamantly” refused to allow counsel to approach his mother\nand family or to have them testify. Id. This conclusion was\nbased on the trial records and the consistent testimony of\nwitnesses at the reference hearing. Id. In response to specific\nquestioning from the trial court “regarding his reluctance to\nhave his mother called,” and in the face of the trial court’s\nadvice that his mother’s testimony would be valuable,\nAndrews “was very precise in his response, telling the judge\nthat he fully understood and that this was his choice and no\none else’s.” Id. (emphasis omitted). The referee further\nnoted that the lead counsel, Lenoir, “represented on the\n\f                          ANDREWS V. DAVIS                                23\n\nrecord at trial that petitioner refused to have his mother called\nand that he ‘had his reasons,’ which Mr. Lenoir did not wish\nto disclose to the court.” Id. The referee also found that\n“petitioner went so far as to threaten to disrupt the trial if his\nmother were called.” Id. Andrews’s opposition to having\ncounsel involve his family was corroborated by his older\nsister and uncontradicted by his mother.2 Id.\n\n                                      2\n\n    After considering “the record of the hearing, the referee’s\nfactual findings, and petitioner’s original trial,” the California\nSupreme Court concluded that “petitioner received\nconstitutionally adequate representation, and any inadequacy\ndid not result in prejudice.” Id. at 659.\n\n    In reaching this conclusion, the court began by stating the\nrequirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim\nunder Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984). First,\nthe court stated that “[t]o prove a claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel at the penalty phase trial, the petitioner\nmust establish that counsel’s performance [(1)] did not meet\nan objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms and [(2)] that he suffered prejudice\nthereby.” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 667 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n 2\n   At the reference hearing, Andrews disputed the finding that he did not\nwant his family involved, but the California Supreme Court noted that “the\nreferee credited Miller’s testimony that [Andrews] objected not only to his\nmother’s involvement, but also to that of any relatives,” and gave the\nreferee’s credibility determination the “great weight” to which it is entitled\nunder California law. Id. at 667.\n\f24                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n     Turning first to the deficiency prong, the California\nSupreme Court concluded that Andrews had not established\nthat his counsel’s performance was defective. Its reasoning\nwas as follows. Under Strickland, “the Supreme Court\nspecifically addressed counsel’s duty to investigate and made\nclear courts should not equate effective assistance with\nexhaustive investigation of potential mitigating evidence.”\nId. at 668. Any judicial scrutiny “must be highly deferential,”\nand courts must avoid second guessing counsel’s assistance\nand must “eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.” Id.\nat 667 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689). Further, while\n“counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to\nmake a reasonable decision that makes particular\ninvestigations unnecessary,” the Supreme Court made clear\nthat “a particular decision not to investigate must be directly\nassessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying\na heavy measure of deference to counsel’s judgments.” Id. at\n668 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690–91). Moreover,\n“valid strategic choices are possible even without extensive\ninvestigative efforts.” Id. (quoting Burger v. Kemp, 483 U.S.\n776, 794 (1987)). Finally, “[t]he reasonableness of counsel’s\nactions may be determined or substantially influenced by the\ndefendant’s own statements or actions,” and may be “based,\nquite properly, on informed strategic choices made by the\ndefendant and on information supplied by the defendant.” Id.\n(quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691).\n\n    Applying this deferential standard in light of the evidence\ndeveloped by the referee, the California Supreme Court\nconcluded that “counsel’s decision not to mount an all-out\ninvestigation into petitioner’s background in search of\nmitigating circumstances was supported by reasonable\nprofessional judgment.” Id. at 669 (quoting Burger, 483 U.S.\nat 794–95).\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              25\n\n    First, the California Supreme Court found that counsel\ncould have reasonably decided not to pursue information\nfrom Andrews’s family in light of Andrews’s decision to\ncurtail such an investigation. The court noted that while “the\nreferee found that counsel could have discovered the\nmitigating evidence presented at the reference hearing with\n‘simple persistence,’” the evidence showed that Andrews\nlimited the investigation counsel could undertake by insisting\nthat counsel not involve his family. Id. at 668. Counsel were\nwithin the range of professional competence in complying\nwith Andrews’s wishes, because under California law, “an\nattorney representing a defendant at the penalty phase of a\ncapital case is not required to present potentially mitigating\nevidence over the defendant’s objections.” Id. (quoting\nPeople v. Kirkpatrick, 874 P.2d 248, 262 (Cal. 1994)).3\n\n    Further, to the extent counsel interviewed Andrews’s\nmother and attempted to contact family members despite\nAndrews’s objection, the court found that counsel could have\nreasonably concluded that the information they obtained was\nnot powerfully mitigating. Id. at 670. Andrews’s mother\n“did not abandon him, but left him with an extended family\nincluding his ‘loving and responsible’ grandfather, regularly\n\n 3\n    Despite the constraints imposed by Andrews, the California Supreme\nCourt found that Andrews’s counsel traveled to Mobile, Alabama twice\nto search for relatives, potential witnesses, and legal documents, and also\ntraveled to Pensacola, Florida to interview Andrews’s mother. In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 663. The dissent concedes as much, Dissent at 97–98\nn.1, so its finding that Andrews’s counsel conducted “virtually no penalty\nphase investigation” is merely an expression of the dissent’s negative\nevaluation of counsel’s efforts. Dissent at 97. But because the California\nSupreme Court determined that counsel was reasonable in not pursuing\nfurther information, the only question raised under the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) is whether this was an objectively\nunreasonable application of Strickland. See Richter, 562 U.S. at 101.\n\f26                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nsent money and clothing to her children, and returned several\nyears later to remain in the family home.” Id. The testimony\nfrom family members generally showed Andrews’s early\nupbringing and family life “to be relatively stable and without\nserious privation or abuse. All but one of his siblings\ncompleted high school, and only one had a minor brush with\nthe law.” Id. Counsel’s preliminary investigation showed\nthat Andrews’s childhood was not mitigating: “Miller viewed\npetitioner’s childhood surroundings as unimpressive because\nhe found them comparable to his own.” Id. at 673. Andrews\n“did not suffer a home environment that would place his\ncrimes in any understandable context or explain his resorting\nto crime every time he was released or escaped from prison.”\nId. at 670. Moreover, his stable conditions in California\ncould have led the jury to conclude that Andrews’s\n“abandonment of his own son to pursue a cocaine habit and\nhis former criminal ways would belie the suggestion he\nmerited sympathy due to his parents’ drinking and\nabandonment and his grandfather’s death.” Id. at 671.\n“Under these circumstances, counsel could reasonably reject\na background mitigation strategy in favor of an alternate basis\nto plead for petitioner’s life.” Id. at 673.\n\n    Second, the California Supreme Court found that counsel\ncould have reasonably decided not to develop evidence\nregarding the conditions of Andrews’s confinement. Id. at\n670–71.4 Relying in part on the referee’s findings, the\n\n\n  4\n     Relying on the opinion of the dissenting Justice in the California\nSupreme Court’s opinion in this case, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 681\n(Kennard, J., dissenting), the dissent claims that Andrews’s attorneys\nrendered ineffective assistance because they allegedly failed to ask\nAndrews any questions regarding his prison conditions. Dissent at\n100–101. But under AEDPA, we do not perform such a de novo review\nof a petitioner’s Strickland claim; rather, we ask only whether the state\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       27\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court noted that while the conditions in\nwhich Andrews had been incarcerated “leaves no doubt\npetitioner endured horrifically demeaning and degrading\ncircumstances,” counsel could reasonably conclude that\nintroducing evidence about these conditions from former\ninmates could have “proved a double-edged sword,” because\nthe jury could have had negative impressions of the witnesses\nand the evidence that would color their views of Andrews.\nId. The witnesses testifying to the conditions under which\nAndrews was incarcerated included “one death row inmate,\nwith serious felony records for murder, rape, and armed\nrobbery,” as well as many inmates who “had themselves\nengaged in brutality while in prison and escaped with some\nfrequency.” Id. at 671. The jury could have drawn an\n“unfavorable comparison” with Andrews in both cases, and\n“[r]ather than engendering sympathy, the evidence could well\nhave reinforced an impression of him as a person who had\nbecome desensitized and inured to violence and disrespect for\nthe law.” Id. Moreover, the witnesses’ “criminal histories\nwould automatically subject them to impeachment.” Id. The\ncourt also found that hearing such witnesses testify about\nbrutal conditions in Alabama would “raise the question of\nwhy petitioner so readily resorted to crime when he escaped\nthe brutal and predatory conditions in Alabama and relocated\nto California, where he found work and started a family.” Id.\nCounsel could also reasonably conclude that having inmates\ndescribe the Alabama prison conditions would “potentially\nopen the door to additional evidence of petitioner’s criminal\n\n\n\n\ncourt’s application of Strickland was objectively unreasonable.\nHarrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 101 (2011).\n\f28                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\npast.” Id. at 673.5 Among other things, “evidence of prison\nconditions could have led to the jury’s learning of petitioner’s\nsecond escape from custody,” which could have “created a\ndanger defense counsel reasonably sought to avoid.” Id. at\n669.6\n\n\n 5\n   The dissent erroneously argues that no reasonable counsel could have\ndecided to avoid the dangers of relying on prisoner testimony because “the\nMt. Meigs evidence was not dependent upon testimony from prisoners”\nbut rather could have been offered by the “experts and respected\nobservers” who testified at Andrews’s state court evidentiary hearing.\nDissent at 99–100, 102–103. In reaching this conclusion, the dissent\nsubstitutes its de novo finding for the findings of the California Supreme\nCourt, which held that “whatever mitigating evidence may have been\ndisclosed by pursuing the conditions of incarceration petitioner\nexperienced, counsel knew such evidence would come primarily from the\ntestimony of petitioner’s fellow prisoners, many of whom were hardened\ncriminals with serious felony records.” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 668–69.\nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2), a federal court “may not second-guess” a\nstate court’s factual findings unless the state court was “not merely wrong,\nbut actually unreasonable” in light of the record before it. Taylor v.\nMaddox, 366 F.3d 992, 999 (9th Cir. 2004). The dissent could not\nreasonably conclude that the California Supreme Court’s conclusion was\nobjectively unreasonable given that it is not clear that the “experts and\nrespected observers” who testified at the state court evidentiary hearing,\nwhich occurred almost a decade after Andrews’s sentencing hearing,\nwould have been available to testify at Andrews’s sentencing hearing in\n1984.\n 6\n   The dissent argues that the California Supreme Court was unreasonable\nin excusing counsel’s failure to discover Mt. Meigs evidence based on\nAndrews’s refusal to involve his family. Dissent at 99–100. This strained\nreading of the California Supreme Court’s broad statement about\nmitigating evidence is itself unreasonable. In fact, the California Supreme\nCourt never stated that there was a connection between family restrictions\nand prison conditions. Rather, the court concluded that Andrews’s\nrestrictions on his family’s involvement would have limited counsel’s\nability to develop Andrews’s background and childhood. In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 662 (noting that, if permitted, “[t]rial counsel could have\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              29\n\n    Third, the California Supreme Court found that counsel\ncould have reasonably decided not to introduce expert\ntestimony on Andrews’s mental health because “[t]he\nprosecutor could have exploited the testimony of the mental\nhealth experts to petitioner’s disadvantage.” Id. at 670. The\ncourt noted that one of the experts at the reference hearing\ntestified “that convicts tend to react with rage to perceived\ninsults, behavior they find difficult to shed even when\ndischarged,” and while this may have explained Andrews’s\nactions, “it does not necessarily create a sympathetic\nimpression” because “[t]he jury could just as readily infer\npetitioner was unable to control lethal impulses on the\nslightest provocation.” Id. Moreover, there would have been\na battle of the experts regarding whether Andrews had\nsuffered any brain damage at all. Id. And “[a]s the reference\nhearing demonstrated, a mental health penalty defense would\nalso have given the prosecution several opportunities to\nrepeat the circumstances of the crime as well as petitioner’s\npast criminality in questioning the experts on both direct and\ncross-examination as to whether petitioner exhibited an\nantisocial personality rather than some form of mental\nimpairment.” Id.\n\n   Finally, the California Supreme Court concluded that\ncounsel had been reasonable in adopting the strategic\n\n\ncontacted petitioner’s family to develop his background and childhood”).\nOn the other hand, the California Supreme Court concluded that\n“[e]vidence relating to the impact of the juvenile and adult correctional\nsystems could have been developed by obtaining prison records and\ncontacting inmates referenced in those records as well as conducting\nstandard legal research of public records relating to lawsuits involving\nthese institutions,” id. (emphasis added), and the main constraint on using\nthis evidence was “the inherent problems of calling prisoners as\nwitnesses,” id. at 664.\n\f30                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\napproach of minimizing Andrews’s “culpability by\ncircumscribing his background and mitigating his criminal\nresponsibility.” Id. at 669. In implementing this strategy,\ncounsel portrayed Andrews as “a follower rather than\nviolently antisocial” and “urged the jury to consider in\nmitigation the fact that others who had committed more\nheinous multiple murders had been sentenced to life without\npossibility of parole and that [Andrews’s co-defendant]\nreceived a comparatively lighter sentence.” Id.7 According\nto the California Supreme Court, this approach “not only\npresented a reasonable case for sparing petitioner’s life under\nthe circumstances, but foreclosed the introduction of\nsubstantial aggravating evidence in rebuttal or on cross-\nexamination that could have undermined the defense by\ndepicting petitioner as aggressive and desensitized to\nviolence.” Id. (citation omitted).8\n\n\n 7\n    The dissent criticizes the California Supreme Court for concluding that\nAndrews’s counsel adopted a reasonable strategy by, among other things,\nportraying Andrews as a follower who was less culpable than others.\nRelying again on the dissenting California Supreme Court Justice, the\ndissent claims that “the only evidence before the jury was that petitioner\nwas the instigator rather than a follower.” Dissent at 104 (quoting In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 682 (Kennard, J., dissenting)). Once again, the\ndissent’s de novo fact finding is contrary to the California Supreme\nCourt’s reasonable conclusion based on evidence that the jury had before\nit a stipulation regarding Andrews’s role in the 1966 grocery store robbery\nwhich portrayed Andrews as a follower. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 659.\n 8\n   Andrews and the dissent argue that the prosecutor would not have put\non additional rebuttal evidence. Dissent at 107, 115. But the California\nSupreme Court rejected this argument, finding that the presentation of\nmitigating evidence would have prompted the prosecutor to shift the focus\nof his penalty phase case, put on additional witnesses, and use cross-\nexamination and closing argument to further damage Andrews’s\nmitigation case. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 665–66. Contrary to the\ndissent, Dissent at 108 n.5, federal courts must defer to the state court’s\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                                31\n\n    Given these valid reasons for not pursuing Andrews’s\nbackground, and the fact that “a lengthy presentation of a\nbroad range of witnesses describing in detail various aspects\nof petitioner’s background” would “have been atypical for a\npenalty phase defense” at the time of the trial, id., the court\nconcluded that “counsel’s strategic decision to limit the scope\nof their investigation of mitigating background evidence and\nnot to present such evidence at the penalty phase came within\n‘the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,’” id. at\n671 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689).\n\n                                     3\n\n   The California Supreme Court next confirmed that this\nconclusion was consistent with then clearly established\n\n\nfactual findings, see, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e) (“In a proceeding instituted\nby an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody\npursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual\nissue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.”). The\nCalifornia Supreme Court noted that it was “clear from the record that\nmuch damaging testimony regarding petitioner’s own violent conduct in\nprison and other circumstances desensitizing inmates to violence could\nhave, and undoubtedly would have, been elicited on cross-examination.”\nId. at 666. Among other evidence, the testimony of the taxi driver in the\n1968 robbery would have rebutted witnesses who characterized petitioner\nas a follower by “demonstrat[ing] petitioner could and did take the\ninitiative for violence” and the police officer’s testimony in the 1977\nlaundry robbery would have shown “petitioner’s lack of reluctance to use\nviolence to obtain his ends.” Id. The court therefore concluded that\n“substantial evidence supports the referee’s finding that presenting the\nmitigating evidence would have opened the door to damaging rebuttal.”\nId. In repeating Andrews’s claim that the prosecutor from Andrews’s trial\nwould not have introduced rebuttal witnesses had the defense presented\nevidence of Andrews’s prison conditions, Dissent at 107, 115, the dissent\nerrs by conducting its own de novo review and failing to defer to the state\ncourt’s factual findings under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2) and (e).\n\f32                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nSupreme Court precedent, Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685 (2002),\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000), and Burger v. Kemp,\n483 U.S. 776 (1987). The court provided the following\nreasoning. In Burger, the Supreme Court held that counsel\nwas not deficient even though he declined to present evidence\nof the defendant’s neglectful, violent family or his mental and\nemotional deficiencies, because: (1) introducing such\nbackground evidence raised a risk that aggravating\ninformation would be introduced, and (2) counsel had\nadopted the reasonable strategy of minimizing his client’s\nculpability in light of the co-defendant’s dominance. Id. at\n672–73 (citing Burger, 483 U.S. at 791–94). The California\nSupreme Court determined that Andrews’s counsel had even\nmore compelling justifications for not introducing\nbackground evidence than Burger’s counsel, given that\nBurger endured a worse childhood than Andrews, was a\nteenager at the time of the murder, had committed only one\nmurder, and was not primarily responsible for the decision to\nkill. Id. at 673.\n\n    Next, the California Supreme Court turned to Bell v.\nCone, 535 U.S. 685 (2002). In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 673.\nIn Bell, counsel provided no penalty phase evidence at all and\nwaived closing argument. Id. (citing Bell, 535 U.S. at 685).\nThe Supreme Court concluded that counsel’s strategy was\nreasonable, because evidence of defendant’s normal\nchildhood might have been perceived negatively by the jury,\nand because counsel’s decision to waive closing argument\nprevented the lead prosecutor from depicting the defendant as\na heartless killer. Id. (citing Bell, 535 U.S. at 699–702). The\nCalifornia Supreme Court noted that the counsel’s strategy in\nBell was similar to the strategy of Andrews’s counsel: by\nproviding little background information and giving only a\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             33\n\nbrief closing argument, counsel could reduce damaging\nrebuttal evidence. Id. at 673–74.\n\n     Finally, the California Supreme Court considered\nWilliams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362 (2000), which held that\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing\nto investigate defendant’s nightmarish childhood, borderline\nmental retardation, and model behavior in prison. Id. at 674\n(citing Williams, 529 U.S. at 395–96). The California\nSupreme Court distinguished this case, noting that counsel’s\nfailure in Williams to investigate was not based on strategy,\nas in Andrews’s case, but due to counsel’s erroneous\nunderstanding of the law. Id. The state court also noted that\nin Williams, there was no tactical reason to withhold evidence\nand there was virtually no risk of damaging rebuttal, as in this\ncase. Id. at 674–75.\n\n     The California Supreme Court therefore concluded that\nthen-existing Supreme Court precedent was consistent with\nits conclusion that Andrews had not established that “in light\nof all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions of\ncounsel were outside the wide range of professionally\ncompetent assistance.” Id. at 668 (internal quotation marks\nand alterations omitted).9\n\n 9\n   The dissent argues that the California Supreme Court erred in relying\non Burger, Bell, and Williams in concluding that Andrews’s counsel were\nnot deficient. Dissent at 104–106, 110–111. This criticism is meritless,\nhowever, because it is based on de novo review rather than the deference\nrequired under AEDPA. For example, in concluding that “[t]he California\nSupreme Court’s reliance on Burger is unreasonable,” Dissent at 104–105,\nthe dissent takes a de novo approach that is not permitted under AEDPA,\nwhere a court must consider whether “fairminded jurists could disagree\nthat the state court’s decision conflicts with [the Supreme] Court’s\nprecedents,” Richter, 562 U.S. at 102. Similarly, instead of determining\nwhether any fairminded jurist could conclude there is a “principled\n\f34                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n                                   4\n\n    The California Supreme Court next turned to the\nprejudice prong. As explained in greater detail below, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court determined, based on its review of\nthe evidence adduced at the reference hearing and the rebuttal\nevidence that could have been introduced during the penalty\nphase, that “it is not ‘reasonabl[y] proba[ble]’ petitioner was\nprejudiced by counsel’s rejection of a defense premised on\nevidence of petitioner’s upbringing, the Alabama prison\nconditions he experienced, and his mental health in light of\nthe circumstances of the crimes, given the ambiguous nature\nof some mitigating evidence and the substantial potential for\ndamaging rebuttal.” Id. at 671 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 694).\n\n    “Having considered the record of the hearing, the\nreferee’s factual findings, and petitioner’s original trial,” the\nCalifornia Supreme Court concluded that Andrews “received\nconstitutionally adequate representation, and any inadequacy\ndid not result in prejudice.” Id. at 659. Accordingly, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court denied Andrews’s state habeas\npetition. Id. at 676.\n\n\n\n\ndistinction,” Murdoch v. Castro, 609 F.3d 983, 991 (9th Cir. 2010) (en\nbanc), between this case and Williams, the dissent misrepresents the\nCalifornia Supreme Court as holding that “a virtually nonexistent penalty\nphase investigation is reasonable so long as it is not based upon a\nmisunderstanding of the law,” and then rejects this absurd reading of\nWilliams. Dissent at 110–111. “[I]t is not apparent how the [dissent’s]\nanalysis would have been any different without AEDPA.” Richter,\n562 U.S. at 101 (faulting the Ninth Circuit’s de novo approach to habeas\nreview).\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                         35\n\n                               5\n\n    After the California Supreme Court rejected Andrews’s\nclaims, Andrews filed a habeas petition in federal district\ncourt. His amended petition raised 32 claims, including\nmultiple subclaims.\n\n    In a lengthy ruling on the merits of the petition, the\ndistrict court denied 31 claims, but granted relief on\nAndrews’s claim that his counsel were ineffective at the\npenalty phase of his trial for failing to investigate and present\nadditional mitigating evidence. In reaching this conclusion,\nthe district court did not apply the standard mandated by the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).\nInstead of determining whether the California Supreme\nCourt’s rejection of this ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of” Strickland, as required by 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(1), the district court reviewed the evidence\nproduced by the referee on this issue de novo and concluded\nthat counsel’s “failure to adequately investigate and discover\nevidence of a life filled with abuse and privation is sufficient\nto establish prejudice under Strickland.” Cf. Richter,\n562 U.S. at 101 (criticizing the Ninth Circuit’s review of a\nstate court opinion under § 2254(d)(1) because it failed to\ngive the deference due under AEDPA). The court granted\nAndrews’s petition on this ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim, denied Andrews’s other 31 claims, and granted a\ncertificate of appealability (COA) on Andrews’s claim that\nCalifornia’s lethal injection protocol violates the Eighth\nAmendment (Claim 25).\n\n   Andrews timely appealed, challenging the district court’s\ndenials of Claim 25 and several uncertified claims. The state\n\f36                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ncross-appealed the district court’s grant of relief on\nAndrews’s ineffective assistance of counsel claim. After\nbriefing on his appeal was complete, Andrews moved for\npermission to brief an additional uncertified claim for habeas\nrelief on the ground that it would violate the Eighth\nAmendment to execute him after a long delay from the date\nof his sentencing. We granted the motion.\n\n                                    II\n\n    We review a district court’s grant or denial of habeas\nrelief de novo. Moses v. Payne, 555 F.3d 742, 750 (9th Cir.\n2009).\n\n                                    A\n\n    AEDPA applies to Andrews’s federal habeas petition,\nwhich was filed after April 24, 1996. See Lindh v. Murphy,\n521 U.S. 320, 322, 336 (1997). Under AEDPA, a court may\nnot grant a habeas petition “with respect to any claim that was\nadjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings,”\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d), unless the state court’s judgment\n“resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\nas determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,”\n§ 2254(d)(1), or “was based on an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented\nin the State court proceeding,” § 2254(d)(2).10\n\n\n  10\n    Neither party disputes that the claims in this case were “adjudicated\non the merits” by the California Supreme Court, and that its decision\nconstitutes the “last reasoned decision” of the state court with respect to\nthose claims. See Cheney v. Washington, 614 F.3d 987, 993, 995 (9th Cir.\n2010).\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                         37\n\n    Under § 2254(d)(1), the relevant Supreme Court\nprecedent includes only the decisions in existence “as of the\ntime the state court renders its decision.” Greene v. Fisher,\n132 S. Ct. 38, 44 (2011) (internal quotation marks and\nemphasis omitted); see also Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S.\n170, 182 (2011) (“State-court decisions are measured against\n[the Supreme] Court’s precedents as of the time the state\ncourt renders its decision.” (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Thus, Supreme Court cases decided after the state\ncourt’s decision are not clearly established precedent under\n§ 2254(d)(1) for purposes of evaluating whether the state\ncourt reasonably applied Supreme Court precedent.\n\n    A Supreme Court decision is not clearly established law\nunder § 2254(d)(1) unless it “squarely addresses the issue” in\nthe case before the state court, Wright v. Van Patten, 552 U.S.\n120, 125–26 (2008) (per curiam), or “establish[es] a legal\nprinciple that ‘clearly extends’” to the case before the state\ncourt, Moses, 555 F.3d at 754 (alterations omitted) (quoting\nVan Patten, 552 U.S. at 123); see also Carey v. Musladin,\n549 U.S. 70, 76–77 (2006) (holding that Supreme Court cases\nevaluating state-sponsored courtroom conduct were not\nclearly established law governing private actor courtroom\nconduct). “[W]hen a state court may draw a principled\ndistinction between the case before it and Supreme Court\ncaselaw, the law is not clearly established for the state-court\ncase.” Murdoch, 609 F.3d at 991. “[I]f a habeas court must\nextend a rationale before it can apply to the facts at hand, then\nby definition the rationale was not clearly established at the\ntime of the state-court decision.” White v. Woodall, 134 S.\nCt. 1697, 1706 (2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). A\nprinciple is clearly established law governing the case “if, and\nonly if, it is so obvious that a clearly established rule applies\nto a given set of facts that there could be no fairminded\n\f38                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndisagreement on the question.” Id. at 1706–07 (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n    A state court decision is “contrary to” Supreme Court\nprecedent if “the state court applies a rule that contradicts the\ngoverning law set forth in [Supreme Court] cases.” Williams,\n529 U.S. at 405. An “unreasonable application” of Supreme\nCourt precedent is not one that is merely “incorrect or\nerroneous,” Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U.S. 63, 75 (2003); see\nalso Williams, 529 U.S. at 410; rather, “[t]he pivotal question\nis whether the state court’s application of the [relevant\nSupreme Court precedent] was unreasonable,” Richter,\n562 U.S. 86 at 101 (emphasis added). “Under § 2254(d), a\nhabeas court must determine what arguments or theories\nsupported” the state court’s decision, id. at 102, and if\n“‘fairminded jurists could disagree’ on the correctness of the\nstate court’s decision,” that decision is not unreasonable, id.\nat 101 (quoting Yarborough v. Alvarado, 541 U.S. 652, 664\n(2004)).\n\n    The Supreme Court has made clear that § 2254(d) sets\nforth a “highly deferential standard . . . , which demands that\nstate-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.”\nPinholster, 563 U.S. at 181 (internal quotation marks\nomitted). “As amended by AEDPA, § 2254(d) stops short of\nimposing a complete bar on federal-court relitigation of\nclaims already rejected in state proceedings,” but only\n“preserves authority to issue the writ in cases where there is\nno possibility fairminded jurists could disagree that the state\ncourt’s decision conflicts with this Court’s precedents” and\n“goes no further.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 102. “[E]ven a strong\ncase for relief does not mean the state court’s contrary\nconclusion was unreasonable.” Id. In a nutshell, “[i]f this\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        39\n\nstandard is difficult to meet, that is because it was meant to\nbe.” Id. at 102.\n\n                               B\n\n    The clearly established federal law for ineffective\nassistance of counsel claims, as determined by the Supreme\nCourt, is Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), and\nits progeny. See Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 189. Strickland\nconcluded that, under the Sixth Amendment, the accused has\nthe right to the effective assistance of counsel at trial and\nduring capital sentencing proceedings. 466 U.S. at 684–87.\nA petitioner claiming ineffective assistance of counsel must\nprove: (1) that “counsel’s performance was deficient,” and\n(2) that “the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.”\nId. at 687.\n\n    In determining whether a state court’s adjudication of an\nineffective assistance of counsel claim was an unreasonable\napplication of Supreme Court precedent, we may consider\nhow the Supreme Court itself has applied Strickland to other\nfactual contexts, but this is merely “illustrative of the proper\napplication of [Strickland’s] standards.” See Wiggins v.\nSmith, 539 U.S. 510, 522 (2003); see also Pinholster,\n563 U.S. at 196 n.17; Brian R. Means, Federal Habeas\nManual § 3:29 (2014). The Supreme Court has warned us not\nto derive “strict rules” from its cases applying Strickland de\nnovo because “the Strickland test ‘of necessity requires a\ncase-by-case examination of the evidence.’” Pinholster,\n563 U.S. at 196 & n.17 (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 391).\nFurther, Supreme Court cases decided on de novo review\n“offer no guidance with respect to whether a state court has\nunreasonably determined that prejudice is lacking” or defense\ncounsel was deficient, and so are not directly applicable to a\n\f40                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nfederal court’s review under § 2254(d)(1) of a habeas\npetitioner’s claim that a state court unreasonably applied\nStrickland. Id. at 202. Indeed, a state court’s application of\nStrickland may be objectively reasonable based on clearly\nestablished Supreme Court precedent at the time of its\ndecision even if the Supreme Court’s subsequent applications\nof Strickland suggest a different result. By contrast, when the\nSupreme Court addresses the AEDPA question whether a\nstate court’s adjudication of an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim was an unreasonable application of Strickland,\nits reasoning may guide a federal court’s AEDPA analysis\nwhen the facts of the Supreme Court case (including the\nprevailing professional norms at the time of the defendant’s\ntrial) are analogous to the case before the court.\n\n    Under Strickland, deficient performance is performance\nthat falls “below an objective standard of reasonableness” and\nis thus outside of “the range of competence demanded of\nattorneys in criminal cases.” 466 U.S. at 687–88 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The objective measure of\ncounsel’s performance is “reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms.” Id. at 688. Therefore, counsel’s\nperformance is deficient only if it falls below the standard of\nthen prevailing professional norms at the time of the trial. Id.\nIn Pinholster, for instance, the Supreme Court rejected the\ndissent’s argument that counsel’s performance was defective\nwhere the dissent provided no evidence that counsel’s chosen\nmitigation strategy was “inconsistent with the standard of\nprofessional competence in capital cases that prevailed in Los\nAngeles in 1984.” 563 U.S. at 196; see also Bobby v. Van\nHook, 558 U.S. 4, 8 (2009) (per curiam) (holding that the\nSixth Circuit had improperly relied on the much more\ndetailed 2003 ABA Guidelines “announced 18 years after\nVan Hook went to trial”). Therefore, a court may not\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        41\n\nevaluate whether counsel’s performance fell below prevailing\nprofessional conduct at the time of a defendant’s trial by\nreference to Supreme Court opinions that rely on later-\ndeveloped professional norms.\n\n    The Supreme Court has also provided guidance for\napplying Strickland to determine whether counsel’s “deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defense,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n687, at the penalty phase of a capital case. Illustrative\nSupreme Court precedent indicates that a court generally\nproceeds through three steps: (1) evaluating and weighing the\ntotality of the available mitigation evidence, see Williams,\n529 U.S. at 397–98; Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 197–202;\n(2) evaluating and weighing the aggravating evidence and any\nrebuttal evidence that could have been adduced by the\ngovernment had the mitigating evidence been introduced,\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 397–98; Pinholster, 563 U.S. at\n197–202, and (3) reweighing the evidence in aggravation\nagainst the totality of available mitigating evidence, see Sears\nv. Upton, 561 U.S. 945, 955–56 (2010) (per curiam);\nWiggins, 539 U.S. at 534; Williams, 529 U.S. at 397–98, to\ndetermine “whether there is a reasonable probability that,\nabsent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that\nthe balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did\nnot warrant death,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695. We explain\nthe Supreme Court’s guidance on each of these steps.\n\n                               1\n\n    The first step in determining whether counsel’s deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defendant at the penalty phase is\nevaluating “the totality of the available mitigation evidence.”\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 397–98. The evidence to be evaluated\nincludes both evidence that was actually presented at\n\f42                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nsentencing and evidence that a competent attorney would\nhave introduced. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534–35. A court\nmay assume that a competent attorney would have considered\npresenting all of the evidence adduced in post-conviction\nproceedings. See Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U.S. 15, 20 (2009)\n(per curiam).\n\n    Mitigation evidence is a broad category, as a jury must be\npermitted to consider all relevant mitigating factors. Lockett\nv. Ohio, 438 U.S. 586, 608 (1978) (plurality opinion);\nEddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 110–12 (1982). The\nSupreme Court has identified several non-exclusive\ncategories of mitigation evidence, focusing primarily on\nevidence that aids the jury’s evaluation of a defendant’s\nmoral culpability. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535. For\ninstance, evidence of a defendant’s disadvantaged\nbackground may lead a jury to conclude the defendant is “less\nculpable than defendants who have no such excuse.” Penry\nv. Lynaugh, 492 U.S. 302, 319 (1989) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted), abrogated on other grounds by Atkins v.\nVirginia, 536 U.S. 304 (2002). Thus, evidence that a\ndefendant had a childhood “filled with abuse and privation,”\nincluding being raised by parents who were eventually\nimprisoned for criminal child neglect, could influence a jury’s\nappraisal of the defendant’s moral culpability. Williams,\n529 U.S at 395, 398; see also Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535\n(mitigating evidence included evidence that the defendant\nsuffered severe privation and abuse as a child, had an\nalcoholic and absent mother, was physically and sexually\nabused in foster care, and was homeless for a brief period);\nRompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 391–93 (2005) (mitigating\nevidence included evidence that the defendant was raised in\na slum by severely abusive, alcoholic parents, who did not\nprovide for him and isolated him).\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        43\n\n    Similarly, evidence of a defendant’s mental or emotional\ndifficulties may lead a jury to conclude that a defendant is\nless culpable than defendants without such difficulties.\nPenry, 492 U.S. at 319. For instance, evidence that a\ndefendant is “borderline mentally retarded,” Williams,\n529 U.S. at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted), or has\nsevere PTSD from military combat, see Porter v. McCollum,\n558 U.S. 30, 35–36 & n.4, 43–44 (2009), or has severe\nlearning and behavioral disabilities, frontal lobe injuries, and\nbrain damage from drug and alcohol abuse, see Sears,\n561 U.S. at 948–49, is potentially mitigating.\n\n    Evidence of conduct or behavior demonstrating the\ndefendant’s good character may also be mitigating. In\nWilliams, the Court gave weight to evidence that the\ndefendant had turned himself in, alerted police to a previously\nundetected crime, expressed remorse, cooperated with police,\nand behaved well in prison. 529 U.S. at 369, 396, 398. In\nBelmontes, the Court noted mitigation evidence that the\ndefendant had maintained strong relationships with family\nmembers in spite of his terrible childhood, and that while in\nprison, he assisted others through a prison religious program\nand rose to second in command in a fire crew. 558 U.S. at\n21.\n\n    After identifying the evidence that the petitioner claims to\nbe mitigating, a court must weigh its strength by assessing its\nlikely impact on a jury. This weighing process includes\nevaluating whether the evidence’s impact on the jury might\nbe aggravating rather than mitigating. See Pinholster,\n563 U.S. at 201–02. The Supreme Court has indicated that\ncourts can consider the fact that mitigation “may be in the eye\nof the beholder,” and juries may find that some evidence\noffered as mitigation cuts the other way. Burger, 483 U.S. at\n\f44                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n794 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). In\nBurger, the Court noted that “[o]n one hand, a jury could\nreact with sympathy over the tragic childhood” of the\ndefendant, while on the other hand, the same testimony could\nestablish the defendant’s “unpredictable propensity for\nviolence” that resulted in murder. Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Similarly, evidence of mental and emotional\nproblems might suggest an increased likelihood that a\ndefendant would be dangerous in the future. See Pinholster,\n563 U.S. at 201 (noting that evidence of the defendant’s\nfamily background, his substance abuse, and his mental\nhealth issues, was “by no means clearly mitigating, as the jury\nmight have concluded that [the defendant] was simply beyond\nrehabilitation”). The Court has also observed that evidence\nof the defendant’s normal youth might, in the jury’s eyes,\nestablish greater moral culpability on the part of the\ndefendant. See Bell, 535 U.S. at 701–02.\n\n                              2\n\n    The second step in determining whether counsel’s\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant at the penalty\nphase is evaluating the weight of the aggravating evidence\nand any rebuttal evidence that the government could have\nadduced had the mitigating evidence been introduced. See\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 397–98; Pinholster, 563 U.S. at\n197–202. Aggravating evidence may include evidence\nrelating to the circumstances of the crime. Thus, in\nStrickland, the Court found the aggravating evidence to be\n“overwhelming” where the defendant had repeatedly stabbed\nthe three murder victims during a robbery. 466 U.S. at 674,\n700. Similarly, where the record showed that the defendant\nhad bludgeoned a woman to death with 15 to 20 blows of a\nsteel dumbbell bar to steal goods worth $100, the Supreme\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       45\n\nCourt agreed with the state court that the aggravating\nevidence was “simply overwhelming” and determined that\ncounsel’s failure to introduce certain mitigating evidence was\nnot prejudicial. Belmontes, 558 U.S. at 15–16, 26–27\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In Van Hook, the\nSupreme Court gave weight to evidence that the murder was\ncommitted in the course of a scheme to rob homosexual men\nby luring them into secluded settings. 558 U.S. at 12–13. In\ndoing so, the Court clarified that the weight, not the number,\nof the aggravating factors was important. Id.\n\n    Evidence about a defendant’s prior criminal history is also\naggravating and can be introduced in rebuttal, and a severe\ncriminal history carries great weight. See Woodford v.\nVisciotti, 537 U.S. 19, 26–27 (2002) (criminal history that\nincluded “the knifing of one man, and the stabbing of a\npregnant woman as she lay in bed trying to protect her unborn\nbaby,” combined with the circumstances of the crime, was\n“overwhelming” and “devastating” aggravating evidence);\naccord Bell, 535 U.S. at 700 & n.5 (defense counsel\nreasonably feared the prosecution would elicit information\nabout defendant’s criminal history, which included robberies,\nin rebuttal); Burger, 483 U.S. at 793 (defense counsel\nreasonably feared the prosecution would introduce the\ndefendant’s juvenile criminal history in rebuttal, when he had\na clean adult record). Evidence that a defendant had\npreviously committed another murder may be “the most\npowerful imaginable aggravating evidence.” Belmontes,\n558 U.S. at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    Rebuttal evidence may also directly undermine the value\nof the mitigation evidence. For example, the Supreme Court\nnoted in Pinholster that it would be “of questionable\nmitigating value” for defense counsel to introduce expert\n\f46                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ntestimony diagnosing a defendant with bipolar mood disorder\nand seizure disorders, because such evidence would invite\nrebuttal by a state expert, who could reject the diagnosis of\nbipolar disorder and offer a different diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder. Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 177, 201.\n\n                              3\n\n    The third step in determining whether counsel’s deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defendant at the penalty phase is\nto “reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of\navailable mitigating evidence,” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534, in\norder to determine “whether there is a reasonable probability\nthat, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have\nconcluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n695. A “reasonable probability” is a level of probability that\n“undermine[s] confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694.\nHowever, counsel’s deficient performance is not prejudicial\nmerely because the court cannot “rule out” the possibility that\nthe sentencer would have imposed a sentence of life in prison\ninstead of the death penalty. Belmontes, 558 U.S. at 20, 27\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Richter, 562 U.S.\nat 111 (“In assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question\nis not whether a court can be certain counsel’s performance\nhad no effect on the outcome . . . .”). Rather, “[t]he\nlikelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just\nconceivable.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 112 (citing Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 693). Thus, “the difference between Strickland’s\nprejudice standard and a more-probable-than-not standard is\nslight and matters ‘only in the rarest case.’” Id. (quoting\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 697).\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       47\n\n    The Court has found a reasonable probability of a\ndifferent outcome when scant and weak aggravating evidence\ncould have been presented in rebuttal to strongly mitigating\nevidence. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534–36, 537–38 (holding\nthat there was a reasonable probability that the jury would\nhave reached a different result at sentencing had it heard\npowerful mitigating evidence regarding the defendant’s\nchildhood background, when the state could have presented\nonly weak rebuttal evidence). By contrast, the Court has\nfound no prejudice when the aggravating evidence is\noverwhelming, even though the mitigating evidence is strong.\nSee Visciotti, 537 U.S. at 26–27 (holding that there was no\nreasonable probability of a different result when the\nmitigating evidence, including the defendant’s “troubled\nfamily background” and possible seizure disorder, did not\noutweigh the “overwhelming” aggravating factors, including\nthe circumstances of the crime and potential rebuttal evidence\nof prior offenses).\n\n    In reweighing aggravating and mitigating evidence, the\nCourt has also examined whether mitigating evidence would\nbe merely cumulative or would have significantly altered the\ninformation provided to the sentencer. See Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 699–700; Porter, 558 U.S. at 41–42. In\nStrickland, the new information “would barely have altered”\nthe picture presented at sentencing, and the Court found no\nprejudice. 466 U.S. at 699–700. Similarly, in Belmontes, the\nCourt concluded that merely cumulative evidence regarding\na petitioner’s difficult childhood, and expert testimony\nregarding a petitioner’s mental state “seeking to explain his\nbehavior, or putting it in some favorable context” would be\nunlikely to outweigh the facts of a brutal murder, and would\nbe even less likely to outweigh evidence that the defendant\nhad committed a prior murder. 558 U.S. at 22–24, 27–28.\n\f48                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that any failure of counsel\nto present additional mitigating evidence was not prejudicial.\nId. at 27.\n\n    These Supreme Court opinions illustrate that under\nStrickland’s prejudice prong, cumulative mitigating evidence\ndoes not support a conclusion that there would be a\nreasonable probability of a different outcome. New\nmitigating evidence can support such a conclusion only if it\nis sufficiently strong, and the known or additional\naggravating evidence is not overwhelming.\n\n                              C\n\n     In light of this guidance, we now evaluate the California\nSupreme Court’s rejection of Andrews’s claim that he was\nprejudiced by his counsel’s failure to investigate and present\nadditional mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of his\ntrial. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697 (“[A] court need not\ndetermine whether counsel’s performance was deficient\nbefore examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as\na result of the alleged deficiencies.”). We must determine\nwhether this decision was “contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of,” Strickland or other Supreme\nCourt precedent in existence at the time of its opinion.\n§ 2254(d)(1); see Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 182–83.\n\n    In considering whether any deficiency by Andrews’s\ncounsel was prejudicial, the California Supreme Court\ncorrectly followed Strickland in asking whether, even if\ncounsel were deficient, Andrews’s defense was not\nprejudiced by any such deficiency because a different result\nwas not reasonably probable. See In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at\n671 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). The California\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              49\n\nSupreme Court then reasonably carried out the three steps\nindicated by Supreme Court opinions for evaluating prejudice\nunder Strickland at the penalty phase.11\n\n                                    1\n\n    The court first considered the totality of the mitigating\nevidence presented at trial, as well as what mitigating\nevidence could have been presented by a competent attorney,\nbased on the six-year review and report by the referee. See\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 397–98. The court reviewed all of the\nmitigating evidence that Andrews presented, including\nAndrews’s family background, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 660,\n670, incarceration in Mt. Meigs and in Alabama prisons,12 id.\n\n 11\n    Andrews argues that the California Supreme Court failed to apply the\ncorrect legal standard for determining whether counsel provided deficient\nperformance at the penalty phase. Specifically, Andrews argues that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court failed to follow Tennard v. Dretke and Smith v.\nTexas, which hold that evidence can be mitigating even if it is not\n“uniquely severe” or does not have a “nexus” to the crime. 542 U.S. 274,\n287 (2004); 543 U.S. 37, 44–45 (2004). This argument misconstrues the\nCalifornia Supreme Court opinion. In determining that counsel could\nhave made a strategic decision not to present tangential evidence that\ncould cut both ways, the court expressly considered the purportedly\nmitigating evidence. On its face, such an approach is not equivalent to\nholding that certain evidence is per se not mitigating and declining to\nconsider it. Cf. Eddings, 455 U.S. at 114–15 (“The sentencer . . . may\ndetermine the weight to be given relevant mitigating evidence. But\n[courts] may not give it no weight by excluding such evidence from their\nconsideration.”).\n 12\n    Andrews’s claim that the state court failed to consider his experiences\nat Mt. Meigs, is not supported by the record. The state court detailed\nAndrews’s experiences at Mt. Meigs when discussing mitigating evidence\nthat could have been presented, noting that “[a]t Mt. Meigs, [Andrews]\nencountered appalling conditions” and detailing the referee’s findings that\nAndrews “was subjected to beatings, brutality, inadequate conditions and\n\f50                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nat 660–61, 670–71, and mental health evidence, id. at 661–62,\n670, observing that the similar types of mitigating evidence\nhave been considered in Supreme Court precedent, id. at\n672–75; see Penry, 492 U.S. at 319; Williams, 529 U.S. at\n395–98.\n\n    The California Supreme Court then evaluated the strength\nof this mitigating evidence by considering, among other\nthings, whether it might be viewed by a jury as aggravating.\nSee Burger, 483 U.S. at 793; Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 201–02.\nThe court reasonably concluded that much of the evidence\nidentified as mitigating “was not conclusively and\nunambiguously mitigating,” and it evaluated the possibility\nthat the evidence could be rebutted or used to Andrews’s\ndisadvantage, or that cross examination might “deflate the\nmitigating impact” of the evidence. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d\nat 670 & n.9. The court reasonably observed that a jury could\nhave determined that Andrews’s family background did not\nreduce his moral culpability, given that Andrews was raised\nin a non-abusive, stable family situation. Id. at 670; cf. Bell,\n535 U.S. at 701–02 (suggesting that evidence of a normal\nyouth might “cut the other way”). The court reasonably\nconcluded that “[Andrews] did not suffer a home\nenvironment that would place his crimes in any\nunderstandable context or explain his resorting to crime every\n\n\nsexual predators,” that “[h]is passiveness and small physique caused him\nto be a target of older, tougher boys, from whom no protection or\nseparation was provided,” and that “Mt. Meigs failed to provide any\nmeaningful rehabilitative or educational opportunities.” In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 660–61 (internal quotation marks omitted). The state court also\nnoted that expert testimony would have addressed his drug use at Mt.\nMeigs. Id. at 661. Moreover, the state court’s use of the term “prison\nconditions” in its opinion is consistent with its use in the referee’s report,\nwhere the term referred to conditions both in prison and Mt. Meigs.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              51\n\ntime he was released or escaped from prison.” In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 670.\n\n    In addition, the California Supreme Court reasonably\ndetermined that the evidence regarding the prison conditions\nwas double-edged. On the one hand, the prison conditions\nevidence left it in “no doubt [that Andrews] endured\nhorrifically demeaning and degrading circumstances.” Id.\nOn the other hand, the evidence would be presented primarily\nthrough the testimony of Andrews’s former fellow inmates,\nwho had serious criminal records that could “draw[] an\nunfavorable comparison” with Andrews. Id. at 671. “Many\nhad themselves engaged in brutality while in prison and\nescaped with some frequency,” also similar to Andrews. Id.\nMoreover, no matter how the prison conditions evidence was\npresented, “[r]ather than engendering sympathy, the evidence\ncould well have reinforced an impression of him as a person\nwho had become desensitized and inured to violence and\ndisrespect for the law.”13 Id.; cf. Pinholster, 563 U.S. at\n201–02.\n\n    The dissent claims that the California Supreme Court was\nunreasonable in concluding that the Mt. Meigs evidence\ncould have constituted a double-edged sword because “[t]he\njury already knew from Andrews’s heinous crimes of\nconviction and from the stipulated prior convictions that\nAndrews was antisocial and ‘had become desensitized and\ninured to violence and disrespect for the law.’” Dissent at\n\n    13\n       Andrews argues that the state court made an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts, see § 2254(d)(2), in holding that the prison\nconditions evidence could be aggravating. We reject this argument,\nbecause the state court’s conclusion is a reasonable application of the\nprejudice standard elaborated by Strickland and its progeny, not a factual\nfinding. Cf. Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 201–02.\n\f52                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n119–120. However, the dissent’s conclusion is factually\nincorrect. Because the stipulation presented to the jury did\nnot describe the facts of each of the offenses underlying\nAndrews’s prior convictions, the jury did not hear that\nAndrews held a woman hostage with a gun to her head when\nrobbing a laundry business or that the taxi driver in the 1968\nrobbery heard Andrews say “[l]et’s shoot him” and then fired\nat least two shots at him. See supra at 21–22. Accordingly,\nthe California Supreme Court did not err in concluding that\nevidence of prison conditions was double-edged.\n\n                               2\n\n     Consistent with Supreme Court precedent, the California\nSupreme Court not only assessed the weight of the mitigating\nevidence and its likely impact on a jury but also evaluated the\nweight of the aggravating evidence at trial, as well as any\nadditional rebuttal evidence that could have been introduced.\nSee Williams, 529 U.S. at 397–98; Belmontes, 558 U.S. at 20,\n24–28. Turning to the circumstances of Andrews’s crimes,\nthe California Supreme Court stated that the murders showed\na “callous disregard for human life.” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d\nat 671; cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 674, 700; Belmontes,\n558 U.S. at 15, 26–27. Andrews did not impulsively react to\na situation that got out of hand; rather, he interacted with the\nvictims in a calm and normal manner before torturing and\nkilling them. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 671. He also did\nmore than simply kill the victims. He raped and sodomized\nBrandon before murdering her, and he also murdered\nWheeler and Chism with “considerable violence and evident\nsangfroid.” Id. The state court also considered that, as\nrebuttal evidence, the prosecution could have presented the\ndetails of Andrews’s criminal history, cf. Bell, 535 U.S. at\n700 & n.5; Burger, 483 U.S. at 793, from which the jury\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              53\n\nmight conclude Andrews was “aggressive and desensitized to\nviolence,” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 669. The jury might also\nhave concluded that this “pattern of criminality” showed\nAndrews “would pose a danger to others if he were sentenced\nto life imprisonment.”14 Id. Also, the references to\nAndrews’s multiple escapes from prison might have been\n“inflammatory.” Id.\n\n    Finally, the California Supreme Court reasonably\nconcluded that the prosecution could have presented its own\nmental health experts in rebuttal, and could have used the\nmental health evidence to Andrews’s disadvantage on cross\nexamination. Id. at 670. The court noted the referee’s\nfindings that prosecution experts could have testified that\nAndrews had normal intelligence and did not suffer brain\n\n\n\n\n  14\n     Andrews argues that the state court’s conclusion that the evidence\ngave rise to the inference of future dangerousness was an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts. He argues that the prison stabbings, laundry\nrobbery, and conditioning to violence during his prison experiences do not\nsupport such an inference, pointing to mitigating facts found by the\nreferee, including that in some incidents, Andrews was defending himself\nagainst inmates who had been threatening him. We disagree. The state\ncourt considered these mitigating facts (such as evidence that in prison\nAndrews was “the prey rather than the predator” and acted in self\ndefense), see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 660–61, and reasonably concluded\nthat the evidence that Andrews was conditioned to violence during his\nprison experiences was an aggravating, not mitigating, circumstance, see\nBurger, 483 U.S. at 793 (noting that evidence of a petitioner’s troubled\nfamily background could also “suggest violent tendencies” that could\naffect the jury adversely). Because the state court reasonably concluded\nthat the jury could have found future dangerousness even had the\nmitigating evidence been introduced, the state court did not unreasonably\napply Supreme Court precedent in weighing how the evidence might\nimpact a jury.\n\f54                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndamage, but had antisocial personality traits.15 Id.; cf.\nPinholster, 563 U.S. at 173, 201. Nor was the state court\nunreasonable in concluding that Andrews’s experts’\ntestimony could backfire. For instance, the court noted that\nthe “compelling” testimony from one of Andrews’s expert\npsychiatric witnesses, opining that Andrews’s prison\nexperience caused him to react with rage to perceived insults,\ncould cause a jury to conclude that Andrews “was unable to\ncontrol lethal impulses on the slightest provocation.” In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 670; cf. Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 201–02.\nFinally, the presentation of the mental health evidence would\nhave given the prosecutor additional opportunities to repeat\nthe circumstances of these crimes as well as Andrews’s past\ncriminality. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670.\n\n                                    3\n\n    After evaluating the mitigating and aggravating evidence,\nthe California Supreme Court re-weighed it and assessed\nwhether it was reasonably probable that, in the absence of any\ndeficient performance by counsel, the sentencer “would have\nconcluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.” Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 695; see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 671–75. The state court\napplied the relevant Supreme Court precedent, and concluded\nthat Andrews was not “prejudiced by counsel’s rejection of\n\n\n  15\n     Andrews argues that the state court unreasonably applied Eddings,\n455 U.S. at 114–15, in concluding that a diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder is not mitigating. Eddings is not on point, because it\nmerely held that a court cannot prevent a jury from hearing such evidence.\nId. The state court did not unreasonably apply Eddings, or any other\nSupreme Court precedent, by observing that evidence that Andrews had\nantisocial personality disorder might make him less sympathetic to the\njury. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670–71.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             55\n\na defense premised on evidence of [Andrews]’s upbringing,\nthe Alabama prison conditions he experienced, and his mental\nhealth in light of the circumstances of the crimes, given the\nambiguous nature of some mitigating evidence and the\nsubstantial potential for damaging rebuttal.” In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 671. Indeed, the California Supreme Court\nconcluded that “[w]ith respect to the question of prejudice”\nthe record “contains no indication the jury was inclined to\nsentence petitioner to life imprisonment and might have been\npersuaded by additional or alternate mitigation evidence.” Id.\nat 675–76. Accordingly, the California Supreme Court\nreasonably concluded that even if counsel were deficient,\nAndrews’s defense was not prejudiced by any such\ndeficiency. Id. Because this is not an objectively\nunreasonable application of Strickland, the district court erred\nin granting Andrews relief on this issue.\n\n   Relying on the Supreme Court’s decisions in Williams\nand Porter, Andrews argues that the California Supreme\nCourt’s decision on the issue of prejudice was an\nunreasonable application of Strickland.16 We disagree.\n\n    In Williams, the police found a man dead in his residence.\n529 U.S. at 367. There was no indication of a struggle so\nlocal officials concluded that the cause of death was alcohol\npoisoning and closed the case. Id. The defendant, who had\nbeen arrested for an unrelated offense, wrote a letter to the\npolice confessing he had killed a man by striking him in the\nchest and back after an argument, thus “alerting police to a\n\n\n 16\n    While Andrews cites other Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit cases, his\nargument focuses primarily on Williams and Porter. Because other cases\ncited by Andrews are non-binding, not factually analogous, or both, we do\nnot address them here.\n\f56                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ncrime they otherwise would never have discovered,\nexpressing remorse for his actions, and cooperating with the\npolice after that.” Id. at 367–68 & n.1, 398.17\n\n    The defendant’s counsel began to prepare for the penalty\nphase only a week before trial, and even then counsel did not\nreview defendant’s juvenile and social services records\nbecause counsel incorrectly believed that state law barred\naccess to these records. Id. at 373, 395. Counsel thus failed\nto discover documents that “graphically describe[d]\n[defendant’s] nightmarish childhood.” Id. at 395. The\nevidence showed that defendant’s “parents had been\nimprisoned for the criminal neglect of [defendant] and his\nsiblings, that [defendant] had been severely and repeatedly\nbeaten by his father, that he had been committed to the\ncustody of the social services bureau for two years during his\nparents’ incarceration (including one stint in an abusive foster\nhome), and then, after his parents were released from prison,\nhad been returned to his parents’ custody.” Id. The records\n\n  17\n      The dissent relies on Justice Rehnquist’s concurring and dissenting\nopinion in Williams, which described additional aggravating factors\nbeyond the crime itself. See Dissent at 114–115 (stating that the jury\nheard evidence that “Williams savagely beat an elderly woman, stole two\ncars, set fire to a home, stabbed a man during a robbery, set fire to the city\njail, and confessed to having strong urges to choke other inmates and to\nbreak a fellow prisoner’s jaw”) (citing Williams, 529 U.S. at 418\n(Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). But under\nAEDPA, neither concurring nor dissenting opinions, nor circuit court\ndecisions (particularly one reversed by the Supreme Court, see Dissent at\n114–115), constitute clearly established Supreme Court precedent. See\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 412 (stating that only the Supreme Court’s\n“holdings, as opposed to the dicta” constitute clearly established Federal\nlaw); Glebe v. Frost, 135 S. Ct. 429, 431 (2014) (“As we have repeatedly\nemphasized, however, circuit precedent does not constitute ‘clearly\nestablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court.’” (quoting\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1))).\n\f                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS                           57\n\nrevealed that defendant’s home had urine and feces on the\nfloor; defendant’s parents “were so intoxicated, they could\nnot find any clothes for the children, nor were they able to put\nthe clothes on them”; “[t]he children were all dirty and none\nof them had on under-pants”; and in one instance “[t]he\nchildren had to be put in Winslow Hospital, as four of them,\nby that time, were definitely under the influence of whiskey.”\nId. at 395 n.19.\n\n    Nor did counsel introduce other mitigating evidence\nreadily apparent from the record, such as the fact that\ndefendant was “borderline mentally retarded.” Id. at 396.\nCounsel also failed to “seek prison records recording\n[defendant’s] commendations for helping to crack a prison\ndrug ring and for returning a guard’s missing wallet, or the\ntestimony of prison officials who described [defendant] as\namong the inmates ‘least likely to act in a violent, dangerous\nor provocative way.’” Id. In addition, counsel failed to\nreturn the phone call of a character witness who had offered\nto testify “that he had visited [defendant] frequently when\n[defendant] was incarcerated as part of a prison ministry\nprogram, that [defendant] ‘seemed to thrive in a more\nregimented and structured environment,’ and that [defendant]\nwas proud of the carpentry degree he earned while in prison.”\nId.\n\n     Finally, at sentencing,“[t]he weight of defense counsel’s\nclosing . . . was devoted to explaining that it was difficult to\nfind a reason why the jury should spare [defendant’s] life.”\nId. at 369; see also id. at 369 n.2 (quoting defense counsel as\ntelling the jury “‘I will admit too that it is very difficult to ask\nyou to show mercy to a man who maybe has not shown much\nmercy himself. I doubt very seriously that he thought much\nabout mercy when he was in [the victim’s] bedroom that\n\f58                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nnight with him. . . .

The Supreme Court held that the state\ncourt applied the wrong legal standard in determining\nprejudice because it required “a separate inquiry into\nfundamental fairness,” id. at 393, even when the petitioner\nshowed there was a reasonable probability of a different\noutcome, id. at 393–95. Therefore, the Court applied\nStrickland de novo to these facts, id. at 397–98; see also\nPinholster, 563 U.S. at 202.\n\n    The state court here discussed Williams at length and\nreasonably distinguished it as having “substantially dissimilar\nfacts.” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 675. In Williams, for\ninstance, the defense counsel could have introduced strong\ncharacter evidence regarding his exemplary conduct in prison,\n529 U.S. at 398, but no comparable evidence of good\ncharacter was present in Andrews’s case.18 The defendant’s\n“nightmarish childhood” in Williams, 529 U.S. at 395, was\nfar worse than Andrews’s relatively stable family\nbackground, see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 674. The\ndefendant in Williams was “borderline mentally retarded,”\n529 U.S. at 396, 398 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nwhile the prosecution could have presented evidence that\nAndrews was not mentally impaired, but rather had antisocial\npersonality traits, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670. Although\nthe prosecutor in Williams could have introduced rebuttal\nevidence that defendant had been “thrice committed to the\njuvenile system—for aiding and abetting larceny when he\nwas 11 years old, for pulling a false fire alarm when he was\n\n\n  18\n     Andrews points to evidence that he appeared to adjust well to the\nAlabama prison system when conditions permitted, but this observation\nis weaker than the evidence in Williams. See 529 U.S. at 396.\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              59\n\n12, and for breaking and entering when he was 15,” 529 U.S.\nat 396, such evidence has much less weight compared to\nAndrews’s robbery-murder, hostage taking, and history of\nescapes from prison, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 675. Finally,\nthe circumstances of the crime in Williams were less brutal\nthan Andrews’s rape and triple murder. Id.19 Because the\nfacts of Williams are dissimilar, the Supreme Court’s\ndetermination in Williams that counsel’s ineffective\nassistance was prejudicial does not make the state court’s\ncontrary conclusion here unreasonable. See Richter, 562 U.S.\nat 101–02; see also Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 202–03.\n\n    Andrews also argues that the California Supreme Court’s\ndecision was unreasonable in light of Porter. Although\nPorter was decided years after the California Supreme\nCourt’s opinion in this case, we give its prejudice analysis\ncareful consideration, because Porter considered prejudice\nunder AEDPA, and therefore provides direction for\ndetermining what constitutes an unreasonable application of\nthe prejudice prong of Strickland under AEDPA.\nNevertheless, we conclude that Porter does not help Andrews\nhere.\n\n\n 19\n    The dissent fails to engage with these distinctions and the evidence at\nissue. Instead, the dissent conducts a de novo review, and concludes that\nthe aggravating evidence admitted at trial and the evidence that could have\nbeen offered in rebuttal against Andrews was “no greater than the\naggravating evidence in Williams.” Dissent at 115. The dissent\nmisunderstands our role. We must determine whether the California\nSupreme Court’s application of Williams was objectively unreasonable\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), not whether we would have reached a\ndifferent result under de novo review. “In order for a state court’s\ndecision to be an unreasonable application of [the Supreme] Court’s case\nlaw, the ruling must be objectively unreasonable, not merely wrong; even\nclear error will not suffice.” Virginia v. LeBlanc, No. 16-1177, 2017 WL\n2507375, at *3 (U.S. June 12, 2017) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\f60                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n     In Porter, the defendant was convicted of two counts of\nfirst-degree murder for shooting his former girlfriend and her\nboyfriend. 558 U.S. at 31. The evidence suggested that “this\nwas a crime of passion” and “that [defendant] was drinking\nheavily just hours before the murders.” Id. at 38. The\ndefendant was convicted of both murders, and the jury\nrecommended the death sentence. Id. at 32. The state\nsupreme court affirmed, but struck the “heinous, atrocious, or\ncruel aggravating factor,” because the evidence was\n“consistent with the hypothesis that [defendant’s] was a crime\nof passion, not a crime that was meant to be deliberately and\nextraordinarily painful.” Id. at 33.\n\n    The defendant represented himself during the guilt phase,\nid. at 32, and his counsel “had only one short meeting with\n[defendant] regarding the penalty phase,” id. at 39. As the\nSupreme Court explained, “counsel did not even take the first\nstep of interviewing witnesses or requesting records.” Id. As\na result, the defendant’s counsel failed to present evidence\nabout “(1) [defendant’s] heroic military service in two of the\nmost critical—and horrific—battles of the Korean War,” id.\nat 41, which earned him two Purple Hearts, the Combat\nInfantryman Badge, and other decorations, id. at 35; “(2) his\nstruggles to regain normality upon his return from war,” id.\nat 41, which led to excessive drinking, id. at 36; “(3) his\nchildhood history of physical abuse,” id. at 41, during which\nhe was subjected to routine beatings and regularly watched\nhis father beating his mother, id. at 33; and “(4) his brain\nabnormality, difficulty reading and writing, and limited\nschooling,” id. at 41.\n\n   The Supreme Court determined that the state court\nunreasonably applied Strickland in holding that the defendant\nwas not prejudiced by counsel’s failure to introduce this\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        61\n\nmitigating evidence. The Court held that the mitigating\nevidence was strong, while the weight of the evidence in\naggravation was less substantial. Id. The Court also held that\nthe state court was unreasonable in discounting the\ndefendant’s childhood abuse and military service. Id. at 43.\nIt was “unreasonable to conclude that [defendant’s] military\nservice would be reduced to inconsequential proportions,\nsimply because the jury would also have learned that\n[defendant] went AWOL on more than one occasion.” Id.\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted). The Court\nreasoned that “[o]ur Nation has a long tradition of according\nleniency to veterans in recognition of their service, especially\nfor those who fought on the front lines as [defendant] did,”\nand that the “relevance of [defendant’s] extensive combat\nexperience is not only that he served honorably under\nextreme hardship and gruesome conditions, but also that the\njury might find mitigating the intense stress and mental and\nemotional toll that combat took on [defendant].” Id. 43–44.\n“To conclude otherwise,” the Court opined, “reflects a failure\nto engage with what [defendant] actually went through in\nKorea.” Id. at 44. Further, the Court held that the state court\nwas “unreasonable to discount to irrelevance the evidence of\n[defendant’s] abusive childhood, especially when that kind of\nhistory may have particular salience for a jury evaluating\n[defendant’s] behavior in his relationship with [his former\ngirlfriend].” Id. at 43.\n\n    The Court’s reasoning in Porter does not lead to the\nconclusion that the California Supreme Court unreasonably\napplied the prejudice prong of Strickland here. Unlike the\nstate court in Porter, the California Supreme Court\nconsidered all mitigation evidence in the record and did not\nfail to consider or “discount to irrelevance” significant\nevidence. See id. The most important mitigation evidence in\n\f62                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nPorter, that the defendant served in “the most critical—and\nhorrific—battles of the Korean War,” see id. at 41, is far\nstronger than the mitigation evidence at issue here.\nMoreover, Andrews did not have an abusive home life, and\nthere is no evidence that his murders in this case were crimes\nof passion for which childhood abuse would have “particular\nsalience for a jury” in evaluating his behavior. See id. at 43.\n\n     Further, the aggravating circumstances in Porter were\ndifferent and less weighty than those in this case. Indeed,\nPorter noted that the state court had stricken the “heinous,\natrocious, or cruel” aggravating factor because the evidence\nin the record was “consistent with the hypothesis that Porter’s\nwas a crime of passion, not a crime that was meant to be\ndeliberately and extraordinarily painful,” id. at 33, while here\nthe California Supreme Court found that Andrews’s brutal\nrape and strangulation of Brandon, and the shooting and\nstrangling deaths of the other victims, evidenced a “callous\ndisregard for human life” and were accomplished with\n“considerable violence and evident sangfroid,” In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 671.20 Because Porter is factually\ndistinct from this case, it has little bearing on the question\nwhether the state court unreasonably applied the prejudice\nprong of Strickland.21\n\n  20\n     The dissent claims that the prosecutor presented “a strong case in\naggravation” in Porter, and therefore the conclusion in Porter must apply\nin this case. Dissent at 118. But unlike the case before us, Porter held\nthat the sentencing judge had misjudged the weight of the aggravating\nevidence, and “the weight of evidence in aggravation is not as substantial\nas the sentencing judge thought.” Porter, 558 U.S. at 41. The aggravating\nevidence in this case cannot similarly be minimized.\n 21\n   Andrews also urges us to apply our decision in Doe v. Ayers, 782 F.3d\n425 (9th Cir. 2015), where we concluded that the defendant was\nprejudiced by counsel’s deficient performance in failing to investigate and\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                               63\n\n    Woodford v. Visciotti, a Supreme Court case that provides\ndirection for determining under AEDPA what constitutes an\nunreasonable application of Strickland, is more closely on\npoint.22 In Visciotti, the Supreme Court considered a state\ncourt’s rejection of a defendant’s Strickland claim. 537 U.S.\nat 26. The state court had weighed the mitigating evidence,\nincluding the defendant’s brain damage, difficult family\nbackground, and possible seizure disorder, against the\naggravating factors, including the circumstances of the crime\n(the cold-blooded killing of two victims during a robbery)\nand his criminal history of knifing a man and stabbing a\npregnant woman in bed “trying to protect her unborn baby,”\nand concluded that the defendant had suffered no prejudice.\nSee id. at 25–26. After the defendant filed a habeas petition,\nthe district court granted relief, and we affirmed. We\nreasoned that counsel’s deficient performance was\nprejudicial, because the “aggravating factors were not\noverwhelming.” Id. at 21–22, 25 (quoting Visciotti v.\n\n\npresent mitigating evidence, including evidence of his rape in prison. Doe\nis not pertinent to our analysis here because it is a pre-AEDPA case that\ndoes not examine whether the state court’s conclusion was unreasonable.\nSee id. at 428, 446 n.31. Nor is Doe clearly established law as determined\nby the Supreme Court. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n 22\n    Although Visciotti was decided after the California Supreme Court’s\ndecision in this case, we give it careful consideration because it addresses\nthe AEDPA question whether a state court’s adjudication of an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim was an unreasonable application of Strickland.\nSee supra at 39–40; see also Dissent at 116–117 & n.9 (acknowledging\nthat Supreme Court opinions analyzing AEDPA are relevant to a circuit\ncourt’s AEDPA analysis, regardless whether those opinions were decided\nbefore or after the last reasoned opinion of the state court). The dissent\nhighlights that Visciotti was “decided after the California Supreme Court’s\ndecision in this case,” Dissent at 118, but given the dissent’s\nacknowledgment that our consideration of a Supreme Court opinion\nanalyzing AEDPA is proper, the meaning of this emphasis is unclear.\n\f64                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nWoodford, 288 F.3d 1097, 1118 (9th Cir. 2002)). The\nSupreme Court reversed.             It explained that “under\n§ 2254(d)(1), it is not enough to convince a federal habeas\ncourt that, in its independent judgment, the state-court\ndecision applied Strickland incorrectly.” Id. at 27 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Rather, “[t]he federal habeas\nscheme leaves primary responsibility with the state courts for\nthese judgments, and authorizes federal-court intervention\nonly when a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable.\nIt is not that here.” Id. In sum, the Court held that “[w]hether\nor not we would reach the same conclusion as the California\nSupreme Court, we think at the very least that the state\ncourt’s contrary assessment was not ‘unreasonable.’” Id.\n(quoting Bell, 535 U.S. at 701) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n    Here, as in Visciotti, the state court reweighed Andrews’s\nmitigating evidence against the brutal circumstances of the\ncrime and Andrews’s prior criminal history, and determined\nthere was no reasonable probability that the sentencer would\ndetermine that “the balance of aggravating and mitigating\nfactors did not warrant imposition of the death penalty.” Id.\nat 22 (internal quotation marks omitted). This decision was\nnot objectively unreasonable, and therefore we are bound to\nconclude that “[w]hether or not we would reach the same\nconclusion,” we cannot say the California Supreme Court’s\nconclusion was an unreasonable application of Strickland.\nSee id. at 27.23\n\n\n 23\n    The fact that our decision in this case was originally unanimous, see\nAndrews v. Davis, 798 F.3d 759 (9th Cir. 2015), and there have been no\nrelevant factual or legal developments since that time, underscores our\nconclusion that fairminded jurists could hold that the state court’s\ndetermination was not objectively unreasonable.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              65\n\n    The dissent purports to recognize that “our deference to\nstate court decisions is at its zenith on federal habeas review,”\nDissent at 96, but fails to apply this standard. Here, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court determined that there was not a\nreasonable probability that the outcome would have been\ndifferent had the evidence adduced at the reference hearing\n(along with the rebuttal evidence) been presented to the jury.\nIn re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 671, 675–76. The dissent does\nnot—and cannot—explain why the court’s conclusion is an\nobjectively unreasonable application of then-existing\nSupreme Court precedent. The dissent points to Williams,\nDissent at 114–116, but makes no effort to explain the flaw\nin the California Supreme Court’s “principled distinction” of\nthis case. Murdoch, 609 F.3d at 991; see supra at 58–59.\nNor does the dissent meaningfully engage with the facts of\nPorter or dispute the numerous distinctions addressed above.\nSee supra at 59–62; Dissent at 116–118.24\n\n    The dissent fails to address the pertinent question, which\n“‘is not whether a federal court believes the state court’s\ndetermination’ under the Strickland standard ‘was incorrect\nbut whether that determination was unreasonable—a\nsubstantially higher threshold.’” Knowles v. Mirzayance,\n556 U.S. 111, 123 (2009) (quoting Schriro v. Landrigan,\n\n\n   24\n      The dissent’s reliance on Wiggins and Rompilla to support its\nStrickland analysis, see Dissent at 112–113, 117, is mistaken, because\nthese cases were decided after the California Supreme Court ruled. While\nwe may always consider the Supreme Court’s reasoning in applying\nAEDPA, both Wiggins and Rompilla examined the prejudice prong of\nStrickland de novo. Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534; Rompilla, 545 U.S. at 390.\nTherefore, these cases do not provide any guidance on the issue before us,\nwhether a state court’s determination that counsel’s deficiency was not\nprejudicial was an unreasonable application of clearly established\nSupreme Court precedent.\n\f66                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n550 U.S. 465, 473 (2007)). Instead, the dissent concludes\nthat the California Supreme Court unreasonably applied\nStrickland based on the dissent’s own view that “at least one\njuror” would be inclined to “spare Andrews’s life” if\nevidence of the abuse at Mt. Meigs had been presented.\nDissent at 92; see id. at 92, 111, 120. This approach would\nbe wrong even under de novo review. The dissent’s limited\nfocus on a single piece of evidence fails to take into account\nthe totality of the mitigating and aggravating evidence in the\nrecord. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695. In this context, the\ndissent’s supposition that one juror would have been moved\namounts to little more than a mere possibility of a different\noutcome, where the Supreme Court has made clear that “[t]he\nlikelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just\nconceivable.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 112 (citing Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 693).\n\n    The dissent’s errors are even more glaring on AEDPA\nreview. The Court has told us frequently and emphatically\nthat “[i]t is not enough that a federal habeas court, in its\nindependent review of the legal question, is left with a firm\nconviction that the state court was erroneous.” Lockyer,\n538 U.S. at 75 (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). Rather, the state court’s decision “must be\nobjectively unreasonable,” id., considering “the totality of the\nevidence before the judge or jury,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n695. Here, rather than apply AEDPA deference, the dissent\nsteps into the shoes of the dissenting justice of the California\nSupreme Court in this case, see Dissent at 98, 100–104,\n107–108, 116, and applies Strickland de novo. Indeed, the\ndissent even makes its own factual findings. See Dissent at\n107, 115 (discounting the substantial rebuttal evidence that\nwould have been presented at sentencing on the ground that\nthe prosecutor from Andrews’s trial would not have\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              67\n\nintroduced rebuttal witnesses had the defense presented\nevidence of Andrews’s prison conditions, a factual conclusion\ncontrary to the determinations of the referee and the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at\n666). Such review is erroneous under AEDPA. In taking this\nde novo approach, the dissent has failed to grapple with “the\nonly question that matters under § 2254(d)(1),” Lockyer,\n538 U.S. at 71, whether the state court’s application of the\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent was objectively\nunreasonable.\n\n   Because the state court’s rejection of Andrews’s penalty\nphase ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not contrary\nto or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court\nprecedent, we may not grant relief on this claim.\n§ 2254(d)(1). We therefore reverse the district court’s\ncontrary conclusion.\n\n                                   D\n\n    Because we decide Andrews’s claim on prejudice\ngrounds, we need not address the parties’ arguments\nregarding whether counsel’s performance was deficient at the\npenalty phase. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697.25 Suffice it to\nsay, the dissent fails to conduct an AEDPA analysis of the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s determination that Andrews’s\nattorney was not deficient under Strickland. Instead, as we\nhave previously noted, supra at 25 n.3, 26–27 n.4, 28 n.5,\n28–29 n.6, 30 n.7, 30–31 n.8, 33–34 n.9, the dissent engages\nin de novo review of both the facts and the law at issue, see\n\n\n  25\n     We also need not consider the additional aggravating evidence put\nforth by the state, which Andrews disputes, and therefore deny the state’s\nmotion for judicial notice of these additional materials.\n\f68                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nDissent at 96–111, and relies on cases that were not clearly\nestablished at the time of the California Supreme Court’s\nruling, see, e.g., Dissent at 100, 106 (relying on the deficiency\nanalysis of Porter, which was decided years after the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s opinion in this case and reviewed\nthe issue of deficiency de novo). And in reaching its de novo\nconclusion that “any competent attorney would have\npresented” the Mt. Meigs evidence, Dissent at 109, the\ndissent ignores “the doubly deferential judicial review that\napplies to a Strickland claim evaluated under the § 2254(d)(1)\nstandard,” Mirzayance, 556 U.S. at 123. Accordingly, the\ndissent fails to raise any serious questions regarding the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s analysis of Strickland’s\ndeficiency prong.\n\n                               III\n\n    Having addressed the state’s cross-appeal, we now turn to\nAndrews’s appeal of the district court’s dismissal of his sole\ncertified claim (Claim 25) that California’s use of its lethal\ninjection protocol to execute him would violate his Eighth\nAmendment rights. According to the district court, the\nCalifornia lethal injection protocol mirrored the Kentucky\nlethal injection protocol upheld by the Supreme Court against\nan Eighth Amendment challenge in Baze v. Rees, 553 U.S. 35\n(2008). The court reasoned that in light of Baze’s ruling, it\nwould be impossible for Andrews to succeed on his challenge\nto California’s lethal injection protocol, and therefore rejected\nthis claim.\n\n    At the time the district court ruled in July 2009, California\ndid not have a lethal injection protocol in place. As explained\nin Sims v. Department of Corrections, the California\nDepartment of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) has\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             69\n\nthe responsibility for developing a procedure for executions\nby lethal injection. 216 Cal. App. 4th 1059, 1064 (2013). In\nDecember 2006, a federal district court ruled that CDCR’s\nprocedure violated the Eighth Amendment prohibition against\ncruel and unusual punishment. Id. (citing Morales v. Tilton,\n465 F. Supp. 2d 972 (N.D. Cal. 2006)). Although the CDCR\nsubstantially revised its protocol in 2007, a state trial court\ninvalidated the revised procedure on the ground that it\nviolated the state’s administrative procedure act. Id.26\nBecause no new protocol was in place at the time the district\ncourt ruled, the claim was unripe, and the district court erred\nin entertaining it. See Payton v. Cullen, 658 F.3d 890, 893\n\n\n\n\n  26\n    After losing its appeal, CDCR promulgated a new procedure, which\ntook effect on August 29, 2010. Sims, 216 Cal. App. 4th at 1064–65. In\nresponse to a new legal challenge, a trial court again invalidated the\nCDCR lethal injection procedure for failure to comply with the state\nadministrative procedure act and permanently enjoined the CDCR from\nadministering executions by lethal injection until it promulgated new\nregulations. Id. at 1066–67. This injunction was upheld on appeal. Id. at\n1083–84. The CDCR proposed a new single-drug lethal injection protocol\nin November 2015. Pursuant to California’s Administrative Procedure\nAct (APA), the CDCR held a mandatory public comment period,\nresponded to each substantive comment, made any necessary changes, and\nresubmitted the proposed protocol for additional public comment until\nNovember 7, 2016. See Cal. Gov. Code §§ 11346–48. On December 28,\n2016, the California Office of Administrative Law (OAL) rejected the\nproposed lethal injunction protocol and stated that revisions may be\nresubmitted within 120 days. In 2016, California voters approved the\nDeath Penalty Reform and Savings Act of 2016 (Proposition 66), which\namended state statute to provide that the state APA does not apply to\nlethal injection protocols. The California Supreme Court stayed\n“implementation of all provisions of Proposition 66” pending the\nresolution of litigation challenging its implementation. Briggs v. Brown,\n387 P.3d 1254, 1255 (Cal. 2017).\n\f70                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n(9th Cir. 2011).27 Andrews may renew his challenge when\nCalifornia has finally approved its protocol. Id.\n\n                                     IV\n\n    Andrews also raises several uncertified claims based on\nthe following legal theories: (1) unconstitutional delay\nbetween sentencing and execution under Lackey v. Texas,\n514 U.S. 1045 (1995) (Stevens, J., statement respecting\ndenial of certiorari); (2) ineffective assistance of trial counsel\nunder Strickland; (3) failure to disclose material exculpatory\nevidence and false testimony under Brady v. Maryland,\n373 U.S. 83 (1963), and Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269\n(1959); and (4) destruction of evidence in violation of due\nprocess under California v. Trombetta, 467 U.S. 479 (1984),\nand its progeny. He also raises uncertified claims based on\ncumulative error and factual innocence.\n\n   We first turn to the question whether Andrews must\nobtain a COA for these claims under 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c).28\n\n\n\n 27\n    In light of this holding, we need not reach Andrews’s claims that the\ndistrict court erred in denying him an evidentiary hearing on Claim 25 or\nin declining to stay this claim to allow him to rely on evidence presented\nin Morales.\n 28\n      Section 2253(c) states:\n\n           (c)(1) Unless a circuit justice or judge issues a\n           certificate of appealability, an appeal may not be taken\n           to the court of appeals from–\n\n               (A) the final order in a habeas corpus proceeding\n           in which the detention complained of arises out of\n           process issued by a State court; or\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                            71\n\nOur analysis of this question is governed by Jennings v.\nStephens, which considered whether a habeas petitioner who\nobtained relief in the district court could defend this judgment\non alternate grounds without taking a cross-appeal and\nobtaining a COA. 135 S. Ct. 793, 798 (2015). Jennings held\nthat a habeas petitioner in such circumstances need not take\na cross-appeal so long as the petitioner did not attempt to\ndefend the district court’s judgment on a theory that seeks “to\nenlarge his rights or lessen the State’s under the District\nCourt’s judgment granting habeas relief.” Id. at 798,\n801–02.29 Further, because “§ 2253(c) applies only when ‘an\nappeal’ is ‘taken to the court of appeals,’” id. at 802 (quoting\n§ 2253(c)), a petitioner who does not have to take a cross-\nappeal does not need a COA, id. Applying this rule, Jennings\nnoted that the district court’s judgment granting the petitioner\nrelief at the penalty phase of his trial entitled him “to release,\nresentencing, or commutation, at the State’s option.” Id. at\n799. Accordingly, “[a]ny potential claim that would have\nentitled [the petitioner] to a new sentencing proceeding could\n\n\n             (B) the final order in a proceeding under section\n         2255.\n\n         (2) A certificate of appealability may issue under\n         paragraph (1) only if the applicant has made a\n         substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\n         right.\n\n         (3) The certificate of appealability under paragraph\n         (1) shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy\n         the showing required by paragraph (2).\n  29\n     Jennings was nonetheless careful to note that a petitioner defending\nhis judgment on appeal would be “confined to those alternative grounds\npresent in the record: he may not simply argue any alternative basis,\nregardless of its origin.” Jennings, 135 S. Ct. at 800.\n\f72                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nhave been advanced to ‘urge . . . support’ of the judgment,”\nid. at 800 (last alteration in original) (quoting United States\nv. Am. Ry. Express Co., 265 U.S. 425, 435 (1924)). Neither\na cross-appeal nor a COA would be required. Id. at 800–02.\nBy contrast, “[a] habeas applicant who has won resentencing\nwould be required to take a cross-appeal in order to raise a\nrejected claim that would result in a new trial.” Id. at 800.\nAnd “if a habeas applicant has won retrial below, a claim that\nhis conduct was constitutionally beyond the power of the\nState to punish would require cross-appeal.” Id. In both such\ncases, a COA would also have been required. See id. at 802.\n\n    Here, Andrews won relief at the district court based on his\ntheory of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty\nphase of his trial. The district court ordered that “the State of\nCalifornia shall, within 120 days from the entry of this\nJudgment, either grant Petitioner a new penalty phase trial, or\nvacate the death sentence and resentence the Petitioner in\naccordance with California law and the United States\nConstitution.” Accordingly, Andrews’s rights under this\njudgment were for a new penalty phase trial or resentencing\nwithin a fixed time, and Andrews may urge any potential\nclaim present in the record that would entitle him to a new\npenalty phase trial or resentencing without taking a cross-\nappeal or obtaining a COA. See id. at 800–02.\n\n    But none of Andrews’s uncertified claims support the\ndistrict court’s judgment. Five of his claims seek a new guilt\nphase trial (his Strickland, Brady/Napue, Trombetta, and\ncumulative error claims, and a factual innocence claim).30 As\n\n\n 30\n    While the Supreme Court has not ruled on the question whether a free-\nstanding claim of factual innocence is cognizable in habeas, it has\nsuggested that success on such a claim (if cognizable) would entitle a\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             73\n\nexplained in Jennings, because Andrews won resentencing,\nhe must take a cross-appeal and obtain a COA to raise a claim\nthat results in a new trial. Id. His Lackey claim seeks a ruling\nthat the state cannot constitutionally impose the death penalty\non him. Because the district court’s order gave the state the\nright to seek the death penalty at a new penalty phase trial,\nAndrews’s Lackey and factual innocence claims seek to\n“lessen the State’s [rights] under the District Court’s\njudgment granting habeas relief.” Id. at 798. Under\nJennings, Andrews must bring a cross-appeal and obtain a\nCOA to raise these claims as well.\n\n    We lack jurisdiction to consider uncertified claims unless\nwe determine that Andrews “has made a substantial showing\nof the denial of a constitutional right” and grant a COA.\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2); see also Ninth Circuit Rule 22-1(e)\n(“Uncertified issues raised and designated [in a petitioner’s\nopening brief] will be construed as a motion to expand the\nCOA . . . .”). Habeas petitioners must make a “showing that\nreasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter,\nagree that) the petition should have been resolved in a\ndifferent manner or that the issues presented were adequate\nto deserve encouragement to proceed further.” Slack v.\nMcDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Because the statute is jurisdictional,“[t]his\nthreshold question should be decided without ‘full\nconsideration of the factual or legal bases adduced in support\nof the claims.’” Buck v. Davis, 137 S. Ct. 759, 773 (2017)\n(quoting Miller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003)). As\nthe Supreme Court directed in Miller-El, rather than\n“[d]eciding the substance of an appeal,” 537 U.S. at 342, we\n\n\npetitioner to a new guilt phase trial. Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390,\n403, 405, 417 (1993).\n\f74                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n“look to the District Court’s application of AEDPA to\npetitioner’s constitutional claims,” id. at 336, in light of a\n“fair interpretation of the record,” id. at 345, and ask whether\n“reasonable jurists would find the district court’s assessment\nof the constitutional claims debatable or wrong,” id. at 338.\nWhile the Court has not specified “what procedures may be\nappropriate in every case,” any procedures “employed at the\nCOA stage should be consonant with the limited nature of the\ninquiry.” Buck, 137 S. Ct. at 774.\n\n                               A\n\n    We first consider Andrews’s claim that his execution\nwould violate the Eighth Amendment due to the long delay\nbetween his sentence and execution. Andrews did not raise\nthis claim in his opening brief on appeal, but moved to file a\nsupplemental brief raising this claim after a district court\nissued a decision holding that under Furman v. Georgia,\n408 U.S. 238 (1972) and Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S. 153\n(1976), California’s death penalty system violated the Eighth\nAmendment because its “dysfunctional administration”\nresulted in “inordinate and unpredictable” periods of delay\nbefore execution, such that executions do not serve a\nretributive or deterrent purpose and will be arbitrary. Jones\nv. Chappell, 31 F. Supp. 3d 1050, 1053, 1061–62, 1069 (C.D.\nCal. 2014), rev’d sub nom. Jones v. Davis, 806 F.3d 538 (9th\nCir. 2015). We granted his motion, and ordered the state to\nrespond.\n\n    In his brief, Andrews stated that he raised this claim to the\ndistrict court as Claim 26. In Claim 26, Andrews had argued\nthat executing him after 22 years on death row would be cruel\nand unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth\nAmendment and would serve no retributive or deterrent\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        75\n\npenological purpose. Claim 26 also asserted that Andrews\ndid not cause any unnecessary delays, but merely sought to\nvindicate his constitutional rights in a system that produced\ndelays. Andrews exhausted this claim by raising it to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, which summarily denied it.\n\n    The district court rejected this claim on the merits on the\nground that there has been no demonstration of “any support\nin the American constitutional tradition or in [Supreme\nCourt] precedent for the proposition that a defendant can\navail himself of the panoply of appellate and collateral\nprocedures and then complain when his execution is\ndelayed,” a quote from Knight v. Florida, 528 U.S. 990\n(1999) (Thomas, J., concurring in a denial of certiorari),\nrelied on by two Ninth Circuit cases, Smith v. Mahoney,\n611 F.3d 978, 998 (9th Cir. 2010), and Allen v. Ornoski,\n435 F.3d 946, 958 (9th Cir. 2006), as evidence that no\nSupreme Court precedent supports a claim of unconstitutional\ndelay.\n\n    On appeal, Andrews argues that the delay in carrying out\nthe death sentence makes California’s death penalty\nunconstitutional both on its face and as applied to him. After\ndiscussing in detail Jones’s reasoning and conclusion that the\nCalifornia death penalty system is unconstitutional, Andrews\nargues that no fairminded jurist could disagree with such a\nconclusion in his case, because he has been continuously\nconfined under sentence of death for more than 30 years, and\nthe delays are caused by factors outside his control. Andrews\nalso points to separate statements by individual Supreme\nCourt justices questioning the constitutionality of the inherent\ndelay in capital cases. See, e.g., Muhammad v. Florida,\n134 S. Ct. 894 (2014) (Breyer, J., dissenting from denial of\ncertiorari); Johnson v. Bredesen, 558 U.S. 1067 (2009)\n\f76                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n(Stevens, J., joined by Breyer, J., statement respecting denial\nof certiorari); Lackey, 514 U.S. 1045 (Stevens, J., statement\nrespecting denial of certiorari) (stating that a prisoner’s claim\nthat his 17 years on death row violates the Eighth\nAmendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual\npunishment was “not without foundation,” and encouraging\nstate and federal courts to consider the issue).\n\n    Before we can address this claim, we must consider\nseveral procedural hurdles. As a threshold matter, Andrews\ndid not raise this claim in his opening brief on appeal. While\nwe generally deem a petitioner to have waived any issue not\nraised in an opening brief, see United States v. Ullah,\n976 F.2d 509, 514 (9th Cir. 1992), we recognize exceptions\nto this general rule. Such an exception is applicable here: the\nstate has fully briefed the issue and would suffer no prejudice.\nSee id. Therefore, we conclude we may address this issue.\n\n    Next, the state argues that Andrews’s claim was not fairly\npresented to the California Supreme Court or the district\ncourt, and so is both unexhausted and waived. “A federal\ncourt may not grant habeas relief to a state prisoner unless he\nhas properly exhausted his remedies in state court.” Dickens\nv. Ryan, 740 F.3d 1302, 1317 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc)\n(quoting Peterson v. Lampert, 319 F.3d 1153, 1155 (9th Cir.\n2003) (en banc)). Exhaustion of constitutional claims\nrequires that the claims be “fairly presented” in state court,\nallowing the state courts an “opportunity to act on them.” Id.\nat 1318 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nTo be fairly presented in state court, a claim must include:\n(1) “a statement of the facts that entitle the petitioner to\nrelief,” Gray v. Netherland, 518 U.S. 152, 162–63 (1996),\nand (2) citations “to either a federal or state case involving\nthe legal standard for a federal constitutional violation,”\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        77\n\nCastillo v. McFadden, 399 F.3d 993, 999 (9th Cir. 2005). “A\nclaim has not been fairly presented in state court if new\nfactual allegations either fundamentally alter the legal claim\nalready considered by the state courts, or place the case in a\nsignificantly different and stronger evidentiary posture than\nit was when the state courts considered it.” Dickens, 740 F.3d\nat 1318 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Two\nclaims are distinct and must be separately exhausted if the\nclaims are based on the same facts, but are supported by\ndistinct constitutional theories. See Gray, 518 U.S. at\n163–65.       “[G]eneral appeals to broad constitutional\nprinciples, such as due process, equal protection, and the right\nto a fair trial, are insufficient to establish exhaustion.”\nHiivala v. Wood, 195 F.3d 1098, 1106 (9th Cir. 1999). But\nwhen claims are “sufficiently related” or “intertwined” so that\nraising one clearly implies the other, exhausting one claim\nwill also exhaust the related claim, so long as the failure to\nexplicitly raise the related claim was not a “strategic choice.”\nLounsbury v. Thompson, 374 F.3d 785, 788 (9th Cir. 2004)\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (holding that exhaustion\nof a procedural challenge to petitioner’s competency\ndetermination exhausted a substantive challenge to the same\ndetermination, though the two challenges relied on two\ndistinct Fifth Amendment theories); see also Wooten v.\nKirkland, 540 F.3d 1019, 1025 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\n    The state asserts that there is a distinction between the\nsort of Eighth Amendment claim that Andrews raised to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court and in district court (sometimes\nreferred to as a Lackey claim), and the Eighth Amendment\nclaim based on Jones he is raising here, such that the state\ncourts lacked an opportunity to consider it. Specifically, the\nstate argues that a Lackey claim is an individual challenge,\nbased on the theory that executing a prisoner who has spent\n\f78                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nmany years on death row violates the prohibition on cruel and\nunusual punishment of that prisoner, while Jones was based\non the theory that the California system itself creates the\nconstitutional infirmity, because inordinate delay makes the\nsystem arbitrary and unable to serve a deterrent or retributive\npurpose, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n    We disagree that Andrews is raising a systemic challenge\nto California’s administration of its death penalty system,\nwhich would be a new and unexhausted claim. Rather,\nAndrews’s claim before the state court, the district court, and\non appeal here is essentially the same constitutional claim:\nthat his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment\nunder the Eighth Amendment is violated by his lengthy\nincarceration while under a sentence of death. Andrews has\nnot introduced any new facts or evidence since he raised this\nargument to the state court. Andrews’s supplemental brief\npoints to Jones’s conclusion that there are systemic delays in\nimposing the death penalty throughout the California system,\nbut uses this conclusion to support his Lackey claim that\n“inherent delay in capital cases” renders executions\nunconstitutional. Accordingly, Andrews’s references to\nJones do not “fundamentally alter the legal claim already\nconsidered by the state courts.” Dickens, 740 F.3d at 1318\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore conclude\nthat Andrews’s uncertified claim, as briefed on appeal, is\nsufficiently related and intertwined with Claim 26 such that\nAndrews’s exhaustion of Claim 26 likewise exhausted his\ncurrent challenge. See Lounsbury, 374 F.3d at 788.\nMoreover, Andrews raised this same claim to the district\ncourt. Accordingly, Andrews exhausted this delay claim and\ndid not waive it.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                         79\n\n    We now consider Andrews’s motion for a COA for this\nclaim. The district court denied Claim 26 because the state\ncourt’s rejection of this claim was not an unreasonable\napplication of Supreme Court precedent. No reasonable jurist\nwould find the district court’s ruling debatable or wrong. See\nSlack, 529 U.S. at 484. As we have previously stated in the\nAEDPA context, no clearly established Supreme Court\nprecedent holds that inordinate delay in the execution of a\ncapital defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment. Allen, 435 F.3d at\n958–60. Andrews argues that the state court’s rejection of his\ndelay claim is contrary to Furman, 408 U.S. at 311–12\n(White, J., concurring), and Gregg, 428 U.S. at 188 (plurality\nopinion). But these cases articulate a general Eighth\nAmendment standard that the death penalty is\nunconstitutional if imposed arbitrarily, or if the penalty itself\ndoes not serve the penological purposes of deterrence and\nretribution. These principles do not “squarely address[]” the\nspecific issue raised by Andrews’s delay claim, and would\nrequire a significant extension of the rationale of Furman and\nGregg to apply in this particular context. See Van Patten,\n552 U.S. at 125–26.\n\n    We reached a similar determination in Jones v. Davis,\nwhere we held that neither Furman nor Gregg established the\nrule that the Eighth Amendment barred delays in resolving\npost-conviction proceedings. See 806 F.3d at 551. In light of\nthe Supreme Court’s rule that “federal courts may not\nconsider novel constitutional theories on habeas review,” id.\nat 541 (citing Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989)), we\nconcluded that neither a Lackey claim nor a systemic\nchallenge to California’s death penalty system was\ncognizable in federal habeas proceedings. Id. at 548, 552.\nBecause such claims are barred from habeas consideration\n\f80                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nunder Teague, see id. at 548, 552, they are not clearly\nestablished rules under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). Schardt v.\nPayne, 414 F.3d 1025, 1037 (9th Cir. 2005). Therefore, the\nstate court’s rejection of Andrews’s delay claim was not an\nunreasonable application of Furman or Gregg, and reasonable\njurists would not dispute the district court’s conclusion to that\neffect. See Woodall, 134 S. Ct. at 1706–07. Therefore, the\nstate court’s rejection of Andrews’s delay claim was not an\nunreasonable application of Furman or Gregg, and reasonable\njurists would not dispute the district court’s conclusion to that\neffect. See Woodall, 134 S. Ct. at 1706–07.\n\n    Because Andrews has not made a “substantial showing”\nthat his Eighth Amendment rights were violated, see\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2), we deny a COA for this claim.\n\n                               B\n\n    We next turn to Andrews’s four uncertified claims\nalleging that trial counsel were ineffective under Strickland\nfor failing to investigate and present four categories of\nevidence.\n\n     The first claim relates to the police’s investigation of\nsuspects before Sanders was arrested and agreed to testify\npursuant to a plea agreement. During the investigation,\npolice officers took statements from at least nine witnesses\nand informally interviewed many others who provided\ninformation about activities in and around Wheeler’s\napartment in the days leading up to the murders. According\nto these statements, Wheeler’s drug customers frequented his\napartment, disturbances were a regular occurrence, and\nshootings had occurred in the apartment. The police did not\nfind any corroborating physical or testimonial evidence\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       81\n\nsuggesting that any of these drug customers was the killer.\nWhen investigating Wheeler’s apartment, the police found\nfingerprints of individuals who had been seen in the\napartment on the evening the murders occurred, but nothing\nlinking them to the crime. The police arrested one drug\ndealer who worked with Wheeler, but ultimately released\nhim. When interrogated, this drug dealer denied murdering\nWheeler, but told the police that a Mexican Mafia member\nhad told him that the Mexican Mafia had murdered Wheeler.\nHe did not provide any corroborating evidence to support this\nstory.\n\n    Relying on this evidence, Andrews claims that his trial\ncounsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and present\nevidence that third parties, such as Wheeler’s customers and\nfellow dealers, had the motive and opportunity to commit the\nmurders due to their drug-related dealings with Wheeler. The\nstate court summarily rejected this claim when it denied\nAndrews’s second state habeas petition. The district court\ndenied relief on this claim.\n\n    We conclude that reasonable jurists would not find\ndebatable or wrong the district court’s conclusion that this\nclaim fails under Strickland and AEDPA. See Slack,\n529 U.S. at 484. The evidence adduced at trial was\noverwhelming: Sanders, an eyewitness, testified to the events\nof the murders, Brooks testified regarding Andrews’s\nconfession, and the evidence established that Andrews’s palm\nprints were found on either side of Brandon’s body. In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 658. Accordingly, reasonable jurists\nwould not debate the reasonableness of the state court’s\nconclusion that counsel’s failure to further investigate these\nsuspects did not prejudice Andrews’s defense.              See\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\f82                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n     Second, Andrews argues that counsel were ineffective for\nfailing to investigate or present evidence that semen found on\nBrandon’s body could not have come from Andrews. The\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the state court did not\nunreasonably apply Strickland in rejecting this claim is not\ndebatable, because the state court could reasonably conclude\nthat counsel’s failure to introduce such evidence was not\nprejudicial. The record shows only that slides containing\nsemen found on Brandon’s body contain biological markers\nthat some people secrete and others do not. Andrews does\nnot secrete these markers, but the record is silent as to\nwhether Brandon was a secretor. Andrews offers statistical\nevidence suggesting that Brandon was probably not a\nsecretor, but the evidence is not conclusive. Indeed, even\nother experts testifying for Andrews noted that what minimal\nevidence they obtained was subject to challenge. In light of\nthe eyewitness testimony about Andrews’s involvement in the\nmurders, and his palm prints next to Brandon’s body,\nreasonable jurists would not dispute that the state court\nreasonably concluded that any deficiency by defense counsel\nwas not prejudicial.\n\n    Next, Andrews raises two claims relating to the police\ninvestigation of fingerprint evidence found at Wheeler’s\napartment. As explained by the state court on direct appeal,\ntwo of the police’s fingerprint experts, Howard Sanshuck and\nDonald Keir, testified at trial that they compared\n50 fingerprints found in Wheeler’s apartment with Andrews’s\nfingerprints and palm prints. People v. Andrews, 776 P.2d at\n289. The two experts concluded that left and right palm\nprints on the kitchen floor on either side of Brandon’s body\nbelonged to Andrews. Id. Sanshuck’s supervisor, Jimmy\nCassel, had previously reviewed the prints and initially\nlabeled them as belonging to Wheeler. Id. Sanshuck\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        83\n\ndiscovered the error shortly before Andrews’s first trial. At\nthe second trial, Cassel stated that the original\nmisidentification was due to his efforts to process the crime\nscene information too quickly, and testified that there was no\nsimilarity between the palm prints found on the kitchen floor\nand Wheeler’s prints. Id. The three experts, Sanshuck, Keir,\nand Cassel, all testified at the second trial that Andrews’s\npalm prints matched the palm prints found on either side of\nBrandon’s body. Id. Andrews has never adduced any\nevidence to rebut this.\n\n    On appeal, Andrews claims that his counsel were\ndeficient in failing to investigate two different lines of\ndefense. First, Andrews claims that counsel performed\ndeficiently by failing to present evidence that Andrews’s\nfingerprints could have been left in Wheeler’s apartment due\nto his prior visits. Second, Andrews claims that counsel\nshould have uncovered and used the police’s original\nmisidentification of his palm prints. Andrews points to other\nreports in the record which he claims shows that Keir and a\nthird analyst, William Leo, also misidentified his fingerprints.\nThe district court rejected this claim. In light of the\nunrebutted evidence that the palm prints found on either side\nof Brandon’s body were Andrews’s prints, no reasonable\njurist would dispute the district court’s determination that the\nstate court could reasonably have concluded that counsel’s\nhandling of the fingerprint evidence did not prejudice\nAndrews’s defense. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n     Finally, Andrews claims that counsel were ineffective for\nfailing to investigate or present evidence regarding his alibi\nthe night of the murder. The record shows that Andrews gave\na defense investigator the names of two alibi witnesses and\ninformation on how to locate them, but Andrews did not\n\f84                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nprovide any affidavits from these witnesses to the state court,\nor any further information about the nature of their testimony.\nThe state court and district court rejected this claim. In light\nof the detailed testimony from Sanders and Brooks, the\nevidence of Andrews’s palm prints on either side of\nBrandon’s body, and the lack of any evidence regarding the\nalibi witnesses, no reasonable jurist would dispute that the\nstate court reasonably applied Strickland in concluding that\ncounsel’s failure to further investigate these witnesses was\nnot prejudicial.\n\n    Andrews relies on United States v. Valenzuela-Bernal for\nthe proposition that he could establish his ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim without showing how his alibi\nwitnesses would have testified, because he needed to show\nonly that their testimony would be material and favorable to\nhis defense. 458 U.S. 858, 867 (1982). Therefore, Andrews\nclaims, the state court erred in rejecting his Strickland claim.\nThe district court rejected this argument, and we agree.\nValenzuela-Bernal held that when the government deports\naliens who could aid a criminal defendant in his defense,\nthere is no violation of the criminal defendant’s right to\ncompulsory process under the Sixth Amendment unless the\ndefendant “make[s] some plausible showing of how [the alibi\nwitness’s] testimony would have been both material and\nfavorable to his defense.” Id. This ruling does not “squarely\naddress[] the issue,” Van Patten, 552 U.S. at 125–26, or\n“establish a legal principle that clearly extends” to the\nquestion whether Andrews’s counsel’s failure to pursue the\nalibi witnesses was ineffective assistance of counsel, see\nMoses, 555 F.3d at 754 (quoting Van Patten, 552 U.S. at 123)\n(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccordingly, the state court’s rejection of Andrews’s claim\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       85\n\nwas not an unreasonable application of Valenzuela-Bernal.\nSee Woodall, 134 S. Ct. at 1706–07.\n\n    In sum, the state court did not unreasonably apply\nStrickland in concluding that Andrews did not create a\n“substantial, not just conceivable” likelihood of a different\nresult, or that “any real possibility of [Andrews’s] being\nacquitted was eclipsed by the remaining evidence pointing to\nguilt,” Richter, 562 U.S. at 112–13; see also Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 695–96, and the district court’s determination to\nthis effect was not debatable. Accordingly, Andrews has not\nmade a “substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\nright,” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2), and we decline to issue a\nCOA.\n\n                              C\n\n    Andrews argues that the state court erred in rejecting two\nclaims that his rights under Brady were violated. Brady\nrequires the state to disclose “evidence that is both favorable\nto the accused and material either to guilt or to punishment.”\nU.S. v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 674 (1985) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Evidence is material “if there is a reasonable\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the\ndefense, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.” Id. at 682. Thus, to establish a Brady violation, a\ndefendant must prove: (1) “[t]he evidence at issue [is]\nfavorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or\nbecause it is impeaching,” (2) the evidence was “suppressed\n. . . either willfully or inadvertently,” and (3) prejudice\nresulted, meaning there is a reasonable probability that\ndisclosing the evidence to the defense would have changed\nthe result. See Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 281–82\n(1999); Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682.\n\f86                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    Andrews claims the state suppressed two pieces of\nevidence. First, he contends that the prosecution failed to\ndisclose a case file maintained by the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment, termed a “murder book,” which contained\nmaterial evidence including the third party culpability and\nfingerprint evidence also advanced in support of his\nineffective assistance of counsel claims. The state court\ncould reasonably have rejected this claim because the state\nhad provided counsel with a chronology of the police\ninvestigation referring to much of the allegedly suppressed\nmurder book evidence. The district court held the state\ncourt’s conclusion was not an unreasonable application of\nBrady. No reasonable jurist could disagree with this\nconclusion, because the state court could reasonably have\nconcluded that the evidence was not suppressed under Brady.\nSee United States v. Dupuy, 760 F.2d 1492, 1501 n.5 (9th Cir.\n1985) (holding the government does not suppress evidence\nfor purposes of Brady where “the means of obtaining the\nexculpatory evidence [was] provided to the defense”).\nMoreover, the state court could have reasonably concluded\nthat the result of the proceeding would not have been\ndifferent even if the evidence had been disclosed to the\ndefense. See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 280.\n\n     For the same reason, no reasonable jurist could disagree\nwith the district court’s rejection of Andrews’s second Brady\nclaim, that the prosecution withheld the fact that Brooks was\nsubject to charges of welfare fraud. The state court could\nhave reasonably concluded that defense counsel had\nsufficient information to discover that charges had been filed,\nbecause defense counsel knew that Brooks was being\ninvestigated for welfare fraud, and questioned her about it at\ntrial, outside the presence of the jury. See Dupuy, 760 F.2d\nat 1501 n.5.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             87\n\n    Andrews also raises claims under Napue, which provides\nthat the state may not “knowingly use false evidence,\nincluding false testimony” or “allow[] it to go uncorrected\nwhen it appears.” 360 U.S. at 269. According to Andrews,\nthe state knowingly adduced false testimony from two\nfingerprint experts, Keir and Sanshuck. First, Andrews notes\nthat a report in the record, dated August 4, 1980, states that\nKeir reviewed “fingers” from a suspect named “Walters” (the\nalias being used by Andrews at the time) and concludes that\nthe prints were “not made.” This means, Andrews argues,\nthat Keir lied in identifying the palm prints found by\nBrandon’s body as being from Andrews, and also lied when\nhe testified that he first examined Andrews’s palm prints in\nNovember 1983. The state asserts Keir did not testify falsely,\nbecause the report references fingerprints, while Keir testified\nregarding palm prints. Second, Andrews argues that\nSanshuck’s testimony that police policy did not require\nphotographs to be taken of prints on the surface from which\nthey were lifted was false, because it contradicted a Los\nAngeles Police Department Homicide Manual, dated 1981.31\nThe state argues that no false information was knowingly\npresented, see id., because the homicide manual used\npermissive, not mandatory, language, and because the\nmanual’s statement did not reflect the police department’s\n\n\n  31\n      The Los Angeles Police Department Homicide Manual states in\npertinent part:\n\n        Note: (A) Photographing Prints\n\n        Prints found at the scene of a homicide should be\n        photographed. The procedure is recommended because\n        it is much easier to introduce print evidence into court\n        if the print has been photographed, as parts of the object\n        which carried the print may show in the picture.\n\f88                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nactual practice, which was the subject of Sanshuck’s\ntestimony. The district court rejected Andrews’s Napue\nclaims, and no reasonable jurist could disagree that the state\ncourt could reject these claims based on the reasonable view\nof the facts offered by the state. See Maddox, 366 F.3d at\n999–1000 (holding that under AEDPA, state court fact\nfinding must be not merely wrong, but “actually\nunreasonable” and without support in the record to warrant\nhabeas relief).\n\n                              D\n\n    Andrews makes three claims based on the fact that\nbetween 1993 and 1995, all biological evidence in this case\nwas destroyed, except for 50 fingerprint cards, one vaginal\nslide, one oral slide, and one anal slide. His petition to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court claimed that the destruction of the\nevidence violated his due process rights under Trombetta and\nArizona v. Youngblood, a case that held that the government’s\n“failure to preserve potentially useful evidence” before trial\ndoes not violate a defendant’s due process rights unless the\ncriminal defendant can show that the government acted in bad\nfaith. 488 U.S. 51, 58 (1988). As Andrews acknowledges,\nthe Supreme Court has since held that cases assessing pre-\nconviction access to evidence, which would include\nTrombetta and Youngblood, do not apply to cases where a\ndefendant is denied access to evidence after being convicted.\nSee Dist. Attorney’s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v.\nOsborne, 557 U.S. 52, 61–62, 68–69, 74 (2009); see also\nCress v. Palmer, 484 F.3d 844, 853 (6th Cir. 2007)\n(observing that “the Supreme Court has not clearly\nestablished that post-conviction destruction [of evidence] is\na due process violation”). Therefore, the California Supreme\nCourt did not unreasonably apply Trombetta or Youngblood.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        89\n\nAndrews relies on Osborne to make a second claim, that the\ndestruction of evidence violated his due process and Eighth\nAmendment rights. We do not consider whether the state\ncourt’s decision was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Osborne, because it was decided after the\nCalifornia Supreme Court ruled, and thus is not clearly\nestablished precedent for purposes of § 2254(d)(1). This\ntheory was not briefed to the district court, as the case was\ndecided between completion of briefing and the court’s\ndecision. Andrews points to no clearly established precedent\nin existence at the time the state court ruled that applies this\nprinciple, and therefore the district court’s rejection of this\nclaim was not debatable among fair minded jurists.\n\n    Andrews’s third claim is that the destruction of evidence\ndenied him access to the courts to vindicate an underlying\nclaim of factual innocence. However, as the district court\nrecognized in rejecting this claim, he cites no Supreme Court\nprecedent clearly establishing that destruction of evidence\nafter a defendant is convicted violates a right of access to the\ncourts. Christopher v. Harbury, on which Andrews relies, is\nnot on point: it held that a plaintiff’s claim that government\nofficials misled her in connection with her husband’s\ndisappearance did not state a constitutional denial of access\nclaim upon which relief could be granted. 536 U.S. 403, 407,\n415, 418–19 (2002). Accordingly, no reasonable jurist could\ndispute that the district court correctly denied this claim.\n\n                               E\n\n    In light of the above, we conclude that no reasonable\njurist would disagree with the district court in rejecting\nAndrews’s cumulative error claim. “[T]he fundamental\nquestion in determining whether the combined effect of trial\n\f90                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nerrors violated a defendant’s due process rights is whether the\nerrors rendered the criminal defense ‘far less persuasive,’ and\nthereby had a ‘substantial and injurious effect or influence’\non the jury’s verdict.” Parle v. Runnels, 505 F.3d 922, 928\n(9th Cir. 2007) (citation omitted) (quoting Chambers v.\nMississippi, 410 U.S. 284, 294 (1973) and Brecht v.\nAbrahamson, 507 U.S. 619, 637 (1993)). We agree with the\ndistrict court that the California Supreme Court reasonably\ndetermined that any errors, in the aggregate, did not have\nsuch a substantial or injurious effect on the verdict. The\ncumulative result of the disputable errors identified by\nAndrews would not have made his defense significantly more\npersuasive, since his defense focused on attacking the\ncredibility of Sanders and Brooks and challenging the\nfingerprint and palm print evidence. Reasonable jurists\nwould not dispute the district court’s conclusion, so no COA\nis warranted.\n\n    Nor would any reasonable jurist disagree with the district\ncourt’s conclusion that the state court did not err in rejecting\nAndrews’s factual innocence claim. The state court could\nhave reasonably concluded that Andrews’s introduction of\nslides showing that biological markers found in the semen on\nBrandon’s body had not been secreted by Andrews and may\nnot have been secreted by Brandon, described above, was\ninsufficient to “go beyond demonstrating doubt about his\nguilt [to] affirmatively prove that he is probably innocent.”\nSee Carriger v. Stewart, 132 F.3d 463, 476 (9th Cir. 1997)\n(en banc) (observing that the standard for establishing a\nfreestanding claim of actual innocence is “‘extraordinarily\nhigh,’ and that the showing [for a successful claim] would\nhave to be ‘truly persuasive.’” (quoting Herrera, 506 U.S. at\n417) (O’Connor, J., concurring)). This claim does not merit\na COA.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             91\n\n    In sum, because the district court’s conclusions, under\nAEDPA review, are not debatable among reasonable jurists,\nAndrews fails to make the “substantial showing of the denial\nof a constitutional right” required for a COA to issue, and we\ndeny his request for one as to each of his uncertified claims.\n\n                                  V\n\n    Andrews contends that the district court erred in denying\nhis motion for an evidentiary hearing on 16 claims (Claims\n1–8, 15, 19–23, 25, and 32), which include all but one of the\nclaims on appeal here.32 We review a district court’s denial\nof an evidentiary hearing for an abuse of discretion, Sully v.\nAyers, 725 F.3d 1057, 1067 (9th Cir. 2013), and “may affirm\nthe district court’s decision on any ground supported by the\nrecord, even if it differs from the district court’s rationale,”\nid. (internal quotation marks omitted). In Pinholster, the\nSupreme Court stated that “review under § 2254(d)(1) is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.” 563 U.S. at 181. “[A]n\nevidentiary hearing is pointless once the district court has\ndetermined that § 2254(d) precludes habeas relief.” Sully,\n725 F.3d at 1075; see Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 203 n.20\n(“Because Pinholster has failed to demonstrate that the\nadjudication of his claim based on the state-court record\nresulted in a decision ‘contrary to’ or ‘involv[ing] an\nunreasonable application’ of federal law, a writ of habeas\ncorpus ‘shall not be granted’ and our analysis is at an end.”\n(alteration in original)). Accordingly, the district court did\n\n\n\n 32\n    He did not seek an evidentiary hearing on Claim 26, which raised the\nargument that it would violate the Eighth Amendment to execute him after\na long delay.\n\f92                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nnot err in denying Andrews’s motion for an evidentiary\nhearing.\n\n    In light of the foregoing, we REVERSE the district\ncourt’s grant of relief, DISMISS the Eighth Amendment\nlethal injection claim as unripe, and DENY the petition for a\nCOA of the uncertified claims.\n\n  REVERSED in part, DISMISSED in part, and\nPETITION DENIED in part.\n\n\n\nMURGUIA, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:\n\n   I respectfully dissent. I would affirm the district court’s\norder granting Andrews relief due to ineffective assistance of\ncounsel at the penalty phase of his trial.\n\n    Andrews was convicted of three heinous and appalling\nmurders. His prior crimes were violent and antisocial. But\ndue to defense counsel’s constitutionally inadequate penalty\nphase investigation, the jurors who sentenced Andrews to\ndeath never knew that he was subjected for two years as a\nyoung teenager to brutal, inhumane, and degrading abuse by\nhis state custodians at Mt. Meigs, a segregated reform school\nfor “Negro children” in Alabama. Had counsel presented this\nreadily available mitigating evidence, there is a reasonable\nprobability that at least one juror would have been moved to\nexercise mercy and spare Andrews’s life. Yet the California\nSupreme Court denied relief in a 5-to-2 decision, concluding\nthat counsel’s performance was neither deficient nor\nprejudicial. See In re Andrews, 52 P.3d 656 (Cal. 2002).\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       93\n\n    Fundamentally, it is unconscionable to sentence a man to\ndeath absent consideration of mitigating evidence of this\nmagnitude, particularly where counsel failed to present any\nmeaningful mitigation evidence. Our “ultimate focus of\ninquiry must be on the fundamental fairness of the proceeding\nwhose result is being challenged.” Strickland v. Washington,\n466 U.S. 668, 696 (1984). Under the standard of review\nmandated by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty\nAct (AEDPA), the “pivotal question is whether the state\ncourt’s application of the Strickland standard was\nunreasonable.” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.S. 86, 101\n(2011). The California Supreme Court’s determination that\ncounsel’s performance was neither deficient nor prejudicial\nis not just wrong, it is unreasonable under the clearly\nestablished law of Strickland and its progeny. Thus, even\nunder the deferential standard of the AEDPA, conditional\nsentencing relief is warranted.\n\n                               I\n\n    Andrews was sent to the Alabama Industrial School for\nNegro Children, later known as Mt. Meigs, in the mid-1960s,\nafter stealing a car. He had no prior history of violent crime.\nHe entered the school when he was 14. He left when he was\n16.\n\n    The California judge who conducted the state court\nevidentiary hearing described Mt. Meigs as a “segregated\nbrutal institution near Montgomery, Alabama.” The state\ncourt hearing judge found that the conditions at Mt. Meigs\nwere horrific, and that Andrews was personally subjected to\n“beatings, brutality, inadequate conditions and sexual\npredators.” Due to “his small stature and passive nature,”\nAndrews was “the target for older boys’ depredations.” The\n\f94                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court itself acknowledged that Andrews\npersonally endured “appalling” conditions at Mt. Meigs. See\nAndrews, 52 P.3d. at 660.\n\n     At the state court evidentiary hearing ordered by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, several outside observers\ncorroborated the accounts of abuse at Mt. Meigs. A United\nStates federal judge testified that Mt. Meigs, during the time\nAndrews was there, was a “penal colony” that represented the\n“absolute denial of basic and fundamental human rights to\n[African-American] children.” A former state probation\nofficer described Mt. Meigs as a “slave camp” for children,\nrun by “illiterate overseers” who forced children to work in\nthe fields harvesting vegetables and picking cotton. The\nchildren were “beaten all the time,” sometimes with\nbroomsticks, mop handles, and fan belts, and often severely\nfor minor infractions. Violence was pervasive and sexual\nassaults were common. The state probation officer testified\nthat children committed to Mt. Meigs in the 1960s had no\nchance of rehabilitation and “came out much worse” than\nwhen they entered. The probation officer, who testified\nbefore Congress and state legislatures about juvenile justice\nfacilities around the country, stated that Mt. Meigs was “by\nfar, by far . . . the worst facility” that he had seen.\n\n     Despite being termed a “school,” Mt. Meigs provided\nlittle to no education, counseling, or vocational programs to\nthe children in its custody. See Andrews, 52 P.3d at 677\n(Kennard, J., dissenting). And in 1971, an Alabama district\ncourt ordered extensive reforms at the institution after finding\nthat “corporal punishment was promiscuously employed by\nthe school’s personnel” and agreeing that “[w]hen officials of\na training school have condoned or permitted the frequent and\nindiscriminate use of corporal punishment . . . they have\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        95\n\ndemonstrated the callous indifference to children’s safety\nwhich provides the basis for Eighth Amendment liability” as\ncruel and unusual punishment. Order, Stockton v. Alabama\nIndustrial School for Negro Children, No. 2834-N (N.D. Ala.\nJuly 23, 1971) (adopting proposed findings of fact and\nconclusions of law); see also Crum v. State Training Sch. for\nGirls, 413 F.2d 1348, 1349 (5th Cir. 1969) (ordering the\ndesegregation of Mt. Meigs after finding that it was “inferior\nin every way” to similar schools for white children).\n\n    Andrews was not spared. The state court record\nchronicles in excruciatingly vivid detail the abuse he\npersonally suffered. When Andrews failed to pick enough\ncotton, left the grass too high in the fields, or made a mistake\nin the dining hall, he was whipped with a fan belt or beaten\nwith a stick. The record indicates that Andrews was beaten\nso severely the skin on his thighs would “bust open.” On\nother occasions Andrews and other wards at Mt. Meigs were\nforced to pull down their pants, lie on the ground on their\nstomachs, and place their penises in holes in the earth while\nthey were whipped. The judge who conducted the state court\nevidentiary hearing found the evidence of abuse\n“compelling.”\n\n    The jury that sentenced Andrews to death heard none of\nthis evidence. Yet the California Supreme Court concluded\nthat counsel was not ineffective and, even if ineffective, there\nwas no reasonable probability of a different result at\nsentencing had the jury heard the Mt. Meigs evidence.\n\n    That decision is fundamentally and objectively\nunreasonable. Consideration of a defendant’s life history is\na “constitutionally indispensable part of the process of\ninflicting the penalty of death.” See Eddings v. Oklahoma,\n\f96                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n455 U.S. 104, 112 (1982) (quoting Woodson v. North\nCarolina, 428 U.S. 280, 304 (1976) (plurality opinion)). Yet\nAndrews’s counsel presented almost no mitigating evidence\nat sentencing. The Mt. Meigs evidence is not cumulative to\nany other evidence presented during the trial or penalty phase.\nThe evidence was readily available. Its sympathetic nature is\npatently obvious. And without consideration of the degrading\nabuse that Andrews endured, the jury that sentenced Andrews\nto death could not fairly “gauge his moral culpability.” See\nPorter v. McCollum, 558 U.S. 30, 41 (2009) (per curiam).\nConfidence in the sentencing outcome has been undermined.\nSee Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n     I recognize that our deference to state court decisions is\nat its zenith on federal habeas review. See generally Richter,\n562 U.S. at 104. Under the AEDPA, federal courts are barred\nfrom granting habeas relief as to state court convictions if\njurists of reason could debate the correctness of the state\ncourt’s decision. See id. at 101. “A state court must be\ngranted a deference and latitude that are not in operation\nwhen the case involves review under the Strickland standard\nitself.” Id. Federal habeas relief is warranted, however, if\n“the state court identifies the correct governing legal\nprinciple” from the decisions of the Supreme Court but\nunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the\npetitioner’s case. Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 413\n(2000); see 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). This case meets that\nstringent standard for collateral relief on federal habeas\nreview.\n\n                              II\n\n   Regarding Strickland's first prong, the California Supreme\nCourt unreasonably applied clearly established federal law in\n\f                          ANDREWS V. DAVIS                                97\n\nconcluding that counsel’s performance at the penalty phase\nwas adequate.\n\n    “[C]ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations\nor to make a reasonable decision that makes particular\ninvestigations unnecessary.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691.\nWhen counsel have not fulfilled “their obligation to conduct\na thorough investigation of the defendant’s background,”\ntheir failure to identify and set forth substantial mitigating\nevidence at sentencing cannot be justified as a “tactical\ndecision.” See Williams, 529 U.S. at 396 (citing 1 ABA\nStandards for Criminal Justice 4–4.1, commentary, p. 4–55\n(2d ed. 1980)); see also Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510,\n521–22 (2003).\n\n    Andrews’s trial counsel conducted “virtually no penalty\nphase investigation” and “did not call a single witness at the\npenalty phase.” Andrews, 52 P.3d at 676 (Kennard, J.,\ndissenting). Nor did counsel ask their investigators to do any\nwork on the penalty phase. Indeed, Andrews’s counsel made\nno serious effort to discover mitigating evidence.1\n\n\n 1\n   The majority cites trips that Andrews’s counsel made to Alabama and\nFlorida as evidence that they conducted something other than a cursory\npenalty phase investigation. Majority at 25 n.3. Yet by the lawyers’ own\naccount, their penalty phase investigation consisted of just three activities.\nFirst, the lawyers spent a day in the Mobile courthouse pulling records of\nAndrews’s prior convictions. One of the lawyers initially testified that\ntheir trip to Alabama included three days of investigation. He changed\nthat account after being confronted with evidence that they were in New\nOrleans for most of the time, flying to Mobile on a Saturday and returning\nto New Orleans on the same day. New Orleans had no relation to the\ncase; the dates of the trip “coincided” with Mardi Gras celebrations.\nSecond, only after Andrews’s first trial ended in a hung jury, the lawyers\ninterviewed Andrews’s mother during a layover in the Pensacola airport,\nafter they briefly revisited the Mobile courthouse to examine records of\n\f98                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    The state court judge who presided over the evidentiary\nhearing expressly found that defense counsel could have\nuncovered the Mt. Meigs evidence with “simple persistence”\nand standard investigative techniques. See Andrews, 52 P.3d\nat 680 (Kennard, J., dissenting); see also id. at 681 (noting\nthat routine legal research of public records would have\nrevealed lawsuits involving these Alabama institutions). The\nCalifornia Supreme Court does not dispute that finding. See\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 668.\n\n                                    A\n\n   The California Supreme Court, however, excused\ncounsel’s failure to discover the Mt. Meigs evidence for a\nnumber of unsupported and unsupportable reasons,\nconcluding that counsel’s investigation was constitutionally\nadequate because: (1) Andrews did not want his family\ninvolved; (2) Andrews did not tell counsel about the appalling\nconditions he endured while confined at Mt. Meigs; (3) the\nMt. Meigs evidence could have backfired, for the evidence\n\n\nAndrews’s prior convictions. The interview did not go into detail about\nAndrews’s background, and the lawyers did not inquire about the names\nor contact information of relatives or anybody else who knew Andrews\nand could speak to his history. Third, the lawyers asserted that they spent\nsome time in Mobile during one of their two trips unsuccessfully\n“look[ing] for evidence of Jesse’s character and good deeds.” The\nlawyers, however, did not interview a single person, contact any of\nAndrews’s family or friends, or look into Andrews’s institutional history.\nSimilarly, the two defense investigators testified that their efforts were\nlimited to the guilt phase, and that neither of Andrews’s attorneys asked\nthem to do any investigation into Andrews’s background for a possible\npenalty phase. The California Supreme Court’s referee characterized\ncounsel’s “actual efforts” to gather mitigating evidence for the penalty\nphase as “limited,” a characterization which in light of this record is\nunderstated, if not overly generous.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                         99\n\nwould have come primarily from prisoners; (4) counsel’s\nlimited investigation was reasonable because counsel had a\nreasonable strategy at the penalty phase; and (5) the Mt.\nMeigs evidence could have opened the door to more evidence\nregarding Andrews’s prior acts of violence. Not one of these\nrationales withstands scrutiny or excuses counsel’s failure to\nperform a basic investigation into his client’s life history.\n\n    (1) Andrews’s Refusal to Involve his Family.\n\n    The California Supreme Court found counsel’s limited\ninvestigation adequate partly because Andrews refused to\ninvolve his family at the penalty phase. See Andrews, 52 P.3d\nat 668. The California Supreme Court reasoned as follows:\n“Although the referee found that counsel could have\ndiscovered the mitigating evidence presented at the reference\nhearing with ‘simple persistence,’ it is equally clear petitioner\ninsisted they not involve his family. ‘As we have repeatedly\nexplained, an attorney representing a defendant at the penalty\nphase of a capital case is not required to present potentially\nmitigating evidence over the defendant’s objections. . . .’” Id.\n(quoting People v. Kirkpatrick, 874 P.2d 248 (Cal. 1994)).\n\n    The California Supreme Court is correct that Andrews did\nnot want his family involved. And it is also correct that the\n“reasonableness of counsel’s actions may be determined or\nsubstantially influenced by the defendant’s own statements or\nactions.” See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691. However,\nexcusing counsel’s failure to present the Mt. Meigs evidence\nbased upon Andrews’s refusal to involve his family is\nunreasonable on its face for a simple reason: presenting the\nMt. Meigs evidence would not have required any\ninvolvement by Andrews’s family. Instead, as accounted\nherein, defense counsel could have introduced the Mt. Meigs\n\f100                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nevidence by admitting public records and by presenting the\ntestimony of numerous experts and respected observers.\n\n    The state court’s rationale is also unreasonable in light of\nthe record before it. Andrews’s trial attorney testified at the\nstate court evidentiary hearing that Andrews imposed no\nlimitations on a penalty phase investigation into his\nbackground, apart from not wanting to have his family testify.\nThe state court hearing judge found no obstacle to calling\nwitnesses who were not members of Andrews’s family.\n\n    It was therefore unreasonable for the California Supreme\nCourt to excuse counsel’s failure to present the Mt. Meigs\nevidence based upon Andrews’s refusal to involve his family.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2) (stating that federal habeas relief\nis warranted if the state court decision was based upon an\nunreasonable determination of facts in light of the evidence\npresented in the state court proceeding); cf. Porter, 558 U.S.\nat 40 (stating that counsel’s decision not to investigate must\nreflect a “reasonable professional judgment,” even when the\nclient is “fatalistic or uncooperative”).\n\n    (2) Andrews’s Failure to Tell Counsel About His Time\n        at Mt. Meigs\n\n    The California Supreme Court also faulted Andrews for\nnot telling trial counsel about the appalling conditions he\nendured while at Mt. Meigs. See Andrews, 52 P.3d at 668\n(“While counsel were aware petitioner had been incarcerated\nin the Alabama prison system, he did not inform them of the\nconditions he endured thereby alerting them to the need for\nfurther investigation of possible mitigation.”). However, no\nevidence in the record suggests that counsel ever asked\nAndrews any questions that would have elicited that history.\n\f                          ANDREWS V. DAVIS                                101\n\nSee Andrews, 52 P.3d at 681 (Kennard, J., dissenting) (stating\nAndrews “did not withhold that information. His attorneys\nnever raised the subject.”).2 Nor is there any evidence that\nAndrews, “described by one of his trial attorneys as ‘very\ncooperative,’ would have refused to discuss his reform school\nand prison experiences in Alabama had he been asked about\nthem.” Id.\n\n    Given those facts, the California Supreme Court was\nunreasonable in placing the burden on Andrews to\ncomprehend and offer mitigation theories at the penalty phase\nof his own trial. Under clearly established Supreme Court\nlaw, legal strategy is the duty and domain of learned counsel;\nwhile a defendant “has the ultimate authority to make certain\nfundamental decisions regarding the case, as to whether to\nplead guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or\ntake an appeal,” legal strategy decisions are matters of\nprofessional judgment that fall within counsel’s domain and\nare the responsibility of counsel. See Jones v. Barnes,\n463 U.S. 745, 751 (1983). And, as accounted above, the most\nbasic of investigations into Andrews’s life history would have\nuncovered the evidence of the abuse he suffered. Cf.\n\n\n 2\n   The majority generally and repeatedly accuses the dissent of engaging\nin a de novo review when evaluating whether the California Supreme\nCourt’s determinations were reasonable. Yet deference does not\neviscerate our duty to examine and evaluate the record to determine the\nreasonableness of the state court’s conclusions. Further, in engaging in\nthat inquiry, it is entirely proper to look to a state court dissenting opinion\nthat may shed light on whether the state court majority’s determinations\nwere reasonable or unreasonable in light of the record as a whole. Facts\non federal habeas review are not limited to only the facts stated in the state\nsupreme court’s majority opinion. Cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2) (stating that\nfederal habeas relief is warranted if the state court decision “was based on\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\npresented”).\n\f102                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 395 (finding counsel deficient for\nfailing to review defendant’s juvenile records that “would\nhave uncovered extensive records graphically describing\n[defendant’s] nightmarish childhood”).\n\n     (3) The Reliance on Prisoners to Present the Mt.\n         Meigs Evidence\n\n    The California Supreme Court further concluded it was\nreasonable for counsel not to present the Mt. Meigs evidence\nbecause such evidence could have backfired as it “would\ncome primarily from the testimony of petitioner’s fellow\nprisoners, many of whom were hardened criminals with\nserious felony records.” See Andrews, 52 P.3d at 668–69.3\n\n    However, the Mt. Meigs evidence was not dependent\nupon testimony from prisoners. At Andrews’s state court\nevidentiary hearing, “a federal district judge, a priest, a\ncollege dean, a clinical psychologist, a longtime prison\ndoctor, and the regional director of the Federal Bureau of\nDetention, all . . . gave powerfully effective testimony about\nthe shocking conditions at” Mt. Meigs. Andrews, 52 P.3d at\n681 (Kennard, J., dissenting); e.g., id. at 677 (discussing\n\n 3\n   The California Supreme Court’s opinion often conflates the evidence\nof abuse that Andrews suffered as a youth at Mt. Meigs with other\npotential mitigating evidence he could have introduced regarding the\nabuse he sustained as an adult in the Alabama prison system. Because\ncounsel’s failure to investigate and introduce the Mt. Meigs evidence,\nstanding alone, plainly rendered counsel’s performance deficient, I only\naddress the Mt. Meigs evidence. However, the dissent in the California\nSupreme Court provides an accurate and thorough accounting of the\nadditional mitigating evidence that counsel could have introduced. See\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 676–80 (Kennard, J., dissenting) (describing\nAndrews’s time in Alabama prisons that were later found to violate the\nEighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment).\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      103\n\ntestimony of federal district court judge Ira Dement, who\nreferred to Mt. Meigs as a “penal colony for children”).\n\n    In light of the state court record, it therefore was\nunreasonable for the California Supreme Court to excuse\ncounsel’s failure to present the Mt. Meigs evidence on the\nbasis that such evidence would have primarily depended upon\nthe testimony of prisoners. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2); see\nalso Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 528 (stating that “partial reliance on\nan erroneous factual finding” can show “the unreasonableness\nof the state court’s decision.”).\n\n   (4) Counsel’s Penalty Strategy\n\n    The California Supreme Court expressly acknowledged\nthat the record at the state court evidentiary hearing suggested\nthat counsel could have conducted a more thorough\ninvestigation into Andrews’s background. See Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 669. However, the California Supreme Court\nultimately concluded that counsel’s penalty phase\nperformance was adequate because counsel had decided upon\na reasonable strategy, one that apparently did not involve or\nrequire any meaningful preliminary investigation into\nAndrews’s social history. According to the California\nSupreme Court, counsel presented a “reasonable case for\nsparing petitioner’s life” by (1) portraying Andrews “as a\nfollower rather than as violently antisocial”; and (2) arguing\na death sentence was not warranted because “others who had\ncommitted more heinous multiple murders” were not\nsentenced to death and Andrews’s co-defendant Sanders had\nreceived a lighter sentence. See id.\n\n   The California Supreme Court’s decision is unreasonable\nbecause neither strategy was supported by the evidence\n\f104                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\npresented at trial. Further, the state court’s decision is\nunreasonable because it ignores counsel’s “duty to make\nreasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision\nthat makes particular investigations unnecessary.”\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 691.\n\n    The evidence as to the crimes of conviction which\nrendered Andrews death eligible belied the depiction of\nAndrews as a follower, rendering counsel’s penalty phase\npitch to the jury contrary to the record, hollow, and false. See\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 682 (Kennard, J., dissenting) (“[T]hat\nwas a disastrous strategy, one no reasonably competent\nattorney would have used”). Indeed, “the only evidence\nbefore the jury was that petitioner was the instigator rather\nthan a follower.” Id. The “evidence showed that [Andrews]\nwas the leader and the perpetrator of the crimes while Sanders\nwas the follower; thus, jurors were not likely to be troubled\nby Sanders’s lighter sentence.” Id.\n\n    Given the evidence at trial, no reasonable argument can\nbe made that counsel’s strategy to depict Andrews as a\nfollower was reasonable, particularly when it was\nunsupported by a basic investigation into Andrews’s\nbackground to determine what other mitigating evidence was\navailable. See Bobby v. Van Hook, 130 S.Ct. 13, 17 (2009)\n(stating that counsel must make “objectively reasonable\nchoices”) (quoting Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 479\n(2000)); see Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 527 (“Strickland does not\nestablish that a cursory investigation automatically justifies\na tactical decision with respect to sentencing strategy.”).\n\n    The California Supreme Court cited Burger v. Kemp,\n483 U.S. 776 (1987), as supporting the proposition that it is\nreasonable to forego mitigating evidence when it would open\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                     105\n\nthe door to rebuttal evidence which would contradict\ncounsel’s strategy of portraying defendant as the follower.\nSee Andrews, 52 P.3d at 673 (citing Burger, 483 U.S. at 793).\nThe California Supreme Court’s reliance on Burger is\nunreasonable for two reasons. First, in Burger, defense\ncounsel performed a robust initial mitigation investigation\nand spoke to a family member, a friend, and a psychologist to\nlearn about his client’s background. See Burger, 483 U.S. at\n790–91. Based upon what Burger’s counsel learned, counsel\ndecided against pursuing a mitigation case relying on that\nbackground, id. at 791, even though it turned out that further\ninvestigation would have produced additional evidence that\ndefendant had “an exceptionally unhappy and unstable\nchildhood.” Id. at 789. As the Supreme Court concluded,\ncounsel’s initial investigation led him to make the\n“reasonable decision that his client’s interest would not be\nserved by presenting this type of [mitigating] evidence.” Id.\nat 791. The facts of this case are very different. Unlike\nBurger’s defense counsel, Andrews’s attorneys never\nperformed any meaningful initial investigation into their\nclient’s background. Absent such an investigation, the\nlawyers cannot be said to have made informed strategic\nchoices about how to proceed in a possible penalty phase of\ntrial.\n\n    Second and relatedly, in Burger, counsel’s depiction of\nhis client as a follower was a reasonable strategy for it was\nsupported by the record. See Burger, 483 U.S. at 779 (noting\nprimary evidence at trial showed that Burger’s co-defendant\nStevens “was primarily responsible for the plan to kidnap the\n[victim], the physical abuse of the victim, and the decision to\nkill him”). In contrast, the evidence at Andrews’s trial\nplainly showed that Andrews was not a follower, but the main\ncriminal actor. Thus, the California Supreme Court’s\n\f106                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nstatement that “we reach the same conclusion on comparable\nfacts,” see Andrews, 52 P.3d at 673, is wrong for the facts in\nBurger are not comparable. The California Supreme Court’s\nreliance on Burger is unreasonable.\n\n    The California Supreme Court also unreasonably applied\nSupreme Court law when it cited Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685\n(2002), to support its conclusion that counsel reasonably\ndecided not to present evidence of Andrews’s background.\nSee Andrews, 52 P.3d at 673 (citing Cone, 535 U.S. at\n699–700). Before noting that defense counsel saw the\nneighborhood Andrews grew up in and considered it\nunimpressive because it was comparable to counsel’s own,\nthe California Supreme Court cited Cone for the proposition\nthat counsel may reasonably decide not to present background\nevidence when testimony about a defendant’s “normal youth”\nmight, in the eyes of the jury, be perceived negatively and cut\nthe other way. See id. However, all reasonable jurists would\nagree that the years Andrews spent at Mt. Meigs were the\nantithesis of a “normal youth.” The California Supreme\nCourt’s invocation of Cone, while simultaneously ignoring\nthat Andrews’s “youth” included his experience at Mt. Meigs,\nwas an objectively unreasonable application of Supreme\nCourt law. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 526–27 (observing that\nthe “strategic decision” offered “to justify counsel’s limited\npursuit of mitigating evidence resembles . . . a post hoc\nrationalization of counsel’s conduct.”); cf. Porter, 558 U.S.\nat 43 (concluding that state supreme court was “unreasonable\nto discount to irrelevance the evidence of Porter’s abusive\nchildhood”).\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                               107\n\n     (5) Opening the Door to Andrews’s Prior Acts of\n         Violence.\n\n    Finally, the California Supreme Court concluded\ncounsel’s failure to present the Mt. Meigs evidence, among\nother mitigation evidence, was reasonable because such\nevidence could have opened the door to more evidence\nregarding Andrews’s prior acts of violence. See Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 669 (stating that by not introducing the evidence,\ncounsel “foreclosed the introduction of substantial\naggravating evidence in rebuttal or on cross-examination that\ncould have undermined the defense by depicting petitioner as\naggressive and desensitized to violence”). The California\nSupreme Court’s decision on this point is unreasonable for at\nleast two reasons.\n\n    One, the prosecutor from Andrews’s trial, who in the\ninterim had become a superior court judge, “testified that if\nthe defense had presented evidence of the Alabama prison\nconditions he probably would not have called rebuttal\nwitnesses to give details about petitioner’s Alabama crimes.”\nSee Andrews, 52 P.3d at 682 (Kennard, J., dissenting).4\n\n\n\n\n 4\n   It is also possible, if not likely, that a California court would not have\nadmitted evidence of prior offenses to rebut the mitigating evidence of\nchildhood abuse that Andrews suffered at Mt. Meigs. Cf. In re Lucas,\n94 P.3d 477, 510 (Cal. 2004) (concluding, in a unanimous decision, that\nmitigating evidence showing “that a defendant suffered abuse in childhood\ngenerally does not open the door to evidence of [a] defendant’s prior\ncrimes or other misconduct”).\n\f108                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    Two, even if the prosecutor had rebutted with more\nevidence regarding Andrews’s prior violent crimes,5 the jury\nalready knew based upon Andrews’s heinous crimes of\nconviction that he was “aggressive and desensitized to\nviolence.” The jury also knew, by stipulation, of Andrews’s\nprior convictions for murder in 1967, armed robbery in 1968,\nescape in 1969, and robbery in 1977 which the prosecution\nintroduced as aggravating factors at the penalty phase.6 More\nevidence regarding Andrews’s prior convictions would have\nreinforced what the jury already knew, namely that Andrews\ncommitted heinous crimes and clearly was “aggressive and\ndesensitized to violence.”\n\n    The clearly established law of Strickland itself supports\nthe conclusion that the California Supreme Court’s decision\nwas unreasonable. In Strickland, it was reasonable for\ncounsel not to present mitigating evidence that “would barely\nhave altered the sentencing profile” and could have opened\nthe door to prior convictions which counsel had successfully\nmoved to exclude. 466 U.S. at 699–700. So too in Darden\n\n\n  5\n   The majority accurately observes that the referee and the California\nSupreme Court majority concluded that if trial counsel had presented the\nMt. Meigs evidence, the prosecutor would have introduced rebuttal\nevidence. Majority at 30–31 n.8. But that finding fails to take into\naccount the plain statement by the former prosecutor—later a state court\njudge—that he probably would not have responded with rebuttal evidence.\nThe referee and California Supreme Court decided not to take the former\nprosecutor at his word and instead speculated about what the prosecutor\nwould have done. That decision was unreasonable. Cf. 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(2).\n 6\n   By stipulation, the jury knew that Andrews’s 1967 murder conviction\nwas for felony murder stemming from an incident when Andrews, then 16,\nand an accomplice robbed a grocery store and the accomplice (not\nAndrews) shot and killed a store clerk during the robbery.\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      109\n\nv. Wainwright, where counsel’s decision to present an\nalternate strategy at sentencing was reasonable because\nevidence regarding defendant’s background could have\nopened the door to his prior convictions that had not\npreviously been admitted in evidence. See 477 U.S. 168, 186\n(1986).\n\n    In contrast, in cases where a defendant’s prior criminal\nhistory is known to the jury, counsel performs unreasonably\nin not presenting a range of persuasive mitigating evidence\nabout the defendant’s background that “no other source had\nopened up.” See Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 383, 390\n(2005) (finding counsel ineffective when counsel knew the\nprosecution would introduce at the penalty phase defendant’s\n“significant history” of prior violent crimes, but counsel\nnevertheless failed to review the readily available prior\nconviction file and present mitigation evidence therefrom);\nsee also Williams, 529 U.S. at 368–69, 395 (finding counsel’s\nperformance deficient when the jury knew of Williams’s\nextensive violent criminal history, and counsel failed to\nreview juvenile records that would have uncovered graphic\nmitigating evidence of Williams’s “nightmarish childhood”).\nAt a minimum, counsel has a duty to conduct the necessary\ninvestigation into his client’s background to learn the range\nof mitigating evidence available. See Williams, 529 U.S. at\n395–96.\n\n                              B\n\n    In sum, there was no conceivable tactical reason either to\nforego the investigation into Andrews’s background or to\nforego the presentation of the compelling Mt. Meigs\nevidence. Any competent attorney would have concluded\nthat the Mt. Meigs evidence was the only evidence in this\n\f110                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ncase that carried a substantial probability of a different\nsentence. That evidence is critical precisely because it\nprovides the jury with a reason to extend mercy despite\nAndrews’s heinous crimes. As such, any competent attorney\nwould have presented the evidence, argued that the abuse\nAndrews suffered as a youth at the hands of his state\ncustodians explains why he is inured to violence, and urged\nthe jurors to spare Andrews’s life on that ground.7\n\n    The California Supreme Court recognized that the United\nStates Supreme Court held in Williams that habeas relief was\nwarranted when counsel failed at the penalty phase to present\nto the jury evidence of petitioner’s “nightmarish childhood,”\nmodel behavior while imprisoned, and borderline retardation.\nSee Andrews, 52 P.3d at 674. The California Supreme Court,\nhowever, distinguished Williams because, in that case,\ncounsel’s investigation was “essentially nonexistent due to an\nincorrect understanding of the law.” See id. (citing Williams,\n529 U.S. at 395–96). The California Supreme Court is\ncorrect that in Williams, counsel’s failure to investigate was\nbased at least in part upon his incorrect understanding of the\nlaw. But surely no reasonable jurist would read Williams as\nholding that a virtually nonexistent penalty phase\ninvestigation is reasonable so long as it is not based upon a\nmisunderstanding of the law. Indeed, the United States\n\n\n  7\n    The California Supreme Court suggested there was “no compelling\nconnection” between the un-presented mitigating evidence and the crimes\nAndrews committed. Andrews, 52 P.3d at 672 (quoting In re Ross,\n892 P.2d 1287, 1305 (Cal. 1995)). To the extent the California Supreme\nCourt suggested a causal nexus is required between mitigating evidence\nand defendant’s crimes, the California Supreme Court’s decision was\ncontrary to Supreme Court law. See Skipper v. South Carolina, 476 U.S.\n1, 4 (1986) (noting “well-established” principle that any relevant\nmitigating evidence may be considered).\n\f                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       111\n\nSupreme Court does not read Williams so narrowly. In\nWiggins, the Supreme Court underscored that in Williams it\nheld the “failure to uncover and present voluminous\nmitigating evidence at sentencing could not be justified as a\ntactical decision . . . because counsel had not ‘fulfill[ed] their\nobligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the\ndefendant's background.’” See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 522\n(quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 396).\n\n    The duty to conduct a thorough investigation of a capital\ndefendant’s background is imposed on counsel to prevent this\nvery circumstance: a man sentenced to death without\nconsideration of non-cumulative, readily available personal\nhistory evidence of compelling mitigating value. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court unreasonably applied clearly\nestablished federal law when it concluded that defense\ncounsel’s performance was constitutionally adequate in this\ncase.\n\n                               III\n\n    Under Strickland’s second prong, the California Supreme\nCourt majority concluded that even if Andrews’s counsel\nperformed inadequately, Andrews suffered no prejudice from\nthe omission of the Mt. Meigs evidence at sentencing. That\nconclusion too is based upon an objectively unreasonable\napplication of Strickland and its progeny.\n\n    Under Strickland, a capital defendant suffers prejudice\nfrom counsel’s deficient performance when “there is a\nreasonable probability that, absent the errors [of counsel], the\nsentencer . . . would have concluded that the balance of\naggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant\ndeath.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695. As Strickland clarified,\n\f112                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n“[a] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome,” not a probability that\nthe result “more likely than not” would have been different.\nId. at 693–94. For a state court considering a habeas petition\nasserting ineffective assistance of counsel, the inquiry is\nstraightforward: counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced\nthe petitioner if he can show “a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror” would have recommended a sentence of life\ninstead of death. Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 537. For a federal\ncourt reviewing a habeas petition filed after the AEDPA’s\npassage, the determinative question is whether the state\ncourt’s finding that petitioner was not prejudiced was not just\nerror, but “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law as determined\nby the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(1); see Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.S. 170, 181\n(2011).\n\n    In this case, the California Supreme Court concluded\nthere was no reasonable probability of a life sentence even if\ncounsel had presented the mitigating evidence regarding\nAndrews’s background. Unlike the majority, I would hold\nthat such a conclusion constitutes an unreasonable application\nof federal law that was clearly established at the time of the\nstate court’s decision.\n\n                              A\n\n    Consideration of the defendant’s life history is a\n“constitutionally indispensable part of the process of\ninflicting the penalty of death.” Eddings, 455 U.S. at 112.\nThe abuse that Andrews suffered at Mt. Meigs epitomizes the\n“kind of troubled history” that the Supreme Court repeatedly\nhas “declared relevant to assessing a defendant’s moral\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      113\n\nculpability.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535; see also id. at 535–36\n(holding a different sentencing outcome was reasonably\nprobable had defense counsel presented evidence that\nWiggins suffered early privation and abuse, as well as\nphysical torment, sexual molestation, and repeated rape in\nfoster care). Such evidence is “relevant because of the belief,\nlong held by this society, that defendants who commit\ncriminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged\nbackground, or to emotional and mental problems, may be\nless culpable than defendants who have no such excuse.”\nBoyde v. California, 494 U.S. 370, 382 (1990) (internal\nquotations marks omitted).\n\n    Without consideration of the compelling and readily\navailable Mt. Meigs evidence, Andrews’s moral culpability\ncould not be fairly gauged at sentencing. See Porter,\n558 U.S. at 41. Indeed, the “benchmark” for assessing an\nineffective assistance claim is “whether counsel’s conduct so\nundermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process\nthat the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just\nresult.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 686. Here, counsel’s failure\nto present the evidence of severe abuse that Andrews\nsuffered, combined with counsel’s failure to present any\nsubstantial mitigation case at sentencing, deprived Andrews\nof a fair sentencing proceeding and renders his death sentence\n“unreliable.” See id. at 700. At bottom, it was unreasonable\nfor the California Supreme Court to conclude that if the jury\nhad heard the Mt. Meigs evidence, there is no reasonable\nprobability that even one juror would have recommended a\nsentence of life instead of death.\n\n    The majority disagrees and observes that the Supreme\nCourt “has found a reasonable probability of a different\noutcome when scant and weak aggravating evidence could\n\f114                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nhave been presented in rebuttal to strongly mitigating\nevidence.” Majority at 47–47 (citing Wiggins, 539 U.S. at\n534–36, 537–38). Yet the Supreme Court has also found a\nreasonable probability of a different outcome when\naggravating evidence is substantial and mitigating evidence\nis compelling. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 398; Porter,\n558 U.S. at 40–44. Indeed, at the time of the California\nSupreme Court’s decision in this case, no decision by the\nUnited States Supreme Court had excused a failure to present\na compelling mitigation case where one was available.\n\n     As the majority recognizes, Williams and Porter are\nparticularly instructive. In Williams, the Supreme Court held\nthere was a reasonable probability of a different result at\nsentencing if counsel had presented evidence either of\ndefendant’s “nightmarish childhood” or his diminished\nintellectual ability. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 398. Notably,\nunlike in this case, Williams’s counsel actually presented\nmitigating evidence, including testimony from two neighbors\nand Williams’s mother, and “a taped excerpt of a statement\nby a psychiatrist.” See id. at 369. Contrary to the majority’s\ndescription of the case, the aggravating factors in Williams\nwere severe. Two prosecution expert witnesses testified at\nsentencing “that there was a ‘high probability’ that Williams\nwould pose a serious continuing threat to society.” See id. at\n368–69. And the jury heard evidence that in the months after\nthe murder for which Williams was sentenced to death,\n“Williams savagely beat an elderly woman, stole two cars, set\nfire to a home, stabbed a man during a robbery, set fire to the\ncity jail, and confessed to having strong urges to choke other\ninmates and to break a fellow prisoner’s jaw.” Id. at 418\n(Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(quoting Williams v. Taylor, 163 F.3d 860, 868 (4th Cir.\n1998), rev’d, 529 U.S. 362 (2000)); see id. at 368 (providing\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       115\n\nthe majority’s description of the aggravating evidence,\nincluding that Williams: had committed “two separate violent\nassaults on elderly victims,” specifically setting a fire outside\none elderly victim’s house before attacking and robbing him,\nand leaving the other elderly victim, a woman, in a\n“vegetative state”; was convicted of arson for the fire he set\nin the jail while awaiting trial; and had prior convictions for\narmed robbery, burglary, and grand larceny).\n\n    Despite these strong aggravating factors, the Supreme\nCourt held that Williams was prejudiced by his counsel’s\nfailure to introduce the undiscovered mitigation evidence.\nImportantly for this case, the Court stated that the evidence\nregarding Williams’s “nightmarish childhood” would have\nbeen enough, standing alone, to sustain a finding of prejudice.\nAs the Court expressly held, “the graphic description of\nWilliams’ childhood, filled with abuse and privation, or the\nreality that he was ‘borderline mentally retarded,’ might well\nhave influenced the jury’s appraisal of his moral culpability.”\nSee id. at 398 (emphasis added).\n\n    Williams plainly supports the conclusion that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court unreasonably applied clearly\nestablished federal law in concluding that Andrews was not\nprejudiced by his counsel’s failure to introduce evidence of\nthe extreme brutality that Andrews suffered as a youth. The\ntotal evidence in aggravation, that which was admitted and\nthat which may have come in as rebuttal evidence concerning\nAndrews’s prior violent crimes (which the prosecutor\ntestified at the state court hearing he probably would not have\nintroduced), was certainly no greater than the aggravating\nevidence in Williams. Similar to Williams, the overlooked\nmitigating evidence in Andrews’s case includes severe and\nsustained physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.\n\f116                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nAndrews’s overlooked mitigating evidence is made even\nstronger by the fact that the abuse at issue was inflicted in\nlarge part at the hands of his state custodians and was broadly\ncorroborated by respected authorities, as previously\naccounted.8\n\n    The Supreme Court’s decision in Porter also\ndemonstrates the unreasonableness of the California Supreme\nCourt’s conclusion that Andrews was not prejudiced.\nAlthough the Supreme Court decided Porter after the\nCalifornia Supreme Court denied Andrews’s ineffective\nassistance claim, Porter is still relevant to assessing prejudice\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).9 See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 522\n\n 8\n   The Supreme Court later stated that Williams offers “no guidance with\nrespect to whether a state court has unreasonably determined that\nprejudice is lacking” because AEDPA deference was not applied to the\nStrickland prejudice question in Williams. See Cullen v. Pinholster,\n131 S.Ct. 1388, 1410–11 (2011) (citing Williams, 529 U.S. at 395–97); but\nsee Williams, 529 U.S. at 415–16 (O’Connor, J., concurring) (“I also agree\nwith the Court that, to the extent the Virginia Supreme Court did apply\nStrickland, its application was unreasonable”). In any event, Williams was\ndecided two years before the California Supreme Court denied Andrews’s\nhabeas petition. Thus, at the time the California Supreme Court decided\nAndrews’s ineffective assistance claim, Williams was highly relevant for\ndetermining what omitted mitigating evidence is prejudicial under\nStrickland. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 398 (“[T]he graphic description of\nWilliams’ childhood, filled with abuse and privation, or the reality that he\nwas ‘borderline mentally retarded,’ might well have influenced the jury’s\nappraisal of his moral culpability.”); see also id. at 415 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (concluding that Williams was prejudiced by counsel’s failure\nto present substantial mitigating evidence, including evidence of his\n“nightmarish childhood,” and that the Virginia Supreme Court was\nunreasonable in concluding otherwise).\n     9\n    The majority acknowledges that Porter is relevant to determining\nwhether the California Supreme Court unreasonably applied Strickland.\nMajority at 59 (“Although Porter was decided years after the California\n\f                          ANDREWS V. DAVIS                               117\n\n(approving reliance on Supreme Court opinions issued after\nthe state court’s decision, when the merits of the claim were\ngoverned by the holdings of Strickland).\n\n    In Porter, due to counsel’s failure to adequately\ninvestigate Porter’s background, the jury that sentenced him\nto death never knew that he had been abused as a child and\nwas a decorated Korean War veteran suffering from post-\ntraumatic stress. See Porter, 558 U.S. at 40–44. The\nSupreme Court held that the Florida Supreme Court was\nunreasonable in concluding that Porter had not been\nprejudiced at sentencing by the omission of this key personal\nhistory evidence. The Supreme Court concluded that without\nthat evidence, the sentencer was unable to “accurately gauge”\nthe defendant’s “moral culpability” and habeas relief was\nwarranted because confidence in the sentencing outcome had\nbeen undermined. See id. at 41; see also Rompilla, 545 U.S.\nat 393 (stating that the relevant test is not whether the jury,\nhad it heard the omitted mitigating evidence, could still have\nreturned a verdict of death).10\n\n\nSupreme Court’s opinion in this case, we give its prejudice analysis\ncareful consideration, because Porter considered prejudice under AEDPA,\nand therefore provides direction for determining what constitutes an\nunreasonable application of the prejudice prong of Strickland under\nAEDPA.”).\n  10\n     The majority criticizes my reference to Rompilla, insisting Rompilla\n“do[es] not provide any guidance on the issue before us, whether a state\ncourt’s determination that counsel’s deficiency was not prejudicial was an\nunreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent.”\nMajority at 65 n.24. But I cite Rompilla for the well-established principle\nthat the Strickland test for prejudice does not turn on whether the jury still\ncould have returned a death sentence even if it had heard the mitigating\nevidence. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694 (“The defendant must show that\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\n\f118                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n     As in Williams, the Supreme Court in Porter affirmed that\na strong case in aggravation does not preclude the conclusion\nthat a state court was unreasonable in denying habeas relief.\nPorter stood convicted of two murders and faced\nconsiderable evidence of premeditation, but the Supreme\nCourt nonetheless held it was objectively unreasonable for the\nFlorida Supreme Court to conclude that Porter had not been\nprejudiced at sentencing by the omission of the mitigating\nevidence. Porter, 558 U.S. at 31. The same conclusion\napplies in Andrews’s case. Despite strong aggravating\nevidence, there is a reasonable probability of a different result\nat sentencing if the jury had heard the powerful evidence of\nthe abuse Andrews suffered as a youth. It is unreasonable to\nconclude otherwise.\n\n    The majority disagrees. Relying on the Supreme Court’s\nopinion in Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U.S. 19 (2002), decided\nafter the California Supreme Court’s decision in this case, the\nmajority insists it was not unreasonable to hold that Andrews\nsuffered no prejudice. Majority at 63–64. The majority is\nmistaken. The balance of mitigating and aggravating factors\nin Visciotti was dramatically different from the balance in\nAndrews. In Visciotti, the potential mitigating evidence at\nissue was expert testimony addressing the psychological\nabuse that Visciotti suffered due to being raised in a\ndysfunctional family. See Visciotti, 537 U.S. at 26. Visciotti\ninvolved no allegations of physical or sexual abuse, and the\npsychological abuse failed to approach what Andrews\nexperienced at Mt. Meigs. The aggravating evidence in\n\n\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence\nin the outcome.”). The test is not whether counsel’s inadequate\nperformance “more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.” See\nid. at 693.\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      119\n\nVisciotti included a prior offense in which Visciotti stabbed\n“a pregnant woman as she lay in bed trying to protect her\nunborn baby.” See id. Given the strong evidence in\naggravation and the relatively weak mitigating evidence, the\nSupreme Court concluded it was not unreasonable for the\nCalifornia Supreme Court to conclude that Visciotti was not\nprejudiced by counsel’s failure to introduce the dysfunctional\nfamily evidence. Id. at 26–27. In contrast, the facts of\nAndrews’s case present a very different balance of factors\nand compel a different result. The majority’s contention that\nthe Mt. Meigs evidence at most carries only the “mere\npossibility of a different outcome,” Majority at 66, grossly\nunderestimates the mitigating force of that evidence. The Mt.\nMeigs mitigating evidence in Andrews is extraordinarily\nstrong. The majority’s reliance on Visciotti is unfounded.\n\n                              B\n\n    The California Supreme Court also reasoned that\nAndrews was not prejudiced because the Mt. Meigs evidence,\nin addition to evidence of abuse Andrews suffered as an adult\nin the Alabama prison system, is “not conclusively and\nunambiguously mitigating” but “could equally have proved\na double-edged sword.” See Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670–71.\nAccording to the California Supreme Court, “[r]ather than\nengendering sympathy” such evidence “could well have\nreinforced an impression of him as a person who had become\ndesensitized and inured to violence and disrespect for the\nlaw” or could have confirmed Andrews had “an antisocial\npersonality.” See id. at 671. That conclusion is unreasonable.\n\n   The jury already knew from Andrews’s heinous crimes of\nconviction and from the stipulated prior convictions that\nAndrews was antisocial and “had become desensitized and\n\f120                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ninured to violence and disrespect for the law.” No person\nconsidering Andrews’s crimes of conviction would conclude\notherwise. But the jurors knew absolutely nothing about\nAndrews’s past that might explain the person he had become\nand provide a basis for the exercise of mercy.\n\n     The severe and sustained abuse that Andrews suffered at\nMt. Meigs provides such evidence. The California Supreme\nCourt agreed the evidence presented at the state court hearing\n“leaves no doubt” Andrews “endured horrifically demeaning\nand degrading circumstances.” See Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670.\nYet the jury that sentenced Andrews to death knew nothing\nabout those circumstances. Had the jury heard that for two\nyears as a teenager Andrews was subjected to brutal,\ninhumane, and degrading abuse by his state custodians at a\nsegregated reform school for African-American children in\nAlabama in the 1960s, there is a reasonable probability that\nat least one juror would have been swayed to exercise mercy\nand spare Andrews’s life. There is “too much mitigating\nevidence that was not presented to now be ignored.” Porter,\n558 U.S. at 44 (internal quotation marks omitted). No\nreasonable person would conclude otherwise.\n\n    The prejudice to Andrews caused by the omission of the\nMt. Meigs evidence at sentencing is compounded by the fact\nthat counsel presented no sympathetic mitigating evidence at\nAndrews’s sentencing. Indeed, at the penalty phase of\nAndrews’s trial, counsel called no witnesses and offered no\nstatements from psychologists, family, or friends. In short,\ndefense counsel presented almost nothing to counter the\nprosecution’s portrayal of their client. The clearly established\nlaw of Strickland recognizes that some errors by counsel will\nhave “pervasive effect . . . altering the entire evidentiary\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      121\n\npicture.” See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695–96. Andrews is\nsuch a case.\n\n    It is unconscionable that Andrews should be sentenced to\ndeath without consideration of the egregious abuse that he\nsuffered at Mt. Meigs. Had counsel presented the Mt. Meigs\nevidence at sentencing, it is reasonably probable that at least\none juror would have been moved to exercise mercy and\nspare Andrews’s life. It is objectively unreasonable, and a\nlegal fiction, to conclude otherwise.\n\n                              IV\n\n   The district court’s conditional grant of sentencing relief\nshould be affirmed. I respectfully dissent.\n\f",

People v. Andrews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1168192\"><a href=\"/opinion/1168192/people-v-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">776</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">285</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 288 (Cal.\n1989). The murder victims were Preston Wheeler, who lived\nin the apartment, Patrice Brandon, and Ronald Chism. Id.\nThe California Supreme Court described the murder scene as\nfollows:\n\n       Wheeler had been stabbed in the chest six\n       times and shot in the neck at close range with\n       either a .32– or .357– caliber weapon. His\n\f6                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n       face and head were bruised, and his face had\n       been slashed with a knife. Brandon and\n       Chism had been strangled with wire coat\n       hangers. Their faces were bruised, Chism’s\n       extensively. Brandon’s anus was extremely\n       dilated, bruised, reddened and torn, consistent\n       with the insertion of a penis shortly before her\n       death. There was also redness around the\n       opening of her vagina, and vaginal samples\n       revealed the presence of semen and\n       spermatozoa. All three victims were bound\n       hand and foot.\n\nId.\n\n    Approximately a year later, police arrested Charles\nSanders in connection with the murders. Id. Sanders entered\ninto a plea agreement, in which he pleaded guilty to three\ncounts of second degree murder, admitted a gun\nenhancement, and agreed to cooperate with the prosecution,\nin exchange for a sentence of 17 years to life in prison. Id.\nDuring his interrogation by the police, Sanders gave both a\ntape-recorded and a written statement. Id. He also testified\nat Andrews’s trial, and described the crime as follows:\n\n       Sanders testified that he and [Andrews]\n       devised a plan to rob Wheeler, a drug dealer.\n       [Andrews] armed himself with a\n       .357 magnum and gave Sanders a .38–or\n       .32–caliber automatic. On the evening of the\n       murders, they visited their friend, Carol\n       Brooks, who lived in the same apartment\n       building as Wheeler, and then went to\n       Wheeler’s apartment. In response to their\n\f             ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      7\n\nknocking, Wheeler, who apparently knew\n[Andrews], let them in. Also inside the\napartment was a woman (Patrice Brandon).\nAfter smoking some marijuana with Wheeler,\n[Andrews] and Sanders drew their guns.\nSanders tied Wheeler and Brandon with belts\nand socks, put on a pair of gloves, and began\nto search the apartment for drugs and money.\nExcept for some powder on a saucer which\nappeared to be cocaine, the search was\nunsuccessful. [Andrews] questioned Wheeler,\nwho denied having any drugs or money.\nSaying he would make Brandon talk,\n[Andrews] dragged her into the kitchen and\nclosed the door. Sanders remained in the\nliving room with Wheeler.\n\nSanders heard [Andrews] hitting Brandon and\nlater heard sounds as though they were having\nsex. When [Andrews] came out of the kitchen\nshortly thereafter, Sanders saw Brandon’s\npants around her ankles.\n\n[Andrews] put his gun in Wheeler’s mouth.\nHe threatened to kill Wheeler and Brandon\nunless Wheeler revealed the location of the\ndrugs. Wheeler said the ‘dope’ was in the\nattic, and pointed out a trap door leading up to\nit. Sanders climbed into the attic. While in\nthe attic, Sanders heard two shots. When he\ncame down, [Andrews] told him he had shot\nWheeler because the latter had tried to jump\nout the window. Sanders asked if Wheeler\nwas dead. [Andrews] responded he was\n\f8                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n       ‘standing right up’ on Wheeler when he fired\n       the gun . . . . When Sanders asked about\n       Brandon, [Andrews] replied he had killed her\n       before leaving the kitchen.\n\n       While [Andrews] and Sanders were cleaning\n       up the apartment, Ronald Chism knocked on\n       the door and asked if everything was all right.\n       [Andrews] said Wheeler was home and\n       invited him inside. [Andrews] then hit Chism\n       on the head, tied him up, and took him into\n       the bathroom. Sanders saw [Andrews] sitting\n       astride Chism’s back, joining and separating\n       his clenched fists in a tugging motion,\n       apparently strangling Chism. Sanders then\n       saw [Andrews] go into the kitchen and choke\n       Brandon with a wire clothes hanger. When\n       the two left the apartment, [Andrews] gave\n       Sanders some money, saying it was all he had\n       found.\n\nIn re Andrews, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2519733\"><a href=\"/opinion/2519733/in-re-andrews/\"><span class=\"volume\">52</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 658 (Cal. 2002) (alterations,\ncitations, and internal quotation marks omitted). Andrews\nwas eventually arrested, and he was charged in June 1982.\n\n    At trial, the jury heard Sanders’s testimony as well as the\ntestimony of Carol Brooks. Brooks confirmed that Andrews\nand Sanders visited her on the night of the murders and told\nher about their plan to “get some money” from Wheeler.\nPeople v. Andrews, 776 P.2d at 289. A week after the\nincident, Sanders told her about his involvement in the\nmurders. Id. Then, a few weeks later, Andrews confessed to\nher that he shot Wheeler, had sex with Brandon, and took\n$300 during the robbery. Id.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                               9\n\n    The prosecution also presented fingerprint evidence. Id.\nPolice experts analyzed 50 prints lifted from the apartment;\nthree prints belonged to Andrews. Id. One fingerprint was\nfound on a coffee table in Wheeler’s living room. Id. Two\npalm prints were found on the kitchen floor, on either side of\nthe spot where Brandon’s body was found, the left palm print\nbeing about a foot from her body.\n\n    The defense primarily focused on undermining Sanders’s\ncredibility. Id. Two jail inmates who had been incarcerated\nwith Sanders testified. Id. They stated that, while Sanders\nwas incarcerated with them, he made statements suggesting\nhe planned to lie about the murders to shift blame onto\nAndrews and away from himself. Id.\n\n    The jury deliberated for three days before finding\nAndrews guilty of murder.1 The jury also found three special\ncircumstances to be true. Two special circumstances related\nto the offense conduct: (1) multiple murder and robbery\nmurder, based on the murders of Wheeler, Brandon, and\nChism, and the robbery of Wheeler, and (2) rape-murder,\nbased on the rape and murder of Brandon. In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 659. The third special circumstance was\nAndrews’s conviction for murder of a grocery store clerk in\n1967. Id.\n\n    At the penalty phase, both the prosecutor and defense\ncounsel made brief presentations. The prosecutor presented\nevidence through a joint stipulation. Id. He noted that the\njury had already found that Andrews had been convicted of\nmurder in 1967. The parties also stipulated that Andrews had\n\n\n  1\n    Andrews was convicted after his second trial, because the jury failed\nto reach a verdict in the first trial.\n\f10                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nbeen convicted of armed robbery in May 1968, convicted of\nescape in November 1969, and convicted of robbery in June\n1977. Id. The stipulation did not describe the facts of the\noffenses underlying these additional convictions. The\nprosecution also submitted photographs of the dead bodies of\nPatrice Brandon and Ronald Chism as they were found by the\npolice in the apartment; the photos had been excluded at the\nguilt phase on the ground they were unduly inflammatory. Id.\nFinally, the parties stipulated that Andrews’s birth date was\nJuly 2, 1950. Id.\n\n    The defense evidence consisted of two sworn statements\nthat were read to the jury. Id. The statements described facts\nunderlying the incident in September 1966 that formed the\nbasis of Andrews’s 1967 conviction for murder. According\nto the statements, Andrews and a 17-year-old companion,\nboth of whom were armed, attempted to rob a grocery store,\nand the companion fired three shots, killing the grocery store\nclerk. Id.\n\n    In his closing argument, defense counsel focused on\nmitigating circumstances. He argued that Andrews’s crimes\nwere unsophisticated, occurred several years apart, and all\ninvolved the unexpected escalation of a planned robbery. Id.\nHe pointed out that Andrews was only 15 years old at the\ntime of the murder of the grocery store clerk, and was not the\nshooter. Id. He portrayed Andrews’s conduct as less\nblameworthy because the murders occurred while Andrews,\nSanders, Wheeler, and Brandon were under the influence of\nillegal drugs. Id. at 659–60. Finally, he emphasized that\nother murderers had received life without the possibility of\nparole despite the jury’s finding of special circumstances, and\ndespite more blameworthy conduct. Id. at 659. He pointed\nout that in this very case, Sanders received a sentence of only\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       11\n\n17 years to life. Id. at 660. The prosecution made no\nrebuttal.\n\n   After one day of deliberations, the jury returned a verdict\nimposing the death penalty for each of the three murder\ncounts. The court sentenced Andrews to death on June 8,\n1984. The California Supreme Court affirmed the conviction\nand sentence on direct appeal on August 3, 1989. People v.\nAndrews, 776 P.2d at 285, 288.\n\n                              B\n\n    Andrews filed petitions for state post-conviction relief,\nclaiming, among other things, that his counsel’s assistance\nwas ineffective at the penalty phase because counsel did not\nadequately investigate and present mitigating evidence. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court summarily denied all of Andrews’s\nclaims, except for his penalty phase ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim.\n\n                              1\n\n    The California Supreme Court appointed a referee to take\nevidence and make factual findings on six questions related\nto Andrews’s penalty phase ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 659. Under California law,\n“[b]ecause appellate courts are ill-suited to conduct\nevidentiary hearings, it is customary for appellate courts to\nappoint a referee to take evidence and make\nrecommendations as to the resolution of disputed factual\nissues.” People v. Romero, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1389262\"><a href=\"/opinion/1389262/people-v-romero/\"><span class=\"volume\">883</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">388</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 393 (Cal. 1994), as\nmodified on denial of reh’g (Jan. 5, 1995). While a referee’s\nfindings on factual questions are not binding on the California\nSupreme Court, they “are entitled to great weight when\n\f12                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.” In re Johnson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1275419\"><a href=\"/opinion/1275419/in-re-johnson/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 307 (Cal. 1998). The six questions provided to the\nreferee were:\n\n       1. What mitigating character and background\n       evidence could have been, but was not,\n       presented by petitioner’s trial attorneys at his\n       penalty trial?\n\n       2. What investigative steps by trial counsel, if\n       any, would have led to each such item of\n       information?\n\n       3. What investigative steps, if any, did trial\n       counsel take in an effort to gather mitigating\n       evidence to be presented at the penalty phase?\n\n       4. What tactical or financial constraints, if\n       any, weighed against the investigation or\n       presentation of mitigating character and\n       background evidence at the penalty phase?\n\n       5. What evidence, damaging to petitioner, but\n       not presented by the prosecution at the guilt or\n       penalty trials, would likely have been\n       presented in rebuttal, if petitioner had\n       introduced any such mitigating character and\n       background evidence?\n\n       6. Did petitioner himself request that either\n       the investigation or the presentation of\n       mitigating evidence at the penalty phase be\n       curtailed in any manner? If so, what\n       specifically did petitioner request?\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       13\n\nIn re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 659.\n\n    The referee received the testimony of more than\n50 witnesses over the span of six years. Id. at 660. As a\nthreshold matter, the referee pointed out two factors that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court should take into account in\nevaluating the information obtained in the reference hearing.\nFirst, the referee acknowledged that “[t]he length of time\navailable to develop, expand and refine the depth of the\nevidence presented at this reference hearing obviously creates\nan artificial setting and this court notes that the abundance\nand massiveness of the evidence presented could not and\nwould not have been the same in an original trial.” Id. at 660\nn.2. Among other things, “[s]trategic considerations alone\nwould have undoubtedly resulted in a greater refinement of\nthe quality of evidence presented.” Id. Second, the referee’s\nconsideration of counsel’s work was hindered by the fact that\nthe lead counsel, Gerard Lenoir, died before the referee\nconducted the hearing, and only the secondary counsel,\nHalvor Miller, was available. Id. at 663 n.7. Miller could not\nrecall the full scope of Lenoir’s investigation. Id. at 663.\n\n    In her report, the referee provided one-paragraph\nsummaries and detailed factual findings in response to each\nquestion. The California Supreme Court both summarized\nthe referee’s findings and explained the weight it gave to\nthese findings. Id. at 660–65.\n\n     In response to the first question (what mitigating\ncharacter and background evidence could have been, but was\nnot, presented by petitioner’s trial attorneys at his penalty\ntrial), the referee identified three broad categories of\nmitigating evidence that were available but not presented to\nthe jury: Andrews’s family background; the conditions of his\n\f14                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nconfinement in a juvenile reform school and in the Alabama\nprison system; and his mental health. Id. at 660. As\nsummarized in the court’s opinion, the referee’s report found\nthe following regarding Andrews’s background. When he\nwas very young, Andrews’s alcoholic parents separated, and\nhis mother left him to be raised by his grandparents and aunt\nin a large family home with his siblings and cousins, located\nin a poor, segregated neighborhood of Mobile, Alabama. Id.\nThe referee described Andrews’s grandfather as “loving,\nbenevolent, and responsible,” id., and the court added that\nAndrews’s mother regularly sent money and clothing to her\nchildren and that Andrews’s upbringing and early family life\nwere “relatively stable and without serious privation or\nabuse,” id. at 670. When Andrews was around nine or ten,\nhis mother returned home with children by another marriage,\nof whom Andrews was jealous. Id. at 660, 670. Around that\ntime Andrews’s grandfather, a “pivotal figure” in his life,\ndied. Id. at 660 (internal quotation marks omitted). Andrews\nbecame withdrawn, skipped school, and at age 14, committed\ncar theft and was sent to a reform school known as Mt.\nMeigs, formally the Alabama Industrial School for Negro\nChildren. Id.\n\n    Summarizing the referee’s report, the California Supreme\nCourt stated that “[a]t Mt. Meigs, petitioner encountered\nappalling conditions.” Id. According to the referee’s report,\none witness described it as “a farming operation and a penal\ncolony for children,” while others described “inhuman\nconditions, inadequate food and clothing and severe beatings”\nwith “sticks, broom handles, tree limbs, and hoe handles . . .\nor fan belts.” Among other things, the referee found that\nAndrews “was subjected to beatings, brutality, inadequate\nconditions and sexual predators.” Id. at 661. Further, “[h]is\npassiveness and small physique caused him to be a target of\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       15\n\nolder, tougher boys, from whom no protection or separation\nwas provided.” Id.\n\n    After his release from Mt. Meigs, Andrews began to\nassociate with Freddie Square, an older boy with\n“manipulative and criminal tendencies.” Id. In September\n1966, three months after Andrews’s release, Andrews and\nSquare entered a grocery store, drew guns, and announced\nthat they were conducting a robbery. Id. When “the store\nclerk placed his hand down the front of his apron,” Square\nshot the clerk, killing him. Id. Andrews “acted as a lookout\nin the robbery, but played a more active role when he and\nSquare robbed a taxi driver during their getaway,” and used\nthe taxi as a getaway car. Id. At the reference hearing, Harry\nWoodall, the driver of the stolen taxi, testified that Andrews\nand Square robbed him at gunpoint. Id. at 665. While\npointing a gun at Woodall, Andrews twice said, “Let’s shoot\nhim.” Id. Andrews and Square stole Woodall’s wallet, then\nordered him out of the taxi and fired three shots at him;\nAndrews fired at least two of the shots. Id. In 1967,\nAndrews was convicted of murder based on the grocery store\nincident, and in 1968, he was convicted of armed robbery of\nthe taxi driver. Id. at 661 n.4. Just before he turned 18, he\nwas committed to Alabama state prison. Id. at 661. He\nescaped from prison and was convicted of that offense in\n1969. Id. at 659. He remained in prison until 1976.\n\n    Summarizing the referee’s findings about conditions in\nthe four different prisons in which Andrews was confined\nover ten years, the California Supreme Court stated:\n\n       [The referee] described conditions in these\n       institutions as abysmal, characterized by\n       severe overcrowding, racial segregation,\n\f16                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n       substandard facilities, no separation of the\n       tougher inmates from younger or smaller\n       inmates, constant violence, the persistent\n       threat of sexual assaults and the constant\n       presence of sexual pressure, the availability\n       and necessity of weapons by all inmates, and\n       degrading conditions in disciplinary modules.\n       [Andrews] not only received beatings but was\n       also personally subjected to sexual assaults.\n\nId. at 661 (internal quotation marks omitted). The referee\nstated that Andrews “was rarely the instigator of violence,”\nwas “the prey rather than the predator” when he was\ninvolved, and was often a target of violence due to his small\nstature. Id. at 662 (internal quotation marks omitted). He\nalso “appeared to adjust well when the structure permitted”\nand, “when circumstances permitted, he tended to hold\npositions of responsibility.” Id. At the same time, however,\nAndrews “was personally involved in violence, including the\nstabbings of two inmates who had been threatening him.” Id.\nat 661 (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).\n\n    Shortly after his release from prison in 1976, Andrews\nengaged in an attempted robbery of a laundry. Id. According\nto testimony at the reference hearing:\n\n       Mobile Police Officer Pettis testified that on\n       March 23, 1977, he responded to a robbery\n       call. Entering the store from which the call\n       came, he and other officers saw [Andrews]\n       holding a crying young woman hostage with\n       a cocked gun at her head. He told the officers\n       to leave and “continued to repeat, ‘Someone’s\n       going to get shot, I’m going to shoot.’” The\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       17\n\n       officers withdrew. Ultimately, [Andrews]\n       surrendered to the officers after releasing the\n       young woman and another woman whom he\n       had also held hostage.\n\nId. at 665. Andrews was arrested for the robbery and held in\nMobile County Jail. Id. at 661. After a failed attempt to\nescape from the jail, he succeeded in escaping on his second\ntry, and fled to California. Id. at 661 & n.5.\n\n    In California, Andrews met Debra Pickett, with whom he\nhad a stable relationship. Id. at 661. The couple had a child,\nand Andrews held a job during this time. Id. But by\nDecember 1979, Andrews had resumed using cocaine and\nleft his job and family. Id. Soon after, he committed the\nthree murders at issue here. Id.\n\n    The referee also described the testimony from mental\nhealth experts that could have been presented at the penalty\nphase. Summarizing the referee’s report, the California\nSupreme Court noted that defense experts diagnosed\nAndrews with a range of mental disorders, including attention\ndeficit disorder, post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and\nmild to moderate organic brain impairment, in part due to\ndrug use and possibly due to a head injury in prison. Id. The\ndefense experts opined that Andrews’s learning disability, the\nadverse circumstances of his childhood, the impact of the\ncorrectional systems, and the PTSD made his commission of\nthe murders and sexual assault more understandable and less\nmorally culpable. Id. at 661–62. The experts gave specific\nexamples of how Andrews’s impairments and the brutal\nconditions of incarceration made it difficult for him to avoid\ngetting into trouble with the law. Id. at 661–62, 670. For\nexample, one defense psychiatrist testified that Wheeler, one\n\f18                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nof the three victims in the December 1979 murders, had\ncalled Andrews a “faggot” a few days before the murders\noccurred, and Andrews’s PTSD would predispose him to\noverreact to the slur. Id. at 680. The psychiatrist concluded\nthat Andrews was “affected by serious emotional disturbance\nwhen he committed the murders.” Id.\n\n     The California Supreme Court then recounted the\nreferee’s findings on questions two, three, and four. These\nquestions addressed the investigative steps trial counsel took\nto gather mitigating evidence for the penalty phase, steps the\ntrial counsel could have taken to do so, and the constraints\nthat weighed against the trial counsel investigating or\npresenting mitigating character and background evidence at\nthe penalty phase. Id. at 662–64. According to the referee,\ntrial counsel hired defense investigators for the guilt phase,\nwhile the counsel themselves did the investigative work for\nthe penalty phase. Id. at 663. The trial counsel took two trips\nto Mobile, one in 1983 and another in 1984. On the first trip,\nthey spent a day searching court records for Andrews’s prior\nconvictions and documents relating to his background. Id.\nThey also searched for relatives and potential witnesses in\nAndrews’s neighborhood. Id. On the second trip, counsel\nobtained information about Andrews’s prior murder\nconviction at the county courthouse. Id. Counsel also\ntraveled to Pensacola, Florida, where they interviewed\nAndrews’s mother. Id. During the course of the interview,\nthey obtained information that Andrews was a slow learner,\nthat his grandparents raised him, and that he started getting\ninto trouble as a teenager. Id. Miller remembered telling\nAndrews’s mother that if he obtained Andrews’s permission\nto obtain information from family members or other contacts,\nhe or Lenoir would contact her for further information. Id.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        19\n\n    The California Supreme Court also summarized the\nreferee’s findings about the constraints placed on trial counsel\nin conducting their penalty phase investigation, though the\ndeath of Lenoir limited this aspect of the referee’s\ninvestigation. Id. at 663–64. According to the referee, there\nwere tactical, rather than financial, constraints. Id. Miller\nrecalled the main tactical constraint as “the adamancy of\npetitioner’s opposition to having his family, and in particular\nhis mother, testify at the trial.” Id. at 664. According to the\nreferee, “Mr. Miller was very consistent in his testimony\nregarding petitioner’s refusal to cooperate in this area, and\nthis position is supported circumstantially by statements made\nby petitioner as well as testimony from the prosecutor.” Id.\nMiller stated that Andrews had threatened to disrupt the\nproceedings if his directions were not followed, and both\ncounsel believed this threat was genuine. Id. “Acceding to\nthese wishes,” neither Miller nor Lenoir “pursued a full\ninvestigation of petitioner’s background or family and never\nlearned the names of family members with one or two\nexceptions.” Id.\n\n    In addition to the constraints imposed by Andrews, the\nreferee found that counsel were concerned about the effects\nof using prisoners as witnesses. Id. Miller doubted that\njurors would be impressed by the credibility and demeanor of\nthe prisoners, and he was concerned that calling prisoners as\nwitnesses would risk disclosure of Andrews’s misconduct in\nprison. Id. The referee found that Andrews had been\ninvolved in two stabbings of other inmates and had escaped\nfrom custodial facilities on two occasions. Id. Further, the\nreferee found that the inmates who provided testimony at the\nreference hearing had “substantial violent criminal records\nand these offenses included a substantial number of escapes.”\nId. Finally, Miller testified that he and Lenoir decided not to\n\f20                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\npresent evidence about Andrews’s upbringing, because the\nhouse and neighborhood in which Andrews grew up\nresembled the house and neighborhood in which Miller was\nraised, and so counsel thought a “poverty-presentation”\nlacked viability. Id.\n\n    The California Supreme Court also summarized the\nreferee’s views on additional investigative steps that counsel\ncould have taken. Id. at 662–63. The referee found that\nobtaining information regarding the circumstances of\nAndrews’s upbringing, the impact of the correctional\nfacilities in Alabama and Andrews’s adult experiences, and\nthe psychiatric aspects of Andrews’s history did not call for\n“any extraordinary efforts beyond simple persistence.” Id. at\n662. The referee believed that Andrews’s mother could have\nprovided more information about Andrews’s upbringing and\ndirected counsel to other family members and acquaintances\nwho could have provided general information regarding\nschooling issues. Id. Counsel could have obtained addresses\nand information about additional witnesses through publicly\navailable documents or through word of mouth. Id. The\nreferee also believed that “[s]everal areas of inquiry were\navailable relating to petitioner’s experiences in the\ncorrectional system in Alabama.” Id. Counsel could have\nobtained prison records from the juvenile and adult\ncorrectional systems and could have contacted inmates\nreferenced in those records. Id. Or counsel could have\nconducted “standard legal research of public records relating\nto lawsuits involving these institutions.” Id. While\nacknowledging that “petitioner’s cooperativeness was a\nsignificant issue,” the referee found that counsel could have\ndeveloped the information presented at the reference hearing\n“through outside sources in the absence of any cooperation\nfrom the petitioner.” Id. at 663.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        21\n\n    In addition, although there was “no significant written\nhistory” in the area of mental health, and there was little\nevidence of “family members having mental impairments,”\nthe referee found that counsel could have appointed\npsychiatric experts. Id. at 662. The referee acknowledged\nthat “[a]ny such inquiry may not necessarily have resulted in\nthe availability of evidence of the diagnoses of organic brain\nimpairment, learning disorders, or of post traumatic stress\ndisorder.” Id. According to the referee, “[t]he quality of\nstandardized personality tests was not the same, the\nknowledge of post traumatic stress disorder was in an infancy\nstage, and the resulting diagnosis may not necessarily have\nbeen favorable to the petitioner.” Id. at 662–63.\n\n    In addressing question five (what evidence, damaging to\npetitioner, but not presented by the prosecution at the guilt or\npenalty trials, would likely have been presented in rebuttal, if\npetitioner had introduced any such mitigating character and\nbackground evidence), the referee found that the\nprosecution’s rebuttal presentation could have included\nevidence about two of Andrews’s prior convictions. Id. at\n664. First, the prosecutor could have presented testimony\nfrom the taxi driver in the 1968 robbery, who would have\ntestified he heard Andrews say “[l]et’s shoot him,” and then\nfired at least two shots at him. Id. at 665. Second, the\nprosecution could have informed the jury about Andrews’s\nattempt to rob a laundry business following his release from\nprison in 1976, which involved holding two women hostage,\none with a gun to her head. Id. at 661, 665. The jury had\nheard that Andrews was convicted of these offenses, but it did\nnot hear the facts on which the conviction was based; the\nprosecutor could have introduced a complete description of\nthe underlying events as aggravating evidence, to show\n\f22                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nAndrews’s greater moral culpability for the rape and triple-\nmurder. Id. at 659, 664.\n\n    Further, the referee determined that the prosecution could\nhave called its own mental health experts to rebut Andrews’s\nevidence. Id. at 665. The state could have presented expert\ntestimony that Andrews did not suffer from PTSD, but rather\nsuffered from antisocial personality disorder, resented\nauthority, and had a normal-range IQ of 93. Id. A second\nstate expert would have testified that Andrews’s ability to\nhold a job and maintain a stable relationship with Debra\nPickett before he committed the murders strongly indicated\nthat he had not suffered brain damage. Id. In addition, the\nexpert would have testified that Andrews’s “behavior on the\nnight of the murders showed planning and thought, and it was\ntherefore unlikely that petitioner was under the influence of\nPCP when he committed the murders.” Id.\n\n    Finally, in response to question six (did petitioner himself\nrequest that either the investigation or the presentation of\nmitigating evidence at the penalty phase be curtailed in any\nmanner, and, if so, what specifically did petitioner request),\nthe referee concluded that there was no doubt that Andrews\n“adamantly” refused to allow counsel to approach his mother\nand family or to have them testify. Id. This conclusion was\nbased on the trial records and the consistent testimony of\nwitnesses at the reference hearing. Id. In response to specific\nquestioning from the trial court “regarding his reluctance to\nhave his mother called,” and in the face of the trial court’s\nadvice that his mother’s testimony would be valuable,\nAndrews “was very precise in his response, telling the judge\nthat he fully understood and that this was his choice and no\none else’s.” Id. (emphasis omitted). The referee further\nnoted that the lead counsel, Lenoir, “represented on the\n\f                          ANDREWS V. DAVIS                                23\n\nrecord at trial that petitioner refused to have his mother called\nand that he ‘had his reasons,’ which Mr. Lenoir did not wish\nto disclose to the court.” Id. The referee also found that\n“petitioner went so far as to threaten to disrupt the trial if his\nmother were called.” Id. Andrews’s opposition to having\ncounsel involve his family was corroborated by his older\nsister and uncontradicted by his mother.2 Id.\n\n                                      2\n\n    After considering “the record of the hearing, the referee’s\nfactual findings, and petitioner’s original trial,” the California\nSupreme Court concluded that “petitioner received\nconstitutionally adequate representation, and any inadequacy\ndid not result in prejudice.” Id. at 659.\n\n    In reaching this conclusion, the court began by stating the\nrequirements for an ineffective assistance of counsel claim\nunder Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). First,\nthe court stated that “[t]o prove a claim of ineffective\nassistance of counsel at the penalty phase trial, the petitioner\nmust establish that counsel’s performance [(1)] did not meet\nan objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms and [(2)] that he suffered prejudice\nthereby.” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 667 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n\n\n\n\n 2\n   At the reference hearing, Andrews disputed the finding that he did not\nwant his family involved, but the California Supreme Court noted that “the\nreferee credited Miller’s testimony that [Andrews] objected not only to his\nmother’s involvement, but also to that of any relatives,” and gave the\nreferee’s credibility determination the “great weight” to which it is entitled\nunder California law. Id. at 667.\n\f24                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n     Turning first to the deficiency prong, the California\nSupreme Court concluded that Andrews had not established\nthat his counsel’s performance was defective. Its reasoning\nwas as follows. Under Strickland, “the Supreme Court\nspecifically addressed counsel’s duty to investigate and made\nclear courts should not equate effective assistance with\nexhaustive investigation of potential mitigating evidence.”\nId. at 668. Any judicial scrutiny “must be highly deferential,”\nand courts must avoid second guessing counsel’s assistance\nand must “eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight.” Id.\nat 667 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689). Further, while\n“counsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to\nmake a reasonable decision that makes particular\ninvestigations unnecessary,” the Supreme Court made clear\nthat “a particular decision not to investigate must be directly\nassessed for reasonableness in all the circumstances, applying\na heavy measure of deference to counsel’s judgments.” Id. at\n668 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690–91). Moreover,\n“valid strategic choices are possible even without extensive\ninvestigative efforts.” Id. (quoting Burger v.

DAVIS                              25\n\n    First, the California Supreme Court found that counsel\ncould have reasonably decided not to pursue information\nfrom Andrews’s family in light of Andrews’s decision to\ncurtail such an investigation. The court noted that while “the\nreferee found that counsel could have discovered the\nmitigating evidence presented at the reference hearing with\n‘simple persistence,’” the evidence showed that Andrews\nlimited the investigation counsel could undertake by insisting\nthat counsel not involve his family. Id. at 668. Counsel were\nwithin the range of professional competence in complying\nwith Andrews’s wishes, because under California law, “an\nattorney representing a defendant at the penalty phase of a\ncapital case is not required to present potentially mitigating\nevidence over the defendant’s objections.” Id. (quoting\nPeople v.

Id. at 670. Andrews’s mother\n“did not abandon him, but left him with an extended family\nincluding his ‘loving and responsible’ grandfather, regularly\n\n 3\n    Despite the constraints imposed by Andrews, the California Supreme\nCourt found that Andrews’s counsel traveled to Mobile, Alabama twice\nto search for relatives, potential witnesses, and legal documents, and also\ntraveled to Pensacola, Florida to interview Andrews’s mother. In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 663. The dissent concedes as much, Dissent at 97–98\nn.1, so its finding that Andrews’s counsel conducted “virtually no penalty\nphase investigation” is merely an expression of the dissent’s negative\nevaluation of counsel’s efforts. Dissent at 97. But because the California\nSupreme Court determined that counsel was reasonable in not pursuing\nfurther information, the only question raised under the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) is whether this was an objectively\nunreasonable application of Strickland. See Richter, 562 U.S. at 101.\n\f26                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nsent money and clothing to her children, and returned several\nyears later to remain in the family home.” Id. The testimony\nfrom family members generally showed Andrews’s early\nupbringing and family life “to be relatively stable and without\nserious privation or abuse. All but one of his siblings\ncompleted high school, and only one had a minor brush with\nthe law.” Id. Counsel’s preliminary investigation showed\nthat Andrews’s childhood was not mitigating: “Miller viewed\npetitioner’s childhood surroundings as unimpressive because\nhe found them comparable to his own.” Id. at 673. Andrews\n“did not suffer a home environment that would place his\ncrimes in any understandable context or explain his resorting\nto crime every time he was released or escaped from prison.”\nId. at 670. Moreover, his stable conditions in California\ncould have led the jury to conclude that Andrews’s\n“abandonment of his own son to pursue a cocaine habit and\nhis former criminal ways would belie the suggestion he\nmerited sympathy due to his parents’ drinking and\nabandonment and his grandfather’s death.” Id. at 671.\n“Under these circumstances, counsel could reasonably reject\na background mitigation strategy in favor of an alternate basis\nto plead for petitioner’s life.” Id. at 673.\n\n    Second, the California Supreme Court found that counsel\ncould have reasonably decided not to develop evidence\nregarding the conditions of Andrews’s confinement. Id. at\n670–71.4 Relying in part on the referee’s findings, the\n\n\n  4\n     Relying on the opinion of the dissenting Justice in the California\nSupreme Court’s opinion in this case, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 681\n(Kennard, J., dissenting), the dissent claims that Andrews’s attorneys\nrendered ineffective assistance because they allegedly failed to ask\nAndrews any questions regarding his prison conditions.

The witnesses testifying to the conditions under which\nAndrews was incarcerated included “one death row inmate,\nwith serious felony records for murder, rape, and armed\nrobbery,” as well as many inmates who “had themselves\nengaged in brutality while in prison and escaped with some\nfrequency.” Id. at 671. The jury could have drawn an\n“unfavorable comparison” with Andrews in both cases, and\n“[r]ather than engendering sympathy, the evidence could well\nhave reinforced an impression of him as a person who had\nbecome desensitized and inured to violence and disrespect for\nthe law.” Id. Moreover, the witnesses’ “criminal histories\nwould automatically subject them to impeachment.” Id. The\ncourt also found that hearing such witnesses testify about\nbrutal conditions in Alabama would “raise the question of\nwhy petitioner so readily resorted to crime when he escaped\nthe brutal and predatory conditions in Alabama and relocated\nto California, where he found work and started a family.” Id.\nCounsel could also reasonably conclude that having inmates\ndescribe the Alabama prison conditions would “potentially\nopen the door to additional evidence of petitioner’s criminal\n\n\n\n\ncourt’s application of Strickland was objectively unreasonable.\nHarrington v.

DAVIS\n\npast.” Id. at 673.5 Among other things, “evidence of prison\nconditions could have led to the jury’s learning of petitioner’s\nsecond escape from custody,” which could have “created a\ndanger defense counsel reasonably sought to avoid.” Id. at\n669.6\n\n\n 5\n   The dissent erroneously argues that no reasonable counsel could have\ndecided to avoid the dangers of relying on prisoner testimony because “the\nMt. Meigs evidence was not dependent upon testimony from prisoners”\nbut rather could have been offered by the “experts and respected\nobservers” who testified at Andrews’s state court evidentiary hearing.\nDissent at 99–100, 102–103. In reaching this conclusion, the dissent\nsubstitutes its de novo finding for the findings of the California Supreme\nCourt, which held that “whatever mitigating evidence may have been\ndisclosed by pursuing the conditions of incarceration petitioner\nexperienced, counsel knew such evidence would come primarily from the\ntestimony of petitioner’s fellow prisoners, many of whom were hardened\ncriminals with serious felony records.” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 668–69.\nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2), a federal court “may not second-guess” a\nstate court’s factual findings unless the state court was “not merely wrong,\nbut actually unreasonable” in light of the record before it. Taylor v.\nMaddox, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786028\"><a href=\"/opinion/786028/leif-taylor-v-thomas-m-maddox-interim-director-george-galaza-cal-terhune/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">992</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 999 (9th Cir. 2004). The dissent could not\nreasonably conclude that the California Supreme Court’s conclusion was\nobjectively unreasonable given that it is not clear that the “experts and\nrespected observers” who testified at the state court evidentiary hearing,\nwhich occurred almost a decade after Andrews’s sentencing hearing,\nwould have been available to testify at Andrews’s sentencing hearing in\n1984.\n 6\n   The dissent argues that the California Supreme Court was unreasonable\nin excusing counsel’s failure to discover Mt. Meigs evidence based on\nAndrews’s refusal to involve his family. Dissent at 99–100. This strained\nreading of the California Supreme Court’s broad statement about\nmitigating evidence is itself unreasonable. In fact, the California Supreme\nCourt never stated that there was a connection between family restrictions\nand prison conditions. Rather, the court concluded that Andrews’s\nrestrictions on his family’s involvement would have limited counsel’s\nability to develop Andrews’s background and childhood. In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 662 (noting that, if permitted, “[t]rial counsel could have\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              29\n\n    Third, the California Supreme Court found that counsel\ncould have reasonably decided not to introduce expert\ntestimony on Andrews’s mental health because “[t]he\nprosecutor could have exploited the testimony of the mental\nhealth experts to petitioner’s disadvantage.” Id. at 670. The\ncourt noted that one of the experts at the reference hearing\ntestified “that convicts tend to react with rage to perceived\ninsults, behavior they find difficult to shed even when\ndischarged,” and while this may have explained Andrews’s\nactions, “it does not necessarily create a sympathetic\nimpression” because “[t]he jury could just as readily infer\npetitioner was unable to control lethal impulses on the\nslightest provocation.” Id. Moreover, there would have been\na battle of the experts regarding whether Andrews had\nsuffered any brain damage at all. Id. And “[a]s the reference\nhearing demonstrated, a mental health penalty defense would\nalso have given the prosecution several opportunities to\nrepeat the circumstances of the crime as well as petitioner’s\npast criminality in questioning the experts on both direct and\ncross-examination as to whether petitioner exhibited an\nantisocial personality rather than some form of mental\nimpairment.” Id.\n\n   Finally, the California Supreme Court concluded that\ncounsel had been reasonable in adopting the strategic\n\n\ncontacted petitioner’s family to develop his background and childhood”).\nOn the other hand, the California Supreme Court concluded that\n“[e]vidence relating to the impact of the juvenile and adult correctional\nsystems could have been developed by obtaining prison records and\ncontacting inmates referenced in those records as well as conducting\nstandard legal research of public records relating to lawsuits involving\nthese institutions,” id. (emphasis added), and the main constraint on using\nthis evidence was “the inherent problems of calling prisoners as\nwitnesses,” id. at 664.\n\f30                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\napproach of minimizing Andrews’s “culpability by\ncircumscribing his background and mitigating his criminal\nresponsibility.” Id. at 669. In implementing this strategy,\ncounsel portrayed Andrews as “a follower rather than\nviolently antisocial” and “urged the jury to consider in\nmitigation the fact that others who had committed more\nheinous multiple murders had been sentenced to life without\npossibility of parole and that [Andrews’s co-defendant]\nreceived a comparatively lighter sentence.” Id.7 According\nto the California Supreme Court, this approach “not only\npresented a reasonable case for sparing petitioner’s life under\nthe circumstances, but foreclosed the introduction of\nsubstantial aggravating evidence in rebuttal or on cross-\nexamination that could have undermined the defense by\ndepicting petitioner as aggressive and desensitized to\nviolence.” Id. (citation omitted).8\n\n\n 7\n    The dissent criticizes the California Supreme Court for concluding that\nAndrews’s counsel adopted a reasonable strategy by, among other things,\nportraying Andrews as a follower who was less culpable than others.\nRelying again on the dissenting California Supreme Court Justice, the\ndissent claims that “the only evidence before the jury was that petitioner\nwas the instigator rather than a follower.” Dissent at 104 (quoting In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 682 (Kennard, J., dissenting)). Once again, the\ndissent’s de novo fact finding is contrary to the California Supreme\nCourt’s reasonable conclusion based on evidence that the jury had before\nit a stipulation regarding Andrews’s role in the 1966 grocery store robbery\nwhich portrayed Andrews as a follower. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 659.\n 8\n   Andrews and the dissent argue that the prosecutor would not have put\non additional rebuttal evidence. Dissent at 107, 115. But the California\nSupreme Court rejected this argument, finding that the presentation of\nmitigating evidence would have prompted the prosecutor to shift the focus\nof his penalty phase case, put on additional witnesses, and use cross-\nexamination and closing argument to further damage Andrews’s\nmitigation case. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 665–66. Contrary to the\ndissent, Dissent at 108 n.5, federal courts must defer to the state court’s\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                                31\n\n    Given these valid reasons for not pursuing Andrews’s\nbackground, and the fact that “a lengthy presentation of a\nbroad range of witnesses describing in detail various aspects\nof petitioner’s background” would “have been atypical for a\npenalty phase defense” at the time of the trial, id., the court\nconcluded that “counsel’s strategic decision to limit the scope\nof their investigation of mitigating background evidence and\nnot to present such evidence at the penalty phase came within\n‘the wide range of reasonable professional assistance,’” id. at\n671 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689).\n\n                                     3\n\n   The California Supreme Court next confirmed that this\nconclusion was consistent with then clearly established\n\n\nfactual findings, see, e.g., 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e) (“In a proceeding instituted\nby an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody\npursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual\nissue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct.”). The\nCalifornia Supreme Court noted that it was “clear from the record that\nmuch damaging testimony regarding petitioner’s own violent conduct in\nprison and other circumstances desensitizing inmates to violence could\nhave, and undoubtedly would have, been elicited on cross-examination.”\nId. at 666. Among other evidence, the testimony of the taxi driver in the\n1968 robbery would have rebutted witnesses who characterized petitioner\nas a follower by “demonstrat[ing] petitioner could and did take the\ninitiative for violence” and the police officer’s testimony in the 1977\nlaundry robbery would have shown “petitioner’s lack of reluctance to use\nviolence to obtain his ends.” Id. The court therefore concluded that\n“substantial evidence supports the referee’s finding that presenting the\nmitigating evidence would have opened the door to damaging rebuttal.”\nId. In repeating Andrews’s claim that the prosecutor from Andrews’s trial\nwould not have introduced rebuttal witnesses had the defense presented\nevidence of Andrews’s prison conditions, Dissent at 107, 115, the dissent\nerrs by conducting its own de novo review and failing to defer to the state\ncourt’s factual findings under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2) and (e).\n\f32                   ANDREWS V.

The court provided the following\nreasoning. In Burger, the Supreme Court held that counsel\nwas not deficient even though he declined to present evidence\nof the defendant’s neglectful, violent family or his mental and\nemotional deficiencies, because: (1) introducing such\nbackground evidence raised a risk that aggravating\ninformation would be introduced, and (2) counsel had\nadopted the reasonable strategy of minimizing his client’s\nculpability in light of the co-defendant’s dominance. Id. at\n672–73 (citing Burger, 483 U.S. at 791–94). The California\nSupreme Court determined that Andrews’s counsel had even\nmore compelling justifications for not introducing\nbackground evidence than Burger’s counsel, given that\nBurger endured a worse childhood than Andrews, was a\nteenager at the time of the murder, had committed only one\nmurder, and was not primarily responsible for the decision to\nkill. Id. at 673.\n\n    Next, the California Supreme Court turned to Bell v.\nCone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118509\"><a href=\"/opinion/118509/bell-v-cone/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002). In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 673.\nIn Bell, counsel provided no penalty phase evidence at all and\nwaived closing argument. Id. (citing Bell, 535 U.S. at 685).\nThe Supreme Court concluded that counsel’s strategy was\nreasonable, because evidence of defendant’s normal\nchildhood might have been perceived negatively by the jury,\nand because counsel’s decision to waive closing argument\nprevented the lead prosecutor from depicting the defendant as\na heartless killer. Id. (citing Bell, 535 U.S. at 699–702). The\nCalifornia Supreme Court noted that the counsel’s strategy in\nBell was similar to the strategy of Andrews’s counsel: by\nproviding little background information and giving only a\n\f                        ANDREWS V.

Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000), which held that\ncounsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel by failing\nto investigate defendant’s nightmarish childhood, borderline\nmental retardation, and model behavior in prison. Id. at 674\n(citing Williams, 529 U.S. at 395–96). The California\nSupreme Court distinguished this case, noting that counsel’s\nfailure in Williams to investigate was not based on strategy,\nas in Andrews’s case, but due to counsel’s erroneous\nunderstanding of the law. Id. The state court also noted that\nin Williams, there was no tactical reason to withhold evidence\nand there was virtually no risk of damaging rebuttal, as in this\ncase. Id. at 674–75.\n\n     The California Supreme Court therefore concluded that\nthen-existing Supreme Court precedent was consistent with\nits conclusion that Andrews had not established that “in light\nof all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions of\ncounsel were outside the wide range of professionally\ncompetent assistance.” Id. at 668 (internal quotation marks\nand alterations omitted).9\n\n 9\n   The dissent argues that the California Supreme Court erred in relying\non Burger, Bell, and Williams in concluding that Andrews’s counsel were\nnot deficient. Dissent at 104–106, 110–111. This criticism is meritless,\nhowever, because it is based on de novo review rather than the deference\nrequired under AEDPA. For example, in concluding that “[t]he California\nSupreme Court’s reliance on Burger is unreasonable,” Dissent at 104–105,\nthe dissent takes a de novo approach that is not permitted under AEDPA,\nwhere a court must consider whether “fairminded jurists could disagree\nthat the state court’s decision conflicts with [the Supreme] Court’s\nprecedents,” Richter, 562 U.S. at 102.

As explained in greater detail below, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court determined, based on its review of\nthe evidence adduced at the reference hearing and the rebuttal\nevidence that could have been introduced during the penalty\nphase, that “it is not ‘reasonabl[y] proba[ble]’ petitioner was\nprejudiced by counsel’s rejection of a defense premised on\nevidence of petitioner’s upbringing, the Alabama prison\nconditions he experienced, and his mental health in light of\nthe circumstances of the crimes, given the ambiguous nature\nof some mitigating evidence and the substantial potential for\ndamaging rebuttal.” Id. at 671 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 694).\n\n    “Having considered the record of the hearing, the\nreferee’s factual findings, and petitioner’s original trial,” the\nCalifornia Supreme Court concluded that Andrews “received\nconstitutionally adequate representation, and any inadequacy\ndid not result in prejudice.” Id. at 659.

His amended petition raised 32 claims, including\nmultiple subclaims.\n\n    In a lengthy ruling on the merits of the petition, the\ndistrict court denied 31 claims, but granted relief on\nAndrews’s claim that his counsel were ineffective at the\npenalty phase of his trial for failing to investigate and present\nadditional mitigating evidence. In reaching this conclusion,\nthe district court did not apply the standard mandated by the\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA).\nInstead of determining whether the California Supreme\nCourt’s rejection of this ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim was “contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of” Strickland, as required by 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(1), the district court reviewed the evidence\nproduced by the referee on this issue de novo and concluded\nthat counsel’s “failure to adequately investigate and discover\nevidence of a life filled with abuse and privation is sufficient\nto establish prejudice under Strickland.” Cf. Richter,\n562 U.S. at 101 (criticizing the Ninth Circuit’s review of a\nstate court opinion under § 2254(d)(1) because it failed to\ngive the deference due under AEDPA). The court granted\nAndrews’s petition on this ineffective assistance of counsel\nclaim, denied Andrews’s other 31 claims, and granted a\ncertificate of appealability (COA) on Andrews’s claim that\nCalifornia’s lethal injection protocol violates the Eighth\nAmendment (Claim 25).\n\n   Andrews timely appealed, challenging the district court’s\ndenials of Claim 25 and several uncertified claims.

See Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 189.

Means, Federal Habeas\nManual § 3:29 (2014). The Supreme Court has warned us not\nto derive “strict rules” from its cases applying Strickland de\nnovo because “the Strickland test ‘of necessity requires a\ncase-by-case examination of the evidence.’” Pinholster,\n563 U.S. at 196 & n.17 (quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 391).\nFurther, Supreme Court cases decided on de novo review\n“offer no guidance with respect to whether a state court has\nunreasonably determined that prejudice is lacking” or defense\ncounsel was deficient, and so are not directly applicable to a\n\f40                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nfederal court’s review under § 2254(d)(1) of a habeas\npetitioner’s claim that a state court unreasonably applied\nStrickland. Id. at 202. Indeed, a state court’s application of\nStrickland may be objectively reasonable based on clearly\nestablished Supreme Court precedent at the time of its\ndecision even if the Supreme Court’s subsequent applications\nof Strickland suggest a different result. By contrast, when the\nSupreme Court addresses the AEDPA question whether a\nstate court’s adjudication of an ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim was an unreasonable application of Strickland,\nits reasoning may guide a federal court’s AEDPA analysis\nwhen the facts of the Supreme Court case (including the\nprevailing professional norms at the time of the defendant’s\ntrial) are analogous to the case before the court.\n\n    Under Strickland, deficient performance is performance\nthat falls “below an objective standard of reasonableness” and\nis thus outside of “the range of competence demanded of\nattorneys in criminal cases.” 466 U.S. at 687–88 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The objective measure of\ncounsel’s performance is “reasonableness under prevailing\nprofessional norms.” Id. at 688. Therefore, counsel’s\nperformance is deficient only if it falls below the standard of\nthen prevailing professional norms at the time of the trial. Id.\nIn Pinholster, for instance, the Supreme Court rejected the\ndissent’s argument that counsel’s performance was defective\nwhere the dissent provided no evidence that counsel’s chosen\nmitigation strategy was “inconsistent with the standard of\nprofessional competence in capital cases that prevailed in Los\nAngeles in 1984.” 563 U.S. at 196; see also Bobby v.

The\nSupreme Court has identified several non-exclusive\ncategories of mitigation evidence, focusing primarily on\nevidence that aids the jury’s evaluation of a defendant’s\nmoral culpability.

Thus, evidence that a\ndefendant had a childhood “filled with abuse and privation,”\nincluding being raised by parents who were eventually\nimprisoned for criminal child neglect, could influence a jury’s\nappraisal of the defendant’s moral culpability. Williams,\n529 U.S at 395, 398; see also Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535\n(mitigating evidence included evidence that the defendant\nsuffered severe privation and abuse as a child, had an\nalcoholic and absent mother, was physically and sexually\nabused in foster care, and was homeless for a brief period);\nRompilla v.

DAVIS                        43\n\n    Similarly, evidence of a defendant’s mental or emotional\ndifficulties may lead a jury to conclude that a defendant is\nless culpable than defendants without such difficulties.\nPenry, 492 U.S. at 319. For instance, evidence that a\ndefendant is “borderline mentally retarded,” Williams,\n529 U.S. at 396 (internal quotation marks omitted), or has\nsevere PTSD from military combat, see Porter v. McCollum,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1756\"><a href=\"/opinion/1756/porter-v-mccollum/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35–36 & n.4, 43–44 (2009), or has severe\nlearning and behavioral disabilities, frontal lobe injuries, and\nbrain damage from drug and alcohol abuse, see Sears,\n561 U.S. at 948–49, is potentially mitigating.\n\n    Evidence of conduct or behavior demonstrating the\ndefendant’s good character may also be mitigating. In\nWilliams, the Court gave weight to evidence that the\ndefendant had turned himself in, alerted police to a previously\nundetected crime, expressed remorse, cooperated with police,\nand behaved well in prison. 529 U.S. at 369, 396, 398. In\nBelmontes, the Court noted mitigation evidence that the\ndefendant had maintained strong relationships with family\nmembers in spite of his terrible childhood, and that while in\nprison, he assisted others through a prison religious program\nand rose to second in command in a fire crew. 558 U.S. at\n21.\n\n    After identifying the evidence that the petitioner claims to\nbe mitigating, a court must weigh its strength by assessing its\nlikely impact on a jury. This weighing process includes\nevaluating whether the evidence’s impact on the jury might\nbe aggravating rather than mitigating. See Pinholster,\n563 U.S. at 201–02. The Supreme Court has indicated that\ncourts can consider the fact that mitigation “may be in the eye\nof the beholder,” and juries may find that some evidence\noffered as mitigation cuts the other way. Burger, 483 U.S. at\n\f44                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n794 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). In\nBurger, the Court noted that “[o]n one hand, a jury could\nreact with sympathy over the tragic childhood” of the\ndefendant, while on the other hand, the same testimony could\nestablish the defendant’s “unpredictable propensity for\nviolence” that resulted in murder. Id. (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Similarly, evidence of mental and emotional\nproblems might suggest an increased likelihood that a\ndefendant would be dangerous in the future. See Pinholster,\n563 U.S. at 201 (noting that evidence of the defendant’s\nfamily background, his substance abuse, and his mental\nhealth issues, was “by no means clearly mitigating, as the jury\nmight have concluded that [the defendant] was simply beyond\nrehabilitation”). The Court has also observed that evidence\nof the defendant’s normal youth might, in the jury’s eyes,\nestablish greater moral culpability on the part of the\ndefendant. See Bell, 535 U.S. at 701–02.\n\n                              2\n\n    The second step in determining whether counsel’s\ndeficient performance prejudiced the defendant at the penalty\nphase is evaluating the weight of the aggravating evidence\nand any rebuttal evidence that the government could have\nadduced had the mitigating evidence been introduced. See\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 397–98; Pinholster, 563 U.S. at\n197–202. Aggravating evidence may include evidence\nrelating to the circumstances of the crime. Thus, in\nStrickland, the Court found the aggravating evidence to be\n“overwhelming” where the defendant had repeatedly stabbed\nthe three murder victims during a robbery. 466 U.S. at 674,\n700. Similarly, where the record showed that the defendant\nhad bludgeoned a woman to death with 15 to 20 blows of a\nsteel dumbbell bar to steal goods worth $100, the Supreme\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       45\n\nCourt agreed with the state court that the aggravating\nevidence was “simply overwhelming” and determined that\ncounsel’s failure to introduce certain mitigating evidence was\nnot prejudicial. Belmontes, 558 U.S. at 15–16, 26–27\n(internal quotation marks omitted). In Van Hook, the\nSupreme Court gave weight to evidence that the murder was\ncommitted in the course of a scheme to rob homosexual men\nby luring them into secluded settings. 558 U.S. at 12–13. In\ndoing so, the Court clarified that the weight, not the number,\nof the aggravating factors was important. Id.\n\n    Evidence about a defendant’s prior criminal history is also\naggravating and can be introduced in rebuttal, and a severe\ncriminal history carries great weight. See Woodford v.\nVisciotti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122243\"><a href=\"/opinion/122243/woodford-v-visciotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26–27 (2002) (criminal history that\nincluded “the knifing of one man, and the stabbing of a\npregnant woman as she lay in bed trying to protect her unborn\nbaby,” combined with the circumstances of the crime, was\n“overwhelming” and “devastating” aggravating evidence);\naccord Bell, 535 U.S. at 700 & n.5 (defense counsel\nreasonably feared the prosecution would elicit information\nabout defendant’s criminal history, which included robberies,\nin rebuttal); Burger, 483 U.S. at 793 (defense counsel\nreasonably feared the prosecution would introduce the\ndefendant’s juvenile criminal history in rebuttal, when he had\na clean adult record). Evidence that a defendant had\npreviously committed another murder may be “the most\npowerful imaginable aggravating evidence.” Belmontes,\n558 U.S. at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n    Rebuttal evidence may also directly undermine the value\nof the mitigation evidence. For example, the Supreme Court\nnoted in Pinholster that it would be “of questionable\nmitigating value” for defense counsel to introduce expert\n\f46                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ntestimony diagnosing a defendant with bipolar mood disorder\nand seizure disorders, because such evidence would invite\nrebuttal by a state expert, who could reject the diagnosis of\nbipolar disorder and offer a different diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder. Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 177, 201.\n\n                              3\n\n    The third step in determining whether counsel’s deficient\nperformance prejudiced the defendant at the penalty phase is\nto “reweigh the evidence in aggravation against the totality of\navailable mitigating evidence,” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534, in\norder to determine “whether there is a reasonable probability\nthat, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have\nconcluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n695. A “reasonable probability” is a level of probability that\n“undermine[s] confidence in the outcome.” Id. at 694.\nHowever, counsel’s deficient performance is not prejudicial\nmerely because the court cannot “rule out” the possibility that\nthe sentencer would have imposed a sentence of life in prison\ninstead of the death penalty. Belmontes, 558 U.S. at 20, 27\n(internal quotation marks omitted); see also Richter, 562 U.S.\nat 111 (“In assessing prejudice under Strickland, the question\nis not whether a court can be certain counsel’s performance\nhad no effect on the outcome . . . .”). Rather, “[t]he\nlikelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just\nconceivable.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 112 (citing Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 693). Thus, “the difference between Strickland’s\nprejudice standard and a more-probable-than-not standard is\nslight and matters ‘only in the rarest case.’” Id. (quoting\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 697).\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       47\n\n    The Court has found a reasonable probability of a\ndifferent outcome when scant and weak aggravating evidence\ncould have been presented in rebuttal to strongly mitigating\nevidence. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 534–36, 537–38 (holding\nthat there was a reasonable probability that the jury would\nhave reached a different result at sentencing had it heard\npowerful mitigating evidence regarding the defendant’s\nchildhood background, when the state could have presented\nonly weak rebuttal evidence). By contrast, the Court has\nfound no prejudice when the aggravating evidence is\noverwhelming, even though the mitigating evidence is strong.\nSee Visciotti, 537 U.S. at 26–27 (holding that there was no\nreasonable probability of a different result when the\nmitigating evidence, including the defendant’s “troubled\nfamily background” and possible seizure disorder, did not\noutweigh the “overwhelming” aggravating factors, including\nthe circumstances of the crime and potential rebuttal evidence\nof prior offenses).\n\n    In reweighing aggravating and mitigating evidence, the\nCourt has also examined whether mitigating evidence would\nbe merely cumulative or would have significantly altered the\ninformation provided to the sentencer. See Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 699–700; Porter, 558 U.S. at 41–42. In\nStrickland, the new information “would barely have altered”\nthe picture presented at sentencing, and the Court found no\nprejudice. 466 U.S. at 699–700. Similarly, in Belmontes, the\nCourt concluded that merely cumulative evidence regarding\na petitioner’s difficult childhood, and expert testimony\nregarding a petitioner’s mental state “seeking to explain his\nbehavior, or putting it in some favorable context” would be\nunlikely to outweigh the facts of a brutal murder, and would\nbe even less likely to outweigh evidence that the defendant\nhad committed a prior murder. 558 U.S. at 22–24, 27–28.\n\f48                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nAccordingly, the Court concluded that any failure of counsel\nto present additional mitigating evidence was not prejudicial.\nId. at 27.\n\n    These Supreme Court opinions illustrate that under\nStrickland’s prejudice prong, cumulative mitigating evidence\ndoes not support a conclusion that there would be a\nreasonable probability of a different outcome. New\nmitigating evidence can support such a conclusion only if it\nis sufficiently strong, and the known or additional\naggravating evidence is not overwhelming.\n\n                              C\n\n     In light of this guidance, we now evaluate the California\nSupreme Court’s rejection of Andrews’s claim that he was\nprejudiced by his counsel’s failure to investigate and present\nadditional mitigating evidence at the penalty phase of his\ntrial. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697 (“[A] court need not\ndetermine whether counsel’s performance was deficient\nbefore examining the prejudice suffered by the defendant as\na result of the alleged deficiencies.”). We must determine\nwhether this decision was “contrary to, or involved an\nunreasonable application of,” Strickland or other Supreme\nCourt precedent in existence at the time of its opinion.\n§ 2254(d)(1); see Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 182–83.\n\n    In considering whether any deficiency by Andrews’s\ncounsel was prejudicial, the California Supreme Court\ncorrectly followed Strickland in asking whether, even if\ncounsel were deficient, Andrews’s defense was not\nprejudiced by any such deficiency because a different result\nwas not reasonably probable. See In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at\n671 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694). The California\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              49\n\nSupreme Court then reasonably carried out the three steps\nindicated by Supreme Court opinions for evaluating prejudice\nunder Strickland at the penalty phase.11\n\n                                    1\n\n    The court first considered the totality of the mitigating\nevidence presented at trial, as well as what mitigating\nevidence could have been presented by a competent attorney,\nbased on the six-year review and report by the referee. See\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 397–98. The court reviewed all of the\nmitigating evidence that Andrews presented, including\nAndrews’s family background, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 660,\n670, incarceration in Mt. Meigs and in Alabama prisons,12 id.\n\n 11\n    Andrews argues that the California Supreme Court failed to apply the\ncorrect legal standard for determining whether counsel provided deficient\nperformance at the penalty phase. Specifically, Andrews argues that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court failed to follow Tennard v. Dretke and Smith v.\nTexas, which hold that evidence can be mitigating even if it is not\n“uniquely severe” or does not have a “nexus” to the crime. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136994\"><a href=\"/opinion/136994/tennard-v-dretke-director-texas-department-of-criminal-justice/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n287 (2004); </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"137727\"><a href=\"/opinion/137727/smith-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 44–45 (2004). This argument misconstrues the\nCalifornia Supreme Court opinion. In determining that counsel could\nhave made a strategic decision not to present tangential evidence that\ncould cut both ways, the court expressly considered the purportedly\nmitigating evidence. On its face, such an approach is not equivalent to\nholding that certain evidence is per se not mitigating and declining to\nconsider it. Cf. Eddings, 455 U.S. at 114–15 (“The sentencer . . . may\ndetermine the weight to be given relevant mitigating evidence. But\n[courts] may not give it no weight by excluding such evidence from their\nconsideration.”).\n 12\n    Andrews’s claim that the state court failed to consider his experiences\nat Mt. Meigs, is not supported by the record. The state court detailed\nAndrews’s experiences at Mt. Meigs when discussing mitigating evidence\nthat could have been presented, noting that “[a]t Mt. Meigs, [Andrews]\nencountered appalling conditions” and detailing the referee’s findings that\nAndrews “was subjected to beatings, brutality, inadequate conditions and\n\f50                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nat 660–61, 670–71, and mental health evidence, id. at 661–62,\n670, observing that the similar types of mitigating evidence\nhave been considered in Supreme Court precedent, id. at\n672–75; see Penry, 492 U.S. at 319; Williams, 529 U.S. at\n395–98.\n\n    The California Supreme Court then evaluated the strength\nof this mitigating evidence by considering, among other\nthings, whether it might be viewed by a jury as aggravating.\nSee Burger, 483 U.S. at 793; Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 201–02.\nThe court reasonably concluded that much of the evidence\nidentified as mitigating “was not conclusively and\nunambiguously mitigating,” and it evaluated the possibility\nthat the evidence could be rebutted or used to Andrews’s\ndisadvantage, or that cross examination might “deflate the\nmitigating impact” of the evidence. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d\nat 670 & n.9. The court reasonably observed that a jury could\nhave determined that Andrews’s family background did not\nreduce his moral culpability, given that Andrews was raised\nin a non-abusive, stable family situation. Id. at 670; cf. Bell,\n535 U.S. at 701–02 (suggesting that evidence of a normal\nyouth might “cut the other way”). The court reasonably\nconcluded that “[Andrews] did not suffer a home\nenvironment that would place his crimes in any\nunderstandable context or explain his resorting to crime every\n\n\nsexual predators,” that “[h]is passiveness and small physique caused him\nto be a target of older, tougher boys, from whom no protection or\nseparation was provided,” and that “Mt. Meigs failed to provide any\nmeaningful rehabilitative or educational opportunities.” In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 660–61 (internal quotation marks omitted). The state court also\nnoted that expert testimony would have addressed his drug use at Mt.\nMeigs. Id. at 661. Moreover, the state court’s use of the term “prison\nconditions” in its opinion is consistent with its use in the referee’s report,\nwhere the term referred to conditions both in prison and Mt. Meigs.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              51\n\ntime he was released or escaped from prison.” In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 670.\n\n    In addition, the California Supreme Court reasonably\ndetermined that the evidence regarding the prison conditions\nwas double-edged. On the one hand, the prison conditions\nevidence left it in “no doubt [that Andrews] endured\nhorrifically demeaning and degrading circumstances.” Id.\nOn the other hand, the evidence would be presented primarily\nthrough the testimony of Andrews’s former fellow inmates,\nwho had serious criminal records that could “draw[] an\nunfavorable comparison” with Andrews. Id. at 671. “Many\nhad themselves engaged in brutality while in prison and\nescaped with some frequency,” also similar to Andrews. Id.\nMoreover, no matter how the prison conditions evidence was\npresented, “[r]ather than engendering sympathy, the evidence\ncould well have reinforced an impression of him as a person\nwho had become desensitized and inured to violence and\ndisrespect for the law.”13 Id.; cf. Pinholster, 563 U.S. at\n201–02.\n\n    The dissent claims that the California Supreme Court was\nunreasonable in concluding that the Mt. Meigs evidence\ncould have constituted a double-edged sword because “[t]he\njury already knew from Andrews’s heinous crimes of\nconviction and from the stipulated prior convictions that\nAndrews was antisocial and ‘had become desensitized and\ninured to violence and disrespect for the law.’” Dissent at\n\n    13\n       Andrews argues that the state court made an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts, see § 2254(d)(2), in holding that the prison\nconditions evidence could be aggravating. We reject this argument,\nbecause the state court’s conclusion is a reasonable application of the\nprejudice standard elaborated by Strickland and its progeny, not a factual\nfinding. Cf. Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 201–02.\n\f52                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n119–120. However, the dissent’s conclusion is factually\nincorrect. Because the stipulation presented to the jury did\nnot describe the facts of each of the offenses underlying\nAndrews’s prior convictions, the jury did not hear that\nAndrews held a woman hostage with a gun to her head when\nrobbing a laundry business or that the taxi driver in the 1968\nrobbery heard Andrews say “[l]et’s shoot him” and then fired\nat least two shots at him. See supra at 21–22. Accordingly,\nthe California Supreme Court did not err in concluding that\nevidence of prison conditions was double-edged.\n\n                               2\n\n     Consistent with Supreme Court precedent, the California\nSupreme Court not only assessed the weight of the mitigating\nevidence and its likely impact on a jury but also evaluated the\nweight of the aggravating evidence at trial, as well as any\nadditional rebuttal evidence that could have been introduced.\nSee Williams, 529 U.S. at 397–98; Belmontes, 558 U.S. at 20,\n24–28. Turning to the circumstances of Andrews’s crimes,\nthe California Supreme Court stated that the murders showed\na “callous disregard for human life.” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d\nat 671; cf. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 674, 700; Belmontes,\n558 U.S. at 15, 26–27. Andrews did not impulsively react to\na situation that got out of hand; rather, he interacted with the\nvictims in a calm and normal manner before torturing and\nkilling them. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 671. He also did\nmore than simply kill the victims. He raped and sodomized\nBrandon before murdering her, and he also murdered\nWheeler and Chism with “considerable violence and evident\nsangfroid.” Id. The state court also considered that, as\nrebuttal evidence, the prosecution could have presented the\ndetails of Andrews’s criminal history, cf. Bell, 535 U.S. at\n700 & n.5; Burger, 483 U.S. at 793, from which the jury\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              53\n\nmight conclude Andrews was “aggressive and desensitized to\nviolence,” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 669. The jury might also\nhave concluded that this “pattern of criminality” showed\nAndrews “would pose a danger to others if he were sentenced\nto life imprisonment.”14 Id. Also, the references to\nAndrews’s multiple escapes from prison might have been\n“inflammatory.” Id.\n\n    Finally, the California Supreme Court reasonably\nconcluded that the prosecution could have presented its own\nmental health experts in rebuttal, and could have used the\nmental health evidence to Andrews’s disadvantage on cross\nexamination. Id. at 670. The court noted the referee’s\nfindings that prosecution experts could have testified that\nAndrews had normal intelligence and did not suffer brain\n\n\n\n\n  14\n     Andrews argues that the state court’s conclusion that the evidence\ngave rise to the inference of future dangerousness was an unreasonable\ndetermination of the facts. He argues that the prison stabbings, laundry\nrobbery, and conditioning to violence during his prison experiences do not\nsupport such an inference, pointing to mitigating facts found by the\nreferee, including that in some incidents, Andrews was defending himself\nagainst inmates who had been threatening him. We disagree. The state\ncourt considered these mitigating facts (such as evidence that in prison\nAndrews was “the prey rather than the predator” and acted in self\ndefense), see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 660–61, and reasonably concluded\nthat the evidence that Andrews was conditioned to violence during his\nprison experiences was an aggravating, not mitigating, circumstance, see\nBurger, 483 U.S. at 793 (noting that evidence of a petitioner’s troubled\nfamily background could also “suggest violent tendencies” that could\naffect the jury adversely). Because the state court reasonably concluded\nthat the jury could have found future dangerousness even had the\nmitigating evidence been introduced, the state court did not unreasonably\napply Supreme Court precedent in weighing how the evidence might\nimpact a jury.\n\f54                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ndamage, but had antisocial personality traits.15 Id.; cf.\nPinholster, 563 U.S. at 173, 201. Nor was the state court\nunreasonable in concluding that Andrews’s experts’\ntestimony could backfire. For instance, the court noted that\nthe “compelling” testimony from one of Andrews’s expert\npsychiatric witnesses, opining that Andrews’s prison\nexperience caused him to react with rage to perceived insults,\ncould cause a jury to conclude that Andrews “was unable to\ncontrol lethal impulses on the slightest provocation.” In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 670; cf. Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 201–02.\nFinally, the presentation of the mental health evidence would\nhave given the prosecutor additional opportunities to repeat\nthe circumstances of these crimes as well as Andrews’s past\ncriminality. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670.\n\n                                    3\n\n    After evaluating the mitigating and aggravating evidence,\nthe California Supreme Court re-weighed it and assessed\nwhether it was reasonably probable that, in the absence of any\ndeficient performance by counsel, the sentencer “would have\nconcluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances did not warrant death.” Strickland, 466 U.S.\nat 695; see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 671–75. The state court\napplied the relevant Supreme Court precedent, and concluded\nthat Andrews was not “prejudiced by counsel’s rejection of\n\n\n  15\n     Andrews argues that the state court unreasonably applied Eddings,\n455 U.S. at 114–15, in concluding that a diagnosis of antisocial\npersonality disorder is not mitigating. Eddings is not on point, because it\nmerely held that a court cannot prevent a jury from hearing such evidence.\nId. The state court did not unreasonably apply Eddings, or any other\nSupreme Court precedent, by observing that evidence that Andrews had\nantisocial personality disorder might make him less sympathetic to the\njury. In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670–71.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             55\n\na defense premised on evidence of [Andrews]’s upbringing,\nthe Alabama prison conditions he experienced, and his mental\nhealth in light of the circumstances of the crimes, given the\nambiguous nature of some mitigating evidence and the\nsubstantial potential for damaging rebuttal.” In re Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 671. Indeed, the California Supreme Court\nconcluded that “[w]ith respect to the question of prejudice”\nthe record “contains no indication the jury was inclined to\nsentence petitioner to life imprisonment and might have been\npersuaded by additional or alternate mitigation evidence.” Id.\nat 675–76. Accordingly, the California Supreme Court\nreasonably concluded that even if counsel were deficient,\nAndrews’s defense was not prejudiced by any such\ndeficiency. Id. Because this is not an objectively\nunreasonable application of Strickland, the district court erred\nin granting Andrews relief on this issue.\n\n   Relying on the Supreme Court’s decisions in Williams\nand Porter, Andrews argues that the California Supreme\nCourt’s decision on the issue of prejudice was an\nunreasonable application of Strickland.16 We disagree.\n\n    In Williams, the police found a man dead in his residence.\n529 U.S. at 367. There was no indication of a struggle so\nlocal officials concluded that the cause of death was alcohol\npoisoning and closed the case. Id. The defendant, who had\nbeen arrested for an unrelated offense, wrote a letter to the\npolice confessing he had killed a man by striking him in the\nchest and back after an argument, thus “alerting police to a\n\n\n 16\n    While Andrews cites other Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit cases, his\nargument focuses primarily on Williams and Porter. Because other cases\ncited by Andrews are non-binding, not factually analogous, or both, we do\nnot address them here.\n\f56                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ncrime they otherwise would never have discovered,\nexpressing remorse for his actions, and cooperating with the\npolice after that.” Id. at 367–68 & n.1, 398.17\n\n    The defendant’s counsel began to prepare for the penalty\nphase only a week before trial, and even then counsel did not\nreview defendant’s juvenile and social services records\nbecause counsel incorrectly believed that state law barred\naccess to these records. Id. at 373, 395. Counsel thus failed\nto discover documents that “graphically describe[d]\n[defendant’s] nightmarish childhood.” Id. at 395. The\nevidence showed that defendant’s “parents had been\nimprisoned for the criminal neglect of [defendant] and his\nsiblings, that [defendant] had been severely and repeatedly\nbeaten by his father, that he had been committed to the\ncustody of the social services bureau for two years during his\nparents’ incarceration (including one stint in an abusive foster\nhome), and then, after his parents were released from prison,\nhad been returned to his parents’ custody.” Id. The records\n\n  17\n      The dissent relies on Justice Rehnquist’s concurring and dissenting\nopinion in Williams, which described additional aggravating factors\nbeyond the crime itself. See Dissent at 114–115 (stating that the jury\nheard evidence that “Williams savagely beat an elderly woman, stole two\ncars, set fire to a home, stabbed a man during a robbery, set fire to the city\njail, and confessed to having strong urges to choke other inmates and to\nbreak a fellow prisoner’s jaw”) (citing Williams, 529 U.S. at 418\n(Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)). But under\nAEDPA, neither concurring nor dissenting opinions, nor circuit court\ndecisions (particularly one reversed by the Supreme Court, see Dissent at\n114–115), constitute clearly established Supreme Court precedent. See\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 412 (stating that only the Supreme Court’s\n“holdings, as opposed to the dicta” constitute clearly established Federal\nlaw); Glebe v. Frost, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">135</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In addition, counsel failed to\nreturn the phone call of a character witness who had offered\nto testify “that he had visited [defendant] frequently when\n[defendant] was incarcerated as part of a prison ministry\nprogram, that [defendant] ‘seemed to thrive in a more\nregimented and structured environment,’ and that [defendant]\nwas proud of the carpentry degree he earned while in prison.”\nId.\n\n     Finally, at sentencing,“[t]he weight of defense counsel’s\nclosing . . . was devoted to explaining that it was difficult to\nfind a reason why the jury should spare [defendant’s] life.”\nId. at 369; see also id. at 369 n.2 (quoting defense counsel as\ntelling the jury “‘I will admit too that it is very difficult to ask\nyou to show mercy to a man who maybe has not shown much\nmercy himself. I doubt very seriously that he thought much\nabout mercy when he was in [the victim’s] bedroom that\n\f58                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nnight with him. . . . Admittedly it is very difficult to get us\nand ask that you give this man mercy when he has shown so\nlittle of it himself.’”). The Supreme Court held that the state\ncourt applied the wrong legal standard in determining\nprejudice because it required “a separate inquiry into\nfundamental fairness,” id. at 393, even when the petitioner\nshowed there was a reasonable probability of a different\noutcome, id. at 393–95. Therefore, the Court applied\nStrickland de novo to these facts, id. at 397–98; see also\nPinholster, 563 U.S. at 202.\n\n    The state court here discussed Williams at length and\nreasonably distinguished it as having “substantially dissimilar\nfacts.” In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 675. In Williams, for\ninstance, the defense counsel could have introduced strong\ncharacter evidence regarding his exemplary conduct in prison,\n529 U.S. at 398, but no comparable evidence of good\ncharacter was present in Andrews’s case.18 The defendant’s\n“nightmarish childhood” in Williams, 529 U.S. at 395, was\nfar worse than Andrews’s relatively stable family\nbackground, see In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 674. The\ndefendant in Williams was “borderline mentally retarded,”\n529 U.S. at 396, 398 (internal quotation marks omitted),\nwhile the prosecution could have presented evidence that\nAndrews was not mentally impaired, but rather had antisocial\npersonality traits, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670. Although\nthe prosecutor in Williams could have introduced rebuttal\nevidence that defendant had been “thrice committed to the\njuvenile system—for aiding and abetting larceny when he\nwas 11 years old, for pulling a false fire alarm when he was\n\n\n  18\n     Andrews points to evidence that he appeared to adjust well to the\nAlabama prison system when conditions permitted, but this observation\nis weaker than the evidence in Williams. See 529 U.S. at 396.\n\f                         ANDREWS V. DAVIS                              59\n\n12, and for breaking and entering when he was 15,” 529 U.S.\nat 396, such evidence has much less weight compared to\nAndrews’s robbery-murder, hostage taking, and history of\nescapes from prison, In re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 675. Finally,\nthe circumstances of the crime in Williams were less brutal\nthan Andrews’s rape and triple murder. Id.19 Because the\nfacts of Williams are dissimilar, the Supreme Court’s\ndetermination in Williams that counsel’s ineffective\nassistance was prejudicial does not make the state court’s\ncontrary conclusion here unreasonable. See Richter, 562 U.S.\nat 101–02; see also Pinholster, 563 U.S. at 202–03.\n\n    Andrews also argues that the California Supreme Court’s\ndecision was unreasonable in light of Porter. Although\nPorter was decided years after the California Supreme\nCourt’s opinion in this case, we give its prejudice analysis\ncareful consideration, because Porter considered prejudice\nunder AEDPA, and therefore provides direction for\ndetermining what constitutes an unreasonable application of\nthe prejudice prong of Strickland under AEDPA.\nNevertheless, we conclude that Porter does not help Andrews\nhere.\n\n\n 19\n    The dissent fails to engage with these distinctions and the evidence at\nissue. Instead, the dissent conducts a de novo review, and concludes that\nthe aggravating evidence admitted at trial and the evidence that could have\nbeen offered in rebuttal against Andrews was “no greater than the\naggravating evidence in Williams.” Dissent at 115. The dissent\nmisunderstands our role. We must determine whether the California\nSupreme Court’s application of Williams was objectively unreasonable\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1), not whether we would have reached a\ndifferent result under de novo review. “In order for a state court’s\ndecision to be an unreasonable application of [the Supreme] Court’s case\nlaw, the ruling must be objectively unreasonable, not merely wrong; even\nclear error will not suffice.” Virginia v.

The\ndefendant was convicted of both murders, and the jury\nrecommended the death sentence. Id. at 32. The state\nsupreme court affirmed, but struck the “heinous, atrocious, or\ncruel aggravating factor,” because the evidence was\n“consistent with the hypothesis that [defendant’s] was a crime\nof passion, not a crime that was meant to be deliberately and\nextraordinarily painful.” Id. at 33.\n\n    The defendant represented himself during the guilt phase,\nid. at 32, and his counsel “had only one short meeting with\n[defendant] regarding the penalty phase,” id. at 39.

The Court\nreasoned that “[o]ur Nation has a long tradition of according\nleniency to veterans in recognition of their service, especially\nfor those who fought on the front lines as [defendant] did,”\nand that the “relevance of [defendant’s] extensive combat\nexperience is not only that he served honorably under\nextreme hardship and gruesome conditions, but also that the\njury might find mitigating the intense stress and mental and\nemotional toll that combat took on [defendant].” Id. 43–44.\n“To conclude otherwise,” the Court opined, “reflects a failure\nto engage with what [defendant] actually went through in\nKorea.” Id. at 44. Further, the Court held that the state court\nwas “unreasonable to discount to irrelevance the evidence of\n[defendant’s] abusive childhood, especially when that kind of\nhistory may have particular salience for a jury evaluating\n[defendant’s] behavior in his relationship with [his former\ngirlfriend].” Id. at 43.\n\n    The Court’s reasoning in Porter does not lead to the\nconclusion that the California Supreme Court unreasonably\napplied the prejudice prong of Strickland here. Unlike the\nstate court in Porter, the California Supreme Court\nconsidered all mitigation evidence in the record and did not\nfail to consider or “discount to irrelevance” significant\nevidence. See id. The most important mitigation evidence in\n\f62                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nPorter, that the defendant served in “the most critical—and\nhorrific—battles of the Korean War,” see id. at 41, is far\nstronger than the mitigation evidence at issue here.\nMoreover, Andrews did not have an abusive home life, and\nthere is no evidence that his murders in this case were crimes\nof passion for which childhood abuse would have “particular\nsalience for a jury” in evaluating his behavior. See id. at 43.\n\n     Further, the aggravating circumstances in Porter were\ndifferent and less weighty than those in this case. Indeed,\nPorter noted that the state court had stricken the “heinous,\natrocious, or cruel” aggravating factor because the evidence\nin the record was “consistent with the hypothesis that Porter’s\nwas a crime of passion, not a crime that was meant to be\ndeliberately and extraordinarily painful,” id. at 33, while here\nthe California Supreme Court found that Andrews’s brutal\nrape and strangulation of Brandon, and the shooting and\nstrangling deaths of the other victims, evidenced a “callous\ndisregard for human life” and were accomplished with\n“considerable violence and evident sangfroid,” In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 671.20 Because Porter is factually\ndistinct from this case, it has little bearing on the question\nwhether the state court unreasonably applied the prejudice\nprong of Strickland.21\n\n  20\n     The dissent claims that the prosecutor presented “a strong case in\naggravation” in Porter, and therefore the conclusion in Porter must apply\nin this case. Dissent at 118. But unlike the case before us, Porter held\nthat the sentencing judge had misjudged the weight of the aggravating\nevidence, and “the weight of evidence in aggravation is not as substantial\nas the sentencing judge thought.” Porter, 558 U.S. at 41. The aggravating\nevidence in this case cannot similarly be minimized.\n 21\n   Andrews also urges us to apply our decision in Doe v.

Visciotti, a Supreme Court case that provides\ndirection for determining under AEDPA what constitutes an\nunreasonable application of Strickland, is more closely on\npoint.22 In Visciotti, the Supreme Court considered a state\ncourt’s rejection of a defendant’s Strickland claim. 537 U.S.\nat 26. The state court had weighed the mitigating evidence,\nincluding the defendant’s brain damage, difficult family\nbackground, and possible seizure disorder, against the\naggravating factors, including the circumstances of the crime\n(the cold-blooded killing of two victims during a robbery)\nand his criminal history of knifing a man and stabbing a\npregnant woman in bed “trying to protect her unborn baby,”\nand concluded that the defendant had suffered no prejudice.\nSee id. at 25–26. After the defendant filed a habeas petition,\nthe district court granted relief, and we affirmed. We\nreasoned that counsel’s deficient performance was\nprejudicial, because the “aggravating factors were not\noverwhelming.” Id. at 21–22, 25 (quoting Visciotti v.\n\n\npresent mitigating evidence, including evidence of his rape in prison. Doe\nis not pertinent to our analysis here because it is a pre-AEDPA case that\ndoes not examine whether the state court’s conclusion was unreasonable.\nSee id. at 428, 446 n.31. Nor is Doe clearly established law as determined\nby the Supreme Court. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1).\n 22\n    Although Visciotti was decided after the California Supreme Court’s\ndecision in this case, we give it careful consideration because it addresses\nthe AEDPA question whether a state court’s adjudication of an ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim was an unreasonable application of Strickland.\nSee supra at 39–40; see also Dissent at 116–117 & n.9 (acknowledging\nthat Supreme Court opinions analyzing AEDPA are relevant to a circuit\ncourt’s AEDPA analysis, regardless whether those opinions were decided\nbefore or after the last reasoned opinion of the state court). The dissent\nhighlights that Visciotti was “decided after the California Supreme Court’s\ndecision in this case,” Dissent at 118, but given the dissent’s\nacknowledgment that our consideration of a Supreme Court opinion\nanalyzing AEDPA is proper, the meaning of this emphasis is unclear.\n\f64                      ANDREWS V.

The\nSupreme Court reversed.             It explained that “under\n§ 2254(d)(1), it is not enough to convince a federal habeas\ncourt that, in its independent judgment, the state-court\ndecision applied Strickland incorrectly.” Id. at 27 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). Rather, “[t]he federal habeas\nscheme leaves primary responsibility with the state courts for\nthese judgments, and authorizes federal-court intervention\nonly when a state-court decision is objectively unreasonable.\nIt is not that here.” Id. In sum, the Court held that “[w]hether\nor not we would reach the same conclusion as the California\nSupreme Court, we think at the very least that the state\ncourt’s contrary assessment was not ‘unreasonable.’” Id.\n(quoting Bell, 535 U.S. at 701) (internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n    Here, as in Visciotti, the state court reweighed Andrews’s\nmitigating evidence against the brutal circumstances of the\ncrime and Andrews’s prior criminal history, and determined\nthere was no reasonable probability that the sentencer would\ndetermine that “the balance of aggravating and mitigating\nfactors did not warrant imposition of the death penalty.” Id.\nat 22 (internal quotation marks omitted). This decision was\nnot objectively unreasonable, and therefore we are bound to\nconclude that “[w]hether or not we would reach the same\nconclusion,” we cannot say the California Supreme Court’s\nconclusion was an unreasonable application of Strickland.\nSee id. at 27.23\n\n\n 23\n    The fact that our decision in this case was originally unanimous, see\nAndrews v.

Here, the\nCalifornia Supreme Court determined that there was not a\nreasonable probability that the outcome would have been\ndifferent had the evidence adduced at the reference hearing\n(along with the rebuttal evidence) been presented to the jury.\nIn re Andrews, 52 P.3d at 671, 675–76. The dissent does\nnot—and cannot—explain why the court’s conclusion is an\nobjectively unreasonable application of then-existing\nSupreme Court precedent. The dissent points to Williams,\nDissent at 114–116, but makes no effort to explain the flaw\nin the California Supreme Court’s “principled distinction” of\nthis case. Murdoch, 609 F.3d at 991; see supra at 58–59.\nNor does the dissent meaningfully engage with the facts of\nPorter or dispute the numerous distinctions addressed above.\nSee supra at 59–62; Dissent at 116–118.24\n\n    The dissent fails to address the pertinent question, which\n“‘is not whether a federal court believes the state court’s\ndetermination’ under the Strickland standard ‘was incorrect\nbut whether that determination was unreasonable—a\nsubstantially higher threshold.’” Knowles v.

Instead, the dissent concludes\nthat the California Supreme Court unreasonably applied\nStrickland based on the dissent’s own view that “at least one\njuror” would be inclined to “spare Andrews’s life” if\nevidence of the abuse at Mt. Meigs had been presented.\nDissent at 92; see id. at 92, 111, 120. This approach would\nbe wrong even under de novo review. The dissent’s limited\nfocus on a single piece of evidence fails to take into account\nthe totality of the mitigating and aggravating evidence in the\nrecord. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695. In this context, the\ndissent’s supposition that one juror would have been moved\namounts to little more than a mere possibility of a different\noutcome, where the Supreme Court has made clear that “[t]he\nlikelihood of a different result must be substantial, not just\nconceivable.” Richter, 562 U.S. at 112 (citing Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 693).\n\n    The dissent’s errors are even more glaring on AEDPA\nreview. The Court has told us frequently and emphatically\nthat “[i]t is not enough that a federal habeas court, in its\nindependent review of the legal question, is left with a firm\nconviction that the state court was erroneous.” Lockyer,\n538 U.S. at 75 (internal quotation marks and citations\nomitted). Rather, the state court’s decision “must be\nobjectively unreasonable,” id., considering “the totality of the\nevidence before the judge or jury,” Strickland, 466 U.S. at\n695. Here, rather than apply AEDPA deference, the dissent\nsteps into the shoes of the dissenting justice of the California\nSupreme Court in this case, see Dissent at 98, 100–104,\n107–108, 116, and applies Strickland de novo. Indeed, the\ndissent even makes its own factual findings. See Dissent at\n107, 115 (discounting the substantial rebuttal evidence that\nwould have been presented at sentencing on the ground that\nthe prosecutor from Andrews’s trial would not have\n\f                        ANDREWS V.

Such review is erroneous under AEDPA. In taking this\nde novo approach, the dissent has failed to grapple with “the\nonly question that matters under § 2254(d)(1),” Lockyer,\n538 U.S. at 71, whether the state court’s application of the\nclearly established Supreme Court precedent was objectively\nunreasonable.\n\n   Because the state court’s rejection of Andrews’s penalty\nphase ineffective assistance of counsel claim was not contrary\nto or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court\nprecedent, we may not grant relief on this claim.\n§ 2254(d)(1). We therefore reverse the district court’s\ncontrary conclusion.\n\n                                   D\n\n    Because we decide Andrews’s claim on prejudice\ngrounds, we need not address the parties’ arguments\nregarding whether counsel’s performance was deficient at the\npenalty phase. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 697.25 Suffice it to\nsay, the dissent fails to conduct an AEDPA analysis of the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s determination that Andrews’s\nattorney was not deficient under Strickland. Instead, as we\nhave previously noted, supra at 25 n.3, 26–27 n.4, 28 n.5,\n28–29 n.6, 30 n.7, 30–31 n.8, 33–34 n.9, the dissent engages\nin de novo review of both the facts and the law at issue, see\n\n\n  25\n     We also need not consider the additional aggravating evidence put\nforth by the state, which Andrews disputes, and therefore deny the state’s\nmotion for judicial notice of these additional materials.\n\f68                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nDissent at 96–111, and relies on cases that were not clearly\nestablished at the time of the California Supreme Court’s\nruling, see, e.g., Dissent at 100, 106 (relying on the deficiency\nanalysis of Porter, which was decided years after the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s opinion in this case and reviewed\nthe issue of deficiency de novo). And in reaching its de novo\nconclusion that “any competent attorney would have\npresented” the Mt. Meigs evidence, Dissent at 109, the\ndissent ignores “the doubly deferential judicial review that\napplies to a Strickland claim evaluated under the § 2254(d)(1)\nstandard,” Mirzayance, 556 U.S. at 123. Accordingly, the\ndissent fails to raise any serious questions regarding the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s analysis of Strickland’s\ndeficiency prong.\n\n                               III\n\n    Having addressed the state’s cross-appeal, we now turn to\nAndrews’s appeal of the district court’s dismissal of his sole\ncertified claim (Claim 25) that California’s use of its lethal\ninjection protocol to execute him would violate his Eighth\nAmendment rights. According to the district court, the\nCalifornia lethal injection protocol mirrored the Kentucky\nlethal injection protocol upheld by the Supreme Court against\nan Eighth Amendment challenge in Baze v.

The court reasoned that in light of Baze’s ruling, it\nwould be impossible for Andrews to succeed on his challenge\nto California’s lethal injection protocol, and therefore rejected\nthis claim.\n\n    At the time the district court ruled in July 2009, California\ndid not have a lethal injection protocol in place.

Sims, 216 Cal. App. 4th at 1064–65. In\nresponse to a new legal challenge, a trial court again invalidated the\nCDCR lethal injection procedure for failure to comply with the state\nadministrative procedure act and permanently enjoined the CDCR from\nadministering executions by lethal injection until it promulgated new\nregulations. Id. at 1066–67. This injunction was upheld on appeal. Id. at\n1083–84. The CDCR proposed a new single-drug lethal injection protocol\nin November 2015.

Jennings held\nthat a habeas petitioner in such circumstances need not take\na cross-appeal so long as the petitioner did not attempt to\ndefend the district court’s judgment on a theory that seeks “to\nenlarge his rights or lessen the State’s under the District\nCourt’s judgment granting habeas relief.” Id. at 798,\n801–02.29 Further, because “§ 2253(c) applies only when ‘an\nappeal’ is ‘taken to the court of appeals,’” id. at 802 (quoting\n§ 2253(c)), a petitioner who does not have to take a cross-\nappeal does not need a COA, id. Applying this rule, Jennings\nnoted that the district court’s judgment granting the petitioner\nrelief at the penalty phase of his trial entitled him “to release,\nresentencing, or commutation, at the State’s option.” Id. at\n799.

Neither\na cross-appeal nor a COA would be required. Id. at 800–02.\nBy contrast, “[a] habeas applicant who has won resentencing\nwould be required to take a cross-appeal in order to raise a\nrejected claim that would result in a new trial.” Id. at 800.\nAnd “if a habeas applicant has won retrial below, a claim that\nhis conduct was constitutionally beyond the power of the\nState to punish would require cross-appeal.” Id. In both such\ncases, a COA would also have been required. See id. at 802.\n\n    Here, Andrews won relief at the district court based on his\ntheory of ineffective assistance of counsel during the penalty\nphase of his trial. The district court ordered that “the State of\nCalifornia shall, within 120 days from the entry of this\nJudgment, either grant Petitioner a new penalty phase trial, or\nvacate the death sentence and resentence the Petitioner in\naccordance with California law and the United States\nConstitution.” Accordingly, Andrews’s rights under this\njudgment were for a new penalty phase trial or resentencing\nwithin a fixed time, and Andrews may urge any potential\nclaim present in the record that would entitle him to a new\npenalty phase trial or resentencing without taking a cross-\nappeal or obtaining a COA. See id. at 800–02.\n\n    But none of Andrews’s uncertified claims support the\ndistrict court’s judgment. Five of his claims seek a new guilt\nphase trial (his Strickland, Brady/Napue, Trombetta, and\ncumulative error claims, and a factual innocence claim).30 As\n\n\n 30\n    While the Supreme Court has not ruled on the question whether a free-\nstanding claim of factual innocence is cognizable in habeas, it has\nsuggested that success on such a claim (if cognizable) would entitle a\n\f                        ANDREWS V.

His Lackey claim seeks a ruling\nthat the state cannot constitutionally impose the death penalty\non him. Because the district court’s order gave the state the\nright to seek the death penalty at a new penalty phase trial,\nAndrews’s Lackey and factual innocence claims seek to\n“lessen the State’s [rights] under the District Court’s\njudgment granting habeas relief.” Id. at 798.

Specifically, the\nstate argues that a Lackey claim is an individual challenge,\nbased on the theory that executing a prisoner who has spent\n\f78                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nmany years on death row violates the prohibition on cruel and\nunusual punishment of that prisoner, while Jones was based\non the theory that the California system itself creates the\nconstitutional infirmity, because inordinate delay makes the\nsystem arbitrary and unable to serve a deterrent or retributive\npurpose, in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n\n    We disagree that Andrews is raising a systemic challenge\nto California’s administration of its death penalty system,\nwhich would be a new and unexhausted claim. Rather,\nAndrews’s claim before the state court, the district court, and\non appeal here is essentially the same constitutional claim:\nthat his right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment\nunder the Eighth Amendment is violated by his lengthy\nincarceration while under a sentence of death. Andrews has\nnot introduced any new facts or evidence since he raised this\nargument to the state court. Andrews’s supplemental brief\npoints to Jones’s conclusion that there are systemic delays in\nimposing the death penalty throughout the California system,\nbut uses this conclusion to support his Lackey claim that\n“inherent delay in capital cases” renders executions\nunconstitutional. Accordingly, Andrews’s references to\nJones do not “fundamentally alter the legal claim already\nconsidered by the state courts.” Dickens, 740 F.3d at 1318\n(internal quotation marks omitted). We therefore conclude\nthat Andrews’s uncertified claim, as briefed on appeal, is\nsufficiently related and intertwined with Claim 26 such that\nAndrews’s exhaustion of Claim 26 likewise exhausted his\ncurrent challenge. See Lounsbury, 374 F.3d at 788.\nMoreover, Andrews raised this same claim to the district\ncourt. Accordingly, Andrews exhausted this delay claim and\ndid not waive it.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                         79\n\n    We now consider Andrews’s motion for a COA for this\nclaim. The district court denied Claim 26 because the state\ncourt’s rejection of this claim was not an unreasonable\napplication of Supreme Court precedent. No reasonable jurist\nwould find the district court’s ruling debatable or wrong. See\nSlack, 529 U.S. at 484. As we have previously stated in the\nAEDPA context, no clearly established Supreme Court\nprecedent holds that inordinate delay in the execution of a\ncapital defendant constitutes cruel and unusual punishment in\nviolation of the Eighth Amendment. Allen, 435 F.3d at\n958–60. Andrews argues that the state court’s rejection of his\ndelay claim is contrary to Furman, 408 U.S. at 311–12\n(White, J., concurring), and Gregg, 428 U.S. at 188 (plurality\nopinion). But these cases articulate a general Eighth\nAmendment standard that the death penalty is\nunconstitutional if imposed arbitrarily, or if the penalty itself\ndoes not serve the penological purposes of deterrence and\nretribution. These principles do not “squarely address[]” the\nspecific issue raised by Andrews’s delay claim, and would\nrequire a significant extension of the rationale of Furman and\nGregg to apply in this particular context. See Van Patten,\n552 U.S. at 125–26.\n\n    We reached a similar determination in Jones v. Davis,\nwhere we held that neither Furman nor Gregg established the\nrule that the Eighth Amendment barred delays in resolving\npost-conviction proceedings. See 806 F.3d at 551. In light of\nthe Supreme Court’s rule that “federal courts may not\nconsider novel constitutional theories on habeas review,” id.\nat 541 (citing Teague v. Lane, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1989)), we\nconcluded that neither a Lackey claim nor a systemic\nchallenge to California’s death penalty system was\ncognizable in federal habeas proceedings.

Therefore, the\nstate court’s rejection of Andrews’s delay claim was not an\nunreasonable application of Furman or Gregg, and reasonable\njurists would not dispute the district court’s conclusion to that\neffect. See Woodall, 134 S. Ct. at 1706–07. Therefore, the\nstate court’s rejection of Andrews’s delay claim was not an\nunreasonable application of Furman or Gregg, and reasonable\njurists would not dispute the district court’s conclusion to that\neffect. See Woodall, 134 S. Ct. at 1706–07.\n\n    Because Andrews has not made a “substantial showing”\nthat his Eighth Amendment rights were violated, see\n28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2), we deny a COA for this claim.\n\n                               B\n\n    We next turn to Andrews’s four uncertified claims\nalleging that trial counsel were ineffective under Strickland\nfor failing to investigate and present four categories of\nevidence.\n\n     The first claim relates to the police’s investigation of\nsuspects before Sanders was arrested and agreed to testify\npursuant to a plea agreement. During the investigation,\npolice officers took statements from at least nine witnesses\nand informally interviewed many others who provided\ninformation about activities in and around Wheeler’s\napartment in the days leading up to the murders. According\nto these statements, Wheeler’s drug customers frequented his\napartment, disturbances were a regular occurrence, and\nshootings had occurred in the apartment. The police did not\nfind any corroborating physical or testimonial evidence\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       81\n\nsuggesting that any of these drug customers was the killer.\nWhen investigating Wheeler’s apartment, the police found\nfingerprints of individuals who had been seen in the\napartment on the evening the murders occurred, but nothing\nlinking them to the crime. The police arrested one drug\ndealer who worked with Wheeler, but ultimately released\nhim. When interrogated, this drug dealer denied murdering\nWheeler, but told the police that a Mexican Mafia member\nhad told him that the Mexican Mafia had murdered Wheeler.\nHe did not provide any corroborating evidence to support this\nstory.\n\n    Relying on this evidence, Andrews claims that his trial\ncounsel were ineffective for failing to investigate and present\nevidence that third parties, such as Wheeler’s customers and\nfellow dealers, had the motive and opportunity to commit the\nmurders due to their drug-related dealings with Wheeler. The\nstate court summarily rejected this claim when it denied\nAndrews’s second state habeas petition. The district court\ndenied relief on this claim.\n\n    We conclude that reasonable jurists would not find\ndebatable or wrong the district court’s conclusion that this\nclaim fails under Strickland and AEDPA. See Slack,\n529 U.S. at 484. The evidence adduced at trial was\noverwhelming: Sanders, an eyewitness, testified to the events\nof the murders, Brooks testified regarding Andrews’s\nconfession, and the evidence established that Andrews’s palm\nprints were found on either side of Brandon’s body. In re\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 658. Accordingly, reasonable jurists\nwould not debate the reasonableness of the state court’s\nconclusion that counsel’s failure to further investigate these\nsuspects did not prejudice Andrews’s defense.              See\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\f82                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n     Second, Andrews argues that counsel were ineffective for\nfailing to investigate or present evidence that semen found on\nBrandon’s body could not have come from Andrews. The\ndistrict court’s conclusion that the state court did not\nunreasonably apply Strickland in rejecting this claim is not\ndebatable, because the state court could reasonably conclude\nthat counsel’s failure to introduce such evidence was not\nprejudicial. The record shows only that slides containing\nsemen found on Brandon’s body contain biological markers\nthat some people secrete and others do not. Andrews does\nnot secrete these markers, but the record is silent as to\nwhether Brandon was a secretor. Andrews offers statistical\nevidence suggesting that Brandon was probably not a\nsecretor, but the evidence is not conclusive. Indeed, even\nother experts testifying for Andrews noted that what minimal\nevidence they obtained was subject to challenge. In light of\nthe eyewitness testimony about Andrews’s involvement in the\nmurders, and his palm prints next to Brandon’s body,\nreasonable jurists would not dispute that the state court\nreasonably concluded that any deficiency by defense counsel\nwas not prejudicial.\n\n    Next, Andrews raises two claims relating to the police\ninvestigation of fingerprint evidence found at Wheeler’s\napartment. As explained by the state court on direct appeal,\ntwo of the police’s fingerprint experts, Howard Sanshuck and\nDonald Keir, testified at trial that they compared\n50 fingerprints found in Wheeler’s apartment with Andrews’s\nfingerprints and palm prints. People v. Andrews, 776 P.2d at\n289. The two experts concluded that left and right palm\nprints on the kitchen floor on either side of Brandon’s body\nbelonged to Andrews. Id. Sanshuck’s supervisor, Jimmy\nCassel, had previously reviewed the prints and initially\nlabeled them as belonging to Wheeler. Id. Sanshuck\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                        83\n\ndiscovered the error shortly before Andrews’s first trial. At\nthe second trial, Cassel stated that the original\nmisidentification was due to his efforts to process the crime\nscene information too quickly, and testified that there was no\nsimilarity between the palm prints found on the kitchen floor\nand Wheeler’s prints. Id. The three experts, Sanshuck, Keir,\nand Cassel, all testified at the second trial that Andrews’s\npalm prints matched the palm prints found on either side of\nBrandon’s body. Id. Andrews has never adduced any\nevidence to rebut this.\n\n    On appeal, Andrews claims that his counsel were\ndeficient in failing to investigate two different lines of\ndefense. First, Andrews claims that counsel performed\ndeficiently by failing to present evidence that Andrews’s\nfingerprints could have been left in Wheeler’s apartment due\nto his prior visits. Second, Andrews claims that counsel\nshould have uncovered and used the police’s original\nmisidentification of his palm prints. Andrews points to other\nreports in the record which he claims shows that Keir and a\nthird analyst, William Leo, also misidentified his fingerprints.\nThe district court rejected this claim. In light of the\nunrebutted evidence that the palm prints found on either side\nof Brandon’s body were Andrews’s prints, no reasonable\njurist would dispute the district court’s determination that the\nstate court could reasonably have concluded that counsel’s\nhandling of the fingerprint evidence did not prejudice\nAndrews’s defense. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\n\n     Finally, Andrews claims that counsel were ineffective for\nfailing to investigate or present evidence regarding his alibi\nthe night of the murder.

Valenzuela-Bernal for\nthe proposition that he could establish his ineffective\nassistance of counsel claim without showing how his alibi\nwitnesses would have testified, because he needed to show\nonly that their testimony would be material and favorable to\nhis defense. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110797\"><a href=\"/opinion/110797/united-states-v-valenzuela-bernal/\"><span class=\"volume\">458</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 867 (1982). Therefore, Andrews\nclaims, the state court erred in rejecting his Strickland claim.\nThe district court rejected this argument, and we agree.\nValenzuela-Bernal held that when the government deports\naliens who could aid a criminal defendant in his defense,\nthere is no violation of the criminal defendant’s right to\ncompulsory process under the Sixth Amendment unless the\ndefendant “make[s] some plausible showing of how [the alibi\nwitness’s] testimony would have been both material and\nfavorable to his defense.” Id. This ruling does not “squarely\naddress[] the issue,” Van Patten, 552 U.S. at 125–26, or\n“establish a legal principle that clearly extends” to the\nquestion whether Andrews’s counsel’s failure to pursue the\nalibi witnesses was ineffective assistance of counsel, see\nMoses, 555 F.3d at 754 (quoting Van Patten, 552 U.S. at 123)\n(alterations and internal quotation marks omitted).\nAccordingly, the state court’s rejection of Andrews’s claim\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       85\n\nwas not an unreasonable application of Valenzuela-Bernal.\nSee Woodall, 134 S. Ct. at 1706–07.\n\n    In sum, the state court did not unreasonably apply\nStrickland in concluding that Andrews did not create a\n“substantial, not just conceivable” likelihood of a different\nresult, or that “any real possibility of [Andrews’s] being\nacquitted was eclipsed by the remaining evidence pointing to\nguilt,” Richter, 562 U.S. at 112–13; see also Strickland,\n466 U.S. at 695–96, and the district court’s determination to\nthis effect was not debatable. Accordingly, Andrews has not\nmade a “substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\nright,” 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2), and we decline to issue a\nCOA.\n\n                              C\n\n    Andrews argues that the state court erred in rejecting two\nclaims that his rights under Brady were violated. Brady\nrequires the state to disclose “evidence that is both favorable\nto the accused and material either to guilt or to punishment.”\nU.S. v. Bagley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111514\"><a href=\"/opinion/111514/united-states-v-bagley/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">667</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 674 (1985) (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Evidence is material “if there is a reasonable\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed to the\ndefense, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.” Id. at 682. Thus, to establish a Brady violation, a\ndefendant must prove: (1) “[t]he evidence at issue [is]\nfavorable to the accused, either because it is exculpatory, or\nbecause it is impeaching,” (2) the evidence was “suppressed\n. . . either willfully or inadvertently,” and (3) prejudice\nresulted, meaning there is a reasonable probability that\ndisclosing the evidence to the defense would have changed\nthe result. See Strickler v. Greene, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118307\"><a href=\"/opinion/118307/strickler-v-greene/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281–82\n(1999); Bagley, 473 U.S. at 682.\n\f86                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    Andrews claims the state suppressed two pieces of\nevidence. First, he contends that the prosecution failed to\ndisclose a case file maintained by the Los Angeles Police\nDepartment, termed a “murder book,” which contained\nmaterial evidence including the third party culpability and\nfingerprint evidence also advanced in support of his\nineffective assistance of counsel claims. The state court\ncould reasonably have rejected this claim because the state\nhad provided counsel with a chronology of the police\ninvestigation referring to much of the allegedly suppressed\nmurder book evidence. The district court held the state\ncourt’s conclusion was not an unreasonable application of\nBrady. No reasonable jurist could disagree with this\nconclusion, because the state court could reasonably have\nconcluded that the evidence was not suppressed under Brady.\nSee United States v. Dupuy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"451681\"><a href=\"/opinion/451681/united-states-v-albert-dupuy-united-states-of-america-v-christie-buzard/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1501 n.5 (9th Cir.\n1985) (holding the government does not suppress evidence\nfor purposes of Brady where “the means of obtaining the\nexculpatory evidence [was] provided to the defense”).\nMoreover, the state court could have reasonably concluded\nthat the result of the proceeding would not have been\ndifferent even if the evidence had been disclosed to the\ndefense. See Strickler, 527 U.S. at 280.\n\n     For the same reason, no reasonable jurist could disagree\nwith the district court’s rejection of Andrews’s second Brady\nclaim, that the prosecution withheld the fact that Brooks was\nsubject to charges of welfare fraud. The state court could\nhave reasonably concluded that defense counsel had\nsufficient information to discover that charges had been filed,\nbecause defense counsel knew that Brooks was being\ninvestigated for welfare fraud, and questioned her about it at\ntrial, outside the presence of the jury. See Dupuy, 760 F.2d\nat 1501 n.5.\n\f                        ANDREWS V. DAVIS                             87\n\n    Andrews also raises claims under Napue, which provides\nthat the state may not “knowingly use false evidence,\nincluding false testimony” or “allow[] it to go uncorrected\nwhen it appears.” 360 U.S. at 269. According to Andrews,\nthe state knowingly adduced false testimony from two\nfingerprint experts, Keir and Sanshuck. First, Andrews notes\nthat a report in the record, dated August 4, 1980, states that\nKeir reviewed “fingers” from a suspect named “Walters” (the\nalias being used by Andrews at the time) and concludes that\nthe prints were “not made.” This means, Andrews argues,\nthat Keir lied in identifying the palm prints found by\nBrandon’s body as being from Andrews, and also lied when\nhe testified that he first examined Andrews’s palm prints in\nNovember 1983. The state asserts Keir did not testify falsely,\nbecause the report references fingerprints, while Keir testified\nregarding palm prints. Second, Andrews argues that\nSanshuck’s testimony that police policy did not require\nphotographs to be taken of prints on the surface from which\nthey were lifted was false, because it contradicted a Los\nAngeles Police Department Homicide Manual, dated 1981.31\nThe state argues that no false information was knowingly\npresented, see id., because the homicide manual used\npermissive, not mandatory, language, and because the\nmanual’s statement did not reflect the police department’s\n\n\n  31\n      The Los Angeles Police Department Homicide Manual states in\npertinent part:\n\n        Note: (A) Photographing Prints\n\n        Prints found at the scene of a homicide should be\n        photographed. The procedure is recommended because\n        it is much easier to introduce print evidence into court\n        if the print has been photographed, as parts of the object\n        which carried the print may show in the picture.\n\f88                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nactual practice, which was the subject of Sanshuck’s\ntestimony. The district court rejected Andrews’s Napue\nclaims, and no reasonable jurist could disagree that the state\ncourt could reject these claims based on the reasonable view\nof the facts offered by the state. See Maddox, 366 F.3d at\n999–1000 (holding that under AEDPA, state court fact\nfinding must be not merely wrong, but “actually\nunreasonable” and without support in the record to warrant\nhabeas relief).\n\n                              D\n\n    Andrews makes three claims based on the fact that\nbetween 1993 and 1995, all biological evidence in this case\nwas destroyed, except for 50 fingerprint cards, one vaginal\nslide, one oral slide, and one anal slide. His petition to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court claimed that the destruction of the\nevidence violated his due process rights under Trombetta and\nArizona v. Youngblood, a case that held that the government’s\n“failure to preserve potentially useful evidence” before trial\ndoes not violate a defendant’s due process rights unless the\ncriminal defendant can show that the government acted in bad\nfaith. </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 58 (1988). As Andrews acknowledges,\nthe Supreme Court has since held that cases assessing pre-\nconviction access to evidence, which would include\nTrombetta and Youngblood, do not apply to cases where a\ndefendant is denied access to evidence after being convicted.\nSee Dist. Attorney’s Office for the Third Judicial Dist. v.\nOsborne, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145860\"><a href=\"/opinion/145860/district-attorneys-office-for-third-judicial-dist-v-osborne/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 61–62, 68–69, 74 (2009); see also\nCress v.

DAVIS                        89\n\nAndrews relies on Osborne to make a second claim, that the\ndestruction of evidence violated his due process and Eighth\nAmendment rights. We do not consider whether the state\ncourt’s decision was contrary to or an unreasonable\napplication of Osborne, because it was decided after the\nCalifornia Supreme Court ruled, and thus is not clearly\nestablished precedent for purposes of § 2254(d)(1). This\ntheory was not briefed to the district court, as the case was\ndecided between completion of briefing and the court’s\ndecision. Andrews points to no clearly established precedent\nin existence at the time the state court ruled that applies this\nprinciple, and therefore the district court’s rejection of this\nclaim was not debatable among fair minded jurists.\n\n    Andrews’s third claim is that the destruction of evidence\ndenied him access to the courts to vindicate an underlying\nclaim of factual innocence. However, as the district court\nrecognized in rejecting this claim, he cites no Supreme Court\nprecedent clearly establishing that destruction of evidence\nafter a defendant is convicted violates a right of access to the\ncourts. Christopher v. Harbury, on which Andrews relies, is\nnot on point: it held that a plaintiff’s claim that government\nofficials misled her in connection with her husband’s\ndisappearance did not state a constitutional denial of access\nclaim upon which relief could be granted. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121160\"><a href=\"/opinion/121160/christopher-v-harbury/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 407,\n415, 418–19 (2002).

We agree with the\ndistrict court that the California Supreme Court reasonably\ndetermined that any errors, in the aggregate, did not have\nsuch a substantial or injurious effect on the verdict. The\ncumulative result of the disputable errors identified by\nAndrews would not have made his defense significantly more\npersuasive, since his defense focused on attacking the\ncredibility of Sanders and Brooks and challenging the\nfingerprint and palm print evidence. Reasonable jurists\nwould not dispute the district court’s conclusion, so no COA\nis warranted.\n\n    Nor would any reasonable jurist disagree with the district\ncourt’s conclusion that the state court did not err in rejecting\nAndrews’s factual innocence claim. The state court could\nhave reasonably concluded that Andrews’s introduction of\nslides showing that biological markers found in the semen on\nBrandon’s body had not been secreted by Andrews and may\nnot have been secreted by Brandon, described above, was\ninsufficient to “go beyond demonstrating doubt about his\nguilt [to] affirmatively prove that he is probably innocent.”\nSee Carriger v.

Had counsel presented this\nreadily available mitigating evidence, there is a reasonable\nprobability that at least one juror would have been moved to\nexercise mercy and spare Andrews’s life.

The California Supreme Court’s determination that\ncounsel’s performance was neither deficient nor prejudicial\nis not just wrong, it is unreasonable under the clearly\nestablished law of Strickland and its progeny. Thus, even\nunder the deferential standard of the AEDPA, conditional\nsentencing relief is warranted.\n\n                               I\n\n    Andrews was sent to the Alabama Industrial School for\nNegro Children, later known as Mt. Meigs, in the mid-1960s,\nafter stealing a car. He had no prior history of violent crime.\nHe entered the school when he was 14. He left when he was\n16.\n\n    The California judge who conducted the state court\nevidentiary hearing described Mt. Meigs as a “segregated\nbrutal institution near Montgomery, Alabama.” The state\ncourt hearing judge found that the conditions at Mt. Meigs\nwere horrific, and that Andrews was personally subjected to\n“beatings, brutality, inadequate conditions and sexual\npredators.” Due to “his small stature and passive nature,”\nAndrews was “the target for older boys’ depredations.” The\n\f94                   ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nCalifornia Supreme Court itself acknowledged that Andrews\npersonally endured “appalling” conditions at Mt. Meigs. See\nAndrews, 52 P.3d. at 660.\n\n     At the state court evidentiary hearing ordered by the\nCalifornia Supreme Court, several outside observers\ncorroborated the accounts of abuse at Mt. Meigs. A United\nStates federal judge testified that Mt. Meigs, during the time\nAndrews was there, was a “penal colony” that represented the\n“absolute denial of basic and fundamental human rights to\n[African-American] children.” A former state probation\nofficer described Mt. Meigs as a “slave camp” for children,\nrun by “illiterate overseers” who forced children to work in\nthe fields harvesting vegetables and picking cotton. The\nchildren were “beaten all the time,” sometimes with\nbroomsticks, mop handles, and fan belts, and often severely\nfor minor infractions. Violence was pervasive and sexual\nassaults were common. The state probation officer testified\nthat children committed to Mt. Meigs in the 1960s had no\nchance of rehabilitation and “came out much worse” than\nwhen they entered. The probation officer, who testified\nbefore Congress and state legislatures about juvenile justice\nfacilities around the country, stated that Mt. Meigs was “by\nfar, by far . . . the worst facility” that he had seen.\n\n     Despite being termed a “school,” Mt. Meigs provided\nlittle to no education, counseling, or vocational programs to\nthe children in its custody. See Andrews, 52 P.3d at 677\n(Kennard, J., dissenting). And in 1971, an Alabama district\ncourt ordered extensive reforms at the institution after finding\nthat “corporal punishment was promiscuously employed by\nthe school’s personnel” and agreeing that “[w]hen officials of\na training school have condoned or permitted the frequent and\nindiscriminate use of corporal punishment . . . they have\n\f                     ANDREWS V.

Meigs after finding that it was “inferior\nin every way” to similar schools for white children).\n\n    Andrews was not spared. The state court record\nchronicles in excruciatingly vivid detail the abuse he\npersonally suffered. When Andrews failed to pick enough\ncotton, left the grass too high in the fields, or made a mistake\nin the dining hall, he was whipped with a fan belt or beaten\nwith a stick. The record indicates that Andrews was beaten\nso severely the skin on his thighs would “bust open.” On\nother occasions Andrews and other wards at Mt. Meigs were\nforced to pull down their pants, lie on the ground on their\nstomachs, and place their penises in holes in the earth while\nthey were whipped. The judge who conducted the state court\nevidentiary hearing found the evidence of abuse\n“compelling.”\n\n    The jury that sentenced Andrews to death heard none of\nthis evidence. Yet the California Supreme Court concluded\nthat counsel was not ineffective and, even if ineffective, there\nwas no reasonable probability of a different result at\nsentencing had the jury heard the Mt. Meigs evidence.\n\n    That decision is fundamentally and objectively\nunreasonable. Consideration of a defendant’s life history is\na “constitutionally indispensable part of the process of\ninflicting the penalty of death.” See Eddings v. Oklahoma,\n\f96                   ANDREWS V.

Yet\nAndrews’s counsel presented almost no mitigating evidence\nat sentencing. The Mt.

Nor did counsel ask their investigators to do any\nwork on the penalty phase. Indeed, Andrews’s counsel made\nno serious effort to discover mitigating evidence.1\n\n\n 1\n   The majority cites trips that Andrews’s counsel made to Alabama and\nFlorida as evidence that they conducted something other than a cursory\npenalty phase investigation. Majority at 25 n.3. Yet by the lawyers’ own\naccount, their penalty phase investigation consisted of just three activities.\nFirst, the lawyers spent a day in the Mobile courthouse pulling records of\nAndrews’s prior convictions. One of the lawyers initially testified that\ntheir trip to Alabama included three days of investigation. He changed\nthat account after being confronted with evidence that they were in New\nOrleans for most of the time, flying to Mobile on a Saturday and returning\nto New Orleans on the same day. New Orleans had no relation to the\ncase; the dates of the trip “coincided” with Mardi Gras celebrations.\nSecond, only after Andrews’s first trial ended in a hung jury, the lawyers\ninterviewed Andrews’s mother during a layover in the Pensacola airport,\nafter they briefly revisited the Mobile courthouse to examine records of\n\f98                       ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    The state court judge who presided over the evidentiary\nhearing expressly found that defense counsel could have\nuncovered the Mt. Meigs evidence with “simple persistence”\nand standard investigative techniques. See Andrews, 52 P.3d\nat 680 (Kennard, J., dissenting); see also id. at 681 (noting\nthat routine legal research of public records would have\nrevealed lawsuits involving these Alabama institutions). The\nCalifornia Supreme Court does not dispute that finding. See\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 668.\n\n                                    A\n\n   The California Supreme Court, however, excused\ncounsel’s failure to discover the Mt. Meigs evidence for a\nnumber of unsupported and unsupportable reasons,\nconcluding that counsel’s investigation was constitutionally\nadequate because: (1) Andrews did not want his family\ninvolved; (2) Andrews did not tell counsel about the appalling\nconditions he endured while confined at Mt. Meigs; (3) the\nMt. Meigs evidence could have backfired, for the evidence\n\n\nAndrews’s prior convictions. The interview did not go into detail about\nAndrews’s background, and the lawyers did not inquire about the names\nor contact information of relatives or anybody else who knew Andrews\nand could speak to his history. Third, the lawyers asserted that they spent\nsome time in Mobile during one of their two trips unsuccessfully\n“look[ing] for evidence of Jesse’s character and good deeds.” The\nlawyers, however, did not interview a single person, contact any of\nAndrews’s family or friends, or look into Andrews’s institutional history.\nSimilarly, the two defense investigators testified that their efforts were\nlimited to the guilt phase, and that neither of Andrews’s attorneys asked\nthem to do any investigation into Andrews’s background for a possible\npenalty phase. The California Supreme Court’s referee characterized\ncounsel’s “actual efforts” to gather mitigating evidence for the penalty\nphase as “limited,” a characterization which in light of this record is\nunderstated, if not overly generous.\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                         99\n\nwould have come primarily from prisoners; (4) counsel’s\nlimited investigation was reasonable because counsel had a\nreasonable strategy at the penalty phase; and (5) the Mt.\nMeigs evidence could have opened the door to more evidence\nregarding Andrews’s prior acts of violence. Not one of these\nrationales withstands scrutiny or excuses counsel’s failure to\nperform a basic investigation into his client’s life history.\n\n    (1) Andrews’s Refusal to Involve his Family.\n\n    The California Supreme Court found counsel’s limited\ninvestigation adequate partly because Andrews refused to\ninvolve his family at the penalty phase. See Andrews, 52 P.3d\nat 668. The California Supreme Court reasoned as follows:\n“Although the referee found that counsel could have\ndiscovered the mitigating evidence presented at the reference\nhearing with ‘simple persistence,’ it is equally clear petitioner\ninsisted they not involve his family. ‘As we have repeatedly\nexplained, an attorney representing a defendant at the penalty\nphase of a capital case is not required to present potentially\nmitigating evidence over the defendant’s objections. . . .’” Id.\n(quoting People v. Kirkpatrick, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1219227\"><a href=\"/opinion/1219227/people-v-kirkpatrick/\"><span class=\"volume\">874</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal. 1994)).\n\n    The California Supreme Court is correct that Andrews did\nnot want his family involved. And it is also correct that the\n“reasonableness of counsel’s actions may be determined or\nsubstantially influenced by the defendant’s own statements or\nactions.” See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 691. However,\nexcusing counsel’s failure to present the Mt. Meigs evidence\nbased upon Andrews’s refusal to involve his family is\nunreasonable on its face for a simple reason: presenting the\nMt. Meigs evidence would not have required any\ninvolvement by Andrews’s family. Instead, as accounted\nherein, defense counsel could have introduced the Mt. Meigs\n\f100                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nevidence by admitting public records and by presenting the\ntestimony of numerous experts and respected observers.\n\n    The state court’s rationale is also unreasonable in light of\nthe record before it. Andrews’s trial attorney testified at the\nstate court evidentiary hearing that Andrews imposed no\nlimitations on a penalty phase investigation into his\nbackground, apart from not wanting to have his family testify.\nThe state court hearing judge found no obstacle to calling\nwitnesses who were not members of Andrews’s family.\n\n    It was therefore unreasonable for the California Supreme\nCourt to excuse counsel’s failure to present the Mt. Meigs\nevidence based upon Andrews’s refusal to involve his family.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2) (stating that federal habeas relief\nis warranted if the state court decision was based upon an\nunreasonable determination of facts in light of the evidence\npresented in the state court proceeding); cf. Porter, 558 U.S.\nat 40 (stating that counsel’s decision not to investigate must\nreflect a “reasonable professional judgment,” even when the\nclient is “fatalistic or uncooperative”).\n\n    (2) Andrews’s Failure to Tell Counsel About His Time\n        at Mt. Meigs\n\n    The California Supreme Court also faulted Andrews for\nnot telling trial counsel about the appalling conditions he\nendured while at Mt. Meigs. See Andrews, 52 P.3d at 668\n(“While counsel were aware petitioner had been incarcerated\nin the Alabama prison system, he did not inform them of the\nconditions he endured thereby alerting them to the need for\nfurther investigation of possible mitigation.”). However, no\nevidence in the record suggests that counsel ever asked\nAndrews any questions that would have elicited that history.\n\f                          ANDREWS V. DAVIS                                101\n\nSee Andrews, 52 P.3d at 681 (Kennard, J., dissenting) (stating\nAndrews “did not withhold that information. His attorneys\nnever raised the subject.”).2 Nor is there any evidence that\nAndrews, “described by one of his trial attorneys as ‘very\ncooperative,’ would have refused to discuss his reform school\nand prison experiences in Alabama had he been asked about\nthem.” Id.\n\n    Given those facts, the California Supreme Court was\nunreasonable in placing the burden on Andrews to\ncomprehend and offer mitigation theories at the penalty phase\nof his own trial. Under clearly established Supreme Court\nlaw, legal strategy is the duty and domain of learned counsel;\nwhile a defendant “has the ultimate authority to make certain\nfundamental decisions regarding the case, as to whether to\nplead guilty, waive a jury, testify in his or her own behalf, or\ntake an appeal,” legal strategy decisions are matters of\nprofessional judgment that fall within counsel’s domain and\nare the responsibility of counsel. See Jones v. Barnes,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111012\"><a href=\"/opinion/111012/jones-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">745</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 751 (1983). And, as accounted above, the most\nbasic of investigations into Andrews’s life history would have\nuncovered the evidence of the abuse he suffered. Cf.\n\n\n 2\n   The majority generally and repeatedly accuses the dissent of engaging\nin a de novo review when evaluating whether the California Supreme\nCourt’s determinations were reasonable. Yet deference does not\neviscerate our duty to examine and evaluate the record to determine the\nreasonableness of the state court’s conclusions. Further, in engaging in\nthat inquiry, it is entirely proper to look to a state court dissenting opinion\nthat may shed light on whether the state court majority’s determinations\nwere reasonable or unreasonable in light of the record as a whole. Facts\non federal habeas review are not limited to only the facts stated in the state\nsupreme court’s majority opinion. Cf. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2) (stating that\nfederal habeas relief is warranted if the state court decision “was based on\nan unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\npresented”).\n\f102                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nWilliams, 529 U.S. at 395 (finding counsel deficient for\nfailing to review defendant’s juvenile records that “would\nhave uncovered extensive records graphically describing\n[defendant’s] nightmarish childhood”).\n\n     (3) The Reliance on Prisoners to Present the Mt.\n         Meigs Evidence\n\n    The California Supreme Court further concluded it was\nreasonable for counsel not to present the Mt. Meigs evidence\nbecause such evidence could have backfired as it “would\ncome primarily from the testimony of petitioner’s fellow\nprisoners, many of whom were hardened criminals with\nserious felony records.” See Andrews, 52 P.3d at 668–69.3\n\n    However, the Mt. Meigs evidence was not dependent\nupon testimony from prisoners. At Andrews’s state court\nevidentiary hearing, “a federal district judge, a priest, a\ncollege dean, a clinical psychologist, a longtime prison\ndoctor, and the regional director of the Federal Bureau of\nDetention, all . . . gave powerfully effective testimony about\nthe shocking conditions at” Mt. Meigs. Andrews, 52 P.3d at\n681 (Kennard, J., dissenting); e.g., id. at 677 (discussing\n\n 3\n   The California Supreme Court’s opinion often conflates the evidence\nof abuse that Andrews suffered as a youth at Mt. Meigs with other\npotential mitigating evidence he could have introduced regarding the\nabuse he sustained as an adult in the Alabama prison system. Because\ncounsel’s failure to investigate and introduce the Mt. Meigs evidence,\nstanding alone, plainly rendered counsel’s performance deficient, I only\naddress the Mt. Meigs evidence. However, the dissent in the California\nSupreme Court provides an accurate and thorough accounting of the\nadditional mitigating evidence that counsel could have introduced. See\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 676–80 (Kennard, J., dissenting) (describing\nAndrews’s time in Alabama prisons that were later found to violate the\nEighth Amendment’s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment).\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      103\n\ntestimony of federal district court judge Ira Dement, who\nreferred to Mt. Meigs as a “penal colony for children”).\n\n    In light of the state court record, it therefore was\nunreasonable for the California Supreme Court to excuse\ncounsel’s failure to present the Mt. Meigs evidence on the\nbasis that such evidence would have primarily depended upon\nthe testimony of prisoners. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2); see\nalso Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 528 (stating that “partial reliance on\nan erroneous factual finding” can show “the unreasonableness\nof the state court’s decision.”).\n\n   (4) Counsel’s Penalty Strategy\n\n    The California Supreme Court expressly acknowledged\nthat the record at the state court evidentiary hearing suggested\nthat counsel could have conducted a more thorough\ninvestigation into Andrews’s background. See Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 669. However, the California Supreme Court\nultimately concluded that counsel’s penalty phase\nperformance was adequate because counsel had decided upon\na reasonable strategy, one that apparently did not involve or\nrequire any meaningful preliminary investigation into\nAndrews’s social history. According to the California\nSupreme Court, counsel presented a “reasonable case for\nsparing petitioner’s life” by (1) portraying Andrews “as a\nfollower rather than as violently antisocial”; and (2) arguing\na death sentence was not warranted because “others who had\ncommitted more heinous multiple murders” were not\nsentenced to death and Andrews’s co-defendant Sanders had\nreceived a lighter sentence. See id.\n\n   The California Supreme Court’s decision is unreasonable\nbecause neither strategy was supported by the evidence\n\f104                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\npresented at trial. Further, the state court’s decision is\nunreasonable because it ignores counsel’s “duty to make\nreasonable investigations or to make a reasonable decision\nthat makes particular investigations unnecessary.”\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 691.\n\n    The evidence as to the crimes of conviction which\nrendered Andrews death eligible belied the depiction of\nAndrews as a follower, rendering counsel’s penalty phase\npitch to the jury contrary to the record, hollow, and false. See\nAndrews, 52 P.3d at 682 (Kennard, J., dissenting) (“[T]hat\nwas a disastrous strategy, one no reasonably competent\nattorney would have used”). Indeed, “the only evidence\nbefore the jury was that petitioner was the instigator rather\nthan a follower.” Id. The “evidence showed that [Andrews]\nwas the leader and the perpetrator of the crimes while Sanders\nwas the follower; thus, jurors were not likely to be troubled\nby Sanders’s lighter sentence.” Id.\n\n    Given the evidence at trial, no reasonable argument can\nbe made that counsel’s strategy to depict Andrews as a\nfollower was reasonable, particularly when it was\nunsupported by a basic investigation into Andrews’s\nbackground to determine what other mitigating evidence was\navailable.

DAVIS                     105\n\nthe door to rebuttal evidence which would contradict\ncounsel’s strategy of portraying defendant as the follower.\nSee Andrews, 52 P.3d at 673 (citing Burger, 483 U.S. at 793).\nThe California Supreme Court’s reliance on Burger is\nunreasonable for two reasons. First, in Burger, defense\ncounsel performed a robust initial mitigation investigation\nand spoke to a family member, a friend, and a psychologist to\nlearn about his client’s background. See Burger, 483 U.S. at\n790–91. Based upon what Burger’s counsel learned, counsel\ndecided against pursuing a mitigation case relying on that\nbackground, id. at 791, even though it turned out that further\ninvestigation would have produced additional evidence that\ndefendant had “an exceptionally unhappy and unstable\nchildhood.” Id. at 789. As the Supreme Court concluded,\ncounsel’s initial investigation led him to make the\n“reasonable decision that his client’s interest would not be\nserved by presenting this type of [mitigating] evidence.” Id.\nat 791. The facts of this case are very different. Unlike\nBurger’s defense counsel, Andrews’s attorneys never\nperformed any meaningful initial investigation into their\nclient’s background. Absent such an investigation, the\nlawyers cannot be said to have made informed strategic\nchoices about how to proceed in a possible penalty phase of\ntrial.\n\n    Second and relatedly, in Burger, counsel’s depiction of\nhis client as a follower was a reasonable strategy for it was\nsupported by the record. See Burger, 483 U.S. at 779 (noting\nprimary evidence at trial showed that Burger’s co-defendant\nStevens “was primarily responsible for the plan to kidnap the\n[victim], the physical abuse of the victim, and the decision to\nkill him”). In contrast, the evidence at Andrews’s trial\nplainly showed that Andrews was not a follower, but the main\ncriminal actor. Thus, the California Supreme Court’s\n\f106                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nstatement that “we reach the same conclusion on comparable\nfacts,” see Andrews, 52 P.3d at 673, is wrong for the facts in\nBurger are not comparable. The California Supreme Court’s\nreliance on Burger is unreasonable.\n\n    The California Supreme Court also unreasonably applied\nSupreme Court law when it cited Bell v. Cone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118509\"><a href=\"/opinion/118509/bell-v-cone/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">685</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(2002), to support its conclusion that counsel reasonably\ndecided not to present evidence of Andrews’s background.\nSee Andrews, 52 P.3d at 673 (citing Cone, 535 U.S. at\n699–700). Before noting that defense counsel saw the\nneighborhood Andrews grew up in and considered it\nunimpressive because it was comparable to counsel’s own,\nthe California Supreme Court cited Cone for the proposition\nthat counsel may reasonably decide not to present background\nevidence when testimony about a defendant’s “normal youth”\nmight, in the eyes of the jury, be perceived negatively and cut\nthe other way. See id. However, all reasonable jurists would\nagree that the years Andrews spent at Mt. Meigs were the\nantithesis of a “normal youth.” The California Supreme\nCourt’s invocation of Cone, while simultaneously ignoring\nthat Andrews’s “youth” included his experience at Mt. Meigs,\nwas an objectively unreasonable application of Supreme\nCourt law. See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 526–27 (observing that\nthe “strategic decision” offered “to justify counsel’s limited\npursuit of mitigating evidence resembles . . . a post hoc\nrationalization of counsel’s conduct.”); cf. Porter, 558 U.S.\nat 43 (concluding that state supreme court was “unreasonable\nto discount to irrelevance the evidence of Porter’s abusive\nchildhood”).\n\f                         ANDREWS V.

Meigs evidence, among\nother mitigation evidence, was reasonable because such\nevidence could have opened the door to more evidence\nregarding Andrews’s prior acts of violence. See Andrews,\n52 P.3d at 669 (stating that by not introducing the evidence,\ncounsel “foreclosed the introduction of substantial\naggravating evidence in rebuttal or on cross-examination that\ncould have undermined the defense by depicting petitioner as\naggressive and desensitized to violence”). The California\nSupreme Court’s decision on this point is unreasonable for at\nleast two reasons.\n\n    One, the prosecutor from Andrews’s trial, who in the\ninterim had become a superior court judge, “testified that if\nthe defense had presented evidence of the Alabama prison\nconditions he probably would not have called rebuttal\nwitnesses to give details about petitioner’s Alabama crimes.”\nSee Andrews, 52 P.3d at 682 (Kennard, J., dissenting).4\n\n\n\n\n 4\n   It is also possible, if not likely, that a California court would not have\nadmitted evidence of prior offenses to rebut the mitigating evidence of\nchildhood abuse that Andrews suffered at Mt. Meigs. Cf. In re Lucas,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2548479\"><a href=\"/opinion/2548479/in-re-lucas/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">477</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 510 (Cal. 2004) (concluding, in a unanimous decision, that\nmitigating evidence showing “that a defendant suffered abuse in childhood\ngenerally does not open the door to evidence of [a] defendant’s prior\ncrimes or other misconduct”).\n\f108                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n    Two, even if the prosecutor had rebutted with more\nevidence regarding Andrews’s prior violent crimes,5 the jury\nalready knew based upon Andrews’s heinous crimes of\nconviction that he was “aggressive and desensitized to\nviolence.” The jury also knew, by stipulation, of Andrews’s\nprior convictions for murder in 1967, armed robbery in 1968,\nescape in 1969, and robbery in 1977 which the prosecution\nintroduced as aggravating factors at the penalty phase.6 More\nevidence regarding Andrews’s prior convictions would have\nreinforced what the jury already knew, namely that Andrews\ncommitted heinous crimes and clearly was “aggressive and\ndesensitized to violence.”\n\n    The clearly established law of Strickland itself supports\nthe conclusion that the California Supreme Court’s decision\nwas unreasonable. In Strickland, it was reasonable for\ncounsel not to present mitigating evidence that “would barely\nhave altered the sentencing profile” and could have opened\nthe door to prior convictions which counsel had successfully\nmoved to exclude. 466 U.S. at 699–700. So too in Darden\n\n\n  5\n   The majority accurately observes that the referee and the California\nSupreme Court majority concluded that if trial counsel had presented the\nMt. Meigs evidence, the prosecutor would have introduced rebuttal\nevidence. Majority at 30–31 n.8. But that finding fails to take into\naccount the plain statement by the former prosecutor—later a state court\njudge—that he probably would not have responded with rebuttal evidence.\nThe referee and California Supreme Court decided not to take the former\nprosecutor at his word and instead speculated about what the prosecutor\nwould have done. That decision was unreasonable. Cf. 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(2).\n 6\n   By stipulation, the jury knew that Andrews’s 1967 murder conviction\nwas for felony murder stemming from an incident when Andrews, then 16,\nand an accomplice robbed a grocery store and the accomplice (not\nAndrews) shot and killed a store clerk during the robbery.\n\f                    ANDREWS V.

See Williams, 529 U.S. at\n395–96.\n\n                              B\n\n    In sum, there was no conceivable tactical reason either to\nforego the investigation into Andrews’s background or to\nforego the presentation of the compelling Mt. Meigs\nevidence. Any competent attorney would have concluded\nthat the Mt. Meigs evidence was the only evidence in this\n\f110                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ncase that carried a substantial probability of a different\nsentence. That evidence is critical precisely because it\nprovides the jury with a reason to extend mercy despite\nAndrews’s heinous crimes. As such, any competent attorney\nwould have presented the evidence, argued that the abuse\nAndrews suffered as a youth at the hands of his state\ncustodians explains why he is inured to violence, and urged\nthe jurors to spare Andrews’s life on that ground.7\n\n    The California Supreme Court recognized that the United\nStates Supreme Court held in Williams that habeas relief was\nwarranted when counsel failed at the penalty phase to present\nto the jury evidence of petitioner’s “nightmarish childhood,”\nmodel behavior while imprisoned, and borderline retardation.\nSee Andrews, 52 P.3d at 674. The California Supreme Court,\nhowever, distinguished Williams because, in that case,\ncounsel’s investigation was “essentially nonexistent due to an\nincorrect understanding of the law.” See id. (citing Williams,\n529 U.S. at 395–96). The California Supreme Court is\ncorrect that in Williams, counsel’s failure to investigate was\nbased at least in part upon his incorrect understanding of the\nlaw. But surely no reasonable jurist would read Williams as\nholding that a virtually nonexistent penalty phase\ninvestigation is reasonable so long as it is not based upon a\nmisunderstanding of the law. Indeed, the United States\n\n\n  7\n    The California Supreme Court suggested there was “no compelling\nconnection” between the un-presented mitigating evidence and the crimes\nAndrews committed. Andrews, 52 P.3d at 672 (quoting In re Ross,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1163343\"><a href=\"/opinion/1163343/in-re-ross/\"><span class=\"volume\">892</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1305 (Cal. 1995)). To the extent the California Supreme\nCourt suggested a causal nexus is required between mitigating evidence\nand defendant’s crimes, the California Supreme Court’s decision was\ncontrary to Supreme Court law. See Skipper v. South Carolina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111657\"><a href=\"/opinion/111657/skipper-v-south-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 4 (1986) (noting “well-established” principle that any relevant\nmitigating evidence may be considered).\n\f                      ANDREWS V. DAVIS                       111\n\nSupreme Court does not read Williams so narrowly. In\nWiggins, the Supreme Court underscored that in Williams it\nheld the “failure to uncover and present voluminous\nmitigating evidence at sentencing could not be justified as a\ntactical decision . . . because counsel had not ‘fulfill[ed] their\nobligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the\ndefendant's background.’” See Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 522\n(quoting Williams, 529 U.S. at 396).\n\n    The duty to conduct a thorough investigation of a capital\ndefendant’s background is imposed on counsel to prevent this\nvery circumstance: a man sentenced to death without\nconsideration of non-cumulative, readily available personal\nhistory evidence of compelling mitigating value. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court unreasonably applied clearly\nestablished federal law when it concluded that defense\ncounsel’s performance was constitutionally adequate in this\ncase.\n\n                               III\n\n    Under Strickland’s second prong, the California Supreme\nCourt majority concluded that even if Andrews’s counsel\nperformed inadequately, Andrews suffered no prejudice from\nthe omission of the Mt. Meigs evidence at sentencing. That\nconclusion too is based upon an objectively unreasonable\napplication of Strickland and its progeny.\n\n    Under Strickland, a capital defendant suffers prejudice\nfrom counsel’s deficient performance when “there is a\nreasonable probability that, absent the errors [of counsel], the\nsentencer . . . would have concluded that the balance of\naggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant\ndeath.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695. As Strickland clarified,\n\f112                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\n“[a] reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\nundermine confidence in the outcome,” not a probability that\nthe result “more likely than not” would have been different.\nId. at 693–94. For a state court considering a habeas petition\nasserting ineffective assistance of counsel, the inquiry is\nstraightforward: counsel’s deficient performance prejudiced\nthe petitioner if he can show “a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror” would have recommended a sentence of life\ninstead of death. Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 537. For a federal\ncourt reviewing a habeas petition filed after the AEDPA’s\npassage, the determinative question is whether the state\ncourt’s finding that petitioner was not prejudiced was not just\nerror, but “was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\napplication of, clearly established Federal law as determined\nby the Supreme Court of the United States.” 28 U.S.C.\n§ 2254(d)(1); see Cullen v. Pinholster, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">563</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">170</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 181\n(2011).\n\n    In this case, the California Supreme Court concluded\nthere was no reasonable probability of a life sentence even if\ncounsel had presented the mitigating evidence regarding\nAndrews’s background. Unlike the majority, I would hold\nthat such a conclusion constitutes an unreasonable application\nof federal law that was clearly established at the time of the\nstate court’s decision.\n\n                              A\n\n    Consideration of the defendant’s life history is a\n“constitutionally indispensable part of the process of\ninflicting the penalty of death.” Eddings, 455 U.S. at 112.\nThe abuse that Andrews suffered at Mt. Meigs epitomizes the\n“kind of troubled history” that the Supreme Court repeatedly\nhas “declared relevant to assessing a defendant’s moral\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      113\n\nculpability.” Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 535; see also id. at 535–36\n(holding a different sentencing outcome was reasonably\nprobable had defense counsel presented evidence that\nWiggins suffered early privation and abuse, as well as\nphysical torment, sexual molestation, and repeated rape in\nfoster care). Such evidence is “relevant because of the belief,\nlong held by this society, that defendants who commit\ncriminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged\nbackground, or to emotional and mental problems, may be\nless culpable than defendants who have no such excuse.”\nBoyde v. California, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112386\"><a href=\"/opinion/112386/boyde-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 382 (1990) (internal\nquotations marks omitted).\n\n    Without consideration of the compelling and readily\navailable Mt. Meigs evidence, Andrews’s moral culpability\ncould not be fairly gauged at sentencing. See Porter,\n558 U.S. at 41. Indeed, the “benchmark” for assessing an\nineffective assistance claim is “whether counsel’s conduct so\nundermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process\nthat the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just\nresult.” Strickland, 466 U.S. at 686. Here, counsel’s failure\nto present the evidence of severe abuse that Andrews\nsuffered, combined with counsel’s failure to present any\nsubstantial mitigation case at sentencing, deprived Andrews\nof a fair sentencing proceeding and renders his death sentence\n“unreliable.” See id. at 700. At bottom, it was unreasonable\nfor the California Supreme Court to conclude that if the jury\nhad heard the Mt. Meigs evidence, there is no reasonable\nprobability that even one juror would have recommended a\nsentence of life instead of death.\n\n    The majority disagrees and observes that the Supreme\nCourt “has found a reasonable probability of a different\noutcome when scant and weak aggravating evidence could\n\f114                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\nhave been presented in rebuttal to strongly mitigating\nevidence.” Majority at 47–47 (citing Wiggins, 539 U.S. at\n534–36, 537–38). Yet the Supreme Court has also found a\nreasonable probability of a different outcome when\naggravating evidence is substantial and mitigating evidence\nis compelling. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 398; Porter,\n558 U.S. at 40–44. Indeed, at the time of the California\nSupreme Court’s decision in this case, no decision by the\nUnited States Supreme Court had excused a failure to present\na compelling mitigation case where one was available.\n\n     As the majority recognizes, Williams and Porter are\nparticularly instructive. In Williams, the Supreme Court held\nthere was a reasonable probability of a different result at\nsentencing if counsel had presented evidence either of\ndefendant’s “nightmarish childhood” or his diminished\nintellectual ability. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 398. Notably,\nunlike in this case, Williams’s counsel actually presented\nmitigating evidence, including testimony from two neighbors\nand Williams’s mother, and “a taped excerpt of a statement\nby a psychiatrist.” See id. at 369. Contrary to the majority’s\ndescription of the case, the aggravating factors in Williams\nwere severe. Two prosecution expert witnesses testified at\nsentencing “that there was a ‘high probability’ that Williams\nwould pose a serious continuing threat to society.” See id. at\n368–69. And the jury heard evidence that in the months after\nthe murder for which Williams was sentenced to death,\n“Williams savagely beat an elderly woman, stole two cars, set\nfire to a home, stabbed a man during a robbery, set fire to the\ncity jail, and confessed to having strong urges to choke other\ninmates and to break a fellow prisoner’s jaw.” Id. at 418\n(Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(quoting Williams v.

The\ntotal evidence in aggravation, that which was admitted and\nthat which may have come in as rebuttal evidence concerning\nAndrews’s prior violent crimes (which the prosecutor\ntestified at the state court hearing he probably would not have\nintroduced), was certainly no greater than the aggravating\nevidence in Williams. Similar to Williams, the overlooked\nmitigating evidence in Andrews’s case includes severe and\nsustained physical, sexual, and psychological abuse.\n\f116                      ANDREWS V.

In any event, Williams was\ndecided two years before the California Supreme Court denied Andrews’s\nhabeas petition. Thus, at the time the California Supreme Court decided\nAndrews’s ineffective assistance claim, Williams was highly relevant for\ndetermining what omitted mitigating evidence is prejudicial under\nStrickland. See Williams, 529 U.S. at 398 (“[T]he graphic description of\nWilliams’ childhood, filled with abuse and privation, or the reality that he\nwas ‘borderline mentally retarded,’ might well have influenced the jury’s\nappraisal of his moral culpability.”); see also id. at 415 (O’Connor, J.,\nconcurring) (concluding that Williams was prejudiced by counsel’s failure\nto present substantial mitigating evidence, including evidence of his\n“nightmarish childhood,” and that the Virginia Supreme Court was\nunreasonable in concluding otherwise).\n     9\n    The majority acknowledges that Porter is relevant to determining\nwhether the California Supreme Court unreasonably applied Strickland.\nMajority at 59 (“Although Porter was decided years after the California\n\f                          ANDREWS V.

See Porter, 558 U.S. at 40–44. The\nSupreme Court held that the Florida Supreme Court was\nunreasonable in concluding that Porter had not been\nprejudiced at sentencing by the omission of this key personal\nhistory evidence. The Supreme Court concluded that without\nthat evidence, the sentencer was unable to “accurately gauge”\nthe defendant’s “moral culpability” and habeas relief was\nwarranted because confidence in the sentencing outcome had\nbeen undermined. See id. at 41; see also Rompilla, 545 U.S.\nat 393 (stating that the relevant test is not whether the jury,\nhad it heard the omitted mitigating evidence, could still have\nreturned a verdict of death).10\n\n\nSupreme Court’s opinion in this case, we give its prejudice analysis\ncareful consideration, because Porter considered prejudice under AEDPA,\nand therefore provides direction for determining what constitutes an\nunreasonable application of the prejudice prong of Strickland under\nAEDPA.”).\n  10\n     The majority criticizes my reference to Rompilla, insisting Rompilla\n“do[es] not provide any guidance on the issue before us, whether a state\ncourt’s determination that counsel’s deficiency was not prejudicial was an\nunreasonable application of clearly established Supreme Court precedent.”\nMajority at 65 n.24. But I cite Rompilla for the well-established principle\nthat the Strickland test for prejudice does not turn on whether the jury still\ncould have returned a death sentence even if it had heard the mitigating\nevidence. See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694 (“The defendant must show that\nthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofessional\n\f118                     ANDREWS V.

Porter, 558 U.S. at 31. The same conclusion\napplies in Andrews’s case. Despite strong aggravating\nevidence, there is a reasonable probability of a different result\nat sentencing if the jury had heard the powerful evidence of\nthe abuse Andrews suffered as a youth. It is unreasonable to\nconclude otherwise.\n\n    The majority disagrees. Relying on the Supreme Court’s\nopinion in Woodford v. Visciotti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122243\"><a href=\"/opinion/122243/woodford-v-visciotti/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002), decided\nafter the California Supreme Court’s decision in this case, the\nmajority insists it was not unreasonable to hold that Andrews\nsuffered no prejudice. Majority at 63–64. The majority is\nmistaken. The balance of mitigating and aggravating factors\nin Visciotti was dramatically different from the balance in\nAndrews. In Visciotti, the potential mitigating evidence at\nissue was expert testimony addressing the psychological\nabuse that Visciotti suffered due to being raised in a\ndysfunctional family. See Visciotti, 537 U.S. at 26. Visciotti\ninvolved no allegations of physical or sexual abuse, and the\npsychological abuse failed to approach what Andrews\nexperienced at Mt. Meigs. The aggravating evidence in\n\n\nerrors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A\nreasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence\nin the outcome.”). The test is not whether counsel’s inadequate\nperformance “more likely than not altered the outcome in the case.” See\nid. at 693.\n\f                    ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      119\n\nVisciotti included a prior offense in which Visciotti stabbed\n“a pregnant woman as she lay in bed trying to protect her\nunborn baby.” See id. Given the strong evidence in\naggravation and the relatively weak mitigating evidence, the\nSupreme Court concluded it was not unreasonable for the\nCalifornia Supreme Court to conclude that Visciotti was not\nprejudiced by counsel’s failure to introduce the dysfunctional\nfamily evidence. Id. at 26–27. In contrast, the facts of\nAndrews’s case present a very different balance of factors\nand compel a different result. The majority’s contention that\nthe Mt. Meigs evidence at most carries only the “mere\npossibility of a different outcome,” Majority at 66, grossly\nunderestimates the mitigating force of that evidence. The Mt.\nMeigs mitigating evidence in Andrews is extraordinarily\nstrong. The majority’s reliance on Visciotti is unfounded.\n\n                              B\n\n    The California Supreme Court also reasoned that\nAndrews was not prejudiced because the Mt. Meigs evidence,\nin addition to evidence of abuse Andrews suffered as an adult\nin the Alabama prison system, is “not conclusively and\nunambiguously mitigating” but “could equally have proved\na double-edged sword.” See Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670–71.\nAccording to the California Supreme Court, “[r]ather than\nengendering sympathy” such evidence “could well have\nreinforced an impression of him as a person who had become\ndesensitized and inured to violence and disrespect for the\nlaw” or could have confirmed Andrews had “an antisocial\npersonality.” See id. at 671. That conclusion is unreasonable.\n\n   The jury already knew from Andrews’s heinous crimes of\nconviction and from the stipulated prior convictions that\nAndrews was antisocial and “had become desensitized and\n\f120                  ANDREWS V. DAVIS\n\ninured to violence and disrespect for the law.” No person\nconsidering Andrews’s crimes of conviction would conclude\notherwise. But the jurors knew absolutely nothing about\nAndrews’s past that might explain the person he had become\nand provide a basis for the exercise of mercy.\n\n     The severe and sustained abuse that Andrews suffered at\nMt. Meigs provides such evidence. The California Supreme\nCourt agreed the evidence presented at the state court hearing\n“leaves no doubt” Andrews “endured horrifically demeaning\nand degrading circumstances.” See Andrews, 52 P.3d at 670.\nYet the jury that sentenced Andrews to death knew nothing\nabout those circumstances. Had the jury heard that for two\nyears as a teenager Andrews was subjected to brutal,\ninhumane, and degrading abuse by his state custodians at a\nsegregated reform school for African-American children in\nAlabama in the 1960s, there is a reasonable probability that\nat least one juror would have been swayed to exercise mercy\nand spare Andrews’s life. There is “too much mitigating\nevidence that was not presented to now be ignored.” Porter,\n558 U.S. at 44 (internal quotation marks omitted). No\nreasonable person would conclude otherwise.\n\n    The prejudice to Andrews caused by the omission of the\nMt. Meigs evidence at sentencing is compounded by the fact\nthat counsel presented no sympathetic mitigating evidence at\nAndrews’s sentencing. Indeed, at the penalty phase of\nAndrews’s trial, counsel called no witnesses and offered no\nstatements from psychologists, family, or friends. In short,\ndefense counsel presented almost nothing to counter the\nprosecution’s portrayal of their client. The clearly established\nlaw of Strickland recognizes that some errors by counsel will\nhave “pervasive effect . . . altering the entire evidentiary\n\f                     ANDREWS V. DAVIS                      121\n\npicture.” See Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695–96. Andrews is\nsuch a case.\n\n    It is unconscionable that Andrews should be sentenced to\ndeath without consideration of the egregious abuse that he\nsuffered at Mt. Meigs. Had counsel presented the Mt. Meigs\nevidence at sentencing, it is reasonably probable that at least\none juror would have been moved to exercise mercy and\nspare Andrews’s life. It is objectively unreasonable, and a\nlegal fiction, to conclude otherwise.\n\n                              IV\n\n   The district court’s conditional grant of sentencing relief\nshould be affirmed. I respectfully dissent.\n\f</pre>",
