This effort was thwarted by an Act of the Michigan Legislature, Act No. 48, effective July 7, 1970, a copy of which is made an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal is under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292 (a) from the interlocutory order of the District Court entered September 3, 1970, which, among other things, refused to grant a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs are pupils and parents of pupils who attend the Detroit Public Schools, and the Detroit Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The defendants are the Governor of Michigan, the Attorney General of Michigan, the Acting State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State Board of Education, the Board of Education of the City of Detroit, three members of the latter board,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the Superintendent of the Detroit Public Schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1970, the Detroit Board of Education adopted a plan which provided for changes in twelve high school attendance zones, designed to effect a more balanced ratio of Negro and white students at the senior high school level. The plan was applicable to twelve of the twenty-one high schools in Detroit that serve particular neighborhood or geographical areas. The April 7 plan was to take effect over a three-year period, applying initially to those students entering the tenth grade in September 1970 at the beginning of 1970-71 school year. In successive stages the eleventh grade was to have been affected at the opening of the 1971-72 school year, and the twelfth grade at the beginning of the 1972-73 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Norman Drachler, the Superintendent of the Detroit Public Schools, testified that the plan was adopted after an extended study. He described the purpose of the plan as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q What was the purpose of the plan as adopted?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A The purpose of the plan was, in addition to complying with the regulations of the State Act 244, to bring about a decentralized school system within the city which would allow for the election of regional boards which would bring about greater participation at the local level by the community. That it would undoubtedly, in the opinion of most of us, add towards the improvement of quality education, quality integrated education insofar as possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Board of Education has, as long as I can recall, always accepted the premise that the task of improving education is a very complex one in a large city, but they have consistently held to the premise that wherever possible, wherever reasonably we can bring about integration in the process of developing our educational program, that this would enhance the opportunity of all children, black and white, both in terms of their educational achievement as well as their potential as responsible citizens in a democracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"So in this plan the Board saw an opportunity, the majority, that we could at the high school level in some twelve high schools bring about over a three-year period a certain amount of integration although it involved only the movement of some ten to twelve thousand children over the three-year period, nevertheless, that is, the transfer of 12,000 children in three years &#8212; nevertheless these children were in twelve schools which involved about 35,000 students, which is over 50 per cent of our total high school enrollment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We have certain high schools that are already integrated. Thus, we saw this as a step not only toward achieving a goal of the decentralization act but also the broader goal which the Board has always had of quality integrated education.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board of Education adopted the plan by a vote of four to two, with one member absent because of illness. This seventh member, who is represented to have favored the plan but was unable to vote, has since died and his vacancy has been filled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the April 7 plan was adopted, Dr. Drachler, the Superintendent of Public Schools, issued the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"As an educator I support the proposed plan because I believe that it is educationally, morally and according to our attorney legally sound. Most of the research and scholarship, both by blacks and whites that I respect, supports the view that integration, racial, religious and economic, has a positive effect on the learning of all children in a pluralistic society. As a student of American educational history I recognize that the above goal has been the dream of our nation for over a century. Local, state and national polls assert that the majority of our people concur with the desirability of integration and believe that eventually it will be a reality in our nation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Let us, therefore, have a plan for self renewal of our schools and our community rather than drift in the climate of uncertainty, fear and frustration. I recognize that our primary objective as teachers is quality education but to repeat, the majority of accepted research and scholarship asserts that quality education in a heterogeneous society such as ours can not be attained to its fullest measure without integration. It is essential for white and black, for poor and rich.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This plan directly affects only our high school students. Without it each constellation will continue a growing pattern of segregated racial or economic enclaves and be concerned only with the educational welfare of its own immediate area. This proposal, however, encourages a broader community concern for educational improvement and assures greater interest and support for quality education for tens of thousands of children wherever they attend school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Since as a people we concur with the necessity for eliminating religious, racial and economic barriers, let us, therefore, begin with a plan, however limited it is, let us begin where we are and move forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"America has been willing to deprive itself of billions of dollars to travel 250,000 miles in space to reach the moon, I am confident Detroiters will be willing to accept the idea of traveling one or two additional miles to school for the sake of a better education for our young people and for a better future for our city.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan was approved by the Michigan Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development by the following resolution:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Whereas racial integration is legally, morally and scientifically right, and Whereas, the President of the United States has stated that `quality is what education is all about' desegregation is vital to that quality, and, Whereas, the Board of Education of the Detroit Public Schools has approved a plan for high school students which effectively increases racial integration, therefore, Be It Resolved, that the Michigan Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development recognizes, endorses and vigorously supports this long needed and forward step for the future of America.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan was endorsed by other national and local agencies and organizations, including the United States Office of Education, the defendant Michigan State Board of Education and the Michigan Civil Rights Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following adoption of the plan on April 7, 1970, Detroit School officials began to prepare procedures to carry it into effect at the beginning of the 1970-71 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Michigan Legislature enacted, and on July 7, 1970, the Governor of Michigan signed into law, Act No. 48, Public Acts of 1970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 12 of this Act is as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Sec. 12. The implementation of any attendance provisions for the 1970-71 school year determined by any first class school district board shall be delayed pending the date of commencement of functions by the first class school district boards established under the provisions of this amendatory act but such provision shall not impair the right of any such board to determine and implement prior to such date such changes in attendance provisions as are mandated by practical necessity. In reviewing, confirming, establishing or modifying attendance provisions the first class school district boards established under the provisions of this amendatory act shall have a policy of open enrollment and shall enable students to attend a school of preference but providing priority acceptance, insofar as practicable, in cases of insufficient school capacity, to those students residing nearest the school and to those students desiring to attend the school for participation in vocationally oriented courses or other specialized curriculum.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms this statute applies only to \"first class school districts.\" The Detroit School system is the only \"first class school district\" in Michigan. Although on its face the statute is a general Act, it is applicable only to one local school system in the State.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following enactment of Act 48, the Superintendent of Detroit City Schools requested an opinion from the attorney for the Board of Education as to the effect of this statute. This opinion, dated July 28, 1970, contains the following language with respect to &#167; 12:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The answer to this question is found in Section 12 of Act 48. Section 12 says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">`The implementation of any attendance provisions for the 1970-71 school year determined by any first class school district board shall be delayed pending the date of commencement of functions by the first class school district boards established under the provisions of this amendatory act * * *.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This quoted portion of Section 12 obviously, albeit indirectly, addresses itself to the action taken by the Board on April 7, 1970, with respect to establishing new high school attendance areas. In our opinion, the effect of this provision is to rescind &#8212; for at least one year &#8212; the attempt made by the Board of Education on April 7, 1970, to achieve integration in its high schools. While Act 48 itself purports only to delay implementation until January 1, 1971, it is well known that no implementation begun even on January 1, 1971, could be placed into operation earlier than the beginning of the Fall semester in September, 1971. For these reasons we deem it unnecessary to recommend that the Board's action on April 7, 1970, establishing high school attendance areas be rescinded.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, a movement was initiated by certain Detroit voters to recall the four members of the Detroit School Board who had voted in favor of the April 7, 1970, plan. The recall movement was resolved at the August 4, 1970, election, which resulted in the recall and removal from office of the four board members who voted in favor of the April 7 plan. As stated in footnote 1, these four positions were vacant at the time the complaint was filed and on August 31, 1970, were filled by appointment by the Governor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with the opinion of the attorney for the Board of Education quoted above, Detroit school officials did not put the April 7 plan into effect for the 1970-71 school year beginning in September 1970. The Superintendent of City Schools testified that he instructed regional superintendents that \"we had to go back to the plan of April 6.\" The principals of the affected high schools sent out letters or otherwise notified students that regardless of any previous instructions to the contrary, they should attend the high school they would have attended prior to April 7. It is undisputed, that, obedient to the mandate of &#167; 12 of Act 48, the plan adopted by the Board of Education on April 7, has been suspended, or at least deferred to a time beyond January 1, 1971. The high schools in question have reverted to the attendance zones which were in effect prior to the April 7 action of the Board. The tenth grade students who would have attended a high school with an improved racial balance as determined by the Board of Education on April 7 have been deprived of that opportunity from the beginning of the 1970-71 school year until the time of the rendering of this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 18, 1970, plaintiffs filed their complaint in the present case as a class action, attacking the constitutionality of &#167; 12 of Act 48. Among other things the complaint prayed for a preliminary injunction requiring defendants to put into effect the plan adopted by the Detroit Board of Education on April 7 and restraining defendants from giving any force or effect to &#167; 12 of Act 48 insofar as it would inhibit immediate implementation of the Board's plan of April 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District Judge Stephen J. Roth advanced the case and scheduled a prompt hearing. Evidentiary hearings were conducted by Judge Roth for three days on August 27-28, and September 1, 1970. The testimony at these hearings comprises three typewritten volumes. On September 3, 1970, Judge Roth released a written opinion denying the application for a preliminary injunction and granting a motion to dismiss the Governor and Attorney General of Michigan as parties defendant. The District Court did not pass upon the issue of the constitutionality of &#167; 12 of Act 48.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was advanced on the docket of the District Court for hearing on its merits beginning November 2, 1970.

If this plan had come into existence under a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, there could be no question that &#167; 12 of Act 48 would be void. The Legislature of a State cannot annul the judgments nor determine the jurisdiction of the Courts of the United States. United States v.

It is true that, as a general rule, a State legislature has plenary power over the arms and instrumentalities of State government, including local boards of education. This power cannot be exercised, however, so as to deprive individuals of constitutionally protected rights. Gomillion v. Lightfoot, 364 U.S. 339, 81 S.Ct. 125, 5 L.Ed.2d 110, distinguishing City of Trenton v. New Jersey, 262 U.S. 182, 43 S.Ct. 534, 67 L.Ed. 937, Hunter v. City of Pittsburgh, 207 U.S. 161, 28 S.Ct. 40, 52 L.Ed. 151, and related cases. Mr. Justice Frankfurter, speaking for the Court in <i>Gomillion,</i> said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"When a State exercises power wholly within the domain of state interest, it is insulated from federal judicial review. But such insulation is not carried over when state power is used as an instrument for circumventing a federally protected right. This principle has had many applications. It has long been recognized in cases which have prohibited a State from exploiting a power acknowledged to be absolute in an isolated context to justify the imposition of an `unconstitutional condition.' What the Court has said in those cases is equally applicable here, <i>viz.,</i> that `Acts generally lawful may become unlawful when done to accomplish an unlawful end, United States v. Reading Co., 226 U.S. 324, 357, 33 S.Ct. 90, 57 L.Ed. 243, and a constitutional power cannot be used by way of condition to attain an unconstitutional result.' Western Union Telegraph Co. v.

In <i>Deal</i> this Court held that the school board of a long-established unitary non-racial school system had no constitutional obligation to bus white and Negro children away from districts of their residences in order that racial complexion be balanced in each of the many public schools in the City. In the present case the Detroit Board of Education in the exercise of its discretion took affirmative steps on its own initiative to effect an improved racial balance in twelve senior high schools. This action was thwarted, or at least delayed, by an act of the State Legislature. No comparable situation was presented in <i>Deal.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants defend the constitutionality of the second sentence of &#167; 12 of Act 48 on the ground that the word \"shall,\" which appears twice in that sentence, was intended to mean \"may,\" and that the sentence is not mandatory. We reject this interpretation of the sentence. We find nothing in the Act to indicate any intention on the part of the Legislature to leave the application of this sentence to the discretion of local school officials. We are cited to nothing in the legislative history to support such an interpretation. The word \"shall\" is ordinarily \"the language of command.\" Anderson v. Yungkau, 329 U.S. 482, 485, 67 S.Ct. 428, 91 L.Ed. 436; Escoe v. Zerbst, 295 U.S. 490, 493, 55 S.Ct. 818, 79 L.Ed. 1566. We interpret the word \"shall\" in the second sentence of &#167; 12 as meaning precisely what the Michigan legislature said.

By this ruling on the invalidity of &#167; 12, we express no opinion at the present stage of the case as to the merits of the plan adopted by the School Board on April 7, 1970, or as to whether it was the constitutional obligation of the School Board to adopt all or any part of that plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>2) Denial of Preliminary Injunction</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although holding that &#167; 12 of Act 48 is unconstitutional, we cannot say that the District Judge abused his discretion in refusing to grant a preliminary injunction upon the basis of the evidence introduced during the three days of hearings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The granting or denial of a preliminary injunction pending final hearing on the merits is within the sound judicial discretion of the District Court.

This effort was thwarted by an Act of the Michigan Legislature, Act No. 48, effective July 7, 1970, a copy of which is made an appendix to this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appeal is under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292 (a) from the interlocutory order of the District Court entered September 3, 1970, which, among other things, refused to grant a preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs are pupils and parents of pupils who attend the Detroit Public Schools, and the Detroit Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The defendants are the Governor of Michigan, the Attorney General of Michigan, the Acting State Superintendent of Public Instruction, the State Board of Education, the Board of Education of the City of Detroit, three members of the latter board,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and the Superintendent of the Detroit Public Schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 7, 1970, the Detroit Board of Education adopted a plan which provided for changes in twelve high school attendance zones, designed to effect a more balanced ratio of Negro and white students at the senior high school level. The plan was applicable to twelve of the twenty-one high schools in Detroit that serve particular neighborhood or geographical areas. The April 7 plan was to take effect over a three-year period, applying initially to those students entering the tenth grade in September 1970 at the beginning of 1970-71 school year. In successive stages the eleventh grade was to have been affected at the opening of the 1971-72 school year, and the twelfth grade at the beginning of the 1972-73 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Norman Drachler, the Superintendent of the Detroit Public Schools, testified that the plan was adopted after an extended study. He described the purpose of the plan as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q What was the purpose of the plan as adopted?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"A The purpose of the plan was, in addition to complying with the regulations of the State Act 244, to bring about a decentralized school system within the city which would allow for the election of regional boards which would bring about greater participation at the local level by the community. That it would undoubtedly, in the opinion of most of us, add towards the improvement of quality education, quality integrated education insofar as possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Board of Education has, as long as I can recall, always accepted the premise that the task of improving education is a very complex one in a large city, but they have consistently held to the premise that wherever possible, wherever reasonably we can bring about integration in the process of developing our educational program, that this would enhance the opportunity of all children, black and white, both in terms of their educational achievement as well as their potential as responsible citizens in a democracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"So in this plan the Board saw an opportunity, the majority, that we could at the high school level in some twelve high schools bring about over a three-year period a certain amount of integration although it involved only the movement of some ten to twelve thousand children over the three-year period, nevertheless, that is, the transfer of 12,000 children in three years &#8212; nevertheless these children were in twelve schools which involved about 35,000 students, which is over 50 per cent of our total high school enrollment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We have certain high schools that are already integrated. Thus, we saw this as a step not only toward achieving a goal of the decentralization act but also the broader goal which the Board has always had of quality integrated education.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board of Education adopted the plan by a vote of four to two, with one member absent because of illness. This seventh member, who is represented to have favored the plan but was unable to vote, has since died and his vacancy has been filled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time the April 7 plan was adopted, Dr. Drachler, the Superintendent of Public Schools, issued the following statement:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"As an educator I support the proposed plan because I believe that it is educationally, morally and according to our attorney legally sound. Most of the research and scholarship, both by blacks and whites that I respect, supports the view that integration, racial, religious and economic, has a positive effect on the learning of all children in a pluralistic society. As a student of American educational history I recognize that the above goal has been the dream of our nation for over a century. Local, state and national polls assert that the majority of our people concur with the desirability of integration and believe that eventually it will be a reality in our nation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Let us, therefore, have a plan for self renewal of our schools and our community rather than drift in the climate of uncertainty, fear and frustration. I recognize that our primary objective as teachers is quality education but to repeat, the majority of accepted research and scholarship asserts that quality education in a heterogeneous society such as ours can not be attained to its fullest measure without integration. It is essential for white and black, for poor and rich.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This plan directly affects only our high school students. Without it each constellation will continue a growing pattern of segregated racial or economic enclaves and be concerned only with the educational welfare of its own immediate area. This proposal, however, encourages a broader community concern for educational improvement and assures greater interest and support for quality education for tens of thousands of children wherever they attend school.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Since as a people we concur with the necessity for eliminating religious, racial and economic barriers, let us, therefore, begin with a plan, however limited it is, let us begin where we are and move forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"America has been willing to deprive itself of billions of dollars to travel 250,000 miles in space to reach the moon, I am confident Detroiters will be willing to accept the idea of traveling one or two additional miles to school for the sake of a better education for our young people and for a better future for our city.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan was approved by the Michigan Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development by the following resolution:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Whereas racial integration is legally, morally and scientifically right, and Whereas, the President of the United States has stated that `quality is what education is all about' desegregation is vital to that quality, and, Whereas, the Board of Education of the Detroit Public Schools has approved a plan for high school students which effectively increases racial integration, therefore, Be It Resolved, that the Michigan Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development recognizes, endorses and vigorously supports this long needed and forward step for the future of America.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan was endorsed by other national and local agencies and organizations, including the United States Office of Education, the defendant Michigan State Board of Education and the Michigan Civil Rights Commission.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following adoption of the plan on April 7, 1970, Detroit School officials began to prepare procedures to carry it into effect at the beginning of the 1970-71 school year.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Michigan Legislature enacted, and on July 7, 1970, the Governor of Michigan signed into law, Act No. 48, Public Acts of 1970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Section 12 of this Act is as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Sec. 12.

This opinion, dated July 28, 1970, contains the following language with respect to &#167; 12:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The answer to this question is found in Section 12 of Act 48. Section 12 says:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">`The implementation of any attendance provisions for the 1970-71 school year determined by any first class school district board shall be delayed pending the date of commencement of functions by the first class school district boards established under the provisions of this amendatory act * * *.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"This quoted portion of Section 12 obviously, albeit indirectly, addresses itself to the action taken by the Board on April 7, 1970, with respect to establishing new high school attendance areas. In our opinion, the effect of this provision is to rescind &#8212; for at least one year &#8212; the attempt made by the Board of Education on April 7, 1970, to achieve integration in its high schools. While Act 48 itself purports only to delay implementation until January 1, 1971, it is well known that no implementation begun even on January 1, 1971, could be placed into operation earlier than the beginning of the Fall semester in September, 1971. For these reasons we deem it unnecessary to recommend that the Board's action on April 7, 1970, establishing high school attendance areas be rescinded.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, a movement was initiated by certain Detroit voters to recall the four members of the Detroit School Board who had voted in favor of the April 7, 1970, plan. The recall movement was resolved at the August 4, 1970, election, which resulted in the recall and removal from office of the four board members who voted in favor of the April 7 plan. As stated in footnote 1, these four positions were vacant at the time the complaint was filed and on August 31, 1970, were filled by appointment by the Governor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In accordance with the opinion of the attorney for the Board of Education quoted above, Detroit school officials did not put the April 7 plan into effect for the 1970-71 school year beginning in September 1970. The Superintendent of City Schools testified that he instructed regional superintendents that \"we had to go back to the plan of April 6.\" The principals of the affected high schools sent out letters or otherwise notified students that regardless of any previous instructions to the contrary, they should attend the high school they would have attended prior to April 7. It is undisputed, that, obedient to the mandate of &#167; 12 of Act 48, the plan adopted by the Board of Education on April 7, has been suspended, or at least deferred to a time beyond January 1, 1971. The high schools in question have reverted to the attendance zones which were in effect prior to the April 7 action of the Board. The tenth grade students who would have attended a high school with an improved racial balance as determined by the Board of Education on April 7 have been deprived of that opportunity from the beginning of the 1970-71 school year until the time of the rendering of this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 18, 1970, plaintiffs filed their complaint in the present case as a class action, attacking the constitutionality of &#167; 12 of Act 48. Among other things the complaint prayed for a preliminary injunction requiring defendants to put into effect the plan adopted by the Detroit Board of Education on April 7 and restraining defendants from giving any force or effect to &#167; 12 of Act 48 insofar as it would inhibit immediate implementation of the Board's plan of April 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District Judge Stephen J. Roth advanced the case and scheduled a prompt hearing. Evidentiary hearings were conducted by Judge Roth for three days on August 27-28, and September 1, 1970. The testimony at these hearings comprises three typewritten volumes. On September 3, 1970, Judge Roth released a written opinion denying the application for a preliminary injunction and granting a motion to dismiss the Governor and Attorney General of Michigan as parties defendant.

In <i>Deal</i> this Court held that the school board of a long-established unitary non-racial school system had no constitutional obligation to bus white and Negro children away from districts of their residences in order that racial complexion be balanced in each of the many public schools in the City. In the present case the Detroit Board of Education in the exercise of its discretion took affirmative steps on its own initiative to effect an improved racial balance in twelve senior high schools. This action was thwarted, or at least delayed, by an act of the State Legislature. No comparable situation was presented in <i>Deal.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants defend the constitutionality of the second sentence of &#167; 12 of Act 48 on the ground that the word \"shall,\" which appears twice in that sentence, was intended to mean \"may,\" and that the sentence is not mandatory.

We find nothing in the Act to indicate any intention on the part of the Legislature to leave the application of this sentence to the discretion of local school officials. We are cited to nothing in the legislative history to support such an interpretation. The word \"shall\" is ordinarily \"the language of command.\" Anderson v.
