          "plain_text": "Present:    All the Justices\n\nJUSTIN SARAFIN\n\nv.   Record No. 131747         OPINION BY JUSTICE DONALD W. LEMONS\n                                         October 31, 2014\nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\n\n               FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA\n\n      In this opinion we consider the definition of \"operate\"\n\nand whether such operation must be \"on a highway\" to sustain a\n\nconviction for driving under the influence pursuant to Code §\n\n18.2-266.\n\n                  I.   Facts and Proceedings Below\n\n      On January 20, 2011, Officer K.E. McBrearty of the\n\nCharlottesville Police Department responded to a noise\n\ncomplaint at 1001 Page Street in Charlottesville.      When\n\nOfficer McBrearty arrived at the scene, she observed Justin\n\nSarafin (\"Sarafin\") sitting in the driver's seat of his\n\nvehicle, which was parked in his private driveway.      Sarafin\n\nwas asleep – although the key was in the ignition and was\n\nturned backward to activate the vehicle's auxiliary power.\n\nMcBrearty knocked on the window and Sarafin awoke, turned off\n\nthe vehicle's auxiliary power, and exited the vehicle.\n\n      Once Sarafin was outside the vehicle, McBrearty smelled\n\nalcohol and noticed his eyes were bloodshot and glassy.       She\n\nquestioned Sarafin about his activities that evening, and he\n\nadmitted to consuming several beers at a local pub, picking up\n\fdinner at a different location, driving home, consuming more\n\nalcohol, and then returning to his vehicle to listen to the\n\nradio.   Sarafin stated he never intended to leave his driveway\n\nand, in fact, had fallen asleep around 2:30 a.m. while\n\nlistening to music.\n\n     Officer McBrearty administered several field sobriety\n\ntests.   Sarafin failed three out of five.   Officer McBrearty\n\nalso administered a preliminary breath test and, based on\n\nthose results, arrested Sarafin for operating a vehicle under\n\nthe influence of alcohol in violation of Code § 18.2-266.\n\n     Sarafin's first trial in the Circuit Court for the City\n\nof Charlottesville (\"circuit court\") resulted in a hung jury.\n\nPrior to his second trial, Sarafin filed a motion requesting a\n\ndetermination of the legal definition of \"operate\" and\n\n\"operation.\"   He then filed a pretrial \"motion to strike,\"\n\narguing he could not be convicted under Code § 18.2-266\n\nbecause he was on private property and, alternatively, there\n\nwas no evidence that he ever intended to activate the motive\n\npower of the vehicle.   The circuit court never addressed\n\nSarafin's pre-trial motions, and the case proceeded to trial.\n\n     Following the Commonwealth's case-in-chief, Sarafin moved\n\nto strike the evidence.   The circuit court took this motion\n\nunder advisement.   Sarafin presented several witnesses,\n\ntestified on his own behalf and renewed his motion to strike\n\n\n                                2\n\fwhich the circuit court again took under advisement.      He then\n\nproposed jury instructions I, J, K and L. 1   The circuit court\n\nrefused Sarafin's instructions and granted the Commonwealth's\n\nInstruction 6 over his objections.\n\n         The jury returned a guilty verdict and affixed\n\npunishment at a $500 fine.     In its conviction order dated\n\nNovember 7, 2012, the circuit court imposed the jury's verdict\n\nand, in addition, revoked Sarafin's operator's license for 12\n\nmonths. 2\n\n     Sarafin appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals\n\nof Virginia, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nconvict him of violating Code § 18.2-266 because he was not\n\n\"operating\" the vehicle on a highway, and that the circuit\n\ncourt erred by refusing his jury instructions.     In its\n\npublished opinion, Sarafin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. App. 385,\n\n748 S.E.2d 641 (2013), the Court of Appeals affirmed Sarafin's\n\nconviction.\n\n     1\n       Sarafin also proposed an alternative version of\nInstruction I, designated as Instruction I(A), which was\nrefused. None of his assignments of error specifically\naddress the refusal to give this instruction, focusing instead\non Instructions I, J, K, and L. Accordingly, Instruction I(A)\nis not before us. Rule 5:17(c)(1)(i)(\"Only assignments of\nerror assigned in the petition for appeal will be noticed by\nthis Court.\").\n     2\n       The circuit court suspended $250 of Sarafin’s fine,\nconditioned upon successful completion of the Virginia Alcohol\nSafety Action Program.\n\n\n\n                                  3\n\f       The Court of Appeals held that under this Court's\n\nprecedents, Sarafin had actual physical control of the vehicle\n\nand was therefore \"operating\" his vehicle within the meaning\n\nof Code § 18.2-266.   Sarafin, 62 Va. App. at 393-402, 748\n\nS.E.2d at 645-49 (citing Enriquez v. Commonwealth, 283 Va.\n\n511, 516-17, 722 S.E.2d 252, 255 (2012)).    Citing some of its\n\nearlier decisions, the Court of Appeals held that \"public\n\nownership of the property upon which the vehicle is driven or\n\noperated is not an element the Commonwealth must prove in a\n\nprosecution for driving in violation of Code § 18.2-266.\"      Id.\n\nat 398, 748 S.E.2d at 647 (quoting Mitchell v. Commonwealth,\n\n26 Va. App. 27, 35, 492 S.E.2d 839, 843 (1997)(citing Gray v.\n\nCommonwealth, 23 Va. App. 351, 353, 477 S.E.2d 301, 302-03\n\n(1996)).   The Court of Appeals concluded that any reference to\n\n\"on a highway\" in Enriquez, 283 Va. at 516-17, 722 S.E.2d at\n\n255, was dicta.    Sarafin, 62 Va. App. at 400-01, 748 S.E.2d at\n\n648.   Based on these definitional holdings, the Court of\n\nAppeals affirmed the circuit court's refusal of Sarafin's\n\nproffered jury instructions.    Id. at 402-03, 748 S.E.2d at\n\n649.\n\n       Sarafin appealed the judgment of the Court of Appeals to\n\nthis Court, and we awarded an appeal on the following\n\nassignments of error:\n\n\n\n\n                                 4\n\f  1. The Virginia Court of Appeals erred by permitting\n     the trial court to find that Justin Sarafin\n     (\"Sarafin\") was in physical control of his vehicle\n     and thereby that he was its \"operator\" while asleep\n     with only his car radio playing while parked on his\n     private property.\n\n       a. The Virginia Court of Appeals erred by finding\n          that these facts were sufficient to support the\n          trial court's conviction.\n\n  2. The Virginia Court of Appeals erred in construing\n     Va. Code § 18.2-266 to allow conviction for\n     \"operation\" on private property.\n\n  3. The Virginia Court of Appeals erred by not requiring\n     the trial court to give any or all of Instructions\n     I, J, K and L offered by Sarafin that precisely and\n     correctly defined what constituted \"operation\" to\n     the jury.\n\n                           II.   Analysis\n\n   A. Standard of Review\n\n      Assignments of error 1 and 2 require us to interpret the\n\nmeaning of \"operate [a] motor vehicle\" as used in Code § 18.2-\n\n266 and whether \"operation\" on private property is within the\n\nscope of the statute.   Questions of statutory interpretation\n\nare reviewed de novo.   Belew v. Commonwealth, 284 Va. 173,\n\n177, 726 S.E.2d 257, 259 (2012).      Whether Sarafin operated his\n\nvehicle in a manner which violated Code § 18.2-266 is a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact which is reviewed de novo.      Nelson v.\n\nCommonwealth, 281 Va. 212, 215, 707 S.E.2d 815, 816 (2011).\n\n\n\n\n                                  5\n\f     Sarafin's third assignment of error focuses upon the\n\ncircuit court's refusal of Jury Instructions I, J, K and L.\n\nAs a general rule, the decision to grant or deny proffered\n\ninstructions rests within the sound discretion of the trial\n\ncourt.   See Daniels v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 460, 466, 657\n\nS.E.2d 84, 87 (2008).    However, \"whether a jury instruction\n\naccurately states the relevant law is a question of law that\n\nwe review de novo.\"     Lawlor v. Commonwealth, 285 Va. 187, 228,\n\n738 S.E.2d 847, 870 (2013)(quoting Orthopedic & Sports\n\nPhysical Therapy Assocs., Inc. v. Summit Group Props., LLC,\n\n283 Va. 777, 782, 724 S.E.2d 718, 721 (2012)).    In deciding\n\nwhether a particular instruction is proper, we view the facts\n\nin the light most favorable to the proponent of the\n\ninstruction.   See Commonwealth v. Cary, 271 Va. 87, 91, 623\n\nS.E.2d 906, 907 (2006).\n\n  B. Code § 18.2-266\n\n     Code § 18.2-266 provides, in relevant part:\n\n           It shall be unlawful for any person to\n           drive or operate any motor vehicle, engine\n           or train . . . while such person is under\n           the influence of alcohol. . . .\n           For the purposes of this article, the term\n           \"motor vehicle\" includes mopeds, while\n           operated on the public highways of this\n           Commonwealth.\n\n\n\n\n                                 6\n\fSarafin's appeal involves two basic inquiries: (1) the\n\ndefinition of \"operate,\" and (2) whether operation must occur\n\non a highway to sustain a conviction under Code § 18.2-266.\n\n            1. Actual Physical Control\n\n     Our past decisions involving operation of a vehicle under\n\nthe influence have focused on whether the defendant was in\n\nactual physical control of the vehicle.     See, e.g., Enriquez,\n\n283 Va. at 511, 722 S.E.2d at 252; Nelson, 281 Va. at 214,\n\n219, 707 S.E.2d at 815, 818; Nicolls v. Commonwealth, 212 Va.\n\n257, 258, 259, 184 S.E.2d 9, 10, 11 (1971); Gallagher v.\n\nCommonwealth, 205 Va. 666, 667, 670, 139 S.E.2d 37, 38, 40\n\n(1964).    In Nelson, we addressed a factual scenario remarkably\n\nsimilar to this case.     Nelson was asleep inside his vehicle\n\nwhich was parked in the cul-de-sac of a residential\n\nneighborhood.     281 Va. at 214, 707 S.E.2d at 816.   The\n\nignition was in the auxiliary position, and the radio was\n\nplaying.    Id.   Nelson argued that, based on these facts, he\n\nwas not operating his motor vehicle.     Id. at 215, 707 S.E.2d\n\nat 816.    We disagreed, holding that:\n\n                 \"Operating\" means \"engaging the\n            machinery of the vehicle which alone, or\n            in sequence, will activate the motive\n            power of the vehicle.\" Manipulating the\n            electrical equipment was one step between\n            the \"off\" position and the point at which\n            the motive power would be activated. While\n            Nelson's action in turning the key to the\n            \"on\" or \"accessory\" position of the\n\n\n                                  7\n\f            ignition did not alone activate the motive\n            power, it was an action taken \"in\n            sequence\" up to the point of activation,\n            making him the operator of the vehicle\n            within the meaning of Code § 18.2-266.\n\nNelson, 281 Va. at 219, 707 S.E.2d at 818 (internal citation\n\nomitted).\n\n     Just a year after deciding Nelson, we again addressed the\n\nmeaning of \"operate\" in Enriquez.     We stated that \"any\n\nindividual who is in actual physical control of a vehicle is\n\nan operator.\"    Enriquez, 283 Va. at 516, 722 S.E.2d at 255\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).    In defining \"actual\n\nphysical control,\" we embraced the dissenting opinion in\n\nStevenson v. City of Falls Church, 243 Va. 434, 439-40, 416\n\nS.E.2d 435, 438-39 (1992)(Compton, J., dissenting), which\n\nstated:\n\n            Ordinary experience tells us that one in a\n            drunken stupor in the driver's seat of a\n            vehicle is likely to arouse abruptly,\n            engage the motive power of the vehicle,\n            and roar away imperiling the lives of\n            innocent citizens. This sequence of events\n            easily can occur where, as here, a drunk\n            is sitting behind the steering wheel of a\n            motor vehicle alone, with the key already\n            in the ignition. From a mechanical\n            standpoint, the vehicle is capable of\n            being immediately placed in motion to\n            become a menace to the public, and to its\n            drunken operator.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we held in Enriquez that:\n\n            [I]n discerning whether an intoxicated\n            person seated behind the steering wheel of\n\n\n                                 8\n\f          a motor vehicle . . . with the key\n          inserted into the ignition switch of the\n          vehicle is in actual physical control of\n          the vehicle, the position of the key in\n          the ignition switch is not determinative.\n          [W]hen an intoxicated person is seated\n          behind the steering wheel . . . and the\n          key is in the ignition switch, he is in\n          actual physical control of the vehicle\n          and, therefore, is guilty of operating the\n          vehicle while under the influence of\n          alcohol within the meaning of Code § 18.2-\n          266.\n\n283 Va. at 516-17, 722 S.E.2d at 255.\n\n     In this case, Sarafin was in actual physical control of\n\nhis vehicle.   He was seated behind the steering wheel, and the\n\nkey was in the ignition switch.       Accordingly, under our prior\n\ncase law, the evidence was sufficient to conclude that he was\n\nan operator of the vehicle.\n\n          2. \"On a Highway\"\n\n     The difference between this case and Nelson and Enriquez\n\nis the location of the vehicle.       In Nelson and Enriquez the\n\nvehicles were clearly on public highways.       Compare Nelson, 281\n\nVa. at 214, 707 S.E.2d at 816, with Enriquez, 283 Va. at 513,\n\n722 S.E.2d at 253.   In this case, Sarafin was on private\n\nproperty, namely, his own driveway.      The question remains\n\nwhether Code § 18.2-266 is violated when the operation of the\n\nvehicle occurs on a private way.\n\n     Code § 18.2-266 contains an explicit \"on a highway\"\n\nrequirement for the operation of mopeds.      However, the statute\n\n\n                                  9\n\fincludes no explicit language requiring an operator of a motor\n\nvehicle to be \"on a highway\" to sustain a conviction under\n\nCode § 18.2-266.    Sarafin invites us, based on his reading of\n\nthe definition of \"operator\" contained in Code § 46.2-100, 3 to\n\nimply an \"on a highway\" requirement for illegal operation of a\n\nmotor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.     We decline this\n\ninvitation for several reasons.\n\n         First, we agree with the Commonwealth that the plain\n\nlanguage of Code § 18.2-266 demonstrates there is no \"on a\n\nhighway\" requirement for the operation of motor vehicles.       The\n\nGeneral Assembly clearly knows how to impose an \"on a highway\"\n\nrequirement, but chose not to do so where the operator of a\n\nmotor vehicle is intoxicated.    In Code § 18.2-266, the General\n\nAssembly prohibits the operation of \"mopeds, [] on the public\n\nhighways of this Commonwealth\" while the operator is\n\nintoxicated.    (Emphasis added.)\n\n     Similarly, the General Assembly included a \"public\n\nhighway\" requirement in Virginia’s implied consent statute,\n\n\n     3\n         Code § 46.2-100 defines \"operator\" as:\n\n             every person who either (i) drives or is\n             in actual physical control of a motor\n             vehicle on a highway or (ii) is exercising\n             control over or steering a vehicle being\n             towed by a motor vehicle.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n                                 10\n\fCode § 18.2-268.2.   Of course, the implied consent law is\n\nbased upon the premise that a user of public roads in the\n\nCommonwealth consents \"to have samples of his blood, breath,\n\nor both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to\n\ndetermine the alcohol, drug, or both alcohol and drug content\n\nof his blood, if he is arrested for violation of § 18.2-266,\n\n18.2-266.1, or subsection B of § 18.2-272 or of a similar\n\nordinance within three hours of the alleged offense.\"     Id.\n\n     \"[W]hen the General Assembly has used specific language\n\nin one instance, but omits that language or uses different\n\nlanguage when addressing a similar subject elsewhere in the\n\nCode, we must presume that the difference in the choice of\n\nlanguage was intentional.\"    See Zinone v. Lee's Crossing\n\nHomeowners Ass'n, 282 Va. 330, 337, 714 S.E.2d 922, 925\n\n(2011)(citing Hollingsworth v. Norfolk Southern Railway, 279\n\nVa. 360, 366-67 & n.2, 689 S.E.2d 651, 654-55 & n.2 (2010);\n\nHalifax Corp. v. First Union National Bank, 262 Va. 91, 100,\n\n546 S.E.2d 696, 702 (2001).   Based on this well-established\n\nrule of statutory construction, we hold that Code § 18.2-266\n\ncontains no \"on a highway\" requirement for the operation of\n\nmotor vehicles.\n\n      Our conclusion is further supported by the fact that\n\nCode § 18.2-266 applies equally to motor vehicles, engines and\n\ntrains.   Trains are operated on privately-owned tracks, not\n\n\n                                11\n\fpublic highways.   See, e.g., Preseault v. United States, 100\n\nF.3d 1525, 1568-69 (Fed. Cir. 1996)(quoting Osgood v. Central\n\nVermont Ry. Co., 60 A. 137, 140 (Vt. 1905))(\"A railroad\n\ncorporation holds its station, grounds, railroad tracks . . .\n\nas its private property.\"); Coonce v. Missouri P. R. Co., 358\n\nS.W.2d 852, 854 (Mo. 1962)(\"A railroad track is private\n\nproperty and the railroad generally has the exclusive right to\n\nthe use of its tracks.\").   Sarafin urges us to impose a public\n\nhighway requirement for the operation of motor vehicles, which\n\nwould require us to read \"engine[s] or train[s]\" out of the\n\nstatute.   If the General Assembly had intended to segregate\n\nthe operation of trains from the operation of motor vehicles,\n\nit certainly knows how to do so. 4    Because Code § 18.2-266\n\napplies equally to motor vehicles, engines and trains, and\n\ntrains only operate on private tracks, we would have to carve\n\nout an implicit \"private way\" exception for motor vehicles in\n\norder to grant Sarafin relief.    This would require us to usurp\n\nthe legislative function of the General Assembly, which we\n\nrefuse to do.   Instead we are bound by the plain meaning of\n\nthe statute, which compels our conclusion that Code § 18.2-266\n\n\n     4\n       The General Assembly has segregated the operation of\naircraft and watercraft while under the influence from the\noperation of motor vehicles while under the influence. Code §\n29.1-738 prohibits operation of watercraft while under the\ninfluence of alcohol and Code § 5.1-13 prohibits operation of\naircraft while under the influence of alcohol.\n\n                                 12\n\fcontains no \"private way\" exception for the operation of motor\n\nvehicles.\n\n     In its argument before this Court, the Commonwealth noted\n\nthat we have previously upheld convictions for driving under\n\nthe influence in two cases where the vehicles were on private\n\nproperty.   See Valentine v. County of Brunswick, 202 Va. 696,\n\n697, 699, 119 S.E.2d 486, 486-87, 488 (1961); Williams v. City\n\nof Petersburg, 216 Va. 297, 298, 301, 217 S.E.2d 893, 894, 896\n\n(1975).   While those cases involved convictions under county\n\ndrunk driving ordinances, the ordinances at issue were similar\n\nto Code § 18.2-266.   Therefore, our reasoning in Valentine,\n\n202 Va. at 698-99, 119 S.E.2d 487-88, and Williams, 216 Va. at\n\n299, 217 S.E.2d at 895, supports our conclusion that Code §\n\n18.2-266 has no \"on a highway\" requirement.\n\n     Finally, Sarafin argues that this Court incorporated an\n\n\"on a highway\" requirement into the rule it announced in\n\nEnriquez, when we stated that:\n\n            When an intoxicated person is seated\n            behind the steering wheel of a motor\n            vehicle on a public highway and the key is\n            in the ignition switch, he is in actual\n            physical control of the vehicle and,\n            therefore, is guilty of operating the\n            vehicle while under the influence of\n            alcohol within the meaning of Code § 18.2-\n            266.\n\n283 Va. at 517, 722 S.E.2d at 255 (emphasis added).      However,\n\nthe issue in Enriquez was not whether the defendant was on a\n\n\n                                 13\n\fpublic highway, but rather, whether the defendant was in\n\nactual physical control of his vehicle.    Neither of the\n\nparties in Enriquez briefed or argued any contention that Code\n\n§ 18.2-266 contained an \"on a highway\" requirement.    Because\n\nthe reference to \"on a highway\" was not essential to the\n\nCourt's judgment, it is unbinding dicta.    See Harmon v. Peery,\n\n145 Va. 578, 583, 134 S.E. 701, 702 (1926) (\"Obiter dicta are\n\nsuch opinions uttered by the way, not upon the point or\n\nquestion pending, . . . as if turning aside . . . from the\n\nmain topic of the case to collateral subjects.\" (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n  C. Jury Instructions\n\n      Sarafin proposed four jury instructions which are now\n\nbefore us on appeal.   Proposed Instruction I reads:\n\n          Operating means driving a motor vehicle\n          from one place to another; starting the\n          engine; or engaging the machinery of a\n          vehicle which alone or in sequence will\n          activate the motive power of the vehicle\n          without actually putting the vehicle in\n          motion; or manipulating the electrical or\n          mechanical equipment which alone or in\n          sequence will activate the motive power of\n          the vehicle without actually putting the\n          vehicle in motion. Any individual who is\n          in actual physical control of a vehicle on\n          a public roadway is an operator. When the\n          engine is not running in a private\n          driveway, the Commonwealth must prove by\n          direct or circumstantial evidence that the\n          defendant specifically intended to\n          activate the motive power of the vehicle\n\n\n\n                               14\n\f             to enter a public roadway while under the\n             influence of alcohol.\n\nProposed Instruction K defines an \"operator\" as \"every person\n\nwho drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle\n\non a highway.\"    Proposed Instructions L and J provide the\n\ndefendant's definition of \"highway\" and \"private road or\n\ndriveway.\"    The circuit court refused each of Sarafin's\n\nproposed instructions, giving Instruction 6 instead:\n\n             Operating a motor vehicle means driving\n             the vehicle from one place to another or\n             starting the engine or manipulating the\n             electrical or mechanical equipment of the\n             vehicle without actually putting the\n             vehicle in motion or engaging the\n             machinery of the vehicle which alone or in\n             sequence will activate the motive power of\n             the vehicle.\n\n     It was not improper for the circuit court to grant\n\nInstruction 6 and refuse Instructions I, J, K and L.\n\nInstruction 6 clearly states the law and covers the issues\n\nfairly raised by the evidence.    In contrast, Instructions I,\n\nJ, K and L either misstate the law or are irrelevant based on\n\nthe facts of this case.\n\n     Given our holding that Code § 18.2-266 contains no \"on a\n\nhighway\" requirement, the inclusion of such a requirement in\n\nthe definition of operating a motor vehicle as set forth in\n\nproposed Instruction I is incorrect.    Similarly, proposed\n\nInstructions J and L are irrelevant, because the jury did not\n\n\n\n                                 15\n\fneed definitions of \"highway\" and \"private road or driveway\"\n\nto convict the defendant of violating Code § 18.2-266.\n\nFinally, proposed Instruction K was properly refused, even\n\nthough it correctly recited the definition of operator\n\ncontained in Code § 46.2-100, because Code § 18.2-266 has no\n\n\"on a highway\" requirement.\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n     We will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals\n\nupholding Sarafin's conviction.\n\n                                                          Affirmed.\n\n\nJUSTICE MIMS, dissenting.\n     In Enriquez v. Commonwealth, 283 Va. 511, 517, 722 S.E.2d\n\n252, 255 (2012), we said that\n\n          when an intoxicated person is seated\n          behind the steering wheel of a motor\n          vehicle on a public highway and the key is\n          in the ignition switch, he is in actual\n          physical control of the vehicle and,\n          therefore, is guilty of operating the\n          vehicle while under the influence of\n          alcohol within the meaning of Code § 18.2-\n          266.\n(Emphasis added). 1   Our holding in that case therefore applies\n\nonly when the motor vehicle is located on a public highway.\n\nThe motor vehicle in this case was not.      Consequently, “[t]he\n\nCourt seeks to avoid the obvious import of this language by\n\n\n     1\n       This emphasized portion of Enriquez is omitted from the\nquotation in Part II(B)(1) of the majority opinion.\n\n                                 16\n\fcharacterizing it as mere dicta.      Only a concept of dictum\n\nthat includes the very reasoning of the opinion could support\n\nthis characterization.”     Rogers v. Tennessee, 532 U.S. 451,\n\n469 (Scalia, J., dissenting).    I therefore must dissent.\n\n        In Enriquez, the defendant was parked at a bus stop on a\n\npublic highway.    283 Va. at 513, 722 S.E.2d at 253.    He “was\n\ngoing to see his girlfriend but was not sure as to where [she]\n\nwas.”     Id. at 514, 722 S.E.2d at 254 (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    The key was in the vehicle’s ignition but no trial\n\nwitness knew what position it was in.      Id.\n\n        Appealing his conviction under Code § 18.2-266, Enriquez\n\nnoted our decision in Stevenson v. City of Falls Church, 243\n\nVa. 434, 416 S.E.2d 435 (1992), wherein we reversed an earlier\n\nconviction under Code § 18.2-266 on similar facts.      In\n\ndeciding that Stevenson did not control, we explicitly\n\n“turn[ed] for assistance to Code § 46.2-100.”     We observed\n\nthat “Code § 46.2-100 provides that ‘operator’ or ‘driver’\n\nmeans every person who either (i) drives or is in actual\n\nphysical control of a motor vehicle on a highway or (ii) is\n\nexercising control over or steering a vehicle being towed by a\n\nmotor vehicle.”     Enriquez, 283 Va. at 515-16, 722 S.E.2d at\n\n255 (internal quotation marks, alterations, and emphasis\n\nomitted).\n\n        We also observed that in an earlier decision, Williams v.\n\nCity of Petersburg, 216 Va. 297, 217 S.E.2d 893 (1975), “we\n\n\n\n\n                                 17\n\fstated that operating a motor vehicle included ‘manipulating\n\nthe mechanical or electrical equipment of the vehicle . . .\n\nwhich alone, or in sequence, will activate the motive power of\n\nthe vehicle.’”   Enriquez, 283 Va. at 516, 722 S.E.2d at 255\n\n(quoting Williams, 216 Va. at 300, 217 S.E.2d at 896).      We\n\nclarified that a defendant who met this standard of\n\n“operat[ing]” under Code § 18.2-266 would be culpable, but\n\nthat it was not the only standard. 2   Rather, we said,\n\n“[a]lthough operating a motor vehicle may be proven by\n\nevidence of manipulation of the mechanical or electrical\n\nequipment,” i.e., the Williams standard, “it need not be\n\nproven in that manner. All that is necessary is evidence that\n\nthe person is in actual physical control of the vehicle within\n\nthe meaning of Code § 46.2-100.”    Id. (emphasis added).\n\n     Consequently, there are two standards that may be applied\n\nto determine whether a defendant “operate[d] any motor\n\nvehicle, engine or train” for the purposes of Code § 18.2-266:\n\nthe Williams standard (requiring manipulation of the\n\nmechanical or electrical equipment of the vehicle which will\n\nactivate its motive power) and the Enriquez standard\n\n(requiring actual physical control within the meaning of Code\n\n§ 46.2-100).   As we ourselves explained when we formulated it,\n\nthe Enriquez standard flows directly from the definition of\n\n“operator” provided by Code § 46.2-100:    we said, “the\n\n     2\n       The majority opinion does not reference the Williams\nstandard.\n\n                               18\n\fstatutory definition of ‘operator’ is controlling.”     Id.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     Thus, the Enriquez standard requires the element that the\n\nmotor vehicle be present on a public highway precisely and\n\nsolely because Code § 46.2-100 includes that element in its\n\ndefinition of “operator”:   the relevant statutory definition\n\nis “every person who . . . drives or is in actual physical\n\ncontrol of a motor vehicle on a highway.” 3    Code § 46.2-100\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     We (unanimously) created this nexus between Code §§ 18.2-\n\n266 and 46.2-100 in Enriquez, so the significance the majority\n\nattributes to its omission from the language enacted by the\n\nGeneral Assembly is misplaced. 4    Similarly, the fact that\n\n     3\n       Code § 46.2-100 defines “highway” for the purpose of\nthis definition in relevant part as:\n\n          every way or place open to the use of the\n          public for purposes of vehicular travel in\n          the Commonwealth . . . and, for law-\n          enforcement purposes (i) . . . all private\n          roads or private streets that have been\n          specifically designated “highways” by an\n          ordinance adopted by the governing body of\n          the county, city, or town in which such\n          private roads or streets are located and\n          (ii) . . . every way or place used for\n          purposes of vehicular travel on any\n          property owned, leased, or controlled by\n          the United States government and located\n          in the Commonwealth.\n     4\n       Moreover, the General Assembly has acquiesced in this\nnexus because it has not amended Code § 18.2-266 in either of\nits two sessions following Enriquez, and none of its five\nsubsequent amendments to Code § 46.2-100 have altered the\ndefinition of “operator.” E.g., Barson v. Commonwealth, 284\n\n                               19\n\ftrains and engines are not operated on public highways is\n\nirrelevant here because they are expressly excluded from the\n\nmeaning of “motor vehicle” as used in the definition of\n\n“operator” set out in Code § 46.2-100. 5   Consequently, the\n\nWilliams standard is adequate to cover them as they are not\n\noperated on public highways. 6\n\n     While the majority refers to two cases in which we have\n\naffirmed similar convictions for conduct on private property,\n\nneither is relevant here because they do not present facts\n\nsimilar to those on which we decided Enriquez.    In the first,\n\nValentine v. County of Brunswick, 202 Va. 696, 697, 119 S.E.2d\n\n486, 486 (1961), the defendant stipulated that he “operat[ed]\n\nhis motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicants.”\n\nThe other was Williams, in which the vehicle’s motor was\n\nrunning.   216 Va. at 298, 217 S.E.2d at 894.\n\n     Accordingly, I reject the majority’s characterization\n\nthat the Enriquez standard’s public highway element is dictum.\n\n\n\nVa. 67, 74, 726 S.E.2d 292, 296 (2012) (citing Tazewell County\nSchool Board v. Brown, 267 Va. 150, 163-64, 591 S.E.2d 671,\n678 (2004)); J. A. Jones Constr. Co. v. Martin, 198 Va. 370,\n378, 94 S.E.2d 202, 207-08 (1956); see also 2013 Acts chs.\n128, 400 and 783; 2014 Acts chs. 53 and 256.\n     5\n       “‘Motor vehicle’ means every vehicle as defined in this\nsection . . . .” Code § 46.2-100. “‘Vehicle’ means every\ndevice in, on or by which any person or property is or may be\ntransported or drawn on a highway, except devices moved by\nhuman power or used exclusively on stationary rails or\ntracks.” Id. (emphasis added).\n     6\n       Similarly, under the Williams standard, a person\n“operate[s]” a motor vehicle for the purpose of Code § 18.2-\n266 once the motor is running wherever the motor vehicle is.\n\n                                 20\n\fWithout that element, the Court has taken the final step\n\ntoward construing Code § 18.2-266 to punish a person for\n\nmerely occupying, rather than operating, a motor vehicle.     See\n\nNelson v. Commonwealth, 281 Va. 212, 219, 707 S.E.2d 815, 818\n\n(2011) (Koontz, J., dissenting) (quoting Williams, 216 Va. at\n\n303, 217 S.E.2d at 898 (Harrison, J., joined by Cochran and\n\nPoff, JJ., dissenting)).    If the public highway element had\n\nbeen omitted from our Enriquez opinion, I would have dissented\n\nthen.    Because the majority retroactively withdraws it here, I\n\nmust do so now.\n\n\nJUSTICE McCLANAHAN, with whom CHIEF JUSTICE KINSER joins,\ndissenting.\n\n        As far back as 1964, this Court determined in Gallagher\n\nv. Commonwealth, 205 Va. 666, 139 S.E.2d 37 (1964), that Code\n\n§ 18.1-54, now Code § 18.2-266, contains an \"on a highway\"\n\nelement based on the Court's interpretation of the word\n\n\"operate\" in the DUI statute.    And, this Court has\n\nconsistently adhered to this interpretation for exactly half a\n\ncentury, until today.\n\n        The majority opinion instead concludes there is now no\n\n\"on a highway\" element for a DUI conviction of an operator of\n\na motor vehicle under Code § 18.2-266, reaching this\n\nconclusion by declaring that the Court's recent articulation\n\n\n\n\n                                 21\n\fof such requirement in Enriquez v. Commonwealth, 283 Va. 511,\n\n722 S.E.2d 252 (2012), was mere dicta.\n\n     Jettisoning the half-century-old highway requirement in\n\nthe DUI statute also greatly undermines the \"actual physical\n\ncontrol\" part of the majority opinion analysis (Part II.B.1.).\n\nThe actual physical control and the highway elements of the\n\nDUI statute are derived from the very same statutory\n\ndefinition taken from the Motor Vehicle Code and incorporated\n\ninto the DUI statute.\n\n     In Gallagher, this Court interpreted the word \"operate\"\n\nin the DUI statute to include both the actual physical control\n\nelement and the highway element by incorporating into the\n\nstatute the definition of the word \"operator\" set forth in\n\nCode § 46.1-1(17) (now Code § 46.2-100) of the \"Motor Vehicle\n\nCode,\" to-wit: \"Every person who drives or is in actual\n\nphysical control of a motor vehicle upon a highway or who is\n\nexercising control over or steering a vehicle being towed by a\n\nmotor vehicle.\"     Gallagher, 205 Va. at 668, 139 S.E.2d at 39\n\n(emphasis added).    The definition of \"operator\" in the\n\nsuccessor statute, incorporated into the Court's analysis in\n\nEnriquez, is nearly identical: \"'[o]perator' or 'driver' means\n\nevery person who either (i) drives or is in actual physical\n\ncontrol of a motor vehicle on a highway or (ii) is exercising\n\ncontrol over or steering a vehicle being towed by a motor\n\n\n                                 22\n\fvehicle.\"   Code § 46.2-100 (emphasis added); Enriquez, 283 Va.\n\nat 516, 722 S.E.2d at 255.\n\n     Based on this definition, this Court has held in a series\n\nof cases over the last fifty years, beginning with Gallagher\n\nand extending to Enriquez, that the DUI statute proscribes a\n\nrange of acts by an intoxicated person determined to\n\nconstitute actual physical control of a motor vehicle without\n\nthe vehicle actually being put in motion. 1   See, e.g.,\n\nGallagher, 205 Va. at 667, 139 S.E.2d at 37 (defendant found\n\nsitting at steering wheel of car, which was stuck in a highway\n\nmedian ditch with the motor running, the car in gear, and a\n\nrear wheel spinning); Nicolls v. Commonwealth, 212 Va. 257,\n\n258, 184 S.E.2d 9, 10 (1971) (defendant found \"slumped over\"\n\nsteering wheel of car, parked on a highway with motor running,\n\nlights on, and heater in operation); Nelson v. Commonwealth,\n\n281 Va. 212, 214, 707 S.E.2d 815, 815-16 (2011) (defendant\n\nfound \"hunched over\" in driver's seat of car, parked on a cul-\n\nde-sac in a residential neighborhood, engine not running, but\n\nradio playing and ignition key in an \"on or accessory\n\n     1\n       Addressing the proscription of \"driv[ing] or\noperat[ing]\" a motor vehicle while under the influence of\nalcohol under the former DUI statute, Code § 18.1-54 (emphasis\nadded), the Court in Gallagher explained: \"It seems clear that\ndriving an automobile means putting in motion; but it seems\nequally clear that unless it was intended that § 18.1-54\nshould cover an activity in addition to driving, the word\n'operate' is useless baggage and serves no purpose.\"\nGallagher, 205 Va. at 668-69, 139 S.E.2d at 39.\n\n                               23\n\fposition\"); Enriquez, 283 Va. at 513-14, 722 S.E.2d 253-54\n\n(defendant seated behind steering wheel of car, parked on a\n\npublic street, engine not running, but key in ignition\n\nswitch).    Moreover, in each such case, where the Court\n\naffirmed the conviction under the DUI statute, the defendant\n\nwas in a motor vehicle located on a highway, as defined in\n\nCode § 46.2-100, not private property. 2      This, of course, is\n\nconsistent with the definition of \"operator\" incorporated into\n\nthe DUI statute from this same provision of the Motor Vehicle\n\nCode, Code § 46.2-100, the effect of which has been, once\n\nagain, to include both the actual physical control and highway\n\nrequirements as elements of a DUI conviction.\n\n            Accordingly, in Enriquez, a unanimous decision, we\n\nreaffirmed the nexus between Code §§ 18.2-266 and 46.2-100.\n\n\n     2\n         Code § 46.2-100 defines \"highway\" as:\n\n         [T]he entire width between the boundary lines of\n         every way or place open to the use of the public\n         for   purposes    of   vehicular     travel    in    the\n         Commonwealth, including the streets and alleys,\n         and, for law-enforcement purposes, (i) the entire\n         width between the boundary lines of all private\n         roads   or   private    streets    that     have    been\n         specifically designated \"highways\" by an ordinance\n         adopted by the governing body of the county, city,\n         or town in which such private roads or streets are\n         located and (ii) the entire width between the\n         boundary lines of every way or place used for\n         purposes of vehicular travel on any property owned,\n         leased,   or   controlled   by   the    United    States\n         government and located in the Commonwealth.\n\n\n\n                                  24\n\fWe thus did not state that only a portion of the definition of\n\n\"operator\" in Code § 46.2-100 controls construction of the\n\nphrase \"operate a motor vehicle\" in Code § 18.2-266.   Rather,\n\nwe held that the entire definition of \"operator\" in Code §\n\n46.2-100 governs in applying Code § 18.2-266.   It would be\n\ninexplicable to import the \"actual physical control\" element\n\nof Code § 46.2-100 into the DUI statute, while simultaneously\n\nrejecting the \"on a highway\" requirement imposed by that same\n\nCode section. 3   Id.\n\n     The majority opinion, however, without any reason or\n\nprinciple, tries to have it both ways by adhering to the\n\nactual physical control requirement while simultaneously\n\nrejecting (after 50 years) the highway requirement, when both\n\nrequirements were derived from the very same statutory\n\ndefinition, which this Court incorporated into the DUI statute\n\nin toto.\n\n     Furthermore, while it is indeed true that the legislature\n\ndid not include the \"on a highway\" requirement within the\n\nexpress language of Code § 18.2-266, that is equally true of\n\nthe \"actual physical control\" requirement that the majority\n\n\n     3\n       Because, here, we are reviewing a DUI case like Enriquez\nwhere the defendant's vehicle was not in motion, and we are,\nthus, called upon to construe the word \"operate\" as opposed to\nthe word \"drive\" under Code § 18.2-266, I express no opinion\nas to whether one may be guilty under the statute when driving\non private property while under the influence of alcohol.\n\n                              25\n\fapplies in this case.   Nonetheless, given the significant\n\nhistory of this Court's use of the definition of \"operator\" in\n\nthe Motor Vehicle Code to define \"operate\" in the DUI statute\n\nwithout any legislative response, the legislature has\n\nundoubtedly viewed this interpretation favorably. 4   See\n\nManchester Oaks Homeowners Ass'n v. Batt, 284 Va. 409, 428,\n\n732 S.E.2d 690, 702 (2012); Barson v. Commonwealth, 284 Va.\n\n67, 74, 726 S.E.2d 292, 296 (2012)); Tazewell County School\n\n     4\n       I also disagree with the majority's position that\nValentine v. County of Brunswick, 202 Va. 696, 119 S.E.2d 486\n(1961), and Williams v. City of Petersburg, 216 Va. 297, 217\nS.E.2d 893 (1975), support its conclusion that \"Code § 18.2-\n266 has no 'on a highway' requirement.\" The majority asserts\nthat the Court upheld DUI convictions in these two cases under\nlocal ordinances similar to Code § 18.2-266 where the vehicles\ninvolved were on private property. First, Valentine\nspecifically states that the \"ordinance [at issue] is not a\nhighway regulation and cannot be construed as part of the\ngeneral codification of the State motor vehicle laws.\"\nValentine, 202 Va. at 698, 119 S.E.2d at 487. Furthermore,\nValentine would have no precedential value to the extent it\ncould otherwise be read as supporting the majority's\nconclusion because it would have been impliedly overruled by\nGallagher. As to Williams, the Court made no determination\nthat the motor vehicle at issue there was located on private\nproperty. As the Court explained, \"[t]he evidence does not\nestablish whether the parking lot was publicly or privately\nowned, but because the city ordinance . . . proscribes the\nprohibited conduct 'in the city,' ownership of the parking lot\nis not relevant in this case.\" Williams, 216 Va. at 298 n.3,\n217 S.E.2d at 894 n.3.\n     In addition, unlike the majority, I have no objection, as\na matter of statutory construction, to this Court applying a\nmotor vehicle related definition from the Motor Vehicle Code\nto define the contours of the meaning of \"operate any motor\nvehicle\" under the DUI statute, even though that same\ndefinition cannot be applied to the operation of trains under\nthe DUI statute. Code § 18.2-266.\n\n\n\n                               26\n\fBoard v. Brown, 267 Va. 150, 163-64, 591 S.E.2d 671, 678\n\n(2004).   For these reasons, I discern no justifiable basis\n\nfor departing from this Court's precedent in deciding this\n\ncase, a conclusion dictated by fidelity to the doctrine of\n\nstare decisis. See Jamerson v. Coleman-Adams Constr., Inc.,\n\n280 Va. 490, 504, 699 S.E.2d 197, 204 (2010) (\"'[A]ny\n\ndeparture from [the doctrine of stare decisis] demands special\n\njustification.'\" (quoting Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. 203, 212\n\n(1984))); see also Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Dean, 233 Va.\n\n260, 265, 355 S.E.2d 579, 581 (1987); Kelly v. Trehy, 133 Va.\n\n160, 169, 112 S.E. 757, 760 (1922).   Accordingly, I would\n\nreverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the\n\ndefendant's conviction for violating Code § 18.2-266 and\n\nvacate the conviction.\n\n\n\n\n                              27\n\f",

LEMONS\n                                         October 31, 2014\nCOMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\n\n               FROM THE COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA\n\n      In this opinion we consider the definition of \"operate\"\n\nand whether such operation must be \"on a highway\" to sustain a\n\nconviction for driving under the influence pursuant to Code §\n\n18.2-266.\n\n                  I.   Facts and Proceedings Below\n\n      On January 20, 2011, Officer K.E. McBrearty of the\n\nCharlottesville Police Department responded to a noise\n\ncomplaint at 1001 Page Street in Charlottesville.      When\n\nOfficer McBrearty arrived at the scene, she observed Justin\n\nSarafin (\"Sarafin\") sitting in the driver's seat of his\n\nvehicle, which was parked in his private driveway.      Sarafin\n\nwas asleep – although the key was in the ignition and was\n\nturned backward to activate the vehicle's auxiliary power.\n\nMcBrearty knocked on the window and Sarafin awoke, turned off\n\nthe vehicle's auxiliary power, and exited the vehicle.\n\n      Once Sarafin was outside the vehicle, McBrearty smelled\n\nalcohol and noticed his eyes were bloodshot and glassy.       She\n\nquestioned Sarafin about his activities that evening, and he\n\nadmitted to consuming several beers at a local pub, picking up\n\fdinner at a different location, driving home, consuming more\n\nalcohol, and then returning to his vehicle to listen to the\n\nradio.   Sarafin stated he never intended to leave his driveway\n\nand, in fact, had fallen asleep around 2:30 a.m. while\n\nlistening to music.\n\n     Officer McBrearty administered several field sobriety\n\ntests.   Sarafin failed three out of five.   Officer McBrearty\n\nalso administered a preliminary breath test and, based on\n\nthose results, arrested Sarafin for operating a vehicle under\n\nthe influence of alcohol in violation of Code § 18.2-266.\n\n     Sarafin's first trial in the Circuit Court for the City\n\nof Charlottesville (\"circuit court\") resulted in a hung jury.\n\nPrior to his second trial, Sarafin filed a motion requesting a\n\ndetermination of the legal definition of \"operate\" and\n\n\"operation.\"   He then filed a pretrial \"motion to strike,\"\n\narguing he could not be convicted under Code § 18.2-266\n\nbecause he was on private property and, alternatively, there\n\nwas no evidence that he ever intended to activate the motive\n\npower of the vehicle.   The circuit court never addressed\n\nSarafin's pre-trial motions, and the case proceeded to trial.\n\n     Following the Commonwealth's case-in-chief, Sarafin moved\n\nto strike the evidence.   The circuit court took this motion\n\nunder advisement.   Sarafin presented several witnesses,\n\ntestified on his own behalf and renewed his motion to strike\n\n\n                                2\n\fwhich the circuit court again took under advisement.      He then\n\nproposed jury instructions I, J, K and L. 1   The circuit court\n\nrefused Sarafin's instructions and granted the Commonwealth's\n\nInstruction 6 over his objections.\n\n         The jury returned a guilty verdict and affixed\n\npunishment at a $500 fine.     In its conviction order dated\n\nNovember 7, 2012, the circuit court imposed the jury's verdict\n\nand, in addition, revoked Sarafin's operator's license for 12\n\nmonths. 2\n\n     Sarafin appealed his conviction to the Court of Appeals\n\nof Virginia, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to\n\nconvict him of violating Code § 18.2-266 because he was not\n\n\"operating\" the vehicle on a highway, and that the circuit\n\ncourt erred by refusing his jury instructions.

The Virginia Court of Appeals erred in construing\n     Va. Code § 18.2-266 to allow conviction for\n     \"operation\" on private property.\n\n  3.

In Nelson, we addressed a factual scenario remarkably\n\nsimilar to this case.     Nelson was asleep inside his vehicle\n\nwhich was parked in the cul-de-sac of a residential\n\nneighborhood.     281 Va. at 214, 707 S.E.2d at 816.   The\n\nignition was in the auxiliary position, and the radio was\n\nplaying.    Id.   Nelson argued that, based on these facts, he\n\nwas not operating his motor vehicle.

We disagreed, holding that:\n\n                 \"Operating\" means \"engaging the\n            machinery of the vehicle which alone, or\n            in sequence, will activate the motive\n            power of the vehicle.\" Manipulating the\n            electrical equipment was one step between\n            the \"off\" position and the point at which\n            the motive power would be activated.

This sequence of events\n            easily can occur where, as here, a drunk\n            is sitting behind the steering wheel of a\n            motor vehicle alone, with the key already\n            in the ignition. From a mechanical\n            standpoint, the vehicle is capable of\n            being immediately placed in motion to\n            become a menace to the public, and to its\n            drunken operator.\n\nBased on this reasoning, we held in Enriquez that:\n\n            [I]n discerning whether an intoxicated\n            person seated behind the steering wheel of\n\n\n                                 8\n\f          a motor vehicle . . . with the key\n          inserted into the ignition switch of the\n          vehicle is in actual physical control of\n          the vehicle, the position of the key in\n          the ignition switch is not determinative.\n          [W]hen an intoxicated person is seated\n          behind the steering wheel . . . and the\n          key is in the ignition switch, he is in\n          actual physical control of the vehicle\n          and, therefore, is guilty of operating the\n          vehicle while under the influence of\n          alcohol within the meaning of Code § 18.2-\n          266.\n\n283 Va. at 516-17, 722 S.E.2d at 255.\n\n     In this case, Sarafin was in actual physical control of\n\nhis vehicle.   He was seated behind the steering wheel, and the\n\nkey was in the ignition switch.       Accordingly, under our prior\n\ncase law, the evidence was sufficient to conclude that he was\n\nan operator of the vehicle.\n\n          2. \"On a Highway\"\n\n     The difference between this case and Nelson and Enriquez\n\nis the location of the vehicle.       In Nelson and Enriquez the\n\nvehicles were clearly on public highways.       Compare Nelson, 281\n\nVa. at 214, 707 S.E.2d at 816, with Enriquez, 283 Va. at 513,\n\n722 S.E.2d at 253.   In this case, Sarafin was on private\n\nproperty, namely, his own driveway.      The question remains\n\nwhether Code § 18.2-266 is violated when the operation of the\n\nvehicle occurs on a private way.\n\n     Code § 18.2-266 contains an explicit \"on a highway\"\n\nrequirement for the operation of mopeds.      However, the statute\n\n\n                                  9\n\fincludes no explicit language requiring an operator of a motor\n\nvehicle to be \"on a highway\" to sustain a conviction under\n\nCode § 18.2-266.    Sarafin invites us, based on his reading of\n\nthe definition of \"operator\" contained in Code § 46.2-100, 3 to\n\nimply an \"on a highway\" requirement for illegal operation of a\n\nmotor vehicle under the influence of alcohol.     We decline this\n\ninvitation for several reasons.\n\n         First, we agree with the Commonwealth that the plain\n\nlanguage of Code § 18.2-266 demonstrates there is no \"on a\n\nhighway\" requirement for the operation of motor vehicles.       The\n\nGeneral Assembly clearly knows how to impose an \"on a highway\"\n\nrequirement, but chose not to do so where the operator of a\n\nmotor vehicle is intoxicated.    In Code § 18.2-266, the General\n\nAssembly prohibits the operation of \"mopeds, [] on the public\n\nhighways of this Commonwealth\" while the operator is\n\nintoxicated.    (Emphasis added.)\n\n     Similarly, the General Assembly included a \"public\n\nhighway\" requirement in Virginia’s implied consent statute,\n\n\n     3\n         Code § 46.2-100 defines \"operator\" as:\n\n             every person who either (i) drives or is\n             in actual physical control of a motor\n             vehicle on a highway or (ii) is exercising\n             control over or steering a vehicle being\n             towed by a motor vehicle.\n\n(Emphasis added.)\n\n\n\n                                 10\n\fCode § 18.2-268.2.   Of course, the implied consent law is\n\nbased upon the premise that a user of public roads in the\n\nCommonwealth consents \"to have samples of his blood, breath,\n\nor both blood and breath taken for a chemical test to\n\ndetermine the alcohol, drug, or both alcohol and drug content\n\nof his blood, if he is arrested for violation of § 18.2-266,\n\n18.2-266.1, or subsection B of § 18.2-272 or of a similar\n\nordinance within three hours of the alleged offense.\"     Id.\n\n     \"[W]hen the General Assembly has used specific language\n\nin one instance, but omits that language or uses different\n\nlanguage when addressing a similar subject elsewhere in the\n\nCode, we must presume that the difference in the choice of\n\nlanguage was intentional.\"    See Zinone v.

Sarafin urges us to impose a public\n\nhighway requirement for the operation of motor vehicles, which\n\nwould require us to read \"engine[s] or train[s]\" out of the\n\nstatute.   If the General Assembly had intended to segregate\n\nthe operation of trains from the operation of motor vehicles,\n\nit certainly knows how to do so. 4    Because Code § 18.2-266\n\napplies equally to motor vehicles, engines and trains, and\n\ntrains only operate on private tracks, we would have to carve\n\nout an implicit \"private way\" exception for motor vehicles in\n\norder to grant Sarafin relief.    This would require us to usurp\n\nthe legislative function of the General Assembly, which we\n\nrefuse to do.   Instead we are bound by the plain meaning of\n\nthe statute, which compels our conclusion that Code § 18.2-266\n\n\n     4\n       The General Assembly has segregated the operation of\naircraft and watercraft while under the influence from the\noperation of motor vehicles while under the influence. Code §\n29.1-738 prohibits operation of watercraft while under the\ninfluence of alcohol and Code § 5.1-13 prohibits operation of\naircraft while under the influence of alcohol.\n\n                                 12\n\fcontains no \"private way\" exception for the operation of motor\n\nvehicles.\n\n     In its argument before this Court, the Commonwealth noted\n\nthat we have previously upheld convictions for driving under\n\nthe influence in two cases where the vehicles were on private\n\nproperty.

While those cases involved convictions under county\n\ndrunk driving ordinances, the ordinances at issue were similar\n\nto Code § 18.2-266.   Therefore, our reasoning in Valentine,\n\n202 Va. at 698-99, 119 S.E.2d 487-88, and Williams, 216 Va. at\n\n299, 217 S.E.2d at 895, supports our conclusion that Code §\n\n18.2-266 has no \"on a highway\" requirement.\n\n     Finally, Sarafin argues that this Court incorporated an\n\n\"on a highway\" requirement into the rule it announced in\n\nEnriquez, when we stated that:\n\n            When an intoxicated person is seated\n            behind the steering wheel of a motor\n            vehicle on a public highway and the key is\n            in the ignition switch, he is in actual\n            physical control of the vehicle and,\n            therefore, is guilty of operating the\n            vehicle while under the influence of\n            alcohol within the meaning of Code § 18.2-\n            266.\n\n283 Va. at 517, 722 S.E.2d at 255 (emphasis added).      However,\n\nthe issue in Enriquez was not whether the defendant was on a\n\n\n                                 13\n\fpublic highway, but rather, whether the defendant was in\n\nactual physical control of his vehicle.    Neither of the\n\nparties in Enriquez briefed or argued any contention that Code\n\n§ 18.2-266 contained an \"on a highway\" requirement.    Because\n\nthe reference to \"on a highway\" was not essential to the\n\nCourt's judgment, it is unbinding dicta.    See Harmon v. Peery,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">578</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 702 (1926) (\"Obiter dicta are\n\nsuch opinions uttered by the way, not upon the point or\n\nquestion pending, . . . as if turning aside . . . from the\n\nmain topic of the case to collateral subjects.\" (citations and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted)).\n\n  C. Jury Instructions\n\n      Sarafin proposed four jury instructions which are now\n\nbefore us on appeal.   Proposed Instruction I reads:\n\n          Operating means driving a motor vehicle\n          from one place to another; starting the\n          engine; or engaging the machinery of a\n          vehicle which alone or in sequence will\n          activate the motive power of the vehicle\n          without actually putting the vehicle in\n          motion; or manipulating the electrical or\n          mechanical equipment which alone or in\n          sequence will activate the motive power of\n          the vehicle without actually putting the\n          vehicle in motion. Any individual who is\n          in actual physical control of a vehicle on\n          a public roadway is an operator. When the\n          engine is not running in a private\n          driveway, the Commonwealth must prove by\n          direct or circumstantial evidence that the\n          defendant specifically intended to\n          activate the motive power of the vehicle\n\n\n\n                               14\n\f             to enter a public roadway while under the\n             influence of alcohol.\n\nProposed Instruction K defines an \"operator\" as \"every person\n\nwho drives or is in actual physical control of a motor vehicle\n\non a highway.\"    Proposed Instructions L and J provide the\n\ndefendant's definition of \"highway\" and \"private road or\n\ndriveway.\"    The circuit court refused each of Sarafin's\n\nproposed instructions, giving Instruction 6 instead:\n\n             Operating a motor vehicle means driving\n             the vehicle from one place to another or\n             starting the engine or manipulating the\n             electrical or mechanical equipment of the\n             vehicle without actually putting the\n             vehicle in motion or engaging the\n             machinery of the vehicle which alone or in\n             sequence will activate the motive power of\n             the vehicle.\n\n     It was not improper for the circuit court to grant\n\nInstruction 6 and refuse Instructions I, J, K and L.\n\nInstruction 6 clearly states the law and covers the issues\n\nfairly raised by the evidence.    In contrast, Instructions I,\n\nJ, K and L either misstate the law or are irrelevant based on\n\nthe facts of this case.\n\n     Given our holding that Code § 18.2-266 contains no \"on a\n\nhighway\" requirement, the inclusion of such a requirement in\n\nthe definition of operating a motor vehicle as set forth in\n\nproposed Instruction I is incorrect.    Similarly, proposed\n\nInstructions J and L are irrelevant, because the jury did not\n\n\n\n                                 15\n\fneed definitions of \"highway\" and \"private road or driveway\"\n\nto convict the defendant of violating Code § 18.2-266.\n\nFinally, proposed Instruction K was properly refused, even\n\nthough it correctly recited the definition of operator\n\ncontained in Code § 46.2-100, because Code § 18.2-266 has no\n\n\"on a highway\" requirement.\n\n                         III.

In\n\ndeciding that Stevenson did not control, we explicitly\n\n“turn[ed] for assistance to Code § 46.2-100.”     We observed\n\nthat “Code § 46.2-100 provides that ‘operator’ or ‘driver’\n\nmeans every person who either (i) drives or is in actual\n\nphysical control of a motor vehicle on a highway or (ii) is\n\nexercising control over or steering a vehicle being towed by a\n\nmotor vehicle.”     Enriquez, 283 Va. at 515-16, 722 S.E.2d at\n\n255 (internal quotation marks, alterations, and emphasis\n\nomitted).\n\n        We also observed that in an earlier decision, Williams v.\n\nCity of Petersburg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1284159\"><a href=\"/opinion/1284159/williams-v-petersburg-commonwealth/\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">217</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">893</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975), “we\n\n\n\n\n                                 17\n\fstated that operating a motor vehicle included ‘manipulating\n\nthe mechanical or electrical equipment of the vehicle . . .\n\nwhich alone, or in sequence, will activate the motive power of\n\nthe vehicle.’”   Enriquez, 283 Va. at 516, 722 S.E.2d at 255\n\n(quoting Williams, 216 Va. at 300, 217 S.E.2d at 896).      We\n\nclarified that a defendant who met this standard of\n\n“operat[ing]” under Code § 18.2-266 would be culpable, but\n\nthat it was not the only standard. 2   Rather, we said,\n\n“[a]lthough operating a motor vehicle may be proven by\n\nevidence of manipulation of the mechanical or electrical\n\nequipment,” i.e., the Williams standard, “it need not be\n\nproven in that manner. All that is necessary is evidence that\n\nthe person is in actual physical control of the vehicle within\n\nthe meaning of Code § 46.2-100.”    Id. (emphasis added).\n\n     Consequently, there are two standards that may be applied\n\nto determine whether a defendant “operate[d] any motor\n\nvehicle, engine or train” for the purposes of Code § 18.2-266:\n\nthe Williams standard (requiring manipulation of the\n\nmechanical or electrical equipment of the vehicle which will\n\nactivate its motive power) and the Enriquez standard\n\n(requiring actual physical control within the meaning of Code\n\n§ 46.2-100).   As we ourselves explained when we formulated it,\n\nthe Enriquez standard flows directly from the definition of\n\n“operator” provided by Code § 46.2-100:    we said, “the\n\n     2\n       The majority opinion does not reference the Williams\nstandard.\n\n                               18\n\fstatutory definition of ‘operator’ is controlling.”     Id.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     Thus, the Enriquez standard requires the element that the\n\nmotor vehicle be present on a public highway precisely and\n\nsolely because Code § 46.2-100 includes that element in its\n\ndefinition of “operator”:   the relevant statutory definition\n\nis “every person who . . . drives or is in actual physical\n\ncontrol of a motor vehicle on a highway.” 3    Code § 46.2-100\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n     We (unanimously) created this nexus between Code §§ 18.2-\n\n266 and 46.2-100 in Enriquez, so the significance the majority\n\nattributes to its omission from the language enacted by the\n\nGeneral Assembly is misplaced. 4    Similarly, the fact that\n\n     3\n       Code § 46.2-100 defines “highway” for the purpose of\nthis definition in relevant part as:\n\n          every way or place open to the use of the\n          public for purposes of vehicular travel in\n          the Commonwealth . . . and, for law-\n          enforcement purposes (i) . . . all private\n          roads or private streets that have been\n          specifically designated “highways” by an\n          ordinance adopted by the governing body of\n          the county, city, or town in which such\n          private roads or streets are located and\n          (ii) . . . every way or place used for\n          purposes of vehicular travel on any\n          property owned, leased, or controlled by\n          the United States government and located\n          in the Commonwealth.\n     4\n       Moreover, the General Assembly has acquiesced in this\nnexus because it has not amended Code § 18.2-266 in either of\nits two sessions following Enriquez, and none of its five\nsubsequent amendments to Code § 46.2-100 have altered the\ndefinition of “operator.” E.g., Barson v. Commonwealth, 284\n\n                               19\n\ftrains and engines are not operated on public highways is\n\nirrelevant here because they are expressly excluded from the\n\nmeaning of “motor vehicle” as used in the definition of\n\n“operator” set out in Code § 46.2-100. 5   Consequently, the\n\nWilliams standard is adequate to cover them as they are not\n\noperated on public highways. 6\n\n     While the majority refers to two cases in which we have\n\naffirmed similar convictions for conduct on private property,\n\nneither is relevant here because they do not present facts\n\nsimilar to those on which we decided Enriquez.

And, this Court has\n\nconsistently adhered to this interpretation for exactly half a\n\ncentury, until today.\n\n        The majority opinion instead concludes there is now no\n\n\"on a highway\" element for a DUI conviction of an operator of\n\na motor vehicle under Code § 18.2-266, reaching this\n\nconclusion by declaring that the Court's recent articulation\n\n\n\n\n                                 21\n\fof such requirement in Enriquez v.

The definition of \"operator\" in the\n\nsuccessor statute, incorporated into the Court's analysis in\n\nEnriquez, is nearly identical: \"'[o]perator' or 'driver' means\n\nevery person who either (i) drives or is in actual physical\n\ncontrol of a motor vehicle on a highway or (ii) is exercising\n\ncontrol over or steering a vehicle being towed by a motor\n\n\n                                 22\n\fvehicle.\"   Code § 46.2-100 (emphasis added); Enriquez, 283 Va.\n\nat 516, 722 S.E.2d at 255.\n\n     Based on this definition, this Court has held in a series\n\nof cases over the last fifty years, beginning with Gallagher\n\nand extending to Enriquez, that the DUI statute proscribes a\n\nrange of acts by an intoxicated person determined to\n\nconstitute actual physical control of a motor vehicle without\n\nthe vehicle actually being put in motion. 1   See, e.g.,\n\nGallagher, 205 Va. at 667, 139 S.E.2d at 37 (defendant found\n\nsitting at steering wheel of car, which was stuck in a highway\n\nmedian ditch with the motor running, the car in gear, and a\n\nrear wheel spinning); Nicolls v.

Moreover, in each such case, where the Court\n\naffirmed the conviction under the DUI statute, the defendant\n\nwas in a motor vehicle located on a highway, as defined in\n\nCode § 46.2-100, not private property. 2      This, of course, is\n\nconsistent with the definition of \"operator\" incorporated into\n\nthe DUI statute from this same provision of the Motor Vehicle\n\nCode, Code § 46.2-100, the effect of which has been, once\n\nagain, to include both the actual physical control and highway\n\nrequirements as elements of a DUI conviction.\n\n            Accordingly, in Enriquez, a unanimous decision, we\n\nreaffirmed the nexus between Code §§ 18.2-266 and 46.2-100.\n\n\n     2\n         Code § 46.2-100 defines \"highway\" as:\n\n         [T]he entire width between the boundary lines of\n         every way or place open to the use of the public\n         for   purposes    of   vehicular     travel    in    the\n         Commonwealth, including the streets and alleys,\n         and, for law-enforcement purposes, (i) the entire\n         width between the boundary lines of all private\n         roads   or   private    streets    that     have    been\n         specifically designated \"highways\" by an ordinance\n         adopted by the governing body of the county, city,\n         or town in which such private roads or streets are\n         located and (ii) the entire width between the\n         boundary lines of every way or place used for\n         purposes of vehicular travel on any property owned,\n         leased,   or   controlled   by   the    United    States\n         government and located in the Commonwealth.\n\n\n\n                                  24\n\fWe thus did not state that only a portion of the definition of\n\n\"operator\" in Code § 46.2-100 controls construction of the\n\nphrase \"operate a motor vehicle\" in Code § 18.2-266.   Rather,\n\nwe held that the entire definition of \"operator\" in Code §\n\n46.2-100 governs in applying Code § 18.2-266.   It would be\n\ninexplicable to import the \"actual physical control\" element\n\nof Code § 46.2-100 into the DUI statute, while simultaneously\n\nrejecting the \"on a highway\" requirement imposed by that same\n\nCode section. 3   Id.\n\n     The majority opinion, however, without any reason or\n\nprinciple, tries to have it both ways by adhering to the\n\nactual physical control requirement while simultaneously\n\nrejecting (after 50 years) the highway requirement, when both\n\nrequirements were derived from the very same statutory\n\ndefinition, which this Court incorporated into the DUI statute\n\nin toto.\n\n     Furthermore, while it is indeed true that the legislature\n\ndid not include the \"on a highway\" requirement within the\n\nexpress language of Code § 18.2-266, that is equally true of\n\nthe \"actual physical control\" requirement that the majority\n\n\n     3\n       Because, here, we are reviewing a DUI case like Enriquez\nwhere the defendant's vehicle was not in motion, and we are,\nthus, called upon to construe the word \"operate\" as opposed to\nthe word \"drive\" under Code § 18.2-266, I express no opinion\nas to whether one may be guilty under the statute when driving\non private property while under the influence of alcohol.\n\n                              25\n\fapplies in this case.   Nonetheless, given the significant\n\nhistory of this Court's use of the definition of \"operator\" in\n\nthe Motor Vehicle Code to define \"operate\" in the DUI statute\n\nwithout any legislative response, the legislature has\n\nundoubtedly viewed this interpretation favorably. 4   See\n\nManchester Oaks Homeowners Ass'n v.
