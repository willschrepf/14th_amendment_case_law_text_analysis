Chicago’s Fire Department\nhas five ranks: firefighter, engineer, lieutenant, captain,\nand battalion chief. Promotions depend on competitive\nexaminations. Chicago developed the 1986 exam for lieu-\ntenant (a position open to firefighters and engineers) with\ncare to ensure that it was both non-discriminatory and a\nvalid test of skills. Yet although 29% of those who took the\nexam were either black or Hispanic, only 12% of those who\nreceived the highest 300 scores were in these groups. The\nDepartment concluded that this disparate impact could be\n\f2                          Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\njustified, under the EEOC’s Uniform Guidelines on Em-\nployee Selection Procedures, 29 C.F.R. §1607.4, only if the\nexam were valid for rank-order use—that is, if someone who\nscores higher on the test is bound to perform better than the\nperson next in line. According to the Department’s expert,\nthis examination had a standard error of measurement of 3.5,\nwhich is to say that a person who scored 80 and took a similar\ntest again could score as high as 83.5 or as low as 76.5\nwithout implying that his skills and probability of success\nin the higher position had changed. Convinced that it could\nnot make promotions from the 1986 list in rank- order\nfashion, the Department established what it called “stan-\ndardized” lists and what most people would call racially\nsegregated lists: it drew up one list for whites and another\nfor blacks and Hispanics, and then made 29% of all promo-\ntions from the minorities-only list. The Department used\nthese lists until 1991, promoting a total of 209 lieutenants\nfrom the 1986 exam.\n  This process meant that the promotion of some white can-\ndidates was delayed, and others were not promoted even\nthough minority candidates with lower scores became lieu-\ntenants. Some of the disappointed applicants filed suit under\n42 U.S.C. §1983 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nThe Department acknowledged that its approach can be\nsustained only if a compelling interest supports its use of\nrace and ethnicity. See, e.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\nPeña, 515 U.S. 200 (1995). It did not argue that either past\ndiscrimination or a quest for diversity supports its approach.\nCf. Grutter v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 306 (2003); Petit v. Chicago,\n352 F.3d 1111 (7th Cir. 2003). Chicago instead maintains\nthat it had a compelling need to comply with federal regu-\nlations that frown on using tests to make promotions in\nstrict sequence. The district court bifurcated liability from\ndamages and conducted a trial before an advisory jury,\nwhich concluded that the Department violated both §1983\nand Title VII. In open court the district judge agreed with\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                                 3\n\nthis conclusion. Two later jury trials (limited to 19 of the\nplaintiffs) led to substantial awards of compensatory dam-\nages plus equitable relief such as front pay. Biondo v. Chicago,\n2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3463 (N.D. Ill. Feb. 28, 2002); Cloud v.\nChicago, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9817 (N.D. Ill. May 30, 2002).\n  According to the Department, the jury’s (and thus the\njudge’s) finding that the 1986 exam was valid is clearly er-\nroneous, see Pullman-Standard v. Swint, 456 U.S. 273 (1982),\neven though the trier of fact credited plaintiffs’ statistical ex-\npert, who supported the exam’s validity. Bryant v. Chicago,\n200 F.3d 1092 (7th Cir. 2000), sustains rank-order use of a\nsimilar exam, making it hard to see how the outcome of this\ntrial could be deemed clearly erroneous. The Department\nacknowledges that the evidence taken in the light most\nfavorable to the verdict shows the exam’s overall validity as a\ntest of skills but maintains that it does not demonstrate the\npropriety of making promotions in sequence, given the stand-\nard error of measurement. Even if the plaintiffs’ expert un-\ndermined the conclusion that the standard error of mea-\nsurement is 3.5, the Department insists, the record does not\nshow that the standard error is zero, and without such a\nfinding (which would be impossible, as no exam predicts\nperfectly) the exam could not have been used to make pro-\nmotions in rank-order sequence, given the disparate impact\nthat would have ensued.\n  Let us suppose that the City has the better of the sta-\ntistical argument on this record (perhaps the one compiled\nin Bryant did more to show the exam’s validity). We shall\nsuppose further that the EEOC’s regulations tell employers\nnot to hire or promote in strict sequence when that would\ncause minority groups to succeed less than 80% as often as\nwhites. But see Paul Meier, Jerome Sacks & Sandy L.\nZabell, What Happened in Hazelwood: Statistics, Employment\nDiscrimination, and the 80% Rule, 1984 Am. Bar Foundation\nResearch J. 139, 158-70. Still, the premise of the City’s ar-\ngument is that regulations supply a compelling governmental\n\f4                          Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\ninterest in making decisions based on race. How can that\nbe? Then Congress or any federal agency could direct em-\nployers to adopt racial quotas, and the direction would be\nself-justifying: the need to comply with the law (or regulation)\nwould be the compelling interest. Such a circular process\nwould drain the equal protection clause of meaning. Deci-\nsions such as Adarand Constructors show that compliance\nwith federal laws cannot automatically be a compelling\ninterest; Adarand Constructors held a federal statute uncon-\nstitutional precisely because it required public officials to\nmake use of race, and the statute was not itself supported\nby a compelling governmental interest. Chicago does not\ncontend that 29 C.F.R. §1607.4 carries out any compelling\ngovernmental interest, and given the holding of Washington v.\nDavis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976), that disparate impact in hiring\nor promotion by a public employer does not violate the equal\nprotection clause, it is hard to see how such an argument\ncould be constructed. If avoiding disparate impact were a\ncompelling governmental interest, then racial quotas in\npublic employment would be the norm, and as a practical\nmatter Washington v. Davis would be undone. Congress did\nnot attempt this; to the contrary, it provided in 42 U.S.C.\n§2000e-2(j) that an employer’s desire to mitigate or avoid\ndisparate impact does not justify preferential treatment for\nany group.\n   The Civil Rights Act of 1991 explicitly forbids the dual-\nlist response to disparate impact. 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(l).\n(That section also forbids differential validation, under which\nscores predicting an equal probability of success on the job\nlead to an equal probability of favorable decision even though\nthis may mean that minorities are promoted with scores\nlower than those of white applicants. See Albemarle Paper\nCo. v. Moody, 422 U.S. 405 (1975) (approving use of differ-\nential validation under statutes then in force). The City did\nnot attempt differential validation before resorting to\nstandardization.) The 1991 Act does not apply retroactively,\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                            5\n\nsee Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244 (1994),\nbut new §2000e-2(l) and old §2002-2(j) jointly reveal that\nstandardization cannot be an indispensable response to dis-\nparate impact. Public employers have other options. One\nwill suffice here. Instead of making rank-order promotions,\nChicago could have created bands reflecting the standard\nerror of measurement. For example, the Department could\nhave treated all scores in the range 96-100 as functionally\nidentical and made promotions by lot from that band; when\nall test-takers with those scores had been promoted, the\nDepartment could have pooled scores in the range 91-95\nand promoted randomly from that group, and so on. That\nprocedure would have respected the limits of the exam’s ac-\ncuracy while avoiding any resort to race or ethnicity. Given\noptions of this kind, the City’s two-list procedure cannot be\nthought compelled. Indeed, it is hard to credit the\nDepartment’s assertion that it viewed rank-order promotions\nas unsupportable when that is how it actually used the exam.\nAfter creating racially segregated lists, the Department pro-\nmoted in rank-order sequence from each list!\n  No more need be said about the merits. Remedies are more\nproblematic. Each of the two juries was asked six questions:\nwhat was the likelihood that, but for the discrimination,\neach firefighter would have been promoted to captain and\nthen battalion chief (and when each position would have been\nachieved); what damages represented loss of pay until the\ntrial; and what damages were appropriate for emotional\ndistress. The district judge then ordered the Department to\nmake retroactive the positions of those plaintiffs who had\nachieved one or more promotions since 1986, and he granted\nfront pay to those who (the jury found) would have been\npromoted further. The judge also ordered the City to pay\nprejudgment interest.

Peter Biondo received $35,125 in\nprejudgment interest on the back-pay amount of $112,000.\nThe court did not add interest to the damages for emotional\ndistress. So money damages came to $272,125. Biondo had\nbeen promoted (after his success on a later exam) to lieu-\ntenant on February 16, 1998; the court ordered the Depart-\nment to make this promotion retroactive to November 1,\n1990, which provided Biondo with additional seniority and\npension benefits. (This date was selected to leave an\nadequate gap before the promotion to captain, which the\njury found would have occurred on August 16, 1993, but for\nthe delay in Biondo’s promotion to lieutenant.) Finally, the\ncourt ordered the Department to pay Biondo at the rate of\na battalion chief for the period between March 1, 2002, and\nMarch 1, 2014, unless Biondo left the Department’s employ\nearlier.\n  Some of these findings are hard to quarrel with. For ex-\nample, Michael Timothy, whose promotion to lieutenant\nwas delayed, made it to both captain (from the 1992 exam\nfor that position) and battalion chief (from the 1994 exam);\nhis damages reflect just a short delay in promotion and a bit\nof aggravation. Gacki and Wirtz became captains after the\n1999 examination. But other findings are more problematic:\nthe juries found that most of the plaintiffs were sure to be\npromoted even though, except for Gacki, Timothy, and Wirtz,\nthey have failed to achieve advancement through the com-\npetitive process since becoming lieutenants (a position 15 of\nthem managed to achieve, eventually, on their own: 5 by\ndelayed promotion from the 1986 list, and 10 by promotion\nfrom later examinations). The finding that Gacki had a “0%”\nchance of becoming a captain is puzzling, as he actually\nachieved that position in 1999. (This finding was the work\nof the second jury; the first jury concluded that Timothy and\nWirtz, the others who already were captains, had a 100%\nprobability of promotion to that position. Neither jury be-\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                                 9\n\nhaved inconsistently.) Then there is the inexplicable verdict\nconcerning Michael Oliver: 90% likely to become a captain\nand certain to become a battalion chief, even though the\nlatter promotion is impossible without the former.\n   The City does not dispute the district court’s central ap-\nproach: asking the jury to determine the probability that\nbeing held back in 1986 cost the plaintiffs later chances for\nadvancement. This “loss of a chance” method is the best\nway to handle probabilistic injuries. See Bishop v. Gainer,\n272 F.3d 1009, 1015-16 (7th Cir. 2001); Doll v. Brown, 75\nF.3d 1200, 1205-07 (1996); Griffin v. Michigan Department\nof Corrections, 5 F.3d 186, 189 (6th Cir. 1993). If four people\ncompeting for one position lost an equal chance to get it,\nthen each should receive 25% of the benefits available. Or\nif a person would have had a 25% chance of promotion from\nlieutenant to captain, then preventing that person from be-\ncoming a lieutenant should lead to a remedy equal to 100%\nof the benefits of being a lieutenant plus 25% of the incre-\nmental benefits of being a captain. (This assumes that all\nplaintiffs are risk neutral; in most cases, however, they would\npay to reduce risk, so the proper award should be something\nless than the actuarial value—for promotion is uncertain.\nNeither side makes anything of this, however, so for sim-\nplicity we assume risk neutrality.)\n   Unfortunately, the juries’ estimates do not reflect a plausible\nappreciation of the lost chances: the juries concluded that\nevery one of the plaintiffs who had not yet achieved a cap-\ntaincy was certain to have done so—even though four plaintiffs\nhad been unsuccessful in post-1986 attempts to become lieu-\ntenants, and 9 of the 15 plaintiffs who reached lieutenant\nhad tried and failed to achieve higher ranks. (Timothy, Gacki,\nand Wirtz became captains after succeeding on exams;\nCorcoran, Joyce, and McElroy were promoted independently\nof the testing process, for reasons that the parties do not\nrelate.) Even in a world of grade inflation, where teachers\nliving far from Lake Wobegon think nothing of rating all\n\f10                         Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\nstudents as “above average,” it is hard to swallow a con-\nclusion that all candidates held back from promotion to\nlieutenant in 1986 were sure to become captains. Remember\nthat 209 firefighters were promoted to lieutenant from the\n1986 exam. Plaintiffs ranked well below many of those 209,\nthough high enough to have made the cut but for the\npreference given to minority firefighters. They are not the\npick of the class, the people who regularly finish first on every\nexam. Of the 528 lieutenants who took the 1992 exam for cap-\ntain (the first that these plaintiffs could have taken had\nthey been promoted from the 1986 exam), only 136 (or 26%)\nwere promoted. That one-in-four chance was the outcome\nfor persons who, on average, had done better on the lieuten-\nants’ exam than plaintiffs (for even had they been promoted,\nthey would have been in the bottom half of the 1986\nlieutenant class). And of the 137 captains who took the 1994\nexam for battalion chief, only 54 (or 41%) were pro-\nmoted—though these juries concluded that 8 of our 19\nplaintiffs had a 100% chance of promotion to battalion chief,\nand that another four had chances exceeding 41%.\n   One must take into account the possibility of sitting for\nmultiple exams: 132 lieutenants who were not promoted from\nthe 1992 test for captain applied again in 1998; of these, 29\n(or 22%) have been promoted. This suggests that of those\nlieutenants who take the captain’s exam at all, about 33%\nare promoted either from the first exam or a second try (if\nthey persist through a second exam, and one could extrapo-\nlate that around 40% of aspiring lieutenants could achieve\npromotion by taking the exam) three or more times. Still,\nthis is a long way from the 100% success rate that the juries\ncalculated for our 19 firefighters.\n  The verdicts imply that, if we were to look at the most\ncomparable firefighters—say, the 25 who ranked immedi-\nately above the plaintiffs on the 1986 exam and were pro-\nmoted to lieutenant as a result—we would find that all\nbecame captains no later than November 2000, and that\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                            11\n\nmost would be battalion chiefs today. The record does not\nreveal how these firefighters actually fared, and plaintiffs,\nwho bear the burden of persuasion, suffer from the omis-\nsion. The best evidence of the chance they actually lost is\nmissing. Nonetheless the verdicts might be sustainable if\nevidence demonstrated that, despite finishing out of the top\nhundred who took the 1986 exam, these plaintiffs must\nhave had a bad day and were really more likely to succeed\nthan the average exam-taker. That only 3 of the 19 have be-\ncome captains by examination (some after two chances, in\n1992 and 1998), suggests otherwise.\n  The record does not contain any evidence comparing these\nplaintiffs with other firefighters. Each of the 19 elected to\npresent a non-comparative case. Each testified that he loves\nthe work, strives to succeed, and studies hard for tests.\nEach presented evidence about his education and experience.\nMost presented family members and friends who testified\nto the long hours the plaintiff studied, the plaintiff’s com-\nmitment to the fire department, and so on. This evidence\ndoes not permit quantification of the chance lost by being\nheld back in 1986. Firefighters do not strive to meet an\nabsolute standard; they compete against their colleagues.\nThe other firefighters taking tests for higher positions also\nlove the department and prepare thoroughly. Only a dem-\nonstration that these plaintiffs are much better at tests than\ntheir rivals would support a verdict that the chance lost was\n100% or anything like it. Yet the plaintiffs bypassed their\nopportunity to introduce comparative evidence; and what\nevidence the record does contain—that these plaintiffs did\nnot excel on the 1986 exam; that they have not done well on\ntests for promotion since then; that only 33% of those who\nwere actually promoted to lieutenant by 1992, and pursued\nfurther promotion, made captain by 2002—undermines the\nverdicts. Even giving all of the evidence and inferences a\nreading favorable to plaintiffs, no reasonable juror could find\nthat all were destined to become captains. The verdicts there-\nfore cannot stand.\n\f12                          Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\n  Because none of the plaintiffs presented comparative evi-\ndence, the view most favorable to the plaintiffs as a group\nis that each would have done as well as the average lieu-\ntenant on the 1992 and 1998 exams. This means that, but for\nthe discrimination after the 1986 exam, 33% of the plaintiffs\n(or 6 of them) would have become captains by 2002 via ex-\namination. Three actually reached that level (and Timothy\nwent on to battalion chief), and three more achieved a cap-\ntaincy in some other way, so the remaining 16 lost only 3\ncaptaincies (or none, depending on how the non-competitive\npromotions are handled). Perhaps it is inappropriate to hold\nthe promotions of some plaintiffs against the rest in this\nway; it depends on whether we view these 19 as all of the\nvictims of discrimination (in which event at most 3 pro-\nmotions were lost) or as a random sample of the victims (in\nwhich event the lost-chance figure should be applied person by\nperson). The City takes the latter view, which is the more\nfavorable to the 13 plaintiffs who have stopped short of\ncaptain. (These 19 are not the only victims; other fire-\nfighters have claims yet to be tried; their disposition has\nbeen postponed to await our decision concerning these fire-\nfighters.) Accordingly, on remand each of the 13 is entitled\nto all of the benefits he would have received from a timely\npromotion to lieutenant, plus 33% of the benefits available\nfrom promotion to captain. And as about 41% of captains\neventually become battalion chiefs, the award for the 10\nplaintiffs who the jury thought likely to achieve that goal\ncould include about 14% of the benefits of that position (a\n33% chance of becoming a captain times the 41% chance that\na captain eventually will advance again).\n   Other remedies depend on the unsupported view that all\n19 plaintiffs were sure to become captains. Promotion to bat-\ntalion chief is possible only for captains, so the high probabili-\nties assigned to battalion chief for 11 plaintiffs are untena-\nble. The back pay awards depend on the probabilities (and\ndates) of these promotions; they too must be vacated. The\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                            13\n\nawards of compensatory damages for emotional distress\nalso are linked to the estimates of promotional likelihoods.\nAs the district judge remarked, this is why the awards to\nTimothy and Wirtz are relatively low: they suffered an\ninsult and aggravation but were not held back significantly\nin their careers. The awards appear to be dominated by the\njurors’ belief that persons who should have been captains, and\nwere stuck for a decade in the rank-and-file, suffered acute\nmental distress. Recognition that these plaintiffs were not\ndestined for the captaincy doubtless would influence the\nevaluation of their degree of (justifiable) distress. Finally,\nthe district judge’s equitable orders (retroactive seniority\nand pensions, front pay) assume the validity of the jurors’\nconclusions. A change in the promotion probabilities and\ndates requires everything else to be redone. Consequently\nwe vacate the entire judgment and remand for a new trial\nlimited to the calculation of back pay and damages for emo-\ntional distress on the assumption that each of the plaintiffs\nwho has yet to reach captain lost a 33% chance of promotion\nby 2002.\n   The district judge should see to it that any awards of com-\npensatory damages for mental distress are proportional to\nthe wrongs—and to the caps added by the 1991 Act. They do\nnot apply directly to injury before 1991, but much of the\nharm post-dates that legislation. No matter how serious the\noffense, compensatory damages for discrimination covered by\nthe 1991 Act cannot exceed $300,000. See 42 U.S.C.\n§1981a(b)(3). The awards in this case reached $232,000 (to\nTervanis), yet the emotional distress that these firefighters\nendured must be considerably less than that suffered by\nother victims of discrimination—some of whom lose their\nlivelihood by racially motivated discharge, others of whom\nendure sexually or racially based harassment or assaults\nthat can make a job a source of trauma and misery. Some-\ntimes discrimination produces mental breakdowns and long-\nterm disability. See Wilson v. Chrysler Corp., 172 F.3d 500\n\f14                        Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\n(7th Cir. 1999); Williamson v. Handy Button Machine Co.,\n817 F.2d 1290 (7th Cir. 1987). None of our plaintiffs suf-\nfered such substantial injuries. If awards even in these ex-\ntreme cases are capped at $300,000, the award appropriate\nto discrimination that simply retards the rate of promotion\nmust be considerably less in order to maintain proportional-\nity. Compare Hennessy v. Penril Datacomm Networks, Inc., 68\nF.3d 1344 (7th Cir. 1995), with Fine v. Ryan International\nAirlines, 305 F.3d 746 (7th Cir. 2002).\n  This leaves front pay. The district court added 12 years’\nworth, at the highest position the jury projected for each\nplaintiff (provided that the plaintiff was still employed at\nthe Department in 2002). The judge explained that this\nunusually long period was justified by the infrequency of\npromotional opportunities and the fact that the plaintiffs\nwere too distracted by the litigation (and the wrong done\nthem in 1986) to be effective exam-takers earlier. Front pay\nmust be reduced to match the opportunity lost—so a person\nwho lost a 33% chance to become a captain by 2002 is\nlimited to front pay at 33% of that position’s salary until it\nis achieved by examination. (To be precise, such a person\ngets the salary and benefits of the position actually held,\nplus 33% of the difference in salary and benefits between\nthat position and captain.)\n   As for duration: we agree with the City that 12 years\nexceeds the scope of a district court’s equitable discretion.\nThe goal of front pay is to put the victim in the financial\nposition he should have enjoyed, when circumstances make\nit inappropriate to direct the employer to promote (or hire)\nhim. See, e.g., Pollard v. E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.,\n532 U.S. 843, 846 (2001); Williams v. Pharmacia, 137 F.3d\n944, 954 (7th Cir. 1998); Graefenhain v. Pabst Brewing Co.,\n870 F.2d 1198, 1212 (7th Cir. 1989). This means, we ob-\nserved in Williams, that front pay cannot extend past the\ntime a reasonable person needs to achieve the same or an\nequivalent position in the absence of discrimination. Even\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                              15\n\nif the lingering effects of discrimination hindered promo-\ntional opportunities until trial in 2002, front pay cannot\nlogically continue after the next unimpeded promotional\nopportunity—the first post-2002 exam for captain (for those\nplaintiffs who were lieutenants in 2002) or battalion chief\n(for those who had become captains). The opportunity to\nseek promotion then gives each plaintiff everything to\nwhich he is entitled; a lieutenant or captain who does not\nachieve a competitive promotion no longer can blame his\nstatus on discrimination that delayed (but did not prevent)\npromotion to lieutenant. Setting this limit also gives plaintiffs\nan incentive to compete for promotions, unlike the district\ncourt’s remedy, which all but guaranteed plaintiffs the highest\npossible salary through retirement without the need to seek\nadvancement or perform the duties of the higher positions.\n  Perhaps what we have said will lead the litigants to resolve\nthese remaining issues (and the remaining firefighters’ claims)\namicably rather than slug it out again in the courtroom. We\nhope so; this dispute is approaching its third decade. The\njudgments are vacated, and the case is remanded for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f16                         Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, concurring. I concur in the result,\ngiven the arguments presented to us. I write separately to\nreiterate what the Supreme Court has made clear: “Al-\nthough all governmental uses of race are subject to strict\nscrutiny, not all are invalidated by it.” Grutter v. Bollinger,\n539 U.S. 306, 326-27 (2003). The City of Chicago’s use of\nrace in making promotional decisions is subject to strict\nscrutiny, meaning it is constitutional if necessary to fulfill\na compelling government interest, so long as it is also nar-\nrowly tailored to further that interest. Adarand Constructors,\nInc. v. Pena, 515 U.S. 200, 227 (1995). As my colleagues\nnote, we have recognized on numerous occasions that a gov-\nernmental agency has a compelling interest in remedying its\npast unlawful discrimination. See Majeske v. City of Chi-\ncago, 218 F.3d 816, 819 (7th Cir. 2000); McNamara v. City of\nChicago, 138 F.3d 1219, 1221 (7th Cir. 1998); People Who\nCare v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 111 F.3d 528, 535 (7th Cir.\n1997); Billish v. City of Chicago, 989 F.2d 890, 893 (7th Cir.\n1993) (en banc); see also Erwin v. Daley, 92 F.3d 521, 527\n(7th Cir. 1996) (“Courts have also held that a compelling\nstate interest can be demonstrated by the use of statistical\nevidence of present discrimination plus a history of entry-\nlevel and promotional discrimination.” (citations omitted)).\n  Yet unlike the position it has taken in other cases, the\nCity did not defend its actions on the basis that it was rem-\nedying past discrimination in the Chicago Fire Department.\nCf., e.g., McNamara v. City of Chicago, 138 F.3d 1219 (7th\nCir. 1998) (finding that non-rank order promotions in\nChicago Fire Department were justified by City’s past racial\ndiscrimination in employment of firefighters); Chicago Fire\nFighters Union Local 2 v. Washington, 1999 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 20310, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 30, 1999) (defending non-\nrank order promotions as part of policy to remedy effects of\npast racial discrimination). Because the City made no\nargument that past discrimination was a factor in any\ndecision related to the scoring of the 1986 examination, we\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                           17\n\nare precluded from analyzing the case on this basis.\n  A nonremedial reason may also constitute a compelling\ninterest supporting the use of race and ethnicity in employ-\nment decisions. For example, this court found that the\nChicago Police Department had a compelling interest in\nhaving a diverse population at the rank of sergeant. Petit v.\nCity of Chicago, 352 F.3d 1111, 1115 (7th Cir. 2003); cf.\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 329 (finding law school had a com-\npelling interest in a diverse student body). We similarly\nrecognized an operational need for persons of different races\nin the corrections environment. Wittmer v. Peters, 87 F.3d\n916, 919 (7th Cir. 1996). In this case, however, the City did\nnot argue that the pursuit of diversity constituted a com-\npelling interest.\n  Based on the arguments presented to us, I concur in the\nresult on the merits. I am in full agreement with the deci-\nsion to vacate the damage awards.\n\nA true Copy:\n      Teste:\n\n                        ________________________________\n                        Clerk of the United States Court of\n                          Appeals for the Seventh Circuit\n\n\n\n\n                   USCA-02-C-0072—8-27-04\n\f",

Chicago’s Fire Department\nhas five ranks: firefighter, engineer, lieutenant, captain,\nand battalion chief. Promotions depend on competitive\nexaminations. Chicago developed the 1986 exam for lieu-\ntenant (a position open to firefighters and engineers) with\ncare to ensure that it was both non-discriminatory and a\nvalid test of skills. Yet although 29% of those who took the\nexam were either black or Hispanic, only 12% of those who\nreceived the highest 300 scores were in these groups. The\nDepartment concluded that this disparate impact could be\n\f2                          Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\njustified, under the EEOC’s Uniform Guidelines on Em-\nployee Selection Procedures, 29 C.F.R. §1607.4, only if the\nexam were valid for rank-order use—that is, if someone who\nscores higher on the test is bound to perform better than the\nperson next in line. According to the Department’s expert,\nthis examination had a standard error of measurement of 3.5,\nwhich is to say that a person who scored 80 and took a similar\ntest again could score as high as 83.5 or as low as 76.5\nwithout implying that his skills and probability of success\nin the higher position had changed. Convinced that it could\nnot make promotions from the 1986 list in rank- order\nfashion, the Department established what it called “stan-\ndardized” lists and what most people would call racially\nsegregated lists: it drew up one list for whites and another\nfor blacks and Hispanics, and then made 29% of all promo-\ntions from the minorities-only list. The Department used\nthese lists until 1991, promoting a total of 209 lieutenants\nfrom the 1986 exam.\n  This process meant that the promotion of some white can-\ndidates was delayed, and others were not promoted even\nthough minority candidates with lower scores became lieu-\ntenants. Some of the disappointed applicants filed suit under\n42 U.S.C. §1983 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\nThe Department acknowledged that its approach can be\nsustained only if a compelling interest supports its use of\nrace and ethnicity. See, e.g., Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.\nPeña, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117947\"><a href=\"/opinion/117947/adarand-constructors-inc-v-pena/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">200</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1995). It did not argue that either past\ndiscrimination or a quest for diversity supports its approach.\nCf. Grutter v. Bollinger, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2003); Petit v.

Chicago instead maintains\nthat it had a compelling need to comply with federal regu-\nlations that frown on using tests to make promotions in\nstrict sequence. The district court bifurcated liability from\ndamages and conducted a trial before an advisory jury,\nwhich concluded that the Department violated both §1983\nand Title VII. In open court the district judge agreed with\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                                 3\n\nthis conclusion. Two later jury trials (limited to 19 of the\nplaintiffs) led to substantial awards of compensatory dam-\nages plus equitable relief such as front pay. Biondo v.

May 30, 2002).\n  According to the Department, the jury’s (and thus the\njudge’s) finding that the 1986 exam was valid is clearly er-\nroneous, see Pullman-Standard v. Swint, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110698\"><a href=\"/opinion/110698/pullman-standard-v-swint/\"><span class=\"volume\">456</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1982),\neven though the trier of fact credited plaintiffs’ statistical ex-\npert, who supported the exam’s validity. Bryant v. Chicago,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767297\"><a href=\"/opinion/767297/lloyd-bryant-desmond-butler-doris-byrd-v-city-of-chicago/\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1092</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th Cir. 2000), sustains rank-order use of a\nsimilar exam, making it hard to see how the outcome of this\ntrial could be deemed clearly erroneous. The Department\nacknowledges that the evidence taken in the light most\nfavorable to the verdict shows the exam’s overall validity as a\ntest of skills but maintains that it does not demonstrate the\npropriety of making promotions in sequence, given the stand-\nard error of measurement. Even if the plaintiffs’ expert un-\ndermined the conclusion that the standard error of mea-\nsurement is 3.5, the Department insists, the record does not\nshow that the standard error is zero, and without such a\nfinding (which would be impossible, as no exam predicts\nperfectly) the exam could not have been used to make pro-\nmotions in rank-order sequence, given the disparate impact\nthat would have ensued.\n  Let us suppose that the City has the better of the sta-\ntistical argument on this record (perhaps the one compiled\nin Bryant did more to show the exam’s validity). We shall\nsuppose further that the EEOC’s regulations tell employers\nnot to hire or promote in strict sequence when that would\ncause minority groups to succeed less than 80% as often as\nwhites. But see Paul Meier, Jerome Sacks & Sandy L.\nZabell, What Happened in Hazelwood: Statistics, Employment\nDiscrimination, and the 80% Rule, 1984 Am. Bar Foundation\nResearch J. 139, 158-70. Still, the premise of the City’s ar-\ngument is that regulations supply a compelling governmental\n\f4                          Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\ninterest in making decisions based on race. How can that\nbe? Then Congress or any federal agency could direct em-\nployers to adopt racial quotas, and the direction would be\nself-justifying: the need to comply with the law (or regulation)\nwould be the compelling interest. Such a circular process\nwould drain the equal protection clause of meaning. Deci-\nsions such as Adarand Constructors show that compliance\nwith federal laws cannot automatically be a compelling\ninterest; Adarand Constructors held a federal statute uncon-\nstitutional precisely because it required public officials to\nmake use of race, and the statute was not itself supported\nby a compelling governmental interest. Chicago does not\ncontend that 29 C.F.R. §1607.4 carries out any compelling\ngovernmental interest, and given the holding of Washington v.\nDavis, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109469\"><a href=\"/opinion/109469/washington-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">426</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1976), that disparate impact in hiring\nor promotion by a public employer does not violate the equal\nprotection clause, it is hard to see how such an argument\ncould be constructed. If avoiding disparate impact were a\ncompelling governmental interest, then racial quotas in\npublic employment would be the norm, and as a practical\nmatter Washington v. Davis would be undone. Congress did\nnot attempt this; to the contrary, it provided in 42 U.S.C.\n§2000e-2(j) that an employer’s desire to mitigate or avoid\ndisparate impact does not justify preferential treatment for\nany group.\n   The Civil Rights Act of 1991 explicitly forbids the dual-\nlist response to disparate impact. 42 U.S.C. §2000e-2(l).\n(That section also forbids differential validation, under which\nscores predicting an equal probability of success on the job\nlead to an equal probability of favorable decision even though\nthis may mean that minorities are promoted with scores\nlower than those of white applicants. See Albemarle Paper\nCo. v. Moody, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109299\"><a href=\"/opinion/109299/albemarle-paper-co-v-moody/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1975) (approving use of differ-\nential validation under statutes then in force). The City did\nnot attempt differential validation before resorting to\nstandardization.) The 1991 Act does not apply retroactively,\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                            5\n\nsee Landgraf v. USI Film Products, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1994),\nbut new §2000e-2(l) and old §2002-2(j) jointly reveal that\nstandardization cannot be an indispensable response to dis-\nparate impact. Public employers have other options. One\nwill suffice here. Instead of making rank-order promotions,\nChicago could have created bands reflecting the standard\nerror of measurement. For example, the Department could\nhave treated all scores in the range 96-100 as functionally\nidentical and made promotions by lot from that band; when\nall test-takers with those scores had been promoted, the\nDepartment could have pooled scores in the range 91-95\nand promoted randomly from that group, and so on. That\nprocedure would have respected the limits of the exam’s ac-\ncuracy while avoiding any resort to race or ethnicity. Given\noptions of this kind, the City’s two-list procedure cannot be\nthought compelled. Indeed, it is hard to credit the\nDepartment’s assertion that it viewed rank-order promotions\nas unsupportable when that is how it actually used the exam.\nAfter creating racially segregated lists, the Department pro-\nmoted in rank-order sequence from each list!\n  No more need be said about the merits. Remedies are more\nproblematic. Each of the two juries was asked six questions:\nwhat was the likelihood that, but for the discrimination,\neach firefighter would have been promoted to captain and\nthen battalion chief (and when each position would have been\nachieved); what damages represented loss of pay until the\ntrial; and what damages were appropriate for emotional\ndistress. The district judge then ordered the Department to\nmake retroactive the positions of those plaintiffs who had\nachieved one or more promotions since 1986, and he granted\nfront pay to those who (the jury found) would have been\npromoted further. The judge also ordered the City to pay\nprejudgment interest.

Peter Biondo received $35,125 in\nprejudgment interest on the back-pay amount of $112,000.\nThe court did not add interest to the damages for emotional\ndistress. So money damages came to $272,125. Biondo had\nbeen promoted (after his success on a later exam) to lieu-\ntenant on February 16, 1998; the court ordered the Depart-\nment to make this promotion retroactive to November 1,\n1990, which provided Biondo with additional seniority and\npension benefits. (This date was selected to leave an\nadequate gap before the promotion to captain, which the\njury found would have occurred on August 16, 1993, but for\nthe delay in Biondo’s promotion to lieutenant.) Finally, the\ncourt ordered the Department to pay Biondo at the rate of\na battalion chief for the period between March 1, 2002, and\nMarch 1, 2014, unless Biondo left the Department’s employ\nearlier.\n  Some of these findings are hard to quarrel with. For ex-\nample, Michael Timothy, whose promotion to lieutenant\nwas delayed, made it to both captain (from the 1992 exam\nfor that position) and battalion chief (from the 1994 exam);\nhis damages reflect just a short delay in promotion and a bit\nof aggravation. Gacki and Wirtz became captains after the\n1999 examination. But other findings are more problematic:\nthe juries found that most of the plaintiffs were sure to be\npromoted even though, except for Gacki, Timothy, and Wirtz,\nthey have failed to achieve advancement through the com-\npetitive process since becoming lieutenants (a position 15 of\nthem managed to achieve, eventually, on their own: 5 by\ndelayed promotion from the 1986 list, and 10 by promotion\nfrom later examinations). The finding that Gacki had a “0%”\nchance of becoming a captain is puzzling, as he actually\nachieved that position in 1999. (This finding was the work\nof the second jury; the first jury concluded that Timothy and\nWirtz, the others who already were captains, had a 100%\nprobability of promotion to that position. Neither jury be-\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                                 9\n\nhaved inconsistently.) Then there is the inexplicable verdict\nconcerning Michael Oliver: 90% likely to become a captain\nand certain to become a battalion chief, even though the\nlatter promotion is impossible without the former.\n   The City does not dispute the district court’s central ap-\nproach: asking the jury to determine the probability that\nbeing held back in 1986 cost the plaintiffs later chances for\nadvancement. This “loss of a chance” method is the best\nway to handle probabilistic injuries. See Bishop v.

If four people\ncompeting for one position lost an equal chance to get it,\nthen each should receive 25% of the benefits available. Or\nif a person would have had a 25% chance of promotion from\nlieutenant to captain, then preventing that person from be-\ncoming a lieutenant should lead to a remedy equal to 100%\nof the benefits of being a lieutenant plus 25% of the incre-\nmental benefits of being a captain. (This assumes that all\nplaintiffs are risk neutral; in most cases, however, they would\npay to reduce risk, so the proper award should be something\nless than the actuarial value—for promotion is uncertain.\nNeither side makes anything of this, however, so for sim-\nplicity we assume risk neutrality.)\n   Unfortunately, the juries’ estimates do not reflect a plausible\nappreciation of the lost chances: the juries concluded that\nevery one of the plaintiffs who had not yet achieved a cap-\ntaincy was certain to have done so—even though four plaintiffs\nhad been unsuccessful in post-1986 attempts to become lieu-\ntenants, and 9 of the 15 plaintiffs who reached lieutenant\nhad tried and failed to achieve higher ranks. (Timothy, Gacki,\nand Wirtz became captains after succeeding on exams;\nCorcoran, Joyce, and McElroy were promoted independently\nof the testing process, for reasons that the parties do not\nrelate.) Even in a world of grade inflation, where teachers\nliving far from Lake Wobegon think nothing of rating all\n\f10                         Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\nstudents as “above average,” it is hard to swallow a con-\nclusion that all candidates held back from promotion to\nlieutenant in 1986 were sure to become captains. Remember\nthat 209 firefighters were promoted to lieutenant from the\n1986 exam. Plaintiffs ranked well below many of those 209,\nthough high enough to have made the cut but for the\npreference given to minority firefighters. They are not the\npick of the class, the people who regularly finish first on every\nexam. Of the 528 lieutenants who took the 1992 exam for cap-\ntain (the first that these plaintiffs could have taken had\nthey been promoted from the 1986 exam), only 136 (or 26%)\nwere promoted. That one-in-four chance was the outcome\nfor persons who, on average, had done better on the lieuten-\nants’ exam than plaintiffs (for even had they been promoted,\nthey would have been in the bottom half of the 1986\nlieutenant class). And of the 137 captains who took the 1994\nexam for battalion chief, only 54 (or 41%) were pro-\nmoted—though these juries concluded that 8 of our 19\nplaintiffs had a 100% chance of promotion to battalion chief,\nand that another four had chances exceeding 41%.\n   One must take into account the possibility of sitting for\nmultiple exams: 132 lieutenants who were not promoted from\nthe 1992 test for captain applied again in 1998; of these, 29\n(or 22%) have been promoted. This suggests that of those\nlieutenants who take the captain’s exam at all, about 33%\nare promoted either from the first exam or a second try (if\nthey persist through a second exam, and one could extrapo-\nlate that around 40% of aspiring lieutenants could achieve\npromotion by taking the exam) three or more times. Still,\nthis is a long way from the 100% success rate that the juries\ncalculated for our 19 firefighters.\n  The verdicts imply that, if we were to look at the most\ncomparable firefighters—say, the 25 who ranked immedi-\nately above the plaintiffs on the 1986 exam and were pro-\nmoted to lieutenant as a result—we would find that all\nbecame captains no later than November 2000, and that\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                            11\n\nmost would be battalion chiefs today. The record does not\nreveal how these firefighters actually fared, and plaintiffs,\nwho bear the burden of persuasion, suffer from the omis-\nsion. The best evidence of the chance they actually lost is\nmissing. Nonetheless the verdicts might be sustainable if\nevidence demonstrated that, despite finishing out of the top\nhundred who took the 1986 exam, these plaintiffs must\nhave had a bad day and were really more likely to succeed\nthan the average exam-taker. That only 3 of the 19 have be-\ncome captains by examination (some after two chances, in\n1992 and 1998), suggests otherwise.\n  The record does not contain any evidence comparing these\nplaintiffs with other firefighters. Each of the 19 elected to\npresent a non-comparative case. Each testified that he loves\nthe work, strives to succeed, and studies hard for tests.\nEach presented evidence about his education and experience.\nMost presented family members and friends who testified\nto the long hours the plaintiff studied, the plaintiff’s com-\nmitment to the fire department, and so on. This evidence\ndoes not permit quantification of the chance lost by being\nheld back in 1986. Firefighters do not strive to meet an\nabsolute standard; they compete against their colleagues.\nThe other firefighters taking tests for higher positions also\nlove the department and prepare thoroughly. Only a dem-\nonstration that these plaintiffs are much better at tests than\ntheir rivals would support a verdict that the chance lost was\n100% or anything like it. Yet the plaintiffs bypassed their\nopportunity to introduce comparative evidence; and what\nevidence the record does contain—that these plaintiffs did\nnot excel on the 1986 exam; that they have not done well on\ntests for promotion since then; that only 33% of those who\nwere actually promoted to lieutenant by 1992, and pursued\nfurther promotion, made captain by 2002—undermines the\nverdicts. Even giving all of the evidence and inferences a\nreading favorable to plaintiffs, no reasonable juror could find\nthat all were destined to become captains. The verdicts there-\nfore cannot stand.\n\f12                          Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\n  Because none of the plaintiffs presented comparative evi-\ndence, the view most favorable to the plaintiffs as a group\nis that each would have done as well as the average lieu-\ntenant on the 1992 and 1998 exams. This means that, but for\nthe discrimination after the 1986 exam, 33% of the plaintiffs\n(or 6 of them) would have become captains by 2002 via ex-\namination. Three actually reached that level (and Timothy\nwent on to battalion chief), and three more achieved a cap-\ntaincy in some other way, so the remaining 16 lost only 3\ncaptaincies (or none, depending on how the non-competitive\npromotions are handled). Perhaps it is inappropriate to hold\nthe promotions of some plaintiffs against the rest in this\nway; it depends on whether we view these 19 as all of the\nvictims of discrimination (in which event at most 3 pro-\nmotions were lost) or as a random sample of the victims (in\nwhich event the lost-chance figure should be applied person by\nperson). The City takes the latter view, which is the more\nfavorable to the 13 plaintiffs who have stopped short of\ncaptain. (These 19 are not the only victims; other fire-\nfighters have claims yet to be tried; their disposition has\nbeen postponed to await our decision concerning these fire-\nfighters.) Accordingly, on remand each of the 13 is entitled\nto all of the benefits he would have received from a timely\npromotion to lieutenant, plus 33% of the benefits available\nfrom promotion to captain. And as about 41% of captains\neventually become battalion chiefs, the award for the 10\nplaintiffs who the jury thought likely to achieve that goal\ncould include about 14% of the benefits of that position (a\n33% chance of becoming a captain times the 41% chance that\na captain eventually will advance again).\n   Other remedies depend on the unsupported view that all\n19 plaintiffs were sure to become captains. Promotion to bat-\ntalion chief is possible only for captains, so the high probabili-\nties assigned to battalion chief for 11 plaintiffs are untena-\nble. The back pay awards depend on the probabilities (and\ndates) of these promotions; they too must be vacated. The\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                            13\n\nawards of compensatory damages for emotional distress\nalso are linked to the estimates of promotional likelihoods.\nAs the district judge remarked, this is why the awards to\nTimothy and Wirtz are relatively low: they suffered an\ninsult and aggravation but were not held back significantly\nin their careers. The awards appear to be dominated by the\njurors’ belief that persons who should have been captains, and\nwere stuck for a decade in the rank-and-file, suffered acute\nmental distress. Recognition that these plaintiffs were not\ndestined for the captaincy doubtless would influence the\nevaluation of their degree of (justifiable) distress. Finally,\nthe district judge’s equitable orders (retroactive seniority\nand pensions, front pay) assume the validity of the jurors’\nconclusions. A change in the promotion probabilities and\ndates requires everything else to be redone. Consequently\nwe vacate the entire judgment and remand for a new trial\nlimited to the calculation of back pay and damages for emo-\ntional distress on the assumption that each of the plaintiffs\nwho has yet to reach captain lost a 33% chance of promotion\nby 2002.\n   The district judge should see to it that any awards of com-\npensatory damages for mental distress are proportional to\nthe wrongs—and to the caps added by the 1991 Act. They do\nnot apply directly to injury before 1991, but much of the\nharm post-dates that legislation. No matter how serious the\noffense, compensatory damages for discrimination covered by\nthe 1991 Act cannot exceed $300,000. See 42 U.S.C.\n§1981a(b)(3). The awards in this case reached $232,000 (to\nTervanis), yet the emotional distress that these firefighters\nendured must be considerably less than that suffered by\nother victims of discrimination—some of whom lose their\nlivelihood by racially motivated discharge, others of whom\nendure sexually or racially based harassment or assaults\nthat can make a job a source of trauma and misery. Some-\ntimes discrimination produces mental breakdowns and long-\nterm disability. See Wilson v.

The district court added 12 years’\nworth, at the highest position the jury projected for each\nplaintiff (provided that the plaintiff was still employed at\nthe Department in 2002). The judge explained that this\nunusually long period was justified by the infrequency of\npromotional opportunities and the fact that the plaintiffs\nwere too distracted by the litigation (and the wrong done\nthem in 1986) to be effective exam-takers earlier. Front pay\nmust be reduced to match the opportunity lost—so a person\nwho lost a 33% chance to become a captain by 2002 is\nlimited to front pay at 33% of that position’s salary until it\nis achieved by examination. (To be precise, such a person\ngets the salary and benefits of the position actually held,\nplus 33% of the difference in salary and benefits between\nthat position and captain.)\n   As for duration: we agree with the City that 12 years\nexceeds the scope of a district court’s equitable discretion.\nThe goal of front pay is to put the victim in the financial\nposition he should have enjoyed, when circumstances make\nit inappropriate to direct the employer to promote (or hire)\nhim.

The opportunity to\nseek promotion then gives each plaintiff everything to\nwhich he is entitled; a lieutenant or captain who does not\nachieve a competitive promotion no longer can blame his\nstatus on discrimination that delayed (but did not prevent)\npromotion to lieutenant. Setting this limit also gives plaintiffs\nan incentive to compete for promotions, unlike the district\ncourt’s remedy, which all but guaranteed plaintiffs the highest\npossible salary through retirement without the need to seek\nadvancement or perform the duties of the higher positions.\n  Perhaps what we have said will lead the litigants to resolve\nthese remaining issues (and the remaining firefighters’ claims)\namicably rather than slug it out again in the courtroom. We\nhope so; this dispute is approaching its third decade. The\njudgments are vacated, and the case is remanded for\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\f16                         Nos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921\n\n  WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, concurring. I concur in the result,\ngiven the arguments presented to us. I write separately to\nreiterate what the Supreme Court has made clear: “Al-\nthough all governmental uses of race are subject to strict\nscrutiny, not all are invalidated by it.” Grutter v. Bollinger,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130155\"><a href=\"/opinion/130155/grutter-v-bollinger/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">306</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 326-27 (2003). The City of Chicago’s use of\nrace in making promotional decisions is subject to strict\nscrutiny, meaning it is constitutional if necessary to fulfill\na compelling government interest, so long as it is also nar-\nrowly tailored to further that interest.

City of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"752374\"><a href=\"/opinion/752374/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-668-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45211-james-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1219</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (7th\nCir. 1998) (finding that non-rank order promotions in\nChicago Fire Department were justified by City’s past racial\ndiscrimination in employment of firefighters); Chicago Fire\nFighters Union Local 2 v. Washington, 1999 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 20310, at *8 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 30, 1999) (defending non-\nrank order promotions as part of policy to remedy effects of\npast racial discrimination). Because the City made no\nargument that past discrimination was a factor in any\ndecision related to the scoring of the 1986 examination, we\n\fNos. 02-2707, 02-3099 & 03-1921                           17\n\nare precluded from analyzing the case on this basis.\n  A nonremedial reason may also constitute a compelling\ninterest supporting the use of race and ethnicity in employ-\nment decisions. For example, this court found that the\nChicago Police Department had a compelling interest in\nhaving a diverse population at the rank of sergeant. Petit v.\nCity of Chicago, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1111</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1115 (7th Cir. 2003); cf.\nGrutter, 539 U.S. at 329 (finding law school had a com-\npelling interest in a diverse student body). We similarly\nrecognized an operational need for persons of different races\nin the corrections environment. Wittmer v.

In this case, however, the City did\nnot argue that the pursuit of diversity constituted a com-\npelling interest.\n  Based on the arguments presented to us, I concur in the\nresult on the merits.
