A Kentucky prisoner proceeding pro se appeals\nthe district court’s order dismissing his civil rights action brought under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983\nfor violations of due process, equal protection, the Eighth Amendment, and the Fourteenth\nAmendment during a mandatory screening procedure before the complaint was served on the\ndefendants. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n                                                  I.\n        Henry David Grinter filed a pro se complaint in which he sought relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 1981 and 1983. He names the following persons as defendants in their individual and official\ncapacities: (1) Sergeant Chad Knight of the Kentucky State Penitentiary, (2) Lieutenant and\nAdjustment Committee Chairman William Henderson of the Kentucky State Penitentiary,\n(3) Lieutenant and Adjustment Committee Member Jay R. Jones of the Kentucky State Penitentiary,\n(4) Case Worker and Adjustment Committee Member Steve Hern of the Kentucky State\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 05-6755                  Grinter v. Knight, et al.                                                            Page 2\n\n\nPenitentiary, (5) Warden Glenn Haeberlin of the Kentucky State Penitentiary, (6) Commissioner\nJohn D. Rees of the Kentucky State Penitentiary, (7) Lieutenant Joel Dunlap, head of Internal\nAffairs at the Kentucky State Penitentiary, (8) Lieutenant Will Thomas, Internal Affairs employee\nat the Kentucky State Penitentiary, and (9) Lieutenant Tim White of the Kentucky State Penitentiary.\nGrinter alleges his claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983 resulted from violations of his due\nprocess, equal protection, Eighth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n        In his complaint, Grinter alleges that on January 3, 2003, Knight came to his cell to\ninvestigate an incident report that had been filed.1 He alleges that Knight presented the report to him\nthrough a food opening in the door of Grinter’s cell in the segregation unit and that Knight refused\nto add witnesses to an incident report in response to his request. After that, Knight closed the slot\nand slipped a copy of the report under the door.\n        Grinter avers that a short time later, White and another guard dressed in full riot gear\napproached his cell without a nurse present. White ordered Grinter to remove his clothes, pinned\nhim to the wall while2 Grinter’s linens and personal property were removed, and placed him under\nfour-point restraints. Grinter remained in the restraints, shackled to his bed, for four hours and\nsustained cuts and bleeding.\n         Grinter alleges that the following day, January 4, 2003, he was issued a disciplinary report\nclaiming he assaulted defendant Knight. The incident report detailing the January 3 incident, which\nwas attached to the complaint, stated that Grinter wadded up and threw the incident report. The\nreport also stated that Grinter struck Knight’s left arm and that Knight had a “small red spot” on his\nwrist. According to the incident report, at a hearing several weeks later the adjustment committee\nfound Grinter guilty. The report states, “Based on facts as stated by Sgt. Knight and [the] medical\nreport from Nurse Roystor . . . Grinter did strike Sgt. Knight[,] causing a red spot on his left wrist.”\nThe adjustment committee assessed a non-restorable penalty of sixty days forfeiture of good time\ncredits.\n       Grinter alleges that he was never provided a copy of any medical records, the testimony\nNurse Roystor gave cannot be true because she did not witness the incident, and J. Belt’s written\nstatement regarding the incident is troubling. Plaintiff appealed to the warden and the state\ndepartment of corrections but was unsuccessful.\n        The district court dismissed the claims against Rees, Haeberlin, Hern, Jones, Henderson,\nThomas, and Dunlap and the due process claims against Knight and White for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b). It dismissed the claims against\nthe defendants, state employees, in their official capacities as claims against Kentucky – which was\nimmune from suit. It dismissed the substantive due process claims based upon the use of the four-\npoint restraints, the challenge to the procedures used by the adjustment board, and the denial of\ngood-time credits, finding no liberty interest present. Likewise, it dismissed the claims for failure\nto intervene in or overturn the finding of guilt, explaining that the defendants could not be named\non the basis of their supervisory roles and that there was no liberty interest. The district court\ndismissed the § 1981 claim against Knight, holding that Knight, as a public official, cannot be sued\nunder § 1981.\n        The district court dismissed Grinter’s § 1983 claims for violation of his equal protection\nrights against defendant Knight and the Eighth Amendment excessive force claim against defendant\n\n         1\n             The incident report is not specifically identified in the complaint.\n         2\n           Placing an inmate under four-point restraints involves shackling the inmate’s hands and feet to the four corners\nof his bed.\n\fNo. 05-6755             Grinter v. Knight, et al.                                                     Page 3\n\n\nWhite for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1997e. At the\ndirection of this court, the district court granted Grinter permission to file a late notice of appeal.\nThis appeal followed.\n                                                     II.\n        We review a district court’s decision to dismiss under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e), 1915A , and\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e de novo. McGore v. Wrigglesworth, 114 F.3d 601, 604 (6th Cir. 1997) (overruled\non other grounds by Jones v. Bock, __ U.S. __, 127 S. Ct. 910, 918-19 (2007)). The Prison\nLitigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) requires district courts to screen and dismiss complaints that are\nfrivolous or malicious, that fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or that seek\nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b).\n                                                     III.\n        Section 1983 provides a private right of action for those persons subject to a deprivation of\nthe “rights, privileges or immunities” guaranteed under the Constitution when that deprivation is\neffected by a person operating “under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage”\nof a governmental entity. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. “[T]he violation of a federally protected right” is\nnecessary for there to be liability against a government official under § 1983. Schroder v. City of\nFort Thomas, 412 F.3d 724, 727 (6th Cir. 2005). In addition, the deprivation must be committed\nby a person acting under color of law. Street v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 102 F.3d 810, 814 (6th Cir.\n1996).\n                                               A. Due Process\n        We first turn to Grinter’s due process claims. The district court dismissed Grinter’s\nsubstantive due process claims for failure to state a claim. On appeal, Grinter appears to assert that\nthe district court erred. Grinter argues that “the defendants did separately and jointly violate[ ] the\nsubstantive due process rights of the plaintiff.”\n                                          i.    Official Capacity\n        Grinter names the defendants to the § 1983 claim in both their individual and official\ncapacities. The district court dismissed the claims against the defendants in their official capacities\nas barred by the Eleventh Amendment.\n         “[A] suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official\nbut rather is a suit against the official’s office.” Will v. Mich. Dep’t of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 71\n(1989). The Eleventh Amendment bars suits brought in federal court against a state and its agencies\nunless the state has waived its sovereign immunity or consented to be sued in federal court. Id. at\n66. See also Abick v. Michigan, 803 F.2d 874, 876-77 (6th Cir. 1986). All of the defendants are\nstate employees and Kentucky has not waived its sovereign immunity. To the extent they are sued\nin their official capacities, the § 1983 claim fails.\n                                        ii.    Individual Capacity\n        Grinter alleges his substantive due process rights were violated when he was placed under\nfour-point restraints for four hours, when prison adjustment procedures were not followed at his\ndisciplinary hearing, and when the adjustment committee did not comply with the Kentucky statute\nauthorizing good-time credits. The district court dismissed each of these claims for failure to state\na claim.\n\fNo. 05-6755              Grinter v. Knight, et al.                                                           Page 4\n\n\n        The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides that a person may not be\ndeprived of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” U.S. Const. Amend. XIV. “The\ndoctrine that governmental deprivations of life, liberty or property are subject to limitations\nregardless of the adequacy of the procedures employed has come to be known as substantive due\nprocess.” Bowers v. City of Flint, 325 F.3d 758, 763 (6th Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). “These\nlimitations are meant to provide heightened protection against government interference with certain\nfundamental rights and liberty interests.” Does v. Munoz, 507 F.3d 961, 964 (6th Cir. 2007)\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). “However, identifying a new fundamental right\nsubject to the protections of substantive due process is often an uphill battle, as the list of\nfundamental rights is short.” Id. (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). A fundamental\nright must be “deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition,” and “implicit in the concept of\nordered liberty.” Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 721 (1997) (internal quotation marks\nand citation omitted).\n        Prisoners have narrower liberty interests than other citizens as “lawful incarceration brings\nabout the necessary withdrawal or limitation of many privileges and rights, a retraction justified by\nthe considerations underlying our penal system.” Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 485 (1995)\n(internal quotations and citation omitted). We “reach the question of what process is due only if the\ninmates establish a constitutionally protected liberty interest.” Wilkinson v. Austin, 545 U.S. 209,\n221 (2005). A liberty interest may arise from the Due Process Clause or a state regulation. Sandin,\n515 U.S. at 487.\n                                          iii.   Four-Point Restraints\n        Grinter alleges a substantive due process violation against White because he was in four-\npoint restraints for four hours and White did not wait for a nurse to arrive before placing Grinter in\nthe restraints.\n        “The Due Process Clause standing alone confers no liberty interest in freedom from state\naction taken within the sentence imposed.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 480 (quotation marks and citation\nomitted). “Discipline by prison officials in response to a wide range of misconduct falls within the\nexpected perimeters of the sentence imposed by a court of law.” Id. at 485. “[T]he Constitution\nitself does not give rise to a liberty interest in avoiding transfer to more adverse conditions of\nconfinement.” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 221.\n        In Sandin, the Supreme Court held that a prisoner’s thirty-day confinement in disciplinary\nsegregation was “within the range of confinement normally expected for one serving an\nindeterminate term of 30 years to life,” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 487, and did not “present a dramatic\ndeparture from the basic conditions of [the inmate’s] sentence,” id. at 485. In contrast, in Wilkinson,\nthe Supreme Court held that prisoners “have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment to [super-\nmaximum security prison].” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 224. We have held that a prisoner’s designation\nas a member of a security threat group did not give rise to a liberty interest. Harbin-Bey v. Rutter,\n420 F.3d 571, 577 (6th Cir. 2005). We also held that we would not “find [ ] a liberty interest on the\nface of” a substance abuse regulation that banned most visitation for prisoners found guilty of two3\nor more substance abuse violations. Bazzetta v. McGinnis, 430 F.3d 795, 802-03 (6th Cir. 2005).\n        The use of the four-point restraints and conditions in which they were administered – the\nfour-hour duration of the period of restraint and the fastening of the restraints without a nurse\npresent – were expected adverse consequences of confinement. Grinter had been accused of hitting\na prison guard, Knight, at the time he was placed in the restraints. Furthermore, prison officials\n\n         3\n          While some of these cases discuss procedural, rather than substantive, due process, they are relevant to the\nquestion of when liberty interests arise for incarcerated prisoners.\n\fNo. 05-6755                Grinter v. Knight, et al.                                                               Page 5\n\n\nentered his cell to conduct an investigation. Given the accusation and the presence of the officials\nin Grinter’s cell, as explained above, there was no liberty interest in either freedom from four-point\nrestraints for four hours or in applying the restraints only in the presence of a nurse because the\nrestraints were not an “atypical and significant hardship” in prison life. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484.\n        The use of the restraints and the absence of a nurse pose a lesser hardship than the thirty-day\nassignment to solitary confinement in Sandin that the Court held did not infringe a liberty interest\nand are significantly less burdensome than the assignment to super-maximum security prison which\nwas found not to infringe any liberty interest in Wilkinson. This situation is more analogous to\nbanning visitors or designating prisoners as a threat, as in Bazzetta and Harbin-Bey, where we found\nthere was no liberty interest. Thus, the Due Process Clause does not give rise to a liberty interest\nin freedom from four-point restraints or in having a nurse arrive before placing an inmate in the\nrestraints.\n        A state may create a liberty interest through a law or regulation establishing freedom from\nrestraint which “imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\nincidents of prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Grinter has pointed to no Kentucky law or\nregulation that creates an interest in freedom from four-point restraints or in having a nurse present\nwhen such restraints are applied to a prisoner. Therefore, White did not violate the Due Process\nClause by placing Grinter in four-point restraints for four hours or in attaching the restraints without\na nurse present.\n                         iv.    Adjustment Procedures in the Disciplinary Hearing\n       Grinter alleges a substantive due process violation against Henderson, Jones, and Hern\nbecause they violated policy by failing to provide Grinter with a copy of a medical report, failed to\nquestion Dunlap and Thomas,     failed to make J. Belt available for questioning, and found guilt\nwithout sufficient evidence.4 The district court dismissed each of these claims.\n        The allegations of failing to provide a copy of a medical report, failing to question Dunlap\nand Thomas, and failing to make J. Belt available for questioning appear to allege that defendants\nfailed to follow established procedures. Failing to follow proper procedures is insufficient to\nestablish an infringement of a liberty interest. Olim v. Wakinekona, 461 U.S. 238, 250 (1983)\n(“Process is not an end in itself. Its constitutional purpose is to protect a substantive interest to\nwhich the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement.”). Thus, the substantive due process\nviolation claim fails because the failure to follow procedure and provide Grinter with a medical\nreport, question Dunlap and Thomas, and make J. Belt available for questioning does not infringe\na liberty interest.\n         Thus, even if Grinter had asserted a procedural due process claim against these defendants,\nit also would have failed. See Sweeton v. Brown, 27 F.3d 1162, 1165 (6th Cir. 1994) (holding that\ndue process does not require that parole authorities follow established procedure). These alleged\nprocedural violations by Henderson, Jones, and Hern did not violate the Due Process Clause.\n\n\n\n\n         4\n           Grinter offered no allegations or argument in support of his claim that there was insufficient evidence to\nsupport a finding of guilt. “[I]t is a settled appellate rule that issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied\nby some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.” United States v. Johnson, 440 F.3d 832, 846 (6th Cir.\n2006) (citation omitted). Grinter has provided no argument or allegations in support of this argument either in the district\ncourt or before this court and has waived it. See also Rogers v. Howes, 64 F. App’x 450, 455 (6th Cir. 2003) (“The mere\nassertion by the petitioner that there was insufficient evidence, without more, cannot support a finding of deprivation\nof due process.”) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\fNo. 05-6755           Grinter v. Knight, et al.                                                 Page 6\n\n\n                v.   Compliance With the Statute Authorizing Good-Time Credits\n        Grinter alleges a substantive due process violation because Henderson, Jones, and Hern\nviolated the Kentucky good-time credit statute, Kentucky Revised Statute § 197.045, denying him\nthe ability to accumulate sixty days of good-time credits. Grinter had already forfeited 2400 days\nof good-time credit and avers he had no more good-time credit to forfeit at the time he was denied\nthe possibility of accumulating sixty days of good-time credits. The statute provides in part, “The\ndepartment may forfeit any good time previously earned by the prisoner or deny the prisoner the\nright to earn good time in any amount if during the term of imprisonment, a prisoner commits any\noffense or violates the rules of the institution.” Ky. Rev. Stat. § 197.045(1).\n        As “the Due Process Clause itself does not create a liberty interest in credit for good\nbehavior,” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 477, the question is whether the Kentucky statute creates such an\ninterest. A Kentucky inmate “ possesses no inherent constitutional right . . . to accumulate good\ntime credits.” Hopewell v. Berry, No. 89-5332, 889 F.2d 1087 (table), 1989 WL 137177, at *1 (6th\nCir. Nov. 15, 1989) (citing Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 557 (1974)). Furthermore, “[p]rison\nofficials clearly have discretion under state law to deny a prisoner future good time.” Id. (citing Ky.\nRev. Stat. § 197.045(1)). As there is no right to accumulate good-time credits, Henderson, Jones,\nand Hern did not commit a constitutional violation. Grinter’s substantive due process rights were\nnot violated because of his inability to accumulate good-time credits.\n                           vi.   Supervisory or Administrative Liability\n       The district court dismissed the claims against Haeberlin, Rees, Dunlap, and Thomas for\nmultiple reasons including that Grinter cannot maintain a claim against these defendants in their\nsupervisory capacities.\n        In his complaint, Grinter alleges that Warden Haeberlin and Commissioner Rees violated his\ndue process rights by acting in a supervisory capacity and allowing their employees to violate\nGrinter’s rights and for affirming the finding of guilt. “Because § 1983 liability cannot be imposed\nunder a theory of respondeat superior, proof of personal involvement is required for a supervisor\nto incur personal liability.” Miller v. Calhoun County, 408 F.3d 803, 817 n.3 (6th Cir. 2005). “At\na minimum, a § 1983 plaintiff must show that a supervisory official at least implicitly authorized,\napproved or knowingly acquiesced in the unconstitutional conduct of the offending subordinate.”\nBellamy v. Bradley, 729 F.2d 416, 421 (6th Cir. 1984). Grinter has not alleged that Haeberlin and\nRees committed any actual acts, nor has he averred that they acquiesced in the conduct of their\nemployees.\n         Grinter also alleges that Internal Affairs Officers Dunlap and Thomas failed to intervene\nwhen Grinter informed them in writing that Knight’s accusations were false. If Grinter is alleging\nthat they were acting in a supervisory capacity, the claim fails. See Bellamy, 729 F.2d at 421.\nFurthermore, if the allegation is brought against Dunlap and Thomas for actions they committed for\nfailing to intervene, the claim also fails. The “denial of administrative grievances or the failure to\nact” by prison officials does not subject supervisors to liability under § 1983. Shehee v. Luttrell, 199\nF.3d 295, 300 (6th Cir. 1999). To the extent Grinter is alleging that he was denied administrative\nappeals, he fails to state a claim because “an expectation of receiving process is not, without more,\na liberty interest protected by the Due Process Clause.” Olim, 461 U.S. at 250 n.12. We affirm the\ndismissal of the claims against Haeberlin, Rees, Dunlap, and Thomas.\n       In conclusion, for the reasons explained above, we affirm the dismissal of Grinter’s due\nprocess claims against all defendants named in these claims.\n\fNo. 05-6755                Grinter v. Knight, et al.                                                               Page 7\n\n\n                                      B.     Equal Protection Under § 1981\n        Grinter asserts an equal protection claim against Knight in his official and individual\ncapacities under § 1981 for race5 discrimination. The district court dismissed this equal protection\nclaim for failure to state a claim. Grinter alleges in his complaint that “Defendant Knight subjected\n[him] to cruel [and] unusual punishment for no reason other than he does not like ‘black inmates.’”\n       Section 1981 provides that “[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall\nhave the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981(a). The statute defines “make and enforce contracts” to include the “making, performance,\nmodification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and\nconditions of the contractual relationship.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(b). The statute elaborates, “The rights\nprotected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and\nimpairment under color of State law.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(c).\n        Section 1981 is unavailable to Grinter as a vehicle to pursue a damages claim against Knight\nin his official capacity. “[T]he express ‘action at law’ provided by § 1983 for the ‘deprivation of\nany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,’ provides the exclusive\nfederal damages remedy for the violation of the rights guaranteed by § 1981” when the claim is\nasserted against a state actor in his official capacity. Jett v. Dallas Indep. Sch. Dist., 491 U.S. 701,\n735 (1989). Jett continues to control following amendments to § 1981 to add subsection (c) in 1991.\nNothing about the amendments suggests that Congress’s intent was to overrule Jett.6 A panel of this\ncourt assumed without discussion that the amendments did not overrule Jett as applied to state actors\nsued in their official capacities. McCrary v. Ohio Dep’t of Human Servs., No. 99-3597, 229 F.3d\n1153 (table), 2000 WL 1140750, at *2 (6th Cir. Aug. 8, 2000) (concluding that “Congress intended\nthat the explicit remedial provisions of § 1983 be controlling in the context of actions seeking\nequitable relief against state actors alleging violation of their rights under § 1981”). Other circuits\nconcur. See, e.g., Pittman v. Oregon Employment Dep’t, 509 F.3d 1065, 1074 (9th Cir. 2007)\n(“[W]e hold that § 1981 does not contain a cause of action against states.”); Oden v. Oktibbeha\nCounty, 246 F.3d 458, 463-64 (5th Cir. 2001); Butts v. County of Volusia, 222 F.3d 891, 894 (11th\nCir. 2000); Dennis v. County of Fairfax, 55 F.3d 151, 156 n.1 (4th Cir.1995); Williams v. Little Rock\nMun. Water Works, 21 F.3d 218, 224 (8th Cir. 1994).\n        Because Jett remains in force, consequently, § 1983 provides an exclusive remedy for\nviolations against state actors sued in their official capacities. An official capacity lawsuit against\nKnight, a state actor, for constitutional violations, such as race discrimination, cannot be brought\nunder § 1981.\n\n\n\n\n         5\n           In the complaint, in addition to the specific allegation against defendant Knight, Grinter alleges “defendants”\nviolated his “equal rights” in violation of § 1981. “This court has adopted the requirement that a plaintiff allege with\nparticularity all material facts to be relied upon when asserting that a governmental official has violated a constitutional\nright.” Terrance v. Northville Reg’l Psychiatric Hosp., 286 F.3d 834, 842 (6th Cir. 2002). Such “conclusory,\nunsupported statements” are “insufficient to state a claim.” Dellis v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 257 F.3d 508, 511 (6th Cir.\n2001).\n         6\n           The new language states in relevant part, “The rights protected by this section are protected against impairment\nby nongovernmental discrimination and impairment under color of State law.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(c). This language\ncreates a right, but not a remedy, and therefore shows no Congressional intent to overrule Jett. See Butts v. County of\nVolusia, 222 F.3d 891, 894 (11th Cir. 2000) (“[T]he section creates a right that private or state actors may violate but\ndoes not itself create a remedy for that violation.”).\n\fNo. 05-6755               Grinter v. Knight, et al.                                                              Page 8\n\n\n        Furthermore, Grinter fails to state a claim against Knight in his individual capacity.7 Grinter\nalleges Knight subjected him to cruel and unusual punishment because of his race. Grinter, who is\npro se, is held to a less stringent pleading standard than a party with an attorney. Haines v. Kerner,\n404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972). Despite this, “more than bare assertions of legal conclusions is ordinarily\nrequired to satisfy federal notice pleading requirements.” Scheid v. Fanny Farmer Candy Shops,\nInc., 859 F.2d 434, 436 (6th Cir. 1988). See also Kamppi v. Ghee, 208 F.3d 213 (table), 2000 WL\n303018, at *1 (6th Cir. May 14, 2000) (“Thus, the less stringent standard for pro se plaintiffs does\nnot compel the courts to conjure up unpleaded facts to support conclusory allegations.”) As Grinter\npleads a legal conclusion without surrounding facts to support the conclusion stated in this claim,\nhe fails to state a claim. We affirm the dismissal of the § 1981 claim.\n                             C.     Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n        The district court dismissed Grinter’s Eighth Amendment excessive force and equal\nprotection race discrimination claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On appeal,\nGrinter argues that he had exhausted his administrative remedies as to all claims at the time he filed\nthe complaint.\n       Prisoners must exhaust their administrative remedies before challenging prison conditions.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e. “There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that\nunexhausted claims cannot be brought in court.” Jones v. Bock, 127 S. Ct. at 918-19. Failure to\nexhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and [ ] inmates are not required to specially plead\nor demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.” Id. at 921.8, 9\n         Grinter alleges that defendant White used excessive force in applying the four-point\nrestraints in violation of the Eighth Amendment. He also alleges that defendant Knight\ndiscriminated against him because of his race in violation of his equal protection rights. The district\ncourt summarily dismissed both of these claims because of Grinter’s failure to plead or demonstrate\nthat he had exhausted his administrative remedies. While the district court followed our precedent\nat the time it ruled in dismissing these claims at the screening stage on exhaustion grounds, Jones\noverruled these cases and changed the law. Under Jones, because exhaustion is an affirmative\ndefense, a claim may not be dismissed at the screening stage for failure to plead or attach exhibits\nwith proof of exhaustion. We reverse the dismissal of these claims for failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies and remand the case for further proceedings in light of Jones. See, e.g.,\nDotson v. Corr. Med. Servs., 2007 WL 3230909, at *2 (6th Cir. Nov. 1, 2007) (remanding case to\nthe district court with instructions to evaluate claims prematurely dismissed under Jones and listing\ncases remanding pursuant to Jones).\n\n\n\n         7\n          We may affirm a district court for any reason, including a reason not considered by the district court. Dismas\nCharities, Inc. v. U.S. Dep’t of Justice, 401 F.3d 666, 677 (6th Cir. 2005).\n         8\n           Jones v. Bock overruled Brown v. Toombs, 139 F.3d 1102, 1103-04 (6th Cir. 1998) (holding that the prisoner\nhas the burden of demonstrating he has exhausted his administrative remedies in his complaint), Burton v. Jones, 321\nF.3d 569, 574 (6th Cir. 2003) (holding that the prisoner must exhaust his administrative remedies as to each defendant\nlater sued), and Jones Bey v. Johnson, 407 F.3d 801, 807 (6th Cir. 2005) (holding that the PLRA requires “total\nexhaustion” where an entire action should be dismissed if one claim is not properly exhausted). __ U.S. __, 127 S. Ct.\nat 918-26.\n         9\n            Furthermore, “exhaustion is not per se inadequate simply because an individual later sued was not named in\nthe grievances.” Id. at 923. Finally, if a complaint contains claims that are exhausted and claims that are not exhausted,\nthe district court should proceed with the exhausted claims while dismissing the claims that are not exhausted and should\nnot dismiss the complaint in its entirety. Id. at 923-26.\n\fNo. 05-6755            Grinter v. Knight, et al.                                               Page 9\n\n\n                                                   IV.\n         For the foregoing reasons, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the district\ncourt.\n\f",

A Kentucky prisoner proceeding pro se appeals\nthe district court’s order dismissing his civil rights action brought under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983\nfor violations of due process, equal protection, the Eighth Amendment, and the Fourteenth\nAmendment during a mandatory screening procedure before the complaint was served on the\ndefendants. For the reasons set forth below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\n                                                  I.\n        Henry David Grinter filed a pro se complaint in which he sought relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n§§ 1981 and 1983. He names the following persons as defendants in their individual and official\ncapacities: (1) Sergeant Chad Knight of the Kentucky State Penitentiary, (2) Lieutenant and\nAdjustment Committee Chairman William Henderson of the Kentucky State Penitentiary,\n(3) Lieutenant and Adjustment Committee Member Jay R. Jones of the Kentucky State Penitentiary,\n(4) Case Worker and Adjustment Committee Member Steve Hern of the Kentucky State\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 05-6755                  Grinter v. Knight, et al.                                                            Page 2\n\n\nPenitentiary, (5) Warden Glenn Haeberlin of the Kentucky State Penitentiary, (6) Commissioner\nJohn D. Rees of the Kentucky State Penitentiary, (7) Lieutenant Joel Dunlap, head of Internal\nAffairs at the Kentucky State Penitentiary, (8) Lieutenant Will Thomas, Internal Affairs employee\nat the Kentucky State Penitentiary, and (9) Lieutenant Tim White of the Kentucky State Penitentiary.\nGrinter alleges his claims under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981 and 1983 resulted from violations of his due\nprocess, equal protection, Eighth Amendment, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n        In his complaint, Grinter alleges that on January 3, 2003, Knight came to his cell to\ninvestigate an incident report that had been filed.1 He alleges that Knight presented the report to him\nthrough a food opening in the door of Grinter’s cell in the segregation unit and that Knight refused\nto add witnesses to an incident report in response to his request. After that, Knight closed the slot\nand slipped a copy of the report under the door.\n        Grinter avers that a short time later, White and another guard dressed in full riot gear\napproached his cell without a nurse present. White ordered Grinter to remove his clothes, pinned\nhim to the wall while2 Grinter’s linens and personal property were removed, and placed him under\nfour-point restraints. Grinter remained in the restraints, shackled to his bed, for four hours and\nsustained cuts and bleeding.\n         Grinter alleges that the following day, January 4, 2003, he was issued a disciplinary report\nclaiming he assaulted defendant Knight. The incident report detailing the January 3 incident, which\nwas attached to the complaint, stated that Grinter wadded up and threw the incident report. The\nreport also stated that Grinter struck Knight’s left arm and that Knight had a “small red spot” on his\nwrist. According to the incident report, at a hearing several weeks later the adjustment committee\nfound Grinter guilty. The report states, “Based on facts as stated by Sgt. Knight and [the] medical\nreport from Nurse Roystor . . . Grinter did strike Sgt. Knight[,] causing a red spot on his left wrist.”\nThe adjustment committee assessed a non-restorable penalty of sixty days forfeiture of good time\ncredits.\n       Grinter alleges that he was never provided a copy of any medical records, the testimony\nNurse Roystor gave cannot be true because she did not witness the incident, and J. Belt’s written\nstatement regarding the incident is troubling. Plaintiff appealed to the warden and the state\ndepartment of corrections but was unsuccessful.\n        The district court dismissed the claims against Rees, Haeberlin, Hern, Jones, Henderson,\nThomas, and Dunlap and the due process claims against Knight and White for failure to state a claim\nupon which relief may be granted pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b). It dismissed the claims against\nthe defendants, state employees, in their official capacities as claims against Kentucky – which was\nimmune from suit. It dismissed the substantive due process claims based upon the use of the four-\npoint restraints, the challenge to the procedures used by the adjustment board, and the denial of\ngood-time credits, finding no liberty interest present. Likewise, it dismissed the claims for failure\nto intervene in or overturn the finding of guilt, explaining that the defendants could not be named\non the basis of their supervisory roles and that there was no liberty interest. The district court\ndismissed the § 1981 claim against Knight, holding that Knight, as a public official, cannot be sued\nunder § 1981.\n        The district court dismissed Grinter’s § 1983 claims for violation of his equal protection\nrights against defendant Knight and the Eighth Amendment excessive force claim against defendant\n\n         1\n             The incident report is not specifically identified in the complaint.\n         2\n           Placing an inmate under four-point restraints involves shackling the inmate’s hands and feet to the four corners\nof his bed.\n\fNo. 05-6755             Grinter v.

At the\ndirection of this court, the district court granted Grinter permission to file a late notice of appeal.\nThis appeal followed.\n                                                     II.\n        We review a district court’s decision to dismiss under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1915(e), 1915A , and\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e de novo.

The Prison\nLitigation Reform Act (“PLRA”) requires district courts to screen and dismiss complaints that are\nfrivolous or malicious, that fail to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or that seek\nmonetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief. 28 U.S.C. § 1915A(b).\n                                                     III.\n        Section 1983 provides a private right of action for those persons subject to a deprivation of\nthe “rights, privileges or immunities” guaranteed under the Constitution when that deprivation is\neffected by a person operating “under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage”\nof a governmental entity. 42 U.S.C. § 1983. “[T]he violation of a federally protected right” is\nnecessary for there to be liability against a government official under § 1983.

Due Process\n        We first turn to Grinter’s due process claims. The district court dismissed Grinter’s\nsubstantive due process claims for failure to state a claim. On appeal, Grinter appears to assert that\nthe district court erred.

In contrast, in Wilkinson,\nthe Supreme Court held that prisoners “have a liberty interest in avoiding assignment to [super-\nmaximum security prison].” Wilkinson, 545 U.S. at 224. We have held that a prisoner’s designation\nas a member of a security threat group did not give rise to a liberty interest. Harbin-Bey v.

Grinter had been accused of hitting\na prison guard, Knight, at the time he was placed in the restraints. Furthermore, prison officials\n\n         3\n          While some of these cases discuss procedural, rather than substantive, due process, they are relevant to the\nquestion of when liberty interests arise for incarcerated prisoners.\n\fNo. 05-6755                Grinter v. Knight, et al.                                                               Page 5\n\n\nentered his cell to conduct an investigation. Given the accusation and the presence of the officials\nin Grinter’s cell, as explained above, there was no liberty interest in either freedom from four-point\nrestraints for four hours or in applying the restraints only in the presence of a nurse because the\nrestraints were not an “atypical and significant hardship” in prison life. Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484.\n        The use of the restraints and the absence of a nurse pose a lesser hardship than the thirty-day\nassignment to solitary confinement in Sandin that the Court held did not infringe a liberty interest\nand are significantly less burdensome than the assignment to super-maximum security prison which\nwas found not to infringe any liberty interest in Wilkinson. This situation is more analogous to\nbanning visitors or designating prisoners as a threat, as in Bazzetta and Harbin-Bey, where we found\nthere was no liberty interest. Thus, the Due Process Clause does not give rise to a liberty interest\nin freedom from four-point restraints or in having a nurse arrive before placing an inmate in the\nrestraints.\n        A state may create a liberty interest through a law or regulation establishing freedom from\nrestraint which “imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary\nincidents of prison life.” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 484. Grinter has pointed to no Kentucky law or\nregulation that creates an interest in freedom from four-point restraints or in having a nurse present\nwhen such restraints are applied to a prisoner. Therefore, White did not violate the Due Process\nClause by placing Grinter in four-point restraints for four hours or in attaching the restraints without\na nurse present.\n                         iv.    Adjustment Procedures in the Disciplinary Hearing\n       Grinter alleges a substantive due process violation against Henderson, Jones, and Hern\nbecause they violated policy by failing to provide Grinter with a copy of a medical report, failed to\nquestion Dunlap and Thomas,     failed to make J. Belt available for questioning, and found guilt\nwithout sufficient evidence.4 The district court dismissed each of these claims.\n        The allegations of failing to provide a copy of a medical report, failing to question Dunlap\nand Thomas, and failing to make J. Belt available for questioning appear to allege that defendants\nfailed to follow established procedures. Failing to follow proper procedures is insufficient to\nestablish an infringement of a liberty interest. Olim v. Wakinekona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110921\"><a href=\"/opinion/110921/olim-v-wakinekona/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 250 (1983)\n(“Process is not an end in itself. Its constitutional purpose is to protect a substantive interest to\nwhich the individual has a legitimate claim of entitlement.”). Thus, the substantive due process\nviolation claim fails because the failure to follow procedure and provide Grinter with a medical\nreport, question Dunlap and Thomas, and make J. Belt available for questioning does not infringe\na liberty interest.\n         Thus, even if Grinter had asserted a procedural due process claim against these defendants,\nit also would have failed.

Compliance With the Statute Authorizing Good-Time Credits\n        Grinter alleges a substantive due process violation because Henderson, Jones, and Hern\nviolated the Kentucky good-time credit statute, Kentucky Revised Statute § 197.045, denying him\nthe ability to accumulate sixty days of good-time credits. Grinter had already forfeited 2400 days\nof good-time credit and avers he had no more good-time credit to forfeit at the time he was denied\nthe possibility of accumulating sixty days of good-time credits. The statute provides in part, “The\ndepartment may forfeit any good time previously earned by the prisoner or deny the prisoner the\nright to earn good time in any amount if during the term of imprisonment, a prisoner commits any\noffense or violates the rules of the institution.” Ky. Rev. Stat. § 197.045(1).\n        As “the Due Process Clause itself does not create a liberty interest in credit for good\nbehavior,” Sandin, 515 U.S. at 477, the question is whether the Kentucky statute creates such an\ninterest. A Kentucky inmate “ possesses no inherent constitutional right . . . to accumulate good\ntime credits.” Hopewell v.

Furthermore, “[p]rison\nofficials clearly have discretion under state law to deny a prisoner future good time.” Id. (citing Ky.\nRev. Stat. § 197.045(1)). As there is no right to accumulate good-time credits, Henderson, Jones,\nand Hern did not commit a constitutional violation. Grinter’s substantive due process rights were\nnot violated because of his inability to accumulate good-time credits.\n                           vi.   Supervisory or Administrative Liability\n       The district court dismissed the claims against Haeberlin, Rees, Dunlap, and Thomas for\nmultiple reasons including that Grinter cannot maintain a claim against these defendants in their\nsupervisory capacities.\n        In his complaint, Grinter alleges that Warden Haeberlin and Commissioner Rees violated his\ndue process rights by acting in a supervisory capacity and allowing their employees to violate\nGrinter’s rights and for affirming the finding of guilt. “Because § 1983 liability cannot be imposed\nunder a theory of respondeat superior, proof of personal involvement is required for a supervisor\nto incur personal liability.” Miller v.

If Grinter is alleging\nthat they were acting in a supervisory capacity, the claim fails. See Bellamy, 729 F.2d at 421.\nFurthermore, if the allegation is brought against Dunlap and Thomas for actions they committed for\nfailing to intervene, the claim also fails.

Equal Protection Under § 1981\n        Grinter asserts an equal protection claim against Knight in his official and individual\ncapacities under § 1981 for race5 discrimination. The district court dismissed this equal protection\nclaim for failure to state a claim. Grinter alleges in his complaint that “Defendant Knight subjected\n[him] to cruel [and] unusual punishment for no reason other than he does not like ‘black inmates.’”\n       Section 1981 provides that “[a]ll persons within the jurisdiction of the United States shall\nhave the same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1981(a). The statute defines “make and enforce contracts” to include the “making, performance,\nmodification, and termination of contracts, and the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and\nconditions of the contractual relationship.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(b). The statute elaborates, “The rights\nprotected by this section are protected against impairment by nongovernmental discrimination and\nimpairment under color of State law.” 42 U.S.C. § 1981(c).\n        Section 1981 is unavailable to Grinter as a vehicle to pursue a damages claim against Knight\nin his official capacity. “[T]he express ‘action at law’ provided by § 1983 for the ‘deprivation of\nany rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws,’ provides the exclusive\nfederal damages remedy for the violation of the rights guaranteed by § 1981” when the claim is\nasserted against a state actor in his official capacity.

Grinter, who is\npro se, is held to a less stringent pleading standard than a party with an attorney. Haines v.

May 14, 2000) (“Thus, the less stringent standard for pro se plaintiffs does\nnot compel the courts to conjure up unpleaded facts to support conclusory allegations.”) As Grinter\npleads a legal conclusion without surrounding facts to support the conclusion stated in this claim,\nhe fails to state a claim. We affirm the dismissal of the § 1981 claim.\n                             C.     Failure to Exhaust Administrative Remedies\n        The district court dismissed Grinter’s Eighth Amendment excessive force and equal\nprotection race discrimination claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. On appeal,\nGrinter argues that he had exhausted his administrative remedies as to all claims at the time he filed\nthe complaint.\n       Prisoners must exhaust their administrative remedies before challenging prison conditions.\n42 U.S.C. § 1997e. “There is no question that exhaustion is mandatory under the PLRA and that\nunexhausted claims cannot be brought in court.” Jones v. Bock, 127 S. Ct. at 918-19. Failure to\nexhaust is an affirmative defense under the PLRA, and [ ] inmates are not required to specially plead\nor demonstrate exhaustion in their complaints.” Id. at 921.8, 9\n         Grinter alleges that defendant White used excessive force in applying the four-point\nrestraints in violation of the Eighth Amendment. He also alleges that defendant Knight\ndiscriminated against him because of his race in violation of his equal protection rights. The district\ncourt summarily dismissed both of these claims because of Grinter’s failure to plead or demonstrate\nthat he had exhausted his administrative remedies. While the district court followed our precedent\nat the time it ruled in dismissing these claims at the screening stage on exhaustion grounds, Jones\noverruled these cases and changed the law. Under Jones, because exhaustion is an affirmative\ndefense, a claim may not be dismissed at the screening stage for failure to plead or attach exhibits\nwith proof of exhaustion. We reverse the dismissal of these claims for failure to exhaust\nadministrative remedies and remand the case for further proceedings in light of Jones. See, e.g.,\nDotson v. Corr. Med. Servs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3230909</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *2 (6th Cir. Nov. 1, 2007) (remanding case to\nthe district court with instructions to evaluate claims prematurely dismissed under Jones and listing\ncases remanding pursuant to Jones).\n\n\n\n         7\n          We may affirm a district court for any reason, including a reason not considered by the district court.
