By four issues, which can\n\nbe properly categorized as three, the District argues that the trial court erred in denying its\n\nplea to the jurisdiction because: (1) Garcia failed to present evidence to raise a fact issue\n\nin response to its plea based on the absence of jurisdictional facts; (2) Garcia’s lawsuit was\n\nnot timely filed under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (“TCHRA”), see TEX .\n\fLAB. CODE ANN . § 21.254 (Vernon 2006); and (3) the District is not an “employer” within the\n\ncontext of the TCHRA, and, thus, there is no waiver of sovereign immunity. We affirm in\n\npart and reverse and render in part.\n\n                                            I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Initially, this case involved three terminated school-district employees—Garcia,\n\nMelinda Sotuyo, and Deborah Medina—who filed separate lawsuits against the District and\n\nits superintendent, H.F. “Jackie” Dyer, alleging violations of the TCHRA and various\n\ncommon-law claims.1 See Mission Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Garcia, 166 S.W.3d 902,\n\n903 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi 2005), aff’d in part, rev’d in part, 253 S.W.3d 653 (Tex.\n\n2008). The District filed a plea to the jurisdiction in each case asserting immunity under\n\nsection 101.106 of the Texas Tort Claims Act, and the trial court denied the District’s pleas.\n\nSee TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . § 101.106 (Vernon 2005). On original submission\n\nto this Court, the cases were consolidated. We affirmed the trial court’s denial of the pleas,\n\nconcluding that section 101.106 of the Texas Tort Claims Act did not apply to the\n\nunderlying claims. See Garcia, 166 S.W.3d at 905.\n\n        On further appeal, the supreme court concluded that: (1) the Texas Tort Claims\n\nAct’s election-of-remedies provision governs all lawsuits filed against a governmental unit;\n\n(2) the employees’ common-law claims against the District and the superintendent were\n\nbarred by the Texas Tort Claims Act’s election-of-remedies provision; and (3) the Texas\n\nTort Claims Act’s election scheme did not bar the employees’ recovery under the TCHRA\n\n“because the Legislature has consented to suits against the government under the TCHRA\n\n. . . and a suit that is based on the TCHRA is not one brought under the [Texas] Tort\n\nClaims Act.” Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 654, 660-61 (stating, in particular, that “[w]hile this\n\nCourt has not previously addressed the issue, all the courts of appeals that have\n\nconsidered it have concluded that the TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity,\n\n\n\n        1\n          Garcia filed her original petition on July 2, 2004, asserting wrongful term ination, defam ation,\nnegligent m isrepresentation, and fraudulent m isrepresentation claim s. Sotuyo and Medina are not parties to\nthis appeal. Garcia acknowledges on appeal that Dyer was dism issed from the underlying suit.\n\n                                                     2\n\fand we agree. . . . In this case . . . Garcia’s TCHRA claims against the ISD survive”).\n\n         On remand, the District filed another plea to the jurisdiction2 contending that: (1)\n\nGarcia failed to present evidence to raise a fact issue in response to its plea based on the\n\nabsence of jurisdictional facts; (2) Garcia failed to comply with the notice provisions\n\ncontained in the TCHRA, see TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.254; and (3) the District is not an\n\n“employer” within the context of the TCHRA, and, therefore, the trial court lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over Garcia’s claims. See id. § 21.002(8) (Vernon Supp. 2009). After\n\na hearing, the trial court denied the District’s plea to the jurisdiction. Thereafter, the District\n\nfiled a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court did not issue any\n\nfact findings or conclusions; this accelerated interlocutory appeal ensued. See TEX . R.\n\nAPP. P. 28.1; see also TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM . CODE ANN . §§ 51.014(a)(8) (Vernon 2008),\n\n101.001(3)(B) (Vernon 2005).\n\n                                           II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n         A plea to the jurisdiction is a dilatory plea used to defeat a cause of action without\n\nregard to whether the claims asserted have merit. Bland Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Blue, 34\n\nS.W.3d 547, 554 (Tex. 2000).                  The plea challenges the trial court’s subject matter\n\njurisdiction. Id.; see Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Jones, 8 S.W.3d 636, 638 (Tex. 1999).\n\nWhether a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction and whether the pleader has alleged\n\nfacts that affirmatively demonstrate the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction are questions\n\nof law that we review de novo. Tex. Dep’t of Parks & Wildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d 217,\n\n226 (Tex. 2004); Tex. Natural Res. Conservation Comm’n v. IT-Davy, 74 S.W.3d 849, 855\n\n\n         2\n           W e are com pelled to note that the District’s jurisdictional com plaints raised in the plea to the\njurisdiction at bar could have been raised in the initial plea to the jurisdiction filed in 2004. W hile there appears\nto be no prohibition on such a piecem eal approach, this practice should be discouraged because of the\ninevitable delay and additional expense. See T EX . C IV . P RAC . & R EM . C OD E A N N . § 10.001(1) (Vernon 2002)\n(providing, am ong other things, that “[t]he signing of a pleading or m otion . . . constitutes a certificate by the\nsignatory that to the signatory’s best knowledge, inform ation, and belief, form ed after reasonable inquiry . .\n. the pleading or m otion is not being presented for any im proper purpose, including to harass or to cause\nunnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation . . .”) (em phasis added); see also Columbia\nMed. Ctr. of Las Colinas, Inc. v. Hogue, 271 S.W .3d 238, 258 (Tex. 2008) (Brister, J., concurring) (quoting\nIley v. Hughes, 158 Tex. 362, 311 S.W .2d 648, 651 (1958) (“‘Our courts have always frowned upon piecem eal\ntrials, deem ing the public interest, the interests of litigants[,] and the adm inistration of justice to be better\nserved by rules of trial which avoid a m ultiplicity of suits.’”)); Transp. Ins. Co. v. Moriel, 879 S.W .2d 10, 30 n.29\n(Tex. 1994) (“[W ]e rem ain resolute that piecem eal trials as a general rule should be avoided . . . .”).\n\n                                                          3\n\f(Tex. 2002).\n\n       The plaintiff has the burden to plead facts affirmatively showing that the trial court\n\nhas jurisdiction. Tex. Ass’n of Bus. v. Tex. Air Control Bd., 852 S.W.2d 440, 446 (Tex.\n\n1993); Univ. of N. Tex. v. Harvey, 124 S.W.3d 216, 220 (Tex. App.–Fort Worth 2003, pet.\n\ndenied). We construe the pleadings liberally in favor of the pleader, look to the pleader’s\n\nintent, and accept as true the factual allegations in the pleadings. See Miranda, 133\n\nS.W.3d at 226, 228; City of Fort Worth v. Crockett, 142 S.W.3d 550, 552 (Tex. App.–Fort\n\nWorth 2004, pet. denied). If a plea to the jurisdiction challenges the existence of\n\njurisdictional facts, we consider relevant evidence submitted by the parties when necessary\n\nto resolve the jurisdictional issues raised, as the trial court is required to do, even those\n\nfacts which may implicate the merits of the cause of action. Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 227;\n\nBlue, 34 S.W.3d at 555 (confining evidentiary review to evidence that is relevant to the\n\njurisdictional issue); see City of Waco v. Kirwan, 298 S.W.3d 618, 622 (Tex. 2009).\n\n       A trial court’s review of a plea to the jurisdiction challenging the existence of\n\njurisdictional facts mirrors that of a traditional motion for summary judgment. Miranda, 133\n\nS.W.3d at 228; see TEX . R. CIV. P. 166a(c). The governmental unit is required to meet the\n\nsummary judgment standard of proof for its assertion that the trial court lacks jurisdiction.\n\nMiranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228. Once the governmental unit meets its burden, the plaintiff\n\nis then required to show that there is a disputed material fact regarding the jurisdictional\n\nissue. Id. If the evidence creates a fact question regarding jurisdiction, the trial court must\n\ndeny the plea to the jurisdiction and leave its resolution to the fact finder. Id. at 227-28.\n\nBut, if the evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the jurisdictional issue,\n\nthe trial court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter of law. Id. at 228.\n\n       “In considering this evidence, we ‘take as true all evidence favorable to the\n\nnonmovant’ and ‘indulge every reasonable inference and resolve any doubts in the\n\nnonmovant’s favor.’” Kirwan, 298 S.W.3d at 622 (quoting Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228).\n\nFurther, a defendant cannot simply deny the existence of jurisdictional facts and force the\n\nplaintiff to raise a fact issue. See Johnson v. Brewer & Pritchard, P.C., 73 S.W.3d 193,\n\n                                               4\n\f207 (Tex. 2002); see also County of Cameron v. Brown, 80 S.W.3d 549, 555 (Tex. 2002)\n\n(“In deciding a plea to the jurisdiction, a court may not weigh the claims’ merits but must\n\nconsider only the plaintiffs’ pleadings and evidence pertinent to the jurisdictional inquiry.”).\n\n                                       III. DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Whether Garcia Failed to Raise a Fact Issue as to Jurisdictional Facts\n\n       In its first issue, the District contends that Garcia presented no evidence to raise a\n\nfact issue in response to its plea to the jurisdiction based on the absence of jurisdictional\n\nfacts. The District argues that it conclusively disproved essential elements of each of\n\nGarcia’s causes of action based on the evidence it presented to the trial court. Garcia\n\ncounters that her pleadings sufficiently invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial\n\ncourt and that the trial court’s denial of the District’s plea to the jurisdiction was proper\n\nbecause the District is attempting to resolve the underlying merits of the case, which is an\n\ninappropriate use of a plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n       In her original petition, Garcia noted that she first began working for the District in\n\nOctober 1976, and “performed all the duties assigned to her with loyalty, dedication[,] and\n\nhard work.” However, on or about February 19, 2003, she was “wrongfully discharged by\n\na management employee of [the District] for illegal and discriminatory reasons, including,\n\nbut not limited to, participating in an investigation involving another district employee . . .\n\nand for exercising her protected right to freedom of association.” Garcia further alleged\n\nthat “she was discriminated against by the Defendant School District due to her race and\n\nnational origin, namely—Hispanic/Mexican-American descent, gender—female, and due\n\nto her age, 48 (d.o.b.—06/15/1954)” and that “her termination was part of a larger unwritten\n\nplan or scheme of the Defendant School District to discriminate against older Hispanic\n\nfemale employees who were politically associated with persons adverse to the\n\nAdministration.” Garcia also stated that “there was no legitimate business justification for\n\nher termination” because she “had always performed a satisfactory job for the Defendant\n\nduring her employment,” that “there was work available and there continues to be work\n\navailable which [Garcia] could perform,” and that she had fulfilled all statutory prerequisites\n\n                                               5\n\fbefore filing this action.\n\n       In response to Garcia’s original petition, the District filed a plea to the jurisdiction\n\nchallenging Garcia’s jurisdictional facts. The District argued that the trial court lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction over Garcia’s discrimination claims because the employee\n\nselected to replace Garcia is of the same gender, national origin, and race and is three\n\nyears older than Garcia. The District further argued that the trial court did not have subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over Garcia’s retaliation claim because she “did not participate in an\n\ninvestigation related to a claim brought pursuant to Chapter 21 [of the labor code].”\n\n       At the hearing on the District’s plea to the jurisdiction, two affidavits were admitted\n\nas part of the District’s evidence. The first affidavit was executed by Rebecca Morrison,\n\nthe Director of Human Resources for the District, who averred that: (1) she had reviewed\n\nGarcia’s employment records; (2) Garcia had served as “one of two Community/Home\n\nSchool Liaisons for Veterans Memorial High School”; and (3) the next person hired to fill\n\nthat position was Zoila Longoria. The second affidavit, executed by Longoria, provided\n\nthat: (1) Longoria’s birthday is April 14, 1951; (2) she is Hispanic; (3) she is a female; and\n\n(4) her national origin is Mexican-American. The District did not present any evidence\n\npertinent to Garcia’s retaliation claim.\n\n       1.      Applicable Law\n\n       The TCHRA prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way\n\ndiscriminating against an employee because of the employee’s race, color, disability,\n\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age. TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051 (Vernon 2006).\n\nSpecifically, section 21.051 of the labor code provides the following:\n\n       An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race,\n       color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n       (1)     fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n               discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection\n               with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\n               employment; or\n\n       (2)     limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n               employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an\n               individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any\n\n                                              6\n\f              other manner the status of an employee.\n\nId. The TCHRA also prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against an\n\nemployee who engages in certain protected activities under chapter 21 of the labor code.\n\nId. § 21.055 (Vernon 2006). In enacting the TCHRA, the Legislature intended to correlate\n\nstate law with federal law with respect to employment discrimination; therefore, we look to\n\nfederal law in interpreting provisions of the TCHRA. See M.D. Anderson Hosp. & Tumor\n\nInst. v. Willrich, 28 S.W.3d 22, 24 (Tex. 2000); NME Hosps., Inc. v. Rennels, 994 S.W.2d\n\n142, 144 (Tex. 1999).\n\n       In order to properly invoke the TCHRA’s limited waiver of governmental immunity,\n\nGarcia must have shown a prima facie case of discrimination or retaliation as provided\n\nunder that statute. See TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051. Accordingly, the trial court’s subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction will be defeated if the District can conclusively negate any element of\n\nGarcia’s prima facie case of discrimination under the TCHRA. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d\n\nat 228 (requiring governmental unit, in asserting a plea to the jurisdiction, to meet the\n\nsummary judgment standard of proof); Randall’s Food Mkts. v. Johnson, 891 S.W.2d 640,\n\n644 (Tex. 1995) (“A defendant who conclusively negates at least one of the essential\n\nelements of a cause of action is entitled to summary judgment as to that cause of action.”).\n\nWe now review the evidence submitted to resolve the jurisdictional issues, with respect to\n\neach of Garcia’s claims, as the trial court was required to do. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d\n\nat 227; Blue, 34 S.W.3d at 555.\n\n       2.     Analysis\n\n              a.     Age Discrimination\n\n       To establish a prima facie case of age discrimination, a plaintiff must show: (1) that\n\nshe was discharged; (2) that she was qualified for the position; (3) that she was in the\n\nprotected class at the time of her discharge; and (4) that she was replaced by someone\n\noutside the protected class or by someone younger, or otherwise show that she was\n\ndischarged because of age. Tex. Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 252\n\n(1981); Bienkowski v. Am. Airlines, 851 F.2d 1503, 1505 (5th Cir. 1988); Stanley Stores,\n\n                                              7\n\fInc. v. Chavana, 909 S.W.2d 554, 559 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi 1995, writ denied);\n\nAdams v. Valley Fed. Credit Union, 848 S.W.2d 182, 186 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi 1992,\n\nwrit denied).\n\n       The District submitted evidence that the person next hired to fill Garcia’s position\n\nwas three years older than Garcia. Garcia did not offer any controverting evidence. The\n\nDistrict argues that Garcia failed to create a fact issue that she was replaced by someone\n\noutside the protected class or by someone younger and that she, therefore, failed to\n\nestablish the fourth element of her prima facie case. We agree that Garcia did not create\n\na fact issue with regard to her age or Longoria’s age. However, undisputed evidence of\n\nthe ages of the respective individuals is not, in and of itself, dispositive of Garcia’s claim.\n\nGarcia could establish the fourth element of a prima facie age discrimination claim by\n\nshowing that she was terminated because of her age, regardless of whether she was\n\nreplaced by someone younger. See Bienkowski, 851 F.2d at 1504-05; Adams, 848\n\nS.W.2d at 186 (stating that the fourth element of a prima facie age discrimination claim is\n\n“that [plaintiff] was replaced by someone outside the protected class, or by someone\n\nyounger or otherwise show that she was discharged because of age” (emphasis added));\n\nsee also O’Connor v. Consol. Coin Caterers Corp., 517 U.S. 308, 312 (1996) (holding, in\n\nthe context of an age discrimination claim under the federal Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act, that whether “one member of the protected class lost out to another\n\nmember is irrelevant, so long as he lost out because of his age”).\n\n       In Garcia’s original petition, she alleged she was discriminated against by the District\n\n“due to her age” and that “her termination was part of a larger unwritten plan or scheme of\n\nthe Defendant School District to discriminate against older Hispanic female employees who\n\nwere politically associated with persons adverse to the Administration.” The District did not\n\nbring forth evidence challenging Garcia’s claim that she was terminated due to her age\n\n\n\n\n                                              8\n\fother than to show that she was replaced by an older employee.3 Under the applicable law\n\nregarding age discrimination claims, that proof was not sufficient to conclusively negate the\n\nfourth element of Garcia’s age discrimination claim. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228;\n\nRandall’s Food Mkts., 891 S.W.2d at 644. Accordingly, the trial court was correct to rely\n\non Garcia’s pleadings—including her broad assertion that she was discriminated against\n\n“due to her age”—and to deny the District’s plea as to Garcia’s age discrimination claim.\n\nSee Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228. The District’s issue as to Garcia’s age discrimination\n\nclaim is overruled.\n\n                 b.       Sex, National Origin and Race Discrimination\n\n        To establish a prima facie case of wrongful discharge based on sex, national origin\n\nor race discrimination, Garcia was required to show that: (1) she is a member of a\n\nprotected class; (2) she was qualified for the position that she held before being\n\ndischarged; (3) she was discharged; and (4) her employer filled the position with a person\n\nwho is not a member of the protected class.

See Bienkowski v. Am. Airlines, 851\nF.2d 1503, 1504-05 (5th Cir. 1988); Stanley Stores, Inc. v. Chavana, 909 S.W .2d 554, 559 (Tex. App.–Corpus\nChristi 1995, writ denied); Adams v. Valley Fed. Credit Union, 848 S.W .2d 182, 186 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi\n1992, writ denied). At that point, the burden would have shifted to Garcia to bring forth evidence to create a\nfact issue as to her prim a facie case in order to avoid dism issal for lack of subject m atter jurisdiction. See\nTex. Dep't of Parks & W ildlife v. Miranda, 133 S.W .3d 217, 228 (Tex. 2004).\n        4\n           A plaintiff m ay also prove a prim a facie case of sex and national origin or race discrim ination by\nshowing that: (1) she is a m em ber of a protected class; (2) she was qualified for her position; and (3) persons\noutside of the class were treated m ore favorably. Johnson v. Hoechst Celanese Corp., 127 S.W .3d 875, 880\nn.4 (Tex. App.–Corpus Christi 2004, no pet.) (citing Harvey v. Chevron U.S.A., Inc., 961 F. Supp. 1017, 1026\n(S.D. Tex. 1997)) (sex discrim ination); Greathouse v. Alvin Indep. Sch. Dist., 17 S.W .3d 419, 423 (Tex.\nApp.–Houston [1st. Dist.] 2000, no pet.) (national origin and race discrim ination). Here, Garcia’s original\npetition did not specifically assert that persons outside of her protected class were treated m ore favorably.\n\n                                                       9\n\fpresented undisputed evidence to the trial court that Garcia was replaced by a Hispanic\n\nfemale of Mexican descent; that is, she was replaced by a member of the protected class.5\n\nBecause Garcia did not submit any evidence creating a fact issue as to this element, the\n\ntrial court should have granted the District’s plea to the jurisdiction as to Garcia’s sex,\n\nnational origin, and race discrimination claims. See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228 (stating\n\nthat “if the relevant evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the\n\njurisdictional issue, the trial court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter of law”).\n\nThe District’s issue as to Garcia’s sex, national origin, and race discrimination claims is\n\ntherefore sustained.\n\n                 c.       Retaliation\n\n        Section 21.055 of the labor code establishes that an employer commits an unlawful\n\nemployment practice if the employer retaliates or discriminates against a person who files\n\na charge of discrimination. See TEX . LABOR CODE ANN . § 21.055 (Vernon 2006). In an\n\naction arising under chapter 21 of the labor code, the plaintiff must first make a prima facie\n\nshowing that: (1) she engaged in a protected activity; (2) an adverse employment action\n\noccurred, and (3) a causal link existed between the protected activity and the adverse\n\naction. Dias v. Goodman Mfg. Co., L.P., 214 S.W.3d 672, 676 (Tex. App.–Houston [14th\n\nDist.] 2000, pet. denied); Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Lane, 31 S.W.3d 282, 295 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Corpus Christi 2000, pet. denied). Under the statute, an employee engages in a\n\nprotected activity only if the employee, under chapter 21 of the labor code: (1) opposes\n\na discriminatory practice; (2) makes or files a charge; (3) files a complaint; or (4) testifies,\n\nassists, or participates in any manner in an investigation, proceeding or hearing. TEX .\n\n\n\nAccordingly, she was required to show that her em ployer filled her position with a person outside of her\nprotected class. See Raggs v. Miss. Power & Light Co., 278 F.3d 463, 468 (5th Cir. 2002); Okoye v. Univ.\nof Tex. Houston Health Sci. Ctr., 245 F.3d 507, 512-13 (5th Cir. 2001).\n         5\n           The fourth elem ent of a prim a facie sex, national origin or race discrim ination claim can only be\nsatisfied with a showing that the plaintiff was replaced by a person who is not a m em ber of the protected class.\nSee Raggs, 278 F.3d at 468; Okoye, 245 F.3d at 512-13. This stands in contrast to the law regarding age\ndiscrim ination claim s, where the corresponding elem ent m ay be satisfied by a showing that the plaintiff was\n“otherwise” discrim inated against due to age, even if the replacem ent was older than the plaintiff. See\nBienkowski, 851 F.2d at 1504-05; Chavana, 909 S.W .2d at 559; Adams, 848 S.W .2d at 186.\n\n                                                       10\n\fLABOR CODE ANN . § 21.055.\n\n       In her original petition, Garcia alleged that she suffered retaliation in the form of\n\nwrongful discharge for “participating in an investigation involving another district employee,\n\nnamely Mona Parras[,] and for exercising her protected right to freedom of association.”\n\nThe District claims that Garcia’s pleadings are insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court\n\nbecause she merely alleged participation in “an investigation.” According to the District,\n\n“this is not enough because the investigation that is at issue must be one that is brought\n\nunder Texas Labor Code Chapter 21.” See id. The District further claims on appeal that\n\nGarcia “judicially admitted that the only Chapter 21 investigation that is related to her case\n\nwas her own claim with the Texas Commission on Human Rights” which she initiated on\n\nOctober 10, 2003, almost eight months after her termination. It argues that “it is logically\n\nimpossible that she was terminated because of something that happened 8 months after\n\nher termination.”\n\n       We agree with the District that the protected activity at issue must fall within the\n\nscope of chapter 21. See id. (prefacing list of protected activities with “under this chapter”);\n\nDias, 214 S.W.3d at 681. However, we do not agree with the District’s representation of\n\nthe record.   Nowhere in Garcia’s petition does she admit that the only chapter 21\n\ninvestigation in which she participated was her own. While it is true that Garcia’s pleading\n\nis vague, and could perhaps be the subject of special exceptions, the District did not submit\n\nany evidence to challenge Garcia’s allegation that she personally participated in the Parras\n\ninvestigation. Moreover, although Garcia generally pleaded retaliation based on her\n\nparticipation in “an investigation,” she did reference section 21.055 of the labor code later\n\nin her pleadings, thus suggesting that the investigation in which she participated was\n\nindeed brought under labor code chapter 21. We conclude that Garcia’s pleadings alleged\n\nsufficient facts to support the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction over her retaliation\n\nclaim. The District’s issue as to Garcia’s retaliation claim is overruled.\n\nB.     Whether Garcia Complied With Labor Code Section 21.254\n\n       By its second issue, the District asserts that Garcia failed to comply with the\n\n                                              11\n\fmandatory and jurisdictional notice requirements contained in the TCHRA. See TEX . LAB.\n\nCODE ANN . § 21.254. Garcia contends that she filed suit within the sixty-day deadline\n\nimposed by the TCHRA and that she exercised due diligence in serving the District with\n\nnotice of her lawsuit.\n\n        The TCHRA provides that an employee must file suit within sixty days of receiving\n\na right-to-sue letter from the civil rights division of the Texas Workforce Commission. See\n\nTEX . LAB . CODE ANN . § 21.254. Although the Texas Supreme Court has not directly\n\naddressed whether this sixty-day filing period is jurisdictional, the Court recently concluded\n\nthat a different TCHRA provision, allowing a two-year period for a complainant to file suit\n\nafter initially making the complaint, see id. § 22.256 (Vernon 2006), is “mandatory but not\n\njurisdictional.” In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, No. 07-0871, 2010 Tex. LEXIS 282, at *24\n\n(Tex. Mar. 26, 2010) (overruling Schroeder v. Tex. Iron Works, Inc., 813 S.W.2d 483, 487\n\nn.10 (Tex. 1991) (holding that the time period for filing a TCHRA lawsuit is “mandatory and\n\njurisdictional.”)). The Court noted that, absent “clear legislative intent to the contrary,” we\n\nmust presume “that the Legislature did not intend to make the [provision] jurisdictional.”\n\nId. at *16 (quoting City of DeSoto v. White, 288 S.W.3d 389, 394 (Tex. 2009)).6 In the case\n\nof section 22.256's two-year deadline for filing suit after the initial complaint, “the statute\n\ndoes not indicate that the provision is jurisdictional or that the consequence of\n\nnoncompliance is dismissal.” Id. at *18. The Court further noted that “[o]ne of the primary\n\ngoals of the statute is to coordinate state law with federal law in the area of employment\n\ndiscrimination,” id. at *19 (quoting Vielma v. Eureka Co., 218 F.3d 458, 462 (5th Cir.\n\n2000)), and that “[t]he United States Supreme Court has consistently construed [the]\n\nrequirements [of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964] as mandatory but not\n\njurisdictional.” Id. at *20 (citing Arbaugh v. Y&H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 516 (2006); Irwin v.\n\n\n          6\n            The Court also noted that, in Dubai Petroleum Co. v. Kazi, 12 S.W .3d 71, 76 (Tex. 2000), it observed\nthat “[t]he classification of a m atter as one of jurisdiction . . . opens the way to m aking judgm ents vulnerable\nto delayed attack for a variety of irregularities that perhaps better ought to be sealed in a judgm ent” and that\n“the m odern direction of policy is to reduce the vulnerability of final judgm ents to attack on the ground that the\ntribunal lacked subject m atter jurisdiction.” In re United Servs. Auto. Ass’n, No. 07-0871, 2010 Tex. LEXIS\n282, at *12-13 (Tex. Mar. 26, 2010) (quoting Dubai, 12 S.W .3d at 76).\n\n                                                        12\n\fDep’t of Veterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 95-96 (1990); Crown, Cork & Seal Co., Inc. v.\n\nParker, 462 U.S. 345, 349 n.3 (1983); Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385,\n\n393 (1982)).\n\n         The same reasoning holds here. Section 21.254 does not explicitly say that failure\n\nto comply with the sixty-day deadline for a complainant to file suit after receiving a right-to-\n\nsue letter compels dismissal of the complainant’s suit or deprives the trial court of\n\njurisdiction. See TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.254.7 We therefore conclude that the sixty-day\n\nfiling period contained in section 21.254 of the TCHRA is mandatory but not jurisdictional.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the District’s plea to the jurisdiction on this\n\nbasis.8 The District’s second issue is overruled.\n\nC.       Whether the District is an “Employer” Under Labor Code Chapter 21\n\n         In its third issue, the District argues that it is not subject to the waiver of immunity\n\ncontained in chapter 21 of the labor code because it is a school district and not an\n\n“employer.” See TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.002(8).\n\n         The Texas Supreme Court held that immunity is waived as to a school district under\n\nchapter 21 of the labor code. See Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 660; see also Copperas Cove\n\n\n         7\n          Several other courts have directly considered the sixty-day lim it provided in section 22.254 and have\nconcluded that the requirem ent is not jurisdictional. See Tex. Dep’t of Transp. v. Beckner, 74 S.W .3d 98, 103\n(Tex. App.–W aco 2002, no pet.); Middleton v. Gould, 952 F. Supp. 435, 438 (S.D. Tex. 1996); Corner v. Gates\nof Cedar Hill, No. 3-00-CV-2499-N, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16944, at *6-7 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 9, 2002)); see also\nW indle v. Mary Kay, Inc., No. 05-02-00252-CV, 2003 Tex. App. LEXIS 5594, at *4 (Tex. App.–Dallas July 1,\n2003, pet. denied) (m em . op.).\n         8\n            The District argues that Garcia’s alleged failure to notify the District of her suit within the sixty-day\nfiling period deprived the trial court of subject m atter jurisdiction, considering section 311.034 of the\ngovernm ent code provides that “[s]tatutory prerequisites to a suit, including the provision of notice, are\njurisdictional requirem ents in all suits against a governm ental entity.” See T EX . G O V ’T C OD E A N N . § 311.034\n(Vernon Supp. 2009). However, the language referenced by the District was not included in the version of\nsection 311.034 that was in effect when Garcia filed suit on July 2, 2004. See Act of June 15, 2001, 77th Leg.,\nR.S., ch. 1158, § 8, 2001 T EX . G EN . L AW S 2374, 2433 (am ended 2005) (current version at T EX . G O V ’T C O DE\nA N N . § 311.034). In fact, the predecessor to section 311.034 provided the following:\n\n         In order to preserve the legislature’s interest in m anaging state fiscal m atters through the\n         appropriations process, a statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign im m unity\n         unless the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language. In a statute, the use of\n         “person” as defined by Section 311.005 to include governm ental entities does not indicate\n         legislative intent to waive sovereign im m unity unless the context of the statute indicates no\n         other reasonable construction.\n\nId. Because the predecessor to section 311.034 is silent as to statutory prerequisites and jurisdictional\nrequirem ents, we are not persuaded by the District’s argum ent.\n\n                                                         13\n\fIndep. Sch. Dist. v. Brown, No. 10-09-00047-CV, 2009 Tex. App. LEXIS 9814, at *1-2 (Tex.\n\nApp.–Waco Dec. 30, 2009, no pet.) (mem. op.) (rejecting a school district’s argument that\n\nschool districts are not “employers” as defined by Chapter 21, and therefore, immunity is\n\nnot waived). On appeal, the District essentially asks us to reconsider the supreme court’s\n\nresolution of this issue.\n\n         We first note that the “law of the case” doctrine requires that “questions of law\n\ndecided on appeal to a court of last resort will govern the case throughout its subsequent\n\nstages.” Hudson v. Wakefield, 711 S.W.2d 628, 630 (Tex. 1986). Furthermore, this Court\n\nis bound to follow the supreme court’s resolution of this issue. See Lubbock County v.\n\nTrammel’s Lubbock Bail Bonds, 80 S.W.3d 580, 585 (Tex. 2002) (“It is not the function of\n\na court of appeals to abrogate or modify established precedent. . . . That function lies\n\nsolely with this Court. . . . Generally, the doctrine of stare decisis dictates that once the\n\nSupreme Court announces a proposition of law, the decision is considered binding\n\nprecedent.”).\n\n         The District argues that Garcia is not the “law of the case” because the specific\n\nissue of whether a school district is immune under the TCHRA was never fully briefed or\n\nargued. It further argues that the supreme court’s more recent decision in Harris County\n\nHospital District v. Tomball Regional Hospital calls Garcia into question. See 283 S.W.3d\n\n838 (Tex. 2009). We are unpersuaded by these arguments. Notwithstanding the lack of\n\nbriefing or argument, the supreme court considered the waiver issue9 and concluded that\n\nthe “TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity.” Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 660.\n\nThus, we must conclude that the definition of “employer” in chapter 21 of the labor code\n\nincludes school districts, and therefore, immunity is waived.10 Accordingly, we overrule the\n\n        9\n          “Here, Garcia alleges that the Legislature waived the ISD’s im m unity in the TCHRA.” Garcia, 253\nS.W .3d at 660.\n          10\n             W e also note that the District, in arguing that it is not an “em ployer” within the context of chapter\n21 of the labor code, argues that it is neither a “political subdivision” of the State of Texas nor a “state\ninstrum entality.” If this were true, then, in reconciling chapter 21 of the labor code with section 51.014 of the\ncivil practice and rem edies code (the statute authorizing certain interlocutory appeals), the District would not\nbe entitled to appeal the trial court’s interlocutory order in this case.

By four issues, which can\n\nbe properly categorized as three, the District argues that the trial court erred in denying its\n\nplea to the jurisdiction because: (1) Garcia failed to present evidence to raise a fact issue\n\nin response to its plea based on the absence of jurisdictional facts; (2) Garcia’s lawsuit was\n\nnot timely filed under the Texas Commission on Human Rights Act (“TCHRA”), see TEX .\n\fLAB. CODE ANN . § 21.254 (Vernon 2006); and (3) the District is not an “employer” within the\n\ncontext of the TCHRA, and, thus, there is no waiver of sovereign immunity. We affirm in\n\npart and reverse and render in part.\n\n                                            I. BACKGROUND\n\n        Initially, this case involved three terminated school-district employees—Garcia,\n\nMelinda Sotuyo, and Deborah Medina—who filed separate lawsuits against the District and\n\nits superintendent, H.F. “Jackie” Dyer, alleging violations of the TCHRA and various\n\ncommon-law claims.1 See Mission Consol.

The District filed a plea to the jurisdiction in each case asserting immunity under\n\nsection 101.106 of the Texas Tort Claims Act, and the trial court denied the District’s pleas.\n\nSee TEX . CIV.

We affirmed the trial court’s denial of the pleas,\n\nconcluding that section 101.106 of the Texas Tort Claims Act did not apply to the\n\nunderlying claims. See Garcia, 166 S.W.3d at 905.\n\n        On further appeal, the supreme court concluded that: (1) the Texas Tort Claims\n\nAct’s election-of-remedies provision governs all lawsuits filed against a governmental unit;\n\n(2) the employees’ common-law claims against the District and the superintendent were\n\nbarred by the Texas Tort Claims Act’s election-of-remedies provision; and (3) the Texas\n\nTort Claims Act’s election scheme did not bar the employees’ recovery under the TCHRA\n\n“because the Legislature has consented to suits against the government under the TCHRA\n\n. . . and a suit that is based on the TCHRA is not one brought under the [Texas] Tort\n\nClaims Act.” Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 654, 660-61 (stating, in particular, that “[w]hile this\n\nCourt has not previously addressed the issue, all the courts of appeals that have\n\nconsidered it have concluded that the TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity,\n\n\n\n        1\n          Garcia filed her original petition on July 2, 2004, asserting wrongful term ination, defam ation,\nnegligent m isrepresentation, and fraudulent m isrepresentation claim s.

Garcia’s TCHRA claims against the ISD survive”).\n\n         On remand, the District filed another plea to the jurisdiction2 contending that: (1)\n\nGarcia failed to present evidence to raise a fact issue in response to its plea based on the\n\nabsence of jurisdictional facts; (2) Garcia failed to comply with the notice provisions\n\ncontained in the TCHRA, see TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.254; and (3) the District is not an\n\n“employer” within the context of the TCHRA, and, therefore, the trial court lacked subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over Garcia’s claims. See id. § 21.002(8) (Vernon Supp. 2009). After\n\na hearing, the trial court denied the District’s plea to the jurisdiction. Thereafter, the District\n\nfiled a request for findings of fact and conclusions of law. The trial court did not issue any\n\nfact findings or conclusions; this accelerated interlocutory appeal ensued. See TEX . R.\n\nAPP. P. 28.1; see also TEX . CIV. PRAC . & REM .

DISCUSSION\n\nA.     Whether Garcia Failed to Raise a Fact Issue as to Jurisdictional Facts\n\n       In its first issue, the District contends that Garcia presented no evidence to raise a\n\nfact issue in response to its plea to the jurisdiction based on the absence of jurisdictional\n\nfacts. The District argues that it conclusively disproved essential elements of each of\n\nGarcia’s causes of action based on the evidence it presented to the trial court. Garcia\n\ncounters that her pleadings sufficiently invoke the subject matter jurisdiction of the trial\n\ncourt and that the trial court’s denial of the District’s plea to the jurisdiction was proper\n\nbecause the District is attempting to resolve the underlying merits of the case, which is an\n\ninappropriate use of a plea to the jurisdiction.\n\n       In her original petition, Garcia noted that she first began working for the District in\n\nOctober 1976, and “performed all the duties assigned to her with loyalty, dedication[,] and\n\nhard work.” However, on or about February 19, 2003, she was “wrongfully discharged by\n\na management employee of [the District] for illegal and discriminatory reasons, including,\n\nbut not limited to, participating in an investigation involving another district employee . . .\n\nand for exercising her protected right to freedom of association.” Garcia further alleged\n\nthat “she was discriminated against by the Defendant School District due to her race and\n\nnational origin, namely—Hispanic/Mexican-American descent, gender—female, and due\n\nto her age, 48 (d.o.b.—06/15/1954)” and that “her termination was part of a larger unwritten\n\nplan or scheme of the Defendant School District to discriminate against older Hispanic\n\nfemale employees who were politically associated with persons adverse to the\n\nAdministration.” Garcia also stated that “there was no legitimate business justification for\n\nher termination” because she “had always performed a satisfactory job for the Defendant\n\nduring her employment,” that “there was work available and there continues to be work\n\navailable which [Garcia] could perform,” and that she had fulfilled all statutory prerequisites\n\n                                               5\n\fbefore filing this action.\n\n       In response to Garcia’s original petition, the District filed a plea to the jurisdiction\n\nchallenging Garcia’s jurisdictional facts. The District argued that the trial court lacked\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction over Garcia’s discrimination claims because the employee\n\nselected to replace Garcia is of the same gender, national origin, and race and is three\n\nyears older than Garcia. The District further argued that the trial court did not have subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction over Garcia’s retaliation claim because she “did not participate in an\n\ninvestigation related to a claim brought pursuant to Chapter 21 [of the labor code].”\n\n       At the hearing on the District’s plea to the jurisdiction, two affidavits were admitted\n\nas part of the District’s evidence. The first affidavit was executed by Rebecca Morrison,\n\nthe Director of Human Resources for the District, who averred that: (1) she had reviewed\n\nGarcia’s employment records; (2) Garcia had served as “one of two Community/Home\n\nSchool Liaisons for Veterans Memorial High School”; and (3) the next person hired to fill\n\nthat position was Zoila Longoria. The second affidavit, executed by Longoria, provided\n\nthat: (1) Longoria’s birthday is April 14, 1951; (2) she is Hispanic; (3) she is a female; and\n\n(4) her national origin is Mexican-American. The District did not present any evidence\n\npertinent to Garcia’s retaliation claim.\n\n       1.      Applicable Law\n\n       The TCHRA prohibits an employer from discharging or in any other way\n\ndiscriminating against an employee because of the employee’s race, color, disability,\n\nreligion, sex, national origin, or age. TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051 (Vernon 2006).\n\nSpecifically, section 21.051 of the labor code provides the following:\n\n       An employer commits an unlawful employment practice if because of race,\n       color, disability, religion, sex, national origin, or age the employer:\n\n       (1)     fails or refuses to hire an individual, discharges an individual, or\n               discriminates in any other manner against an individual in connection\n               with compensation or the terms, conditions, or privileges of\n               employment; or\n\n       (2)     limits, segregates, or classifies an employee or applicant for\n               employment in a manner that would deprive or tend to deprive an\n               individual of any employment opportunity or adversely affect in any\n\n                                              6\n\f              other manner the status of an employee.\n\nId. The TCHRA also prohibits employers from retaliating or discriminating against an\n\nemployee who engages in certain protected activities under chapter 21 of the labor code.\n\nId. § 21.055 (Vernon 2006). In enacting the TCHRA, the Legislature intended to correlate\n\nstate law with federal law with respect to employment discrimination; therefore, we look to\n\nfederal law in interpreting provisions of the TCHRA.

Willrich, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1755090\"><a href=\"/opinion/1755090/md-anderson-hosp-tumor-inst-v-willrich/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 24 (Tex. 2000); NME Hosps., Inc. v.

See TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.051. Accordingly, the trial court’s subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction will be defeated if the District can conclusively negate any element of\n\nGarcia’s prima facie case of discrimination under the TCHRA.

Garcia did not offer any controverting evidence. The\n\nDistrict argues that Garcia failed to create a fact issue that she was replaced by someone\n\noutside the protected class or by someone younger and that she, therefore, failed to\n\nestablish the fourth element of her prima facie case. We agree that Garcia did not create\n\na fact issue with regard to her age or Longoria’s age. However, undisputed evidence of\n\nthe ages of the respective individuals is not, in and of itself, dispositive of Garcia’s claim.\n\nGarcia could establish the fourth element of a prima facie age discrimination claim by\n\nshowing that she was terminated because of her age, regardless of whether she was\n\nreplaced by someone younger. See Bienkowski, 851 F.2d at 1504-05; Adams, 848\n\nS.W.2d at 186 (stating that the fourth element of a prima facie age discrimination claim is\n\n“that [plaintiff] was replaced by someone outside the protected class, or by someone\n\nyounger or otherwise show that she was discharged because of age” (emphasis added));\n\nsee also O’Connor v.

See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228;\n\nRandall’s Food Mkts., 891 S.W.2d at 644. Accordingly, the trial court was correct to rely\n\non Garcia’s pleadings—including her broad assertion that she was discriminated against\n\n“due to her age”—and to deny the District’s plea as to Garcia’s age discrimination claim.\n\nSee Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228.

Sex, National Origin and Race Discrimination\n\n        To establish a prima facie case of wrongful discharge based on sex, national origin\n\nor race discrimination, Garcia was required to show that: (1) she is a member of a\n\nprotected class; (2) she was qualified for the position that she held before being\n\ndischarged; (3) she was discharged; and (4) her employer filled the position with a person\n\nwho is not a member of the protected class.

See Miranda, 133 S.W.3d at 228 (stating\n\nthat “if the relevant evidence is undisputed or fails to raise a fact question on the\n\njurisdictional issue, the trial court rules on the plea to the jurisdiction as a matter of law”).\n\nThe District’s issue as to Garcia’s sex, national origin, and race discrimination claims is\n\ntherefore sustained.\n\n                 c.

This stands in contrast to the law regarding age\ndiscrim ination claim s, where the corresponding elem ent m ay be satisfied by a showing that the plaintiff was\n“otherwise” discrim inated against due to age, even if the replacem ent was older than the plaintiff. See\nBienkowski, 851 F.2d at 1504-05; Chavana, 909 S.W .2d at 559; Adams, 848 S.W .2d at 186.\n\n                                                       10\n\fLABOR CODE ANN . § 21.055.\n\n       In her original petition, Garcia alleged that she suffered retaliation in the form of\n\nwrongful discharge for “participating in an investigation involving another district employee,\n\nnamely Mona Parras[,] and for exercising her protected right to freedom of association.”\n\nThe District claims that Garcia’s pleadings are insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the court\n\nbecause she merely alleged participation in “an investigation.” According to the District,\n\n“this is not enough because the investigation that is at issue must be one that is brought\n\nunder Texas Labor Code Chapter 21.” See id. The District further claims on appeal that\n\nGarcia “judicially admitted that the only Chapter 21 investigation that is related to her case\n\nwas her own claim with the Texas Commission on Human Rights” which she initiated on\n\nOctober 10, 2003, almost eight months after her termination. It argues that “it is logically\n\nimpossible that she was terminated because of something that happened 8 months after\n\nher termination.”\n\n       We agree with the District that the protected activity at issue must fall within the\n\nscope of chapter 21. See id. (prefacing list of protected activities with “under this chapter”);\n\nDias, 214 S.W.3d at 681. However, we do not agree with the District’s representation of\n\nthe record.   Nowhere in Garcia’s petition does she admit that the only chapter 21\n\ninvestigation in which she participated was her own. While it is true that Garcia’s pleading\n\nis vague, and could perhaps be the subject of special exceptions, the District did not submit\n\nany evidence to challenge Garcia’s allegation that she personally participated in the Parras\n\ninvestigation. Moreover, although Garcia generally pleaded retaliation based on her\n\nparticipation in “an investigation,” she did reference section 21.055 of the labor code later\n\nin her pleadings, thus suggesting that the investigation in which she participated was\n\nindeed brought under labor code chapter 21. We conclude that Garcia’s pleadings alleged\n\nsufficient facts to support the trial court’s subject matter jurisdiction over her retaliation\n\nclaim. The District’s issue as to Garcia’s retaliation claim is overruled.\n\nB.     Whether Garcia Complied With Labor Code Section 21.254\n\n       By its second issue, the District asserts that Garcia failed to comply with the\n\n                                              11\n\fmandatory and jurisdictional notice requirements contained in the TCHRA. See TEX . LAB.\n\nCODE ANN . § 21.254. Garcia contends that she filed suit within the sixty-day deadline\n\nimposed by the TCHRA and that she exercised due diligence in serving the District with\n\nnotice of her lawsuit.\n\n        The TCHRA provides that an employee must file suit within sixty days of receiving\n\na right-to-sue letter from the civil rights division of the Texas Workforce Commission. See\n\nTEX . LAB . CODE ANN . § 21.254. Although the Texas Supreme Court has not directly\n\naddressed whether this sixty-day filing period is jurisdictional, the Court recently concluded\n\nthat a different TCHRA provision, allowing a two-year period for a complainant to file suit\n\nafter initially making the complaint, see id. § 22.256 (Vernon 2006), is “mandatory but not\n\njurisdictional.” In re United Servs. Auto.

Section 21.254 does not explicitly say that failure\n\nto comply with the sixty-day deadline for a complainant to file suit after receiving a right-to-\n\nsue letter compels dismissal of the complainant’s suit or deprives the trial court of\n\njurisdiction. See TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.254.7 We therefore conclude that the sixty-day\n\nfiling period contained in section 21.254 of the TCHRA is mandatory but not jurisdictional.\n\nAccordingly, the trial court did not err in denying the District’s plea to the jurisdiction on this\n\nbasis.8 The District’s second issue is overruled.\n\nC.       Whether the District is an “Employer” Under Labor Code Chapter 21\n\n         In its third issue, the District argues that it is not subject to the waiver of immunity\n\ncontained in chapter 21 of the labor code because it is a school district and not an\n\n“employer.” See TEX . LAB. CODE ANN . § 21.002(8).\n\n         The Texas Supreme Court held that immunity is waived as to a school district under\n\nchapter 21 of the labor code. See Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 660; see also Copperas Cove\n\n\n         7\n          Several other courts have directly considered the sixty-day lim it provided in section 22.254 and have\nconcluded that the requirem ent is not jurisdictional.

App.–Dallas July 1,\n2003, pet. denied) (m em . op.).\n         8\n            The District argues that Garcia’s alleged failure to notify the District of her suit within the sixty-day\nfiling period deprived the trial court of subject m atter jurisdiction, considering section 311.034 of the\ngovernm ent code provides that “[s]tatutory prerequisites to a suit, including the provision of notice, are\njurisdictional requirem ents in all suits against a governm ental entity.” See T EX . G O V ’T C OD E A N N . § 311.034\n(Vernon Supp. 2009). However, the language referenced by the District was not included in the version of\nsection 311.034 that was in effect when Garcia filed suit on July 2, 2004. See Act of June 15, 2001, 77th Leg.,\nR.S., ch. 1158, § 8, 2001 T EX . G EN . L AW S 2374, 2433 (am ended 2005) (current version at T EX . G O V ’T C O DE\nA N N . § 311.034). In fact, the predecessor to section 311.034 provided the following:\n\n         In order to preserve the legislature’s interest in m anaging state fiscal m atters through the\n         appropriations process, a statute shall not be construed as a waiver of sovereign im m unity\n         unless the waiver is effected by clear and unambiguous language. In a statute, the use of\n         “person” as defined by Section 311.005 to include governm ental entities does not indicate\n         legislative intent to waive sovereign im m unity unless the context of the statute indicates no\n         other reasonable construction.\n\nId. Because the predecessor to section 311.034 is silent as to statutory prerequisites and jurisdictional\nrequirem ents, we are not persuaded by the District’s argum ent.\n\n                                                         13\n\fIndep.

(rejecting a school district’s argument that\n\nschool districts are not “employers” as defined by Chapter 21, and therefore, immunity is\n\nnot waived). On appeal, the District essentially asks us to reconsider the supreme court’s\n\nresolution of this issue.\n\n         We first note that the “law of the case” doctrine requires that “questions of law\n\ndecided on appeal to a court of last resort will govern the case throughout its subsequent\n\nstages.” Hudson v.

Furthermore, this Court\n\nis bound to follow the supreme court’s resolution of this issue.

Generally, the doctrine of stare decisis dictates that once the\n\nSupreme Court announces a proposition of law, the decision is considered binding\n\nprecedent.”).\n\n         The District argues that Garcia is not the “law of the case” because the specific\n\nissue of whether a school district is immune under the TCHRA was never fully briefed or\n\nargued. It further argues that the supreme court’s more recent decision in Harris County\n\nHospital District v. Tomball Regional Hospital calls Garcia into question. See </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"895112\"><a href=\"/opinion/895112/harris-county-hosp-dist-v-tomball/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Tex. 2009). We are unpersuaded by these arguments. Notwithstanding the lack of\n\nbriefing or argument, the supreme court considered the waiver issue9 and concluded that\n\nthe “TCHRA clearly and unambiguously waives immunity.” Garcia, 253 S.W.3d at 660.\n\nThus, we must conclude that the definition of “employer” in chapter 21 of the labor code\n\nincludes school districts, and therefore, immunity is waived.10 Accordingly, we overrule the\n\n        9\n          “Here, Garcia alleges that the Legislature waived the ISD’s im m unity in the TCHRA.” Garcia, 253\nS.W .3d at 660.\n          10\n             W e also note that the District, in arguing that it is not an “em ployer” within the context of chapter\n21 of the labor code, argues that it is neither a “political subdivision” of the State of Texas nor a “state\ninstrum entality.” If this were true, then, in reconciling chapter 21 of the labor code with section 51.014 of the\ncivil practice and rem edies code (the statute authorizing certain interlocutory appeals), the District would not\nbe entitled to appeal the trial court’s interlocutory order in this case.
