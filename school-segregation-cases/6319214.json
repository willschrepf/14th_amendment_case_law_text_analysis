Charles City Community Schools\n\nBoard of Education, 368 N.W.2d 74, 79 (Iowa 1985), we observed that the\n\n“state has a clear right to set minimum educational standards for all its\n\nchildren and a corresponding responsibility to see to it that those\n\nstandards are honored.” Yet we also concluded that a “court is without\n\neither the resources or the expertise necessary” to draft minimum\n\neducational standards for private religious schools. Id. at 80.\n\n      This case concerns Iowa’s standards for public schools. It asks us,\n\nin effect, to require the state to impose additional public school\n\nstandards, urging that such action is both constitutionally and\n\nstatutorily required.\n\n      Adhering to the lessons of the Johnson case, we decline the\n\ninvitation. We hold that plaintiffs’ specific challenges to the educational\n\npolicies of this state are properly directed to the plaintiffs’ elected\n\nrepresentatives, rather than the courts. We find the plaintiffs have not\n\nstated claims for relief under article IX, division 2, section 3, article I,\n\nsection 6, or article I, section 9 of the Iowa Constitution, or Iowa Code\n\nsection 256.37 (2007).\n\n      Our decision does not foreclose future constitutional challenges to\n\nactions taken by state or local officials in the vital field of public\n\neducation.   We decide only that this case, brought by these plaintiffs,\n\nshould not go forward because the factual allegations, even if proved, do\n\nnot set forth a potential constitutional or statutory violation under the\n\nforegoing provisions.\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’\n\npetition.\n\f                                     4\n\n      I. Facts and Procedural Background.\n\n      Because this case was decided on a motion to dismiss, our relevant\n\npoint of reference is the plaintiffs’ petition. The plaintiffs’ first amended\n\nand substituted petition, which the district court ultimately dismissed, is\n\ntwenty-three pages long.      It includes a two-page summary, entitled\n\n“Nature of the Lawsuit,” as well as thirteen pages of “Factual\n\nAllegations.”\n\n      The sixteen named plaintiffs are students or parents of students\n\nwho attended or currently attend public schools in the Davenport, Des\n\nMoines, or West Harrison Community School Districts. As explained by\n\nplaintiffs’ counsel at oral argument, plaintiffs’ position is that Iowa’s\n\neducational system is not adequately serving students in either the\n\nlargest (e.g., Davenport and Des Moines) or the smallest (e.g., West\n\nHarrison) school districts. The case is not brought as a class action.\n\n      According to the initial summary contained in the petition, “[t]he\n\nquiet, ugly truth is that Iowa’s educational system is but a shadow of its\n\nglorious past and our leaders are whistling by its graveyard.” Plaintiffs\n\nallege that there exists a “disparity in educational outcomes [in Iowa]\n\nbased upon where one goes to school” and there has been a “failure[] to\n\nprovide similar educational opportunities for all of Iowa’s students.”\n\n      Plaintiffs have not named any local school officials as defendants.\n\nThey have sued, rather, the State of Iowa, the Governor of Iowa, the Iowa\n\nDepartment of Education, and the Director of the Department. In their\n\ninitial summary, plaintiffs allege that these statewide entities and\n\nofficials “have failed to establish standards, failed to enforce any\n\nstandards, failed to adopt effective educator pay systems, and failed to\n\nestablish and maintain an adequate education delivery system.”\n\f                                           5\n\n       In the ensuing factual allegations, plaintiffs allege that Iowa’s\n\nstatewide laws and rules are “broad educational requirements and\n\naccreditation standards for schools within the State of Iowa.” They do\n\nnot, in plaintiffs’ view, contain “specific, detailed information regarding\n\nthe courses that schools must provide or offer to [their] students nor do\n\nthey set forth any details regarding the skills that must be attained by\n\nstudents at each grade level.” Repeatedly, plaintiffs criticize Iowa for the\n\nlack of “state-mandated standards.” They maintain that Iowa is the only\n\nstate without any statewide academic standards.                 Plaintiffs also fault\n\nIowa for not “providing specific testing of students at various educational\n\nlevels and in a variety of subject matters like other states,” instead\n\nrelying on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) and the Iowa Test of\n\nEducational Development (ITED).\n\n       This part of the petition refers to a number of reports and studies.1\n\nFor example, plaintiffs note that according to Education Week’s Quality\n\nCounts 2008 report, Iowa received a “C” for educational performance. 2\n\n       Plaintiffs also cite Iowa Department of Education statistics that, in\n\ntheir view, show how students attending the smallest school districts\n\n(less than 250 students) are disadvantaged.                      According to the\nDepartment’s 2007 Annual Condition of Education report, teachers in\n\n\n       1See  Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., 551 U.S. 308, 322, 127 S. Ct.\n2499, 2509, 168 L. Ed. 2d 179, 193 (2007) (in ruling on a motion to dismiss, courts\nmust ordinarily consider documents incorporated into the complaint by reference);\nHallett Constr. Co. v. Iowa State Highway Comm’n, 261 Iowa 290, 295, 154 N.W.2d 71,\n74 (1967) (highway specifications that were incorporated in the petition by reference\nwere deemed part of the petition and could be considered in a default proceeding).\nBecause this action was brought in 2008, the materials cited by plaintiffs date from\n2008 or earlier.\n        2This was a middling performance, according to this source.    The national\naverage was a C. See Iowa—State Highlights 2008, Education Week’s Quality Counts\n(Editorial Projects in Educ. Research Ctr., Bethesda, Md.), 2008, at 2, available at\nhttp://www.edweek.org/ew/toc/2008/01/10/index.html.\n\f                                           6\n\nthose districts have, on average, less experience, fewer advanced degrees,\n\nand more teaching assignments than their colleagues at the largest\n\nschool districts, such as Davenport and Des Moines.                    Iowa Dep’t of\n\nEduc., The Annual Condition of Education at 47, 75, 76 (2007)\n\n[hereinafter     The    Annual     Condition      of   Education],     available     at\n\nhttp://educateiowa.gov/index.php?option=com_docman&task=cat_view\n\n&gid=646&itemid=1563.            Unsurprisingly, according to the petition,\n\nstudents in the smallest districts also have fewer curriculum units\n\navailable to them. 3 Id. at 112.\n\n       Additionally, students from Iowa’s smallest school districts receive,\n\non average, lower ACT scores. In 2007, according to the Department of\n\nEducation report, the average ACT composite score was 21.3 for students\n\nat districts in the lowest enrollment category (less than 250 students).\n\nId. at 192. By contrast, the average ACT composite score was 22.5 for\n\nstudents attending districts in the largest enrollment category. Id. The\n\npetition notes, however, that the national average ACT composite score\n\nwas 21.2.      Id. at 186.    Thus, all categories of school districts in Iowa\n\nscored above the national average. 4\n\n       Plaintiffs further allege that Iowa’s ranking in science and math is\n“consistently declining”; that Iowa “has continued to decline in the\n\nnational rankings for math and reading proficiencies and other measures\n\nof student achievement”; that “Iowa ranks well below the national\n\naverage for students taking gateway courses such as Algebra, Algebra 2\n\n       3On   the other hand, the 2007 report indicates that students at the smallest\nschool districts benefit, on average, from much smaller class size. The Annual Condition\nof Education, at 122. For example, the relevant comparisons are 11.9 versus 20.5\nstudents per class for kindergarten, 11.8 versus 21.4 per class for first grade, 13.1\nversus 21.6 for second grade, and 13.7 versus 22.7 for third grade. Id.\n       4The  2007 report further reveals that Iowa’s average ACT composite score of\n22.3 was tied with Wisconsin for second place in the nation. Id. at 185.\n\f                                      7\n\nor Geometry”; that “Iowa ranks thirty-eighth in the nation for AP\n\n[Advanced Placement] test scores”; and that “[m]any Iowa students are\n\nnot prepared to enter the workforce or post-secondary education without\n\nadditional training or remediation when they graduate from high school.”\n\n       Some of the factual allegations concern “the circumstances of the\n\nplaintiffs.”   These allegations do not actually discuss the plaintiffs\n\nindividually, but rather their school districts. According to the petition,\n\none of the districts, West Harrison, has approximately 500 students.\n\n(Thus, it does not fall into the smallest category of school district, i.e.,\n\nless than 250 students, referenced earlier in the petition.) Among other\n\nthings, plaintiffs allege that West Harrison had an average ACT\n\ncomposite score of 18.6 in 2006, nearly three and a half points below the\n\naverage ACT score for all Iowa students; that only ten to twelve percent of\n\nWest Harrison’s teachers have advanced degrees; that West Harrison\n\ndoes not have anyone on staff to assist high school students with college\n\nplanning or other career counseling; and that classes at West Harrison\n\ndo not adequately prepare students for a college level curriculum.\n\n       With regard to the Davenport school district, plaintiffs do not find\n\nfault with teacher experience, staffing, or class availability, but allege\n\nthat its average composite ACT score in 2007 was 20.5. No allegations\n\nare made as to teacher experience, staffing, class availability, or ACT\n\nscores in the Des Moines school district.      However, with respect to all\n\nthree of the school districts, plaintiffs allege that the percentages of\n\nstudents found proficient in math and reading according to ITBS and\n\nITED scores generally have ranged between fifty and seventy percent, a\n\nlevel that plaintiffs appear to believe is unsatisfactory.\n\n       The petition has two counts seeking relief. In Count I, plaintiffs\n\nrequest a declaratory judgment.           They allege that education is a\n\f                                      8\n\nfundamental right or alternatively that the current education laws (“or\n\nlack thereof”) are “irrational, arbitrary, and capricious” and not\n\n“rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.” They also allege\n\nthat “some students are receiving a more effective education than other\n\nstudents based solely upon where the student resides.” They allege the\n\ndefendants have “failed to establish and provide access to an effective\n\neducation” by (1) “failing to establish educational standards,” (2) failing\n\nto enforce and utilize such standards, (3) “failing to implement a\n\nprofessional pay system for educators consistent with such standards,”\n\n(4) “failing to provide equal access,” and (5) “failing to develop an effective\n\norganizational and delivery system and failing to address or abolish the\n\ndisparities among different school[] districts in Iowa.”          They allege\n\nviolations of the due process, equal protection, and education clauses of\n\nthe Iowa Constitution and Iowa Code section 256.37.\n\n      Count II seeks an order of mandamus. It alleges similar failures\n\non the part of the defendants, but goes on to assert that these failures\n\namount to a breach of duty and requests an order directing the\n\ndefendants to provide an effective education.\n\n      Finally, plaintiffs’ prayer for relief seeks a declaration that the\n\ndefendants have failed to provide an effective education in accordance\n\nwith the due process, equal protection, and education clauses and Iowa\n\nCode section 256.37.       It also requests an order of mandamus or\n\npermanent injunction directing the defendants to (1) undertake all\n\nsuitable means to provide an effective education; (2) develop educational\n\ncontent and performance standards for all Iowa school districts which\n\ndetail required course offerings, instructor capabilities, and testing\n\nrequirements,    among    other   things;   (3) improve   or    develop   state\n\nassessments;     (4) develop   and    enforce    professional    development\n\f                                          9\n\nprograms; (5) implement a career ladder to enhance recruitment and\n\nretention of quality teachers; (6) enforce the standards by identifying and\n\nenforcing consequences for failure to follow and implement such\n\nstandards;       (7) “develop    educational   management       and   governance\n\narrangements to mitigate all procedural and structural impediments to\n\nan effective education”; and (8) “[c]lose the achievement gaps among the\n\nschool[] districts in Iowa.”\n\n      Plaintiffs’ original petition was filed April 3; their first amended and\n\nsubstituted petition on April 30. On June 21, 2008, the defendants filed\n\na motion to dismiss. In their nine-page motion, the defendants argued:\n\n(1) all the constitutional claims raised a nonjusticiable political question;\n\n(2) the equal protection and due process claims failed to state a claim;\n\n(3) there   is    no   private    cause   of   action   under   section   256.37;\n\n(4) mandamus did not lie; (5) the Governor could not be sued; and (6) the\n\nIowa Administrative Procedures Act was the exclusive means of obtaining\n\nreview of acts or omissions by the Department of Education.\n\n      This motion was resisted on all grounds by plaintiffs; a hearing\n\nwas held; and on November 21, 2008, the district court granted the\n\ndefendants’ motion.\n\n      In a thoughtful sixteen-page ruling, the district court found the\n\nplaintiffs had stated claims for relief under the equal protection clause\n\nand the due process clause, but all their constitutional claims presented\n\na nonjusticiable political question, and their statutory claim under\n\nsection 256.37 failed because that provision does not afford a private\n\nright of action. The court also found the plaintiffs had not satisfied the\n\nprerequisites for seeking mandamus. The court dismissed the action in\n\nits entirety for these reasons, declining to reach the defendants’\n\nremaining asserted grounds for dismissal. Plaintiffs appeal.\n\f                                           10\n\n       II. Standard of Review.\n\n       Our review of a district court ruling on a motion to dismiss is for\n\ncorrection of errors at law. Kingsway Cathedral v. Iowa Dep’t of Transp.,\n\n711 N.W.2d 6, 7 (Iowa 2006).              “A motion to dismiss should only be\n\ngranted if the allegations in the petition, taken as true, could not entitle\n\nthe plaintiff to any relief.” Sanchez v. State, 692 N.W.2d 812, 816 (Iowa\n\n2005). “A motion to dismiss admits the well-pleaded facts in the petition,\n\nbut not the conclusions.” Kingsway Cathedral, 711 N.W.2d at 8.\n\n       III. Analysis.\n\n       A. Introduction.           We begin our analysis of this case by\n\ndiscussing, briefly, what it is not.         For one thing, this is not a school\n\nfunding case.      Plaintiffs do not allege that Iowa has a funding system\n\nthat discriminates among school districts or even one that funds schools\n\ninadequately. 5 Also, plaintiffs are not questioning any specific law, rule,\n\n       5Approximately   forty-one other state supreme courts have considered broad\nconstitutional challenges to the state education system. The vast majority of these\ncases have been primarily concerned with the state’s method of funding education—i.e.,\nallegations that funding is either inequitable, inadequate, or both. See Opinion of the\nJustices, 624 So.2d 107, 112 n.5 (Ala. 1993) (funding “a major focus of plaintiffs’ case”),\nabrogated by Ex parte James, 836 So.2d 813, 819 (Ala. 2002) (ultimately finding\nchallenge nonjusticiable); Matanuska-Susitna Borough Sch.

Plaintiffs do not claim the defendants have a different policy or\n\nstandard for different types or categories of schools.\n\n       Rather, the entire focus of plaintiffs’ lawsuit is on the defendants’\n\nalleged “failure” to act on a statewide basis. More specifically, plaintiffs\n\nallege that the defendants have failed to establish statewide educational\n\nstandards,      assessments,       and    teacher     training,     recruitment,      and\n\nretention programs. To be sure, plaintiffs claim they have been denied\n\n“equal access” as a result of these “failures,” but that is an allegation of\n\n_______________________________\n364 S.E.2d 470, 472 (S.C. 1988) (holding system for financing and funding schools did\nnot violate the South Carolina Constitution); Davis v.

See Conn. Coal. for Justice in Educ. Funding, Inc. v. Rell, 990 A.2d\n206, 210–11, 271 (Conn. 2010) (holding the plaintiffs’ allegations that they had not\nreceived suitable educational opportunities stated cognizable claims in light of\nConnecticut’s constitutional mandate for “free public elementary and secondary\nschools”); Rose v.

There is no allegation that the\n\ndefendants, for example, have treated the West Harrison school district\n\nany differently from other, larger school districts.          Simply stated,\n\nplaintiffs charge the defendants with not having affirmatively adopted\n\npolicies that would eliminate existing discrepancies among districts, for\n\nexample, as to average student test scores.\n\n      B. The Legal Issues Before Us. As we have indicated many times\n\nbefore, “we will uphold a district court ruling on a ground other than the\n\none upon which the district court relied provided the ground was urged\n\nin that court.”     Martinek v. Belmond-Klemme Cmty. Sch. Dist., 772\n\nN.W.2d 758, 762 (Iowa 2009) (citations omitted); see also Fennelly v. A-1\n\nMach. & Tool Co., 728 N.W.2d 163, 177 (Iowa 2006); Emmert v. Neiman,\n\n245 Iowa 931, 934, 65 N.W.2d 606, 608 (1954) (“We have held many\n\ntimes that in reviewing a ruling sustaining a motion to strike or dismiss,\n\nthe same should be sustained if any of the grounds advanced are good,\n\neven though the one upon which the trial court based its ruling, is not.”\n\n(citations omitted)).\n\n      Here the defendants urged dismissal of the constitutional claims in\n\nthe   district   court   on   the   alternative   grounds   that   they   were\n\nnonjusticiable and that they failed to state a claim. Both parties had a\n\nfull opportunity to brief (and did brief) those matters below. Although\n\nthe defendants’ appellate brief does not specifically urge that we affirm\n\non the basis of failure to state a claim if we find one or more of the claims\n\njusticiable, the defendants made that request at oral argument.           The\n\nparties have provided their district court briefing to us, and neither side\n\nhas suggested that further briefing is needed.        In any event, because\n\nboth grounds were duly raised before the trial court, we could affirm on\n\neither ground even if it were not argued to us. See Erickson v. Erickson’s\n\f                                     14\n\nEstate, 191 Iowa 1393, 1397, 180 N.W. 664, 665 (1920).                   The\n\nfundamental principle is one of fairness to the parties and the trial court.\n\nSee DeVoss v. State, 648 N.W.2d 56, 62–63 (Iowa 2002). That fairness is\n\nassured so long as the grounds on which we are affirming were presented\n\nto the trial court so the trial court had an opportunity to rule on them\n\nand the opposing party had an opportunity to counter them if it felt it\n\nneeded to do so. Cf. Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Charter Barclay Hosp.,\n\nInc., 81 F.3d 53, 56 (7th Cir. 1996) (noting that it “would not be quite\n\ncricket” to decide a case on a ground that had not been raised at all by\n\nthe appellee before oral argument of the appeal).        Also, because the\n\ndistrict court has already indicated that it believes the equal protection\n\nand due process claims would be sufficient if they were justiciable, a\n\nremand for it to rule again on the viability of those claims (assuming\n\ntheir justiciability) seems particularly unnecessary and would only\n\nprolong the proceedings.\n\n      In State v. Seering, 701 N.W.2d 655, 660–61 (Iowa 2005), we\n\ndeclined to reach several constitutional arguments that were presented\n\nto and not ruled upon by the district court, and that were also not\n\npresented to us. That was an appropriate exercise of our discretion, but\n\nit is a far cry from the present case. Here the parties not only briefed\n\nbelow whether the equal protection and due process claims should be\n\ndismissed for failure to state a claim, the district court also decided these\n\nquestions. A remand for the district court to rule again on whether the\n\nplaintiffs have stated a claim therefore would serve no purpose. At oral\n\nargument, the plaintiffs did not object to this court’s considering whether\n\nthey stated a claim, nor would such an objection have made sense.\n\n      Appellants and appellees stand in different positions because the\n\nappellant seeks to overturn the judgment rendered below.         See Ritz v.\n\f                                       15\n\nWapello Cnty. Bd. of Supervisors, 595 N.W.2d 786, 789 (Iowa 1999)\n\n(stating that “[w]e have recognized . . . a distinction between successful\n\nand unsuccessful parties for purposes of error preservation” (citations\n\nomitted)). Our rules provide that an appellee need not even file a brief in\n\nour court. See Iowa R. App. P. 6.903(3) (indicating that the appellee may\n\nwaive filing a brief). The appellant, by contrast, must file a brief and is\n\nlimited to the issues raised in that brief. See id. r. 6.903(2); Dilley v. City\n\nof Des Moines, 247 N.W.2d 187, 195 (Iowa 1976) (citing cases).              Of\n\ncourse, we may choose to consider only grounds for affirmance raised in\n\nthe appellee’s brief, but we are not required to do so, so long as the\n\nground was raised below.        In recent years, we have even on occasion\n\naffirmed on grounds not raised below. For example, in State v. Reyes,\n\n744 N.W.2d 95, 99–100 (Iowa 2008), we affirmed on a statutory ground\n\nthat was not raised either below or in the appellate briefs, until we\n\ninvited supplemental briefing.      In State v. Adams, we granted further\n\nreview and invited supplemental briefing on an issue that had not been\n\nraised by either party either below or on appeal, and then rendered a\n\ndecision on that issue.      See Order for Supplemental Briefing, State v.\n\nAdams, 810 N.W.2d 365, 366 (Iowa 2012) (No. 08–0513).\n\n         This appeal has been brought to us. The elected branches of our\n\nstate government are currently engaged in an active debate about state\n\neducational policy. They are entitled to know whether this lawsuit may\n\naffect their policy choices.        It would be an abnegation of our\n\nresponsibility not to reach a legal question about the sufficiency of the\n\nplaintiffs’ pleadings that was fully developed and decided by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n         Additionally, the political question grounds and the failure to state\n\na claim grounds are interrelated. In either case, we assume the truth of\n\f                                              16\n\nthe plaintiffs’ factual allegations and determine whether, under those\n\nfacts, the plaintiffs could be entitled to judicial relief. 6\n\n       C. The Education Clause.                 We first consider plaintiffs’ claims\n\nunder article IX, division 2, section 3 of the Iowa Constitution. 7 In its\n\nentirety, this section reads as follows:\n\n              Perpetual support fund.         Sec. 3.    The General\n       Assembly shall encourage, by all suitable means, the\n       promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural\n       improvement. The proceeds of all lands that have been, or\n       hereafter may be, granted by the United States to this State,\n       for the support of schools, which may have been or shall\n       hereafter be sold, or disposed of, and the five hundred\n       thousand acres of land granted to the new States, under an\n       act of Congress, distributing the proceeds of the public lands\n       among the several States of the Union, approved in the year\n       of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, and\n       all estates of deceased persons who may have died without\n       leaving a will or heir, and also such percent as has been or\n       may hereafter be granted by Congress, on the sale of lands\n       in this State, shall be, and remain a perpetual fund, the\n       interest of which, together with all rents of the unsold lands,\n       and such other means as the General Assembly may provide,\n\n        6This case was originally argued in March 2010, before three current members\n\njoined this court. It was then reargued in June 2011. Even at the first oral argument,\nsome of the questioning related to the merits of plaintiffs’ claims, including the following\nquestions taken from the recording:\n       I take it this is a bit of an attack on local control, correct me if I’m wrong?\n       Aren’t you in essence saying that a local school board then would not have\n       the authority to say: well we want to set our tax rates at a certain level;\n       we are concerned about economic development in this rural setting, we\n       don’t want to get the taxes up high; we choose not to promote advanced\n       placement courses and instead we want to have a broad based athletic\n       program.\n       Supposing there were a uniform standard, number one wouldn’t that pose\n       a risk of a lower standard as the legislature considers what’s uniform\n       across the board that they want to bring the rural districts up and maybe\n       the urban districts down?\n       Secondly, supposing that standard were established could a wealthier\n       district then elect to apply a richer environment?\n(Emphasis added.)\n       7Plaintiffs  do not argue, either here or below, that they have claims under\ndivision 1 of article IX of the Iowa Constitution.\n\f                                          17\n      shall be inviolably appropriated to the support of common\n      schools throughout the state.\n\nIowa Const. art. IX, div. 2, § 3 (1857 original version) (emphasis added).\n\nThe present controversy concerns the italicized first sentence above,\n\nwhich both parties refer to as “the education clause.” 8\n      Plaintiffs    contend      the   education      clause   imposes   judicially\n\nenforceable obligations on Iowa’s legislature to promote education by “all\n\nsuitable means.”       Defendants counter that plaintiffs’ claims under the\n\nclause present a nonjusticiable political question.             Otherwise stated,\n\ndefendants maintain that the education clause reflects a grant of funding\n\nauthority to the legislature, not a limit upon legislative policy in the field\n\nof education.\n\n      Constitutional provisions, like statutes, need to be read in context.\n\nSee Iowa Elec. Light & Power Co. v. Inc. Town of Grand Junction, 221 Iowa\n\n441, 463, 264 N.W. 84, 95 (1935) (Parsons, J., specially concurring) (“A\n\nConstitution should be construed as a whole, just like a statute.”).\n\nArticle IX of the 1857 Constitution of the State of Iowa, entitled,\n\n“Education and School Lands,” was enacted in two divisions. The first\n\ndivision of article IX, captioned “Education,” established a state board of\n\neducation and conferred on that board powers and duties relating to\n\neducation policy. In particular, section 1 of that division provided, “The\n\neducational interest of the State, including Common Schools and other\n\neducational institutions, shall be under the management of a Board of\n\nEducation . . . .” Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1, § 1. Section 8 authorized\n\nthe board of education “to legislate and make all needful rules and\n\nregulations in relation to Common Schools,” although it also permitted\n\n\n\n\n      8We   have not used that term previously in any case.\n\f                                     18\n\nthe general assembly to “alter[], amend[] or repeal[]” the board’s acts,\n\nrules and regulations after they had been adopted. Id. art. IX, div. 1, § 8.\n\n       The second division of article IX, captioned “School Funds and\n\nSchool Lands,” sets forth provisions relating to the funding of education,\n\nespecially through the sale of state-owned lands.        Whereas the first\n\ndivision entrusted the “educational interest” to the board of education,\n\nthe second division made clear that funding would be the legislature’s\n\ndomain.    Hence, the first section of the second division states, “[t]he\n\neducational and school funds and lands, shall be under the control and\n\nmanagement of the General Assembly of this state.” Id. art. IX, div. 2,\n\n§ 1.\n\n       The third section of the second division, wherein the education\n\nclause is found, is entitled “Perpetual support fund.” Id. art IX, div. 2,\n\n§ 3.   The clause itself then follows.      The remaining language of this\n\nsection, after the education clause, speaks in terms of “a perpetual fund,\n\nthe interest of which, together with all rents of the unsold lands, and\n\nsuch other means as the General Assembly may provide, shall be\n\ninviolably appropriated to the support of Common schools throughout\n\nthe State.”   Id.   All this, we believe,   supports a construction of the\n\neducation clause as a funding provision, which allocated to the general\n\nassembly the authority to provide money for education, and thereby to\n\n“encourage [various forms of improvement] by all suitable means.” Id.\n\n       We discussed this dichotomy between education policy (covered by\n\nthe first division of article IX) and education funding (the subject of the\n\nsecond division) at some length in District Township of the City of\n\nDubuque v. City of Dubuque, 7 Clarke 262 (1858), decided just a year\n\nafter the adoption of 1857 constitution. There we found unconstitutional\n\na wide-ranging law enacted by the general assembly to provide for “the\n\f                                          19\n\npublic instruction of the state of Iowa” on the ground that “[p]ower to\n\nlegislate upon the subject of education, is conferred upon the board [of\n\neducation]” and the legislature can only act in the realm of education\n\npolicy to alter, amend, or repeal the board’s prior acts.               Dist. Twp., 7\n\nClarke at 271–72, 285–86. 9 We emphasized that laws “which provide a\n\nsystem of education, sometimes known by the name of ‘school laws’ . . .\n\nare to originate with the board[,]” whereas laws “for the levying of taxes—\n\nthose making appropriations of money—and those for the control and\n\nmanagement of the educational and school funds and lands—are to be\n\npassed by the general assembly.” Id. at 286.\n\n       A year later, in Clayton County High School v. Clayton County, 9\n\nIowa 175 (1859), reinforcing the lesson of the Dubuque case, we held the\n\ngeneral assembly lacked constitutional authority to establish high\n\nschools. We specifically rejected the argument that such schools “may\n\nrightfully be provided for by the General Assembly, to whom is committed\n\nthe duty of encouraging, by all suitable means, the promotion of\n\nintellectual, scientific, moral and agricultural improvement.”                 Clayton\n\nCnty., 9 Iowa at 176. Instead we concluded that these schools were “a\n\ncomponent part of the educational system of the State; the original\n\n\n       9Among      the provisions which this court declared unconstitutional was a\nprovision for schools segregated on the basis of race. See 1858 Iowa Acts ch. 52,\n§ 30(4). Later, in Clark v. Board of Directors, 24 Iowa 266 (1868), we struck down the\nsegregated schools of a particular school district. Our decision there was based on\ninterpretation of language originally passed by the board of education in 1860 in the\nwake of the Dubuque decision and subsequently reaffirmed on several occasions by the\nlegislature. Clark, 24 Iowa at 271–73. The language in question required “the\ninstruction of youth between the ages of five and twenty-one years.” Id. at 271. We\nreasoned that this language prohibited the exclusion of persons of color from the\ncommon schools. Id. at 276. Our opinion cited section 12 of the first division of article\nIX—one of the original constitutional provisions relating to the board—as providing\nauthority for the board’s 1860 enactment. Id. at 271. In this case, plaintiffs have not\ncited or relied upon section 12 or any of the other original constitutional provisions in\nthe first division relating to the board of education.\n\f                                          20\n\nestablishment of which, as well as its subsequent management and\n\ncontrol, has been committed by the constitution to the Board of\n\nEducation.” Id. at 177. In short, at a time when the 1857 constitution\n\nwas quite fresh in people’s minds, we reached the conclusion that no\n\naspect of the Iowa Constitution, including the education clause,\n\nauthorized the legislature to provide for public schools (as opposed to\n\nmerely funding them).        Since the contemporary view of our court was\n\nthat the education clause did not even allow the legislature to establish\n\npublic schools, it seems difficult for us to conceive that the clause could\n\nhave been seen as a source of enforceable minimum standards for such\n\nschools.\n\n          This interpretation of the education clause as a grant of funding\n\nauthority is further confirmed by section 15 of the first division of article\n\nIX:\n\n                 At any time after the year One thousand eight hundred\n          and sixty three, the General Assembly shall have power to\n          abolish or re-organize said Board of Education, and provide\n          for the educational interest of the State in any other manner\n          that to them shall seem best and proper.\n\nIowa Const. art. IX, div. 1, § 15. In short, section 15 of the first division\nauthorized the general assembly to eliminate the board of education at\n\nany time after 1863 and thereafter provide for “the educational interest of\n\nthe State in any other manner that to them shall seem best and proper.”\n\nId. As it turned out, the legislature abolished the board of education at\n\nthe earliest possible opportunity in 1864. See 1864 Iowa Acts ch. 52,\n\n§ 1. 10\n\n\n       10We are not called upon to decide in this case whether the abolition of the\n\nboard of education gave the legislature plenary authority to address education policy or\nwhether that authority is subject to any limits that previously applied to the board of\neducation.\n\f                                      21\n\n      Placed in context, section 15 reaffirms the dividing line between\n\nthe first division of article IX, which addressed education policy, and the\n\nsecond division, which identified funding sources. Section 15 made clear\n\nthat the board of education would control education policy (subject to a\n\npossible legislative override) until at least 1863, but thereafter the\n\nlegislature could take over that responsibility “in any other manner that\n\nto them shall seem best and proper.” Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1, § 15.\n\n      One episode from the 1857 constitutional convention debates also\n\nsuggests that our founders did not intend for section 3 of the second\n\ndivision to constrain the general assembly’s authority with respect to\n\neducation policy. On March 3, 1857, George Ells of Davenport proposed\n\namending that section to include a guarantee of a free public education.\n\nSpecifically, he sought to add a clause at the end of the section so it\n\nwould read, “shall be inviolably appropriated to the support of common\n\nschools throughout the state, in which tuition shall be without charge.”\n\nSee 2 The Debates of the Constitutional Convention; of the State of Iowa\n\n968 (W. Blair Lord reporter, Davenport, Luse, Lane & Co. 1857)\n\n[hereinafter Debates] (emphasis added), available at http://www.state\n\nlibraryofiowa.org/services/law-library/iaconst.\n\n      Ells’s proposal came under immediate criticism.         J.C. Hall of\n\nBurlington objected that the issue of free public schools should be left “to\n\nbe determined in the future, as the public exigencies may require.” Id.\n\nA.H. Marvin of Monticello observed:\n\n             We should not, in my opinion, be bound by a\n      constitutional provision to make our common schools free to\n      all, but should let the several districts regulate this matter\n      for themselves. If we do that, I will warrant you that poor\n      children will never be turned out of our common schools.\n\f                                          22\n\nId. at 969. Harvey Skiff of Newton commented, “If we should incorporate\n\nthe provision of the gentleman from Scott [Mr. Ells] into our constitution,\n\nit would become established as organic law, which could not be\n\nrepealed.” Id. Although another delegate (Rufus Clarke of Mt. Pleasant)\n\nspoke in favor of the amendment, it was quickly defeated by a vote of\n\ntwenty-five to eight. Id. at 970–72.\n\n       This exchange indicates the delegates to the 1857 convention did\n\nnot believe that section 3, as it was ultimately approved, contained a\n\nright to a free public education. And if section 3 did not assure a right to\n\na free public education, it seems untenable to argue that section 3\n\ncontained a judicially enforceable right to a free public education with\n\ncertain minimum standards of quality.             Iowa’s constitutional delegates\n\nhad an opportunity to make a guarantee of free public education part of\n\n“organic law,” id. at 969, and declined to do so. 11\n\n       Our decision in Kleen v. Porter lends further support to the view\n\nthat the education clause does not constrain legislative policies in the\n\nfield of education. 237 Iowa 1160, 23 N.W.2d 904 (1946). Kleen was a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action seeking to have declared unconstitutional\n\ntwo laws that appropriated money from the general fund to school\ndistricts on a targeted basis to reimburse certain transportation expenses\n\nand bring all districts up to a certain minimum level of per-pupil\n\nfunding.    237 Iowa at 1161, 23 N.W.2d at 905. The petition asserted\n\n       11Earlier  in the convention, Marvin had proposed an amendment that would\nhave provided, “And the legislature shall provide for raising funds sufficient so that\nschools shall be kept in each district at least six months in each year, which schools\nshall be free of charge and equally open to all.” 2 Debates, at 825. That amendment\nalso was rejected, following a debate that had unfortunate racial overtones. Id. at 825–\n30.\n       Unlike the earlier Marvin amendment, the later Ells amendment was directed to\nsection 3 of the second division. There is no indication in the debates that the Ells\namendment was rejected for racial reasons. Id. at 968–72.\n\f                                          23\n\nthat under sections 3 and 7 of the second division of article IX, such\n\nappropriations could only be made on a uniform statewide basis in\n\nproportion to the numbers of youths between five and twenty-one years\n\nold in each district. Id.; see also Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 2, § 7 (“The\n\nmoney subject to the support and maintenance of common schools shall\n\nbe distributed to the districts in proportion to the number                of youths,\n\nbetween the ages of five and twenty-one years, in such manner as may\n\nbe provided by the General Assembly.”). 12 We disagreed. We held that\n\nthe enumeration requirement applied only to appropriations from the\n\n“permanent school fund” established by article IX, division 2, not other\n\nfunding sources. Kleen, 237 Iowa at 1165–66, 23 N.W.2d at 907. We\n\nconstrued the first sentence of section 3—“The General Assembly shall\n\nencourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of intellectual, scientific,\n\nmoral, and agricultural improvement”—as designed to give the legislature\n\n“broad authority” to augment the income from the permanent school\n\nfund without being subject to the enumeration requirement in section 7.\n\nId. at 1166, 23 N.W.2d at 907. Thus, Kleen saw the education clause as\n\na grant of broad funding authority to the general assembly.\n\n      In sum, given the wording and location of the education clause in\n\nour constitution, and our prior interpretations of that clause, we do not\n\nbelieve plaintiffs have stated a claim thereunder. Plaintiffs’ criticisms of\n\nstate education policy do not amount to a violation of article IX, division\n\n2, section 3.\n\n      It is a well-established principle that the courts will not intervene\n\nor attempt to adjudicate a challenge to a legislative action involving a\n\n“political question.”     Des Moines Register & Tribune Co. v. Dwyer, 542\n\n\n      12This   section was repealed by constitutional amendment in 1984.\n\f                                       24\n\nN.W.2d 491, 495 (Iowa 1996); see also Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S.\n\n486, 518, 89 S. Ct. 1944, 1962, 23 L. Ed. 2d 491, 515 (1969).          The\n\nnonjusticability of “political questions” is primarily rooted in the\n\nseparation of powers doctrine, “which requires we leave intact the\n\nrespective roles and regions of independence of the coordinate branches\n\nof government.” Dwyer, 542 N.W.2d at 495 (citations omitted).\n\n      The political question doctrine excludes from judicial review\n      those controversies which revolve around policy choices and\n      value determinations constitutionally committed for\n      resolution to the halls of [the General Assembly] or the\n      confines of the Executive Branch.          The Judiciary is\n      particularly ill suited to make such decisions, as courts are\n      fundamentally underequipped to formulate [state] policies or\n      develop standards for matters not legal in nature.\n\nJapan Whaling Ass’n v. Am. Cetacean Soc’y, 478 U.S. 221, 230, 106 S.\n\nCt. 2860, 2866, 92 L. Ed. 2d 166, 178 (1986) (citations and internal\n\nquotations omitted). Nonetheless, the exercise of the judiciary’s power to\n\ninterpret the constitution and to review the constitutionality of the laws\n\nand acts of the legislature does not offend these principles.     Luse v.\n\nWray, 254 N.W.2d 324, 327–28 (Iowa 1977); see also Marbury v.\n\nMadison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177–78, 2 L. Ed. 60, 73 (1803).\n\n      A political question may be found when one or more of the\nfollowing considerations is present:\n\n      (1) a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of\n      the issue to a coordinate political department; (2) a lack of\n      judicially discoverable and manageable standards for\n      resolving the issue; (3) the impossibility of deciding without\n      an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for\n      nonjudicial discretion; (4) the impossibility of a court’s\n      undertaking independent resolution without expressing a\n      lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government;\n      (5) an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a\n      political decision already made; or (6) the potentiality of\n      embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by\n      various departments on one question.\n\f                                    25\n\nDwyer, 542 N.W.2d at 495 (citing Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 217, 82 S.\n\nCt. 691, 710, 7 L. Ed. 2d 663, 686 (1962)). Whether a matter involves a\n\n“political question” is determined on a case-by-case basis and requires\n\nan examination of the nature of the underlying claim. Id. at 495–96.\n\n      A number of these factors might support the conclusion that\n\nplaintiffs’ claim under the education clause presents a political question.\n\nTo begin with, the text and history of the clause indicate a commitment\n\nof authority to the general assembly, rather than a constraint upon it.\n\nThe clause says the “General Assembly shall encourage . . . .” Unlike\n\nmost of the clauses in our bill of rights, it is not worded in the negative\n\nas a prohibition (e.g., “the General Assembly shall not . . .”). See, e.g.,\n\nIowa Const. art. I, §§ 3–4, 6–9, 11–19, 21, 23–24. Moreover, as noted\n\nabove, the education clause must be read in conjunction with the broad\n\npolicy-making authority conferred by article IX, division 1, section 15,\n\nwhich states that the general assembly shall have power after 1863 to\n\n“provide for the educational interest of the state in any other manner\n\nthat to them shall seem best and proper.” Kinzer v. Dirs. of Indep. Sch.\n\nDist., 129 Iowa 441, 444, 105 N.W. 686, 687 (1906) (citing this\n\nconstitutional provision and stating that “the Legislature is expressly\n\nauthorized to provide for the educational interests of the state, in such\n\nmanner as shall seem best and proper”); see also Bunger v. Iowa High\n\nSch. Athletic Ass’n, 197 N.W.2d 555, 563 (Iowa 1972) (same).\n\n      Second, it is an open question whether the education clause\n\ncontains “judicially discoverable and manageable standards.”       Dwyer,\n\n542 N.W.2d at 495.        The clause says that the legislature shall\n\n“encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of intellectual,\n\nscientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.”    Iowa Const. art. IX.,\n\ndiv. 2, § 3. Are courts to become arbiters of “moral improvement?” How\n\f                                          26\n\nare judges to decide that children are deficient in their moral upbringing\n\nand what to do about it? Of course, the clause does not even contain the\n\nwords “schools” or “education.” Does this mean that we as judges can\n\norder the state to foster moral improvement in adults? 13\n\n       As we note above, most of the prior challenges to state education\n\nsystems have been, in whole or in part, about funding.                     Courts are\n\naccustomed to dealing with questions of financial discrimination. See,\n\ne.g., State v. Dudley, 766 N.W.2d 606, 621–22 (Iowa 2009) (finding a\n\ndenial of equal protection when indigent defendants represented by\n\ncontract attorneys were required to pay more than indigent defendants\n\nrepresented by the public defender’s office). But this lawsuit asks the\n\ncourts to enter into a longstanding debate over the merits of state\n\nmandates versus local control in public education. That may require an\n\ninitial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.\n\nDwyer, 542 N.W.2d at 495.\n\n       Lastly, we consider how other state courts have treated provisions\n\nin   their    state   constitutions     similar    to   Iowa’s    education     clause.\n\nComparable language appears in the constitutions of California, Indiana,\n\nand Nevada. Cal. Const. art. IX, § 1 (“[T]he Legislature shall encourage\n\nby all suitable means, the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and\n\nagricultural improvement.”); Ind. Const. art. 8, § 1 (“[I]t shall be the duty\n\nof the General Assembly to encourage, by all suitable means, moral,\n\nintellectual, scientific, and agricultural improvement[.]”); Nev. Const. art.\n\n11, § 1 (“The legislature shall encourage by all suitable means the\n\n       13In Dickinson v. Porter, we rejected an equal protection challenge to a state law\nthat funded a tax credit for certain agricultural lands. 240 Iowa 393, 35 N.W.2d 66\n(1949). In finding that the law’s classification rested on a reasonable basis, i.e., to\n“benefit and encourage agriculture,” we cited the education clause as an example of a\nstate public policy to promote agriculture. Id. at 408–09, 35 N.W.2d at 76. The\nDickinson case had nothing to do with education.\n\f                                           27\n\npromotion      of   intellectual,   literary,    scientific,   mining,     mechanical,\n\nagricultural, and moral improvements[.]”). 14             Only in Indiana has the\n\nstate supreme court directly addressed justiciability.\n\n       In Bonner ex rel. Bonner v. Daniels, 907 N.E.2d 516, 518 (Ind.\n\n2009), a group of Indiana public school students sought a declaratory\n\njudgment to establish that the Indiana Constitution imposes an\n\nenforceable duty on state government to provide a standard of quality\n\neducation and that the duty was not being satisfied.                           Indiana’s\n\nConstitution provides:\n\n       Knowledge and learning, generally diffused throughout a\n       community, being essential to the preservation of a free\n       government; it shall be the duty of the General Assembly to\n       encourage, by all suitable means, moral, intellectual,\n       scientific, and agricultural improvement; and to provide, by\n       law, for a general and uniform system of Common Schools,\n\n\n        14The education clauses of the constitutions of Connecticut, Massachusetts, and\n\nNew Hampshire are not similar to Iowa’s. They employ language that is both more\nforceful and more specific. Connecticut’s clause provides, “There shall always be free\npublic elementary and secondary schools in the state. The general assembly shall\nimplement this principle by appropriate legislation.”       Conn. Const. art. 8, § 1.\nMassachusetts’ clause states:\n       Wisdom, and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the\n       body of the people, being necessary for the preservation of their rights\n       and liberties; and as these depend on spreading the opportunities and\n       advantages of education in the various parts of the country, and among\n       the different orders of the people, it shall be the duty of legislatures and\n       magistrates, in all future periods of this commonwealth, to cherish the\n       interests of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries of them;\n       especially the university at Cambridge, public schools and grammar\n       schools in the towns . . . .\nMass. Const. pt. 2 ch. V, § 2 (emphasis added). New Hampshire’s provides:\n       Knowledge and learning, generally diffused through a community, being\n       essential to the preservation of a free government; and spreading the\n       opportunities and advantages of education through the various parts of\n       the country, being highly conducive to promote this end; it shall be the\n       duty of the legislators and magistrates, in all future periods of this\n       government, to cherish the interest of literature and the sciences, and all\n       seminaries and public schools. . .\nN.H. Const. pt. 2, art. 83 (emphasis added).\n\f                                     28\n      wherein tuition shall be without charge, and equally open to\n      all.\n\nInd. Const. art. 8, § 1 (emphasis added). The court noted that the clause\n\n“expresses two duties”—the first being “general and aspirational,” i.e., to\n\nencourage moral, intellectual, scientific, and agricultural improvement;\n\nthe second being “more concrete,” i.e., to provide for free public schools\n\nopen to all. Bonner, 907 N.E.2d at 520. In the court’s view “[j]udicial\n\nenforceability is more plausible as to the second duty than the first.” Id.\n\nThus, the court found that this section required the legislature to\nestablish free public schools, but “does not impose upon government an\n\naffirmative duty to achieve any particular standard of resulting\n\neducational quality.     This determination is delegated to the sound\n\nlegislative discretion of the General Assembly.” Id. at 522. Quoting an\n\nearlier case, the Indiana Supreme Court concluded that “ ‘determining\n\nthe components of a public education is left within the authority of the\n\nlegislative branch of government.’ ” Id. at 521–22 (quoting Nagy ex rel.\n\nNagy v. Evansville-Vanderburgh Sch. Corp., 844 N.E.2d 481, 491 (Ind.\n\n2006)).\n\n      Asked at oral argument to furnish an example where an education\n\nclause similar to Iowa’s had been found justiciable, plaintiffs’ counsel\n\ncited Texas. See Edgewood Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Meno, 917 S.W.2d 717,\n\n735–37 (Tex. 1995) (holding that the Texas Constitution contains a\n\njusticiable standard with respect to education). But the Texas provision\n\nis worded quite differently: “[I]t shall be the duty of the Legislature of the\n\nState to establish and make suitable provision for the support and\n\nmaintenance of an efficient system of public free schools.” Tex. Const.\n\nart. VII, § 1. Other than the word “suitable,” the two clauses bear little\n\nsimilarity.   The Texas Constitution expressly requires the support and\n\f                                             29\n\nmaintenance of “an efficient system of public free schools.”                          Iowa’s\n\nrequires only the “encourage[ment]” of “the promotion of intellectual,\n\nscientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.” Compare Iowa Const.\n\nart. IX, div. 2, § 3, with Tex. Const. art. VII, § 1.                  Adding the word\n\n“suitable” to either clause, or both, does not alter the basic contrast\n\nbetween      an   amorphous         goal   (“intellectual,     scientific,    moral,     and\n\nagricultural improvement”) and a more specific one (“the support and\n\nmaintenance of an efficient system of public free schools”). Id.\n\n       It bears emphasis that Iowa’s education clause, unlike the\n\nconstitutions of most other states, does not mandate free public\n\nschools. 15 Nor does the education clause require that the state’s public\n\n           15See Alaska Const. art.

Kleen involved a question of legislative spending authority. 237 Iowa at 1161,\n23 N.W.2d at 905. We interpreted the education clause as a grant of “broad authority”\nto the legislature. Id. at 1166, 23 N.W.2d at 907. This case involves the question\nwhether the education clause provides justiciable rights and thus limits the legislature.\n      There is a political question doctrine in Iowa as elsewhere. See, e.g., Dwyer, 542\nN.W.2d at 495–96; State ex rel. Turner v. Scott, 269 N.W.2d 828, 831–32 (Iowa 1978).\n\f                                            32\n\neducation clause does not afford a basis for relief under the allegations in\n\nthis case.\n\n       D. The Equal Protection Clause. We now turn to plaintiffs’ claim\n\nthat the defendants have violated the equal protection clause of the Iowa\n\nConstitution. 18 Article I, section 6 provides:\n\n       All laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation;\n       the General Assembly shall not grant to any citizen, or class\n       of citizens, privileges or immunities, which, upon the same\n       terms shall not equally belong to all citizens.\n\nIowa Const. art. I, § 6.\n\n\n_______________________________\nSometimes, “doing our job” involves recognizing that the clause in question delegates\nauthority to another branch of government. But we defer to another day whether\nclaims by public school students and parents under the education clause relating to the\nquality of their education present a nonjusticiable political question.\n       18We   have regularly referred to article I, section 6 as the “equal protection\nclause” of the Iowa Constititution. See, e.g., Rojas v. Pine Ridge Farms, L.L.C., 779\nN.W.2d 223, 229 (Iowa 2010); War Eagle Vill. Apartments v. Plummer, 775 N.W.2d 714,\n723 (Iowa 2009); Varnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862, 872 (Iowa 2009); State v. Wade, 757\nN.W.2d 618, 621 (Iowa 2008); State v. Mitchell, 757 N.W.2d 431, 435 (Iowa 2008);\nTimberland Partners XXI, LLP v. Iowa Dep’t of Revenue, 757 N.W.2d 172, 173–74 (Iowa\n2008); Houck v. Iowa Bd. of Pharmacy Exam’rs, 752 N.W.2d 14, 21 (Iowa 2008); In re\nDet. of Hennings, 744 N.W.2d 333, 338–39 (Iowa 2008); Ames Rental Prop. Ass’n v. City\nof Ames, 736 N.W.2d 255, 261 (Iowa 2007); In re S.A.J.B., 679 N.W.2d 645, 648 (Iowa\n2004). On a few occasions, none more recent than 2001, we have referred to it as the\n“privileges and immunities clause.” See Perkins v. Bd. of Supervisors, 636 N.W.2d 58,\n71 (Iowa 2001); Utilicorp United Inc. v. Iowa Utils. Bd., 570 N.W.2d 451, 455 (Iowa 1997);\nBennett v. City of Redfield, 446 N.W.2d 467, 474 (Iowa 1989); Koch v. Kostichek, 409\nN.W.2d 680, 683 (Iowa 1987).\n        While labels should not affect the underlying analysis, it is important to\nrecognize that article I, section 6, like the Federal Equal Protection Clause, deals with\nequality and uniformity—i.e., laws “of a general nature” having “a uniform operation”\nand the legislature not granting privileges to a citizen or class of citizens that “upon the\nsame terms [do] not equally belong to all citizens.” In this respect, it resembles the\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. By the\nsame token, it differs dramatically from the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which by its terms protects certain\nprivileges and immunities of “citizens of the United States” from being abridged by the\nstates. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. The Fourteenth Amendment Privileges and\nImmunities Clause shields certain rights of national citizenship from state interference.\nSaenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 501–504, 119 S. Ct. 1518, 1525–27, 143 L. Ed. 2d 689,\n704–05 (1999).\n\f                                           33\n\n       At the outset, we do not agree with the district court’s conclusion\n\nthat plaintiffs’ equal protection claim presents a nonjusticiable political\n\nquestion. Typically, we decide claims brought by individuals who allege\n\ndenial of their constitutional right to equal protection, even when the\n\nclaim pertains to an area where the legislative branch has been vested\n\nwith considerable authority. See, e.g., Luse, 254 N.W.2d at 328 (holding\n\nthat an equal protection challenge to a general assembly election contest\n\nwas justiciable notwithstanding the authority conferred by article III,\n\nsection 7 to each house to determine such matters). Equal protection\n\njurisprudence has a set of standards that we have applied in the past.\n\nCf. Dwyer,        542    N.W.2d     at   495    (discussing    the      elements   of    a\n\nnonjusticiable political question and treating a “lack of judicially\n\ndiscoverable and manageable standards” as one such element). 19                         We\n\ntherefore turn to the merits of plaintiffs’ equal protection claim.\n\n       We begin our discussion with Exira Community School District v.\n\nState, 512 N.W.2d 787 (Iowa 1994), a case where we previously\n\nconfronted both an equal protection and a substantive due process\n\nchallenge relating to education (and reached the merits of the challenge).\n\nIn that case, the Exira Community School District and Exira parent-\ntaxpayers and students sued to invalidate a provision of the state’s open\n\nenrollment statute 20 that required the school district of residence to pay\n\ntuition to the district into which the student had open enrolled. Exira,\n\n512 N.W.2d at 789–90. About ten percent of students living in the Exira\n\n       19We   are not holding that a claim under the equal protection clause can never\npresent a nonjusticiable political question. See, e.g., Vieth v. Jubelirer, 541 U.S. 267,\n281–306, 125 S. Ct. 1769, 1778–92, 158 L. Ed. 2d 546, 560–76 (2004) (stating the view\nof four Justices that partisan gerrymandering claims under the Federal Equal\nProtection Clause and other U.S. constitutional provisions constitute a nonjusticiable\npolitical question).\n       20The   provision is now found at Iowa Code section 282.18(7).\n\f                                     34\n\ndistrict had open enrolled into another, larger school district (Audubon).\n\nId. at 789. Because the financing mechanism required Exira to transfer\n\nfunds, this had resulted in a substantial shortfall in available spending\n\nfor the remaining Exira students and “financial trouble for the district.”\n\nId. at 793–94.      Although we found the Exira district itself lacked\n\nstanding, id. at 790, we reached the merits of the equal protection and\n\nsubstantive due process challenges brought by the parent-taxpayers and\n\nstudents under both the U.S. and the Iowa Constitutions.                  We\n\nsummarized their complaints as follows:\n\n      They believe the financing mechanism in section 282.18(8) is\n      unreasonable because it requires a transfer of locally\n      generated tax revenues without a showing of need. What the\n      appellants want is a financing scheme that would require a\n      showing that the receiving district “needs” the tax dollars\n      more than the sending district. Otherwise—the appellants\n      argue—a significant loss of students could ultimately destroy\n      a sending district.\n\n             ....\n\n            Appellants’ complaint boils down to this. Before open\n      enrollment, the state had achieved through the financing\n      formula educational equality for every student in Iowa.\n      During the first year of open enrollment, Exira experienced a\n      $70,000 loss in tax revenues necessary to educate the\n      students remaining in the Exira school district.         This\n      resulted in a substantial disparity in funds available for\n      education between Exira and Audubon. This disparity has\n      disturbed the educational equality previously existing.\n\nId. at 793–94.\n\n      Significantly, the plaintiffs in Exira did not allege that the statute\n\nin question infringed upon a fundamental right. Id. at 793. Thus, for\n\nboth equal protection and substantive due process purposes, we applied\n\nthe rational basis test. Id. Quoting an earlier case, we held that when a\n\nstatute bears “ ‘a definite, rational relationship to a legitimate purpose,’ ”\n\nit must be allowed to stand.       Id. (quoting Kent v. Polk Cnty. Bd. of\n\f                                       35\n\nSupervisors, 391 N.W.2d 220, 225 (Iowa 1986)). This is true even if the\n\nreasonableness of the nexus to the purported end is only “ ‘fairly\n\ndebatable.’ ”     Id.   Further, the challenging party must negate every\n\nreasonable basis upon which the statute may be sustained. Id.\n\n      Applying the rational basis test, we found that the financing\n\nmechanism        “easily   passes   constitutional   muster”   because   open\n\nenrollment results in greater access to educational opportunities and the\n\nlegislature’s chosen method of financing open enrollment “maintains per\n\npupil equity.” Id. at 795. Regarding the parent-taxpayers’ “relative need”\n\nargument, i.e., that the Exira district needed the money it was\n\ntransferring to Audubon in order to survive, we commented, “In the final\n\nanalysis, the appellants’ relative need argument is really all about a\n\nschool district’s alleged due process right to exist.”         Id.   We then\n\nresponded to this argument as follows:\n\n             If it chooses to do so, the legislature can—without\n      constitutional impediment—terminate a school district’s\n      existence.       And when the legislature enacted open\n      enrollment legislation, it knew full well that its ultimate\n      effect might mean the demise of some smaller schools.\n      Despite this knowledge, the legislature made a policy\n      decision—right or wrong—to go with open enrollment. It is\n      not for us to judge the wisdom of such a policy. That was a\n      legislative call.\n\n            In yielding the call to the legislative branch of\n      government, we are not insensitive to the feelings and\n      strongly-held views of patrons of smaller schools, such as\n      the Exira school. We recognize that individuals and families\n      sense a way of life is in the balance and vehemently\n      challenge any assumption that centralization of schools\n      improves the quality of education. The proper forum for this\n      debate is however not in the courts, but in the other\n      branches of state government. Our clear duty is to interpret\n      and apply the law given to us, and not to develop or choose\n      among schemes for public education.\n\nId. at 795–96.\n\f                                    36\n\n      At the end of our opinion, we turned specifically to the due process\n\nand equal protection claims of the Exira students.      We rejected their\n\nsubstantive due process claim, observing, “We know of no authority that\n\nsays a student’s desire to be educated in a certain school district [i.e.,\n\nExira] rises to the level of a right protected by due process.” Id. at 796.\n\nWe added that a student has “a due process right to an adequate\n\neducation,” but noted, “That right—as we have demonstrated [in our\n\nprevious rational basis analysis]—is furthered, not diminished, by the\n\nfunding mechanism in section 282.18(8).”      Id.   We also overruled the\n\nstudents’ equal protection challenge, stating: “Nor do we think such\n\nstudents are treated differently for equal protection purposes. We say\n\nthis because section 282.18(8) assures every student roughly the same\n\namount of funds for his or her education wherever that student is\n\neducated.” Id. In short, we concluded that the statute “does indeed have\n\na rational basis,” which “disposes of” both the equal protection and the\n\nsubstantive due process challenges. Id.\n\n      We believe several lessons can be drawn from Exira.        First, we\n\nrecognized that students have a due process right to an adequate\n\neducation, although we did not characterize it as a fundamental right.\n\nId. at 796. (The plaintiffs did not allege that a fundamental right was at\n\nissue in their case, id. at 793, and we accepted that position for purposes\n\nof our decision.)   Second, we held there is no due process right to be\n\neducated in a particular school district. Id. at 796. Third, we found a\n\nfunding mechanism that assured roughly the same amount of per-pupil\n\nfunding regardless of the district did not treat students differently or\n\nviolate equal protection. Id. Finally, we expressed the view that debates\n\nover whether “centralization of schools improves the quality of education”\n\nbelonged in the legislature and not the courts. Id. at 795–96.\n\f                                    37\n\n      As an initial matter, we note that any equal protection claim,\n\nwhether in the education context or elsewhere, requires an allegation of\n\ndisparate treatment, not merely disparate impact.       Indeed, plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel conceded as much at oral argument. To allege a viable equal\n\nprotection claim, plaintiffs must allege that the defendants are treating\n\nsimilarly situated persons differently.    Thus, in State v. Wade, we\n\nrejected an argument that a special sentence for both felony and\n\nmisdemeanor sex offenders violated equal protection. 757 N.W.2d 618,\n\n625 (Iowa 2008). We explained, “Even though Wade has identified two\n\nclasses that are similarly situated, Wade’s equal protection argument\n\nfails because . . . offenders who commit serious misdemeanor sex crimes\n\nand offenders who commit felony sex crimes are not treated differently.”\n\nId.; see also Ames Rental Prop. Ass’n v. City of Ames, 736 N.W.2d 255,\n\n259 (Iowa 2007) (plaintiffs met this threshold by alleging that tenants\n\nwho were related and tenants who were unrelated received differential\n\ntreatment); Montoy v. State, 120 P.3d 306, 308 (Kan. 2005) (holding that\n\n“disparate impact” of Kansas’s school financing scheme on minorities\n\nand other classes could not establish an equal protection violation).\n\n      A related way of saying the same thing is to point out that equal\n\nprotection claims require “state action.” Disparate treatment by someone\n\nother than the state (which the state, because of its inaction, failed to\n\nprevent) generally does not amount to an equal protection violation. See\n\nPrincipal Cas. Ins. Co. v. Blair, 500 N.W.2d 67, 69–70 (Iowa 1993)\n\n(holding that the presence of an allegedly discriminatory family insurance\n\nclause in a private insurance policy did not violate either the Federal or\n\f                                          38\n\nthe State Equal Protection Clause because this was “not an action of the\n\nstate”). 21\n\n        But as we have noted above, the petition contains no allegations of\n\ndisparate treatment.       Plaintiffs do not allege that the defendants have\n\nallocated fewer funds to students attending school districts like West\n\nHarrison, Davenport, and Des Moines, or that they have imposed\n\ndifferent rules or requirements with respect to those districts. Plaintiffs’\n\ntheory, rather, is that the defendants have not taken sufficient\n\naffirmative steps to eliminate perceived differences in outcomes, e.g.,\n\ngaps in average student achievement, teacher experience level, and the\n\nlike.   One can describe that theory in various ways, but it is not an\n\nallegation of disparate treatment by these defendants. See, e.g., City of\n\nCoralville v. Iowa Utils. Bd., 750 N.W.2d 523, 530–31 (Iowa 2008)\n\n(rejecting an equal protection challenge to a utility law that applied\n\nequally to all communities but with different results in different locales\n\non the ground that it was “in substance a misplaced argument for\n\nuniformity of consequences rather than uniformity of operation”). 22 For\n\nthis reason, plaintiffs’ equal protection claim was properly dismissed.\n\n\n\n        21This  is not imposing an “intent” requirement. We are not saying the State\nneeds to have intentionally discriminated against students from West Harrison, or\nDavenport, or Des Moines, for example. But the State must have done something that\ntreats these students differently from other students, as opposed to merely having failed\nto enact statewide standards and requirements favored by the plaintiffs. In a disparate\nfunding case, the unequal funding can itself constitute the denial of equal protection,\nbut plaintiffs do not allege there are any discrepancies of funding in Iowa.\n        22Plaintiffs allege that they are being denied “equal access” to education, but\n\nthese catchwords obscure a critical point. Nothing in the petition alleges that the\ndefendants (i.e., the state government and state officials of Iowa) have passed any law,\nadopted any regulation, or undertaken any measure that treats students differently\nfrom one district to another. To the contrary, plaintiffs fault the defendants for not\nimplementing statewide standards that would affirmatively eradicate district-to-district\ndifferences—e.g., in average student performance or average teacher qualification.\n“Failure to equalize differences” is not the same as treating people differently.\n\f                                      39\n\n      Even if we could discern some allegation of disparate treatment in\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations, we would still not be persuaded that they have\n\nstated a claim. Unless a suspect class or a fundamental right is at issue,\n\nequal protection claims are reviewed under the rational basis test.\n\nSanchez, 692 N.W.2d at 817. Plaintiffs do not allege that a suspect class\n\nis involved, but they claim that education is a fundamental right. For\n\npurposes   of   federal   constitutional   analysis,   education   is   not   a\n\nfundamental right. San Antonio Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S.\n\n1, 35, 93 S. Ct. 1273, 1297, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16, 44 (1973); see also Plyler v.\n\nDoe, 457 U.S. 202, 223, 102 S. Ct. 2382, 2398, 72 L. Ed. 2d 786, 803\n\n(1982) (“Nor is education a fundamental right; a State need not justify by\n\ncompelling necessity every variation in the manner in which education is\n\nprovided to its population.”).\n\n      This does not control the analysis under the Iowa Constitution.\n\nTrue, in Exira, we quoted from Rodriguez and relied on its reasoning.\n\nExira, 512 N.W.2d at 794–95.         In discussing that decision, we said,\n\n“Although important, education is not a fundamental right.” Id. at 794.\n\nBut as we have noted, the Exira plaintiffs were not maintaining that the\n\nchallenged law intruded upon a fundamental right. Id. at 793. Thus, we\n\nbelieve it remains an open question whether education is a fundamental\n\nright under the Iowa Constitution.\n\n      We have recently said,\n\n      [N]either this court nor the Supreme Court has created a\n      clear test for determining whether the claimed right is a\n      fundamental right. . . . [O]nly rights and liberties that are\n      objectively “ ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and\n      tradition’ ” and “ ‘implicit in the concept of ordered liberty’ ”\n      qualify as fundamental.\n\nHensler v. City of Davenport, 790 N.W.2d 569, 581 (Iowa 2010) (citation\n\nomitted) (quoting Chavez v. Martinez, 538 U.S. 760, 775, 123 S. Ct.\n\f                                    40\n\n1994, 2005, 155 L. Ed. 2d 984, 999 (2003)); accord Seering, 701 N.W.2d\n\nat 664 (declining to hold freedom of choice in residence to be a\n\nfundamental right even though it is “of keen interest to any individual”).\n\nFundamental rights are generally those explicitly or implicitly contained\n\nin the Constitution.    Plyler, 457 U.S. at 218 n.15, 102 S. Ct. at 2395\n\nn.15, 72 L. Ed. 2d at 799 n.15; Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at 817. We have\n\ntraditionally followed the U.S. Supreme Court’s guidance in determining\n\nwhich rights are deemed fundamental. Seering, 701 N.W.2d at 664; In re\n\nDet. of Cubbage, 671 N.W.2d 442, 447 (Iowa 2003). “Fundamental right”\n\nfor purposes of constitutional review is not a synonym for “important.”\n\nMany important interests, such as the right to choose one’s residence or\n\nthe right to drive a vehicle, do not qualify as fundamental rights. See\n\nSeering, 701 N.W.2d at 664; Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at 817.\n\n      In Serrano v. Priest, 5 Cal. 3d 584, 608–09 (1971), the California\n\nSupreme Court relied on California’s similarly worded education clause\n\nas one—but by no means the only—supporting consideration for its\n\nconclusion that education was a fundamental right under the California\n\nConstitution.    Article IX, section 1 of the California Constitution is\n\nentitled “Encouragement of education” and reads in its entirety as\n\nfollows:\n\n      A general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being\n      essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the\n      people, the Legislature shall encourage by all suitable means\n      the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and\n      agricultural improvement.\n\nCal. Const. art. IX, § 1.\n\n      While California apparently borrowed some of this wording from\n\nthe Iowa Constitution, see Crosby v. Lyon, 37 Cal. 242, 245 (1869), its\n\neducation clause is essentially a stand-alone provision.       In Iowa, by\n\f                                     41\n\ncontrast, the education clause is the first sentence of a funding section\n\nentitled “Perpetual support fund” that, in turn, falls within a series of\n\nfunding provisions. Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 2, § 3.\n\n      Contrasting with the reasoning of the California Supreme Court is\n\nthat of the Indiana Supreme Court. In Bonner, the court affirmed the\n\ndismissal of the plaintiffs’ state equal protection and due process claims,\n\ndetermining that there was no fundamental constitutional right to an\n\nadequate public education in Indiana. 907 N.E.2d at 522. The court\n\nreached this result despite the presence of an education clause similar to\n\nIowa’s in the Indiana Constitution. The court noted that the clause “does\n\nnot speak in terms of a right or entitlement to education” and that the\n\nIndiana Bill of Rights contains no reference to education. Id. The same\n\nis true in Iowa. The “Bill of Rights” and “Right of Suffrage” in the Iowa\n\nConstitution make no mention of education. See Iowa Const. arts. I, II.\n\n      We defer to another day the question whether education can\n\namount to a fundamental right under the Iowa Constitution, thereby\n\ntriggering heightened scrutiny.      For present purposes, we conclude\n\nsimply that the matters alleged in plaintiffs’ petition, even if true, do not\n\namount to a deprivation of such a right.          In Hensler, we recently\n\nacknowledged there is a fundamental parental right to exercise care,\n\ncustody, and control over children. 790 N.W.2d at 581–82. Yet not all\n\nalleged infringements upon this right trigger strict scrutiny. Id. at 582.\n\nRather, we required in Hensler that the challenged governmental action\n\n“directly and substantially intrude into [the parent’s] decision-making\n\nauthority over her child.” Id. at 583. Similarly here, even if we assume\n\nthere is a fundamental right to a basic education at some level, the\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations do not show a denial of that right.     No plaintiff\n\nalleges anything specific to his or her (or his or her child’s) own actual\n\f                                    42\n\neducation.      Rather, their allegations are largely a hodgepodge of\n\nstatistics. Some of these numbers relate to Iowa’s performance as a state\n\nand show a deterioration or decline in Iowa’s ranking or a below-average\n\nscore.     Others relate to ACT scores, reading proficiency, and math\n\nproficiency ratings in the Davenport, Des Moines, or West Harrison\n\nschool districts. These data, in the plaintiffs’ view, demonstrate the need\n\nfor more statewide standards and requirements.       But even if all true,\n\nthey do not amount to a deprivation of a fundamental right as to these\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n         In Exira, we commented that the proper forum for debate over\n\nschool centralization is “not in the courts, but in the other branches of\n\nstate government.”    512 N.W.2d at 796.     In a way, this case involves\n\nanother phase of the same debate.          These plaintiffs want greater\n\ncentralization–—“state-mandated standards,” state-mandated “specific\n\ntesting of students at various educational levels in a variety of subject\n\nmatters,” and a state-mandated “professional pay system for educators.”\n\n         Because in this particular case the allegations do not show a\n\ndeprivation of a fundamental right, even if we assume there is a\n\nfundamental right to education at some level, we apply the rational basis\n\ntest.    In previous discussions of both the Federal and the Iowa Equal\n\nProtection Clause, we have found a rational basis review applies when\n\n“ ‘social or economic legislation is at issue.’ ” Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at\n\n817 (quoting City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440,\n\n105 S. Ct. 3249, 3254, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313, 320 (1985)). This is when “ ‘the\n\nEqual Protection Clause allows the States wide latitude, and the\n\nConstitution presumes that even improvident decisions will eventually be\n\nrectified by the democratic processes.’ ”     Id.; accord Midwest Check\n\f                                         43\n\nCashing, Inc. v. Richey, 728 N.W.2d 396, 404–05 (Iowa 2007); Asmus v.\n\nWaterloo Cmty. Sch. Dist., 722 N.W.2d 653, 658 (Iowa 2006).\n\n      The rational basis test is a “deferential standard.”            Ames Rental\n\nProp. Ass’n, 736 N.W.2d at 259.           Under this test, we must determine\n\nwhether   the     classification    is   “rationally   related   to   a   legitimate\n\ngovernmental interest.”       Id.    The classification is valid “unless the\n\nrelationship between the classification and the purpose behind it is so\n\nweak the classification must be viewed as arbitrary or capricious.” Id.\n\nThe government is not required or expected to produce evidence to justify\n\nits action.     Id.   To the contrary, the plaintiff “must negate every\n\nreasonable basis upon which the classification may be sustained.”\n\nBierkamp v. Rogers, 293 N.W.2d 577, 579–80 (Iowa 1980); see also State\n\nv. Willard, 756 N.W.2d 207, 213 (Iowa 2008); Ames Rental Prop. Ass’n,\n\n736 N.W.2d at 259.\n\n      Depending on the circumstances, a rational basis challenge can be\n\nresolved on a motion to dismiss. See, e.g., Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at 817–\n\n20 (affirming the dismissal of equal protection and due process claims\n\nbrought by undocumented aliens challenging the state’s refusal to issue\n\ndriver’s licenses); Johnston v. Veterans’ Plaza Auth., 535 N.W.2d 131,\n\n131–32 (Iowa 1995) (affirming dismissal of plaintiff’s claim and rejecting\n\nplaintiff’s contention that the thirty-day appeal timeframe contained in\n\nthe statutory right to appeal a condemnation appraisement violated\n\nequal protection and due process because plaintiff “does not rebut” the\n\npossible basis for the distinction suggested by the defendant, “nor does\n\nhe attempt to negate any other rational basis for the distinction”); Gard v.\n\nLittle Sioux Intercounty Drainage Dist., 521 N.W.2d 696, 698–99 (Iowa\n\n1994) (affirming the dismissal of a negligence action against drainage\n\ndistrict including claim that immunity for district amounted to a denial\n\f                                           44\n\nof equal protection); Seivert v. Resnick, 342 N.W.2d 484, 485 (Iowa 1984)\n\n(affirming the grant of motion to dismiss by applying the rational basis\n\ntest to reject a claim that an Iowa statute impermissibly distinguished\n\namong tortfeasors). Since the State does not have to produce evidence,\n\nand only a “plausible” justification is required, see Ames Rental Prop.\n\nAss’n, 736 N.W.2d at 259, there are certainly occasions where a rational\n\nbasis test can be applied on the pleadings without taking evidence. In\n\nthis case, unless the well-pleaded facts (if true) would show that Iowa’s\n\neducational system is not rationally related to a legitimate state goal,\n\nthere is no reason for the case to proceed further.\n\n       Disregarding plaintiffs’ legal conclusions (for example, that Iowa’s\n\neducation system is “irrational, arbitrary and capricious” or that the\n\ndefendants have failed to provide an “effective education”), 23 we are left\n\nwith the following allegations: (1) Iowa has fewer state standards and\n\nrequirements than other states (although it has some); (2) Iowa’s schools\n\nhave a mediocre national ranking on some measures according to some\n\nsources; (3) the smaller school districts in Iowa on average have less\n\nexperienced and credentialed teachers and offer fewer classes; (4) three\n\ndistricts (Davenport, Des Moines, and West Harrison) have substantial\npercentages of students who are not demonstrating proficiency in\n\nreading and math according to certain standardized tests; and (5) one\n\ndistrict (West Harrison) does not do a good job of preparing students for\n\ncollege. Plaintiffs attribute the last four points to the first—that is, they\n\nblame the lack of state-mandated standards in various areas for the\n\nundistinguished rankings on certain national score charts and the\n\n\n       23Ifthere is a constitutional right to an “effective education,” then alleging that\nthe defendants have failed to provide such an education amounts to a mere legal\nconclusion.\n\f                                    45\n\nconcerns noted with respect to smaller and larger school districts. But\n\nfor purposes of the rational basis test, we need only find a reasonable\n\nrelationship to a legitimate state purpose.    See, e.g., Comm. for Educ.\n\nRights, 672 N.E.2d at 1196 (affirming dismissal of complaint on this\n\nground after applying rational basis test and finding Illinois’s system for\n\nfunding public education rationally related to the legitimate state\n\npurpose of local control).\n\n      We can conceive of a rational basis for the set of circumstances\n\ndescribed by plaintiffs. The Iowa legislature may have decided that local\n\nschool board autonomy is preferable in certain instances to state\n\nmandates.    The legislature may also have concluded that it is more\n\nequitable to provide an equal or roughly equal amount of resources to\n\neach state school district, on a per capita basis, and then give those\n\nschool districts the primary responsibility for determining how that\n\nmoney will be spent.     See Iowa Code § 257.1(2) (providing that “each\n\nschool district in the state is entitled to receive foundation aid in an\n\namount per pupil equal to the difference between the per pupil\n\nfoundation tax . . . and the combined foundation base per pupil or the\n\ncombined district cost per pupil, whichever is less”). The legislature may\n\nalso have decided that it is important to preserve school districts in rural\n\nareas, even though the smaller size of those districts may not allow them\n\nto offer the same kinds of programs as larger districts. The legislature\n\nmay have determined that time spent on standardized testing of\n\nstudents—and preparation for such tests—detracts from time spent in\n\nother areas of learning. Additionally, the legislature may have decided\n\nthat school districts in Iowa are aware of their students’ math and\n\nreading proficiency rates, but have many other pressing concerns, and\n\f                                             46\n\nthat it would be best to defer to the judgment of local administrators\n\nregarding the areas that require the most attention.\n\n       Local control, equity in per-pupil funding, maintenance of existing\n\nrural school districts, and conservation of scarce classroom time and\n\nresources are all legitimate governmental interests. As claimed interests,\n\nthey are “realistically conceivable.”             Miller v. Boone Cnty. Hosp., 394\n\nN.W.2d 776, 779 (Iowa 1986). Furthermore, the policies decried by the\n\nplaintiffs are at least rationally connected to these goals.                          While\n\nacknowledging the undeniable importance of education, our court has\n\npreviously characterized it as an area where there is no true consensus\n\nand where needs change over time. Thus, we have said that “education\n\nis defined as a broad and comprehensive term with a variable and\n\nindefinite meaning.” In re Petty, 241 Iowa 506, 511, 41 N.W.2d 672, 675\n\n(1950). We have also observed:\n\n       The establishment and the maintenance of an educational\n       system through public schools is an indispensable obligation\n       and function of the State of Iowa.           It should be so\n       maintained as to keep abreast with progress generally, and\n       to meet the needs of the times. This applies not only to the\n       courses of study but also to the teaching force. The policy\n       with respect to either should not be an inflexible one.\n\nTalbott v. Indep. Sch. Dist. of Des Moines, 230 Iowa 949, 967, 299 N.W.\n\n556, 565 (1941).         We cannot say that any state classification scheme\n\nidentified by the petition is so arbitrary as to be unconstitutional. 24\n\n\n        24In Midwest Check Cashing, Inc., the plaintiff brought an equal protection\n\nchallenge to a state law that limited payday loans but allegedly did not limit them\nenough. 728 N.W.2d at 403 (“these limitations are not as protective as Richey would\nlike”). We expressed “serious[] doubt” that the plaintiff had shown sufficient state\naction for equal protection or substantive due process purposes or that she had been\nsufficiently classified for equal protection purposes. Id. at 404 n.6. In any event, we\nfound the law met the rational basis test. Id. at 404–05. This case is somewhat\nsimilar, in that plaintiffs are complaining about the state’s failure to act, not state action\nitself. As we have already discussed, we do not believe the petition alleges actual\ndisparate treatment by the state government as is necessary for an equal protection\n\f                                          47\n\n       In Racing Association of Central Iowa v. Fitzgerald (RACI), 675\n\nN.W.2d 1, 15–16 (2004), we held that a statute taxing gross gambling\n\nreceipts from racetracks at a rate nearly twice the rate imposed on gross\n\ngambling receipts from riverboats violated the Iowa equal protection\n\nclause.     We find RACI readily distinguishable here.                 As noted, the\n\nplaintiffs do not point to anything the defendants have allegedly done to\n\ntreat one group of Iowans different from another.                  Even if disparate\n\ntreatment were alleged, RACI still only requires that the purported\n\nrational basis be “realistically conceivable” and have a “basis in fact”; it\n\nexplicitly “does not require ‘proof’ in the traditional sense.” RACI, 675\n\nN.W.2d at 7–8 & n.4 (quoting Miller, 394 N.W.2d at 779). Providing equal\n\nresources     to   school    districts    while   allowing     those    districts    the\n\nindependence to determine many aspects of educational policy is not\n\nmerely “realistically conceivable” as a legislative purpose, it is the same\n\nlegislative purpose we upheld in Exira.\n\n       RACI has not been the death knell for traditional rational basis\n\nreview. Since RACI was decided, we have continued to uphold legislative\n\nclassifications based on judgments the legislature could have made,\n\nwithout requiring evidence or “proof” in either a traditional or a\n\nnontraditional sense. See Judicial Branch v. Iowa Dist. Ct., 800 N.W.2d\n\n569, 578–79 (Iowa 2011) (holding it was constitutional to remove\n\ndeferred judgments but not dismissals and acquittals from the public\n\ndocket and stating that “[t]he legislature could rationally determine that\n\ndeferred judgments should not be accessible to the public but dismissals\n\nand acquittals should be”); State v. Mitchell, 757 N.W.2d 431, 438–39\n\n(Iowa 2008) (upholding a law that distinguished between married and\n_______________________________\nclaim, but even if it did, the facts alleged do not demonstrate the absence of a rational\nbasis.\n\f                                     48\n\nunmarried sex offenders and finding that “[t]he legislature could have\n\nreasonably    determined    its   chosen    classification   scheme,   which\n\ndifferentiates between cohabitants who are married and those who are\n\nunmarried, would rationally advance the government objective of\n\nprotecting children from sex offenders”); Ames Rental Prop. Ass’n, 736\n\nN.W.2d at 259 (upholding an ordinance limiting the number of unrelated\n\npersons who could live in a house because “[t]he City is not required or\n\nexpected to produce evidence to justify its legislative action”).\n\n      While some members of this court have dissented from some of\n\nthose decisions, claiming they are inconsistent with RACI, see Mitchell,\n\n757 N.W.2d at 442 (Wiggins, J., dissenting), Ames Rental Property Ass’n,\n\n736 N.W.2d at 264 (Wiggins, J., dissenting), they are precedents of this\n\ncourt. In fact, since RACI was decided, we have considered rational basis\n\nequal protection challenges under the Iowa Constitution many times and\n\nupheld such a challenge only once. See Dudley, 766 N.W.2d at 620–24\n\n(upholding a rational basis challenge to the state’s reimbursement laws\n\nfor indigent defense without affording either side an opportunity to\n\npresent evidence). But see Timberland Partners XXI, LLP v. Iowa Dep’t of\n\nRevenue, 757 N.W.2d 172, 175–77 (Iowa 2008) (rejecting an equal\n\nprotection challenge to an administrative rule providing that apartments\n\nwould be taxed at a higher commercial rate and condominiums at a\n\nlower residential rate even if both were used for the same commercial\n\npurposes); State v. Willard, 756 N.W.2d 207, 213–14 (Iowa 2008) (finding\n\nresidency restrictions for convicted sex offenders do not violate equal\n\nprotection); City of Coralville, 750 N.W.2d at 530–31 (Iowa 2008)\n\n(rejecting equal protection challenge to a tariff system); In re Det. of\n\nHennings, 744 N.W.2d 333, 339–40 (Iowa 2008) (finding no equal\n\nprotection violation in denying a right to a bench trial in a sexually\n\f                                     49\n\nviolent predator proceeding but not a criminal case); Midwest Check\n\nCashing, Inc., 728 N.W.2d at 404–05 (finding a rational basis for different\n\ntreatment of payday loans); Asmus, 722 N.W.2d at 658 (rejecting an\n\nequal protection challenge to a higher standard for legal causation in\n\nworkers’ compensation mental injury cases); State v. Simmons, 714\n\nN.W.2d 264, 276–78 (Iowa 2006) (holding that making only defendants\n\nwho plead guilty eligible for a certain reduction in sentence does not\n\nviolate equal protection); Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at 817–19 (holding that\n\ndenying driver’s licenses to illegal aliens does not violate equal\n\nprotection); Claude v. Guar. Nat’l Ins. Co., 679 N.W.2d 659, 664–66 (Iowa\n\n2004) (holding the statutory distinction between hit-and-run and miss-\n\nand-run vehicles for purposes of mandatory uninsured motorist coverage\n\ndid not violate equal protection).\n\n      E. Substantive Due Process. Plaintiffs also allege the defendants\n\nhave violated the due process clause of the Iowa Constitution, which\n\nprovides that “no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property,\n\nwithout due process of law.” Iowa Const. art. I, § 9. For the reasons\n\nalready discussed with respect to equal protection, we believe plaintiffs’\n\nsubstantive due process claim is justiciable.        We have a familiar\n\nanalytical framework under which to analyze such claims, and we have\n\nreached the merits of such a claim in the field of education before. See\n\nExira, 512 N.W.2d at 793–96.\n\n      Substantive due process prevents the government “ ‘from engaging\n\nin conduct that shocks the conscience or interferes with rights implicit in\n\nthe concept of ordered liberty.’ ” Zaber v. City of Dubuque, 789 N.W.2d\n\n634, 640 (Iowa 2010) (quoting Atwood v. Vilsack, 725 N.W.2d 641, 647\n\n(Iowa 2006)); State v. Hernandez-Lopez, 639 N.W.2d 226, 237 (Iowa\n\n2002).   With a substantive due process claim, we follow a two-stage\n\f                                      50\n\nanalysis. Hensler, 790 N.W.2d at 580. First, we determine the nature of\n\nthe individual right involved, then the appropriate level of scrutiny. Id. If\n\nthe right at issue is fundamental, strict scrutiny applies; otherwise, the\n\nstate only has to satisfy the rational basis test. Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at\n\n819–20.    When the rational basis test applies, there need only be a\n\n“reasonable fit” between the legislature’s purpose and the means chosen\n\nto advance that purpose. Zaber, 789 N.W.2d at 640. We have said that\n\n“ ‘[t]he doctrine of judicial self-restraint requires us to exercise the\n\nutmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in th[e] field [of\n\nsubstantive due process].’ ” Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at 819 (quoting Reno\n\nv. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302, 113 S. Ct. 1439, 1447, 123 L. Ed. 2d 1, 16\n\n(1993)).\n\n      As we have already noted, the petition does not allege wrongful\n\nacts by the defendants. Instead, it asserts the defendants’ inaction has\n\ninfringed upon plaintiffs’ rights. Generally, plaintiffs allege the State and\n\nits officials have failed to establish sufficient state-wide standards or\n\nfailed to enforce and utilize such standards. Yet this court has indicated\n\nthe purpose of substantive due process is to protect citizens when the\n\ngovernment engages in actual conduct (i.e., governmental action) that\n\ninfringes or interferes with rights. In re Det. of Hennings, 744 N.W.2d at\n\n337 (“Governmental action violates principles of substantive due process\n\nwhen . . . .”); Atwood, 725 N.W.2d at 647 (“Substantive due process\n\nprinciples preclude the government ‘from engaging in conduct . . . .’ ”\n\n(citation omitted)); Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at 819 (“Substantive due\n\nprocess    ‘ “provides   heightened        protection   against   government\n\ninterference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.” ’ ”\n\n(quoting Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65, 120 S. Ct. 2054, 2060, 147\n\nL. Ed. 2d 49, 56 (2000))); Hernandez-Lopez, 639 N.W.2d at 238 (“We\n\f                                     51\n\nmust then determine whether the government action infringing . . . .”).\n\nWe have previously expressed “serious doubt” about the viability of a\n\nsubstantive due process theory based on the notion that the government\n\nfailed to act. Midwest Check Cashing, Inc., 728 N.W.2d at 404 n.6.\n\n      Regardless, there is an additional reason why we conclude\n\nplaintiffs have not alleged facts that, if true, would amount to a denial of\n\nsubstantive due process.     As we have already pointed out, we are not\n\ndeciding today whether there is a fundamental right to a basic education\n\nembraced within the Iowa Constitution.       If there is such a right, the\n\nplaintiffs have not alleged that they have been deprived of it. Therefore,\n\nthe rational basis test applies.\n\n      Typically, when the rational basis test is involved, we evaluate that\n\nbasis similarly for equal protection and due process purposes. Midwest\n\nCheck Cashing, Inc., 728 N.W.2d at 405; Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at 820\n\n(concluding that “[f]or the reasons discussed in the equal protection\n\nanalysis,” a statute meets the rational basis test and does not violate\n\nsubstantive due process).     For the rational basis test to be met, there\n\nneed only be a reasonable fit between the governmental interest and the\n\nmeans utilized to advance that interest. The legislature need not employ\n\nthe best means of achieving that interest. Hensler, 790 N.W.2d at 584.\n\nThe plaintiff by contrast must negate every reasonable basis upon which\n\nthe government’s act may be sustained. Zaber, 789 N.W.2d at 640.\n\n      Our decision in Exira illustrates how the rational basis test works\n\nin practice. Applying that test, we found the financing provision of the\n\nopen enrollment statute to be constitutional because it gave “access to\n\neducational opportunities” even though “its ultimate effect might mean\n\nthe demise of some smaller schools.” Exira, 512 N.W.2d at 795–96. “It is\n\nnot for us to judge the wisdom of such a policy. That was a legislative\n\f                                     52\n\ncall.” Id. at 795. “Our clear duty is to interpret and apply the law given\n\nto us, and not to develop or choose among schemes for public\n\neducation.” Id. at 796. In other words, the possibility that the financing\n\nprovision could be counterproductive and lead to fewer educational\n\nopportunities (due to “the demise of some smaller schools”) was not\n\nrelevant to a rational basis analysis.\n\n      For the reasons already discussed under equal protection, we\n\nbelieve the plaintiffs have not alleged facts that if true would establish a\n\nsubstantive due process violation. They have alleged certain aspects of\n\nIowa’s K–12 educational performance, by some criteria, are mediocre or\n\neven below national averages.        They have alleged Iowa has fewer\n\nstatewide standards than other states. They have alleged some urban\n\n(Davenport and Des Moines) and rural (West Harrison) districts offer\n\nfewer services or, on average, have less favorable educational outcomes\n\nthan other districts. These allegations undoubtedly raise important and\n\nlegitimate concerns for education policymakers to consider. But they do\n\nnot “shock the conscience” as representing abusive governmental\n\nconduct.    See State ex rel. Miller v. Smokers Warehouse Corp., 737\n\nN.W.2d 107, 111 (Iowa 2007) (stating that substantive due process “ ‘is\n\nreserved for the most egregious governmental abuses against liberty or\n\nproperty rights’ ” (quoting Blumenthal Inv. Trusts v. City of W. Des\n\nMoines, 636 N.W.2d 255, 265 (Iowa 2001))).         According to the 2007\n\nDepartment of Education report cited by plaintiffs in their petition, for\n\n2005–06, Iowa ranked 37th nationally in per-pupil spending, rated\n\nsubstantially above the national average in NAEP fourth and eighth\n\ngrade reading and mathematics achievement, and rated substantially\n\nabove the national average in SAT and AP test scores.          The Annual\n\nCondition of Education at 196, 201, 205, 245.       Again, these statistics\n\f                                           53\n\nwarrant consideration by education policymakers, but they do not rise to\n\nthe level of a constitutional violation. We conclude that plaintiffs have\n\nnot stated a claim for deprivation of substantive due process based on\n\nthe defendants’ alleged failure to do more to advance the cause of public\n\neducation in this state. 25\n\n       In rejecting the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims, we emphasize\n\nagain that this is not a case involving alleged disparities in education\n\nfunding.       Rather,     the   plaintiffs     allege   the   defendants       have    a\n\nconstitutional duty—enforceable by Iowa’s judiciary—to improve the\n\nquality of the education they are receiving. In the relatively few instances\n\nwhere such quality-based claims have been asserted and have advanced\n\npast a motion to dismiss in other states, that has occurred because the\n\nstate’s founders enshrined a particular educational mandate in the state\n\nconstitution.     Thus, in Connecticut Coalition for Justice in Education\n\nFunding v. Rell, the Connecticut Supreme Court relied on a state\n\nconstitutional provision guaranteeing a right to “free public elementary\n\nand secondary schools in the state.” 990 A.2d 206, 212 n.1 (Conn. 2010)\n\n(quoting Conn. Const. art. 8, § 1).               As we have discussed, Iowa’s\n\ndelegates voted down an analogous provision in 1857. Similarly, in Rose\n\nv. Council for Better Education, Inc., the Kentucky Supreme Court noted\n\n\n       25We believe the only relevant due process concept here is one of substantive\n\ndue process, not procedural due process. Procedural due process requires that certain\nprocedures be afforded (e.g., notice and an opportunity to be heard) before the\ngovernment deprives a citizen of a liberty or property interest. Smokers Warehouse\nCorp., 737 N.W.2d at 111. The plaintiffs are not complaining about the procedures by\nwhich educational laws and requirements have been enacted in Iowa or applied to\nthemselves.    They do not dispute that those policy choices have been made\ndemocratically by the people’s elected representatives in the legislative and executive\nbranches. Their quarrel is with the substance of Iowa’s educational policies. Id.\n(holding that where the plaintiffs do not clearly identify the nature of their due process\nclaim, “we assume it is a substantive due process argument because they do not\ndiscuss any notice or hearing deficiencies”).\n\f                                     54\n\nthat Kentucky’s constitution included a constitutional mandate to\n\n“provide an efficient system of common schools throughout the state.”\n\n790 S.W.2d 186, 189 (Ky. 1989); see also Ky. Const. § 183.           And in\n\nAbbeville County School District v. State, the South Carolina Supreme\n\nCourt invoked a constitutional provision that, like Connecticut’s,\n\nrequires the state’s general assembly to “provide for the maintenance and\n\nsupport of a system of free public schools open to all children in the\n\nState.” 515 S.E.2d 535, 539 (S.C. 1999); see also S.C. Const. art. XI, § 3.\n\n      Whatever the merits of these other judicial interventions in\n\neducation, Iowa’s constitution is different. As we have already discussed,\n\nit does not mandate that the legislature provide either “free public\n\nschools” or an “efficient system of common schools.” We are confronted\n\nwith equal protection and due process challenges that should be resolved\n\nunder a rational basis test. In Abbeville County School District, the South\n\nCarolina Supreme Court affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs’ equal\n\nprotection cause of action under the South Carolina Constitution for\n\nfailure to state a claim. 515 S.E.2d at 538–39; see also Comm. for Educ.\n\nRights v. Edgar, 672 N.E.2d 1178, 1196 (Ill. 1996) (affirming dismissal of\n\nequal protection claim brought under the Illinois Constitution and\n\nobserving that “[w]hile the present school funding scheme might be\n\nthought unwise, undesirable or unenlightened from the standpoint of\n\ncontemporary notions of social justice, these objections must be\n\npresented to the General Assembly”); Bonner, 907 N.E.2d at 522\n\n(upholding dismissal of equal protection and due process claims based\n\non the Indiana Constitution); Fair Sch. Fin. Council of Okla., Inc. v. State,\n\n746 P.2d 1135, 1150–51 (Okla. 1987) (affirming grant of motion for\n\njudgment on the pleadings on the plaintiffs’ equal protection and due\n\f                                    55\n\nprocess claims under the Oklahoma Constitution after concluding “there\n\nis a rational basis to support the present school finance system”).\n\n      F. Iowa Code § 256.37.       The plaintiffs also assert a statutory\n\nclaim under Iowa Code section 256.37, which provides:\n\n             It is the policy of the state of Iowa to provide an\n      education system that prepares the children of this state to\n      meet and exceed the technological, informational, and\n      communications demands of our society.          The general\n      assembly finds that the current education system must be\n      transformed to deliver the enriched educational program that\n      the adults of the future will need to have to compete in\n      tomorrow’s world. The general assembly further finds that\n      the education system must strive to reach the following\n      goals:\n\n               1. All children in Iowa must start school ready to\n      learn.\n\n             2. Iowa’s high school graduation rate must increase to\n      at least ninety percent.\n\n            3. Students graduating from Iowa’s education system\n      must demonstrate competency in challenging subject matter,\n      and must have learned to use their minds well, so they may\n      be prepared for responsible citizenship, further learning, and\n      productive employment in a global economy.\n\n           4. Iowa students must be first in the world in science\n      and mathematics achievement.\n\n             5. Every adult Iowan must be literate and possess the\n      knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global\n      economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of\n      citizenship.\n\n            6. Every school in Iowa must be free of drugs and\n      violence and offer a disciplined environment conducive to\n      learning.\n\n      This law does not contain an express private right of action, so any\n\ncause of action must be implied.     Typically, in determining whether a\n\nprivate right of action may be inferred from a statute, we consider four\n\nfactors:\n\f                                    56\n      1. Is the plaintiff a member of the class for whose benefit the\n         statute was enacted?\n\n      2. Is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or\n          implicit, to either create or deny such a remedy?\n\n      3. Would allowing such a cause of action be consistent with\n         the underlying purpose of the legislation?\n\n      4. Would the private cause of action intrude into an area\n         over which the federal government or a state\n         administrative agency holds exclusive jurisdiction?\n\nMarcus v. Young, 538 N.W.2d 285, 288 (Iowa 1995) (citing Cort v. Ash,\n\n422 U.S. 66, 78, 95 S. Ct. 2080, 2088, 45 L. Ed. 2d 26, 36–37 (1975)).\n\nAll four factors generally must weigh in favor of a private right of action\n\nfor us to find such a right exists. Stotts v. Eveleth, 688 N.W.2d 803, 808\n\n(Iowa 2004).\n\n      Here we agree section 256.37 was enacted for the plaintiffs’ benefit,\n\nin that many of them are Iowa public school students. But we conclude\n\nthe second, third, and fourth factors listed above do not support a\n\nprivate right of action, and therefore hold plaintiffs’ claim under section\n\n256.37 was properly dismissed.\n\n      Regarding the second Marcus/Cort factor, the language of section\n\n256.37 does not indicate legislative intent to create a remedy. Rather,\n\nthe section merely sets forth a general statement of policy with six “goals”\n\nthe “education system must strive to reach.”         Iowa Code § 256.37\n\n(emphasis added).     The legislature specifically used the terms “goals”\ninstead   of   more    concrete   language    such    as   “standards”   or\n\n“requirements.” Also, the legislature used the aspirational phrase “must\n\nstrive to reach” instead of a more demanding phrase such as “must\n\nreach.” Id.\n\n      Furthermore, the wording of the goals themselves reflects a\n\nlegislative purpose to make only a policy pronouncement. Throughout\n\f                                           57\n\nthe statute, broad and sweeping language such as “all” and “every” is\n\nused. Id. The goals are thus utopian in nature. For example, the final\n\ngoal states, “Every school in Iowa must be free of drugs and violence\n\n. . . .”    Id.   Did the legislature intend to allow a student to bring suit\n\nwhenever his or her school is not entirely “free of drugs and violence”?\n\nWe think not.\n\n           The placement of section 37 within Chapter 256 of the Iowa Code\n\nalso supports the proposition that it is simply a policy statement.\n\nSection 256.37 is located within subchapter I, entitled “General\n\nProvisions.”       This subchapter generally describes education policy in\n\nIowa and establishes the Department of Education. Many other sections\n\nwithin the same “General Provisions” subchapter also begin with the\n\nlanguage, “It is the policy . . . .” See, e.g., id. §§ 256.18, .38.\n\n           The third Marcus/Cort factor is also unmet here because allowing a\n\nprivate cause of action would be inconsistent with section 256.37’s\n\npurpose of delineating general goals for Iowa’s educational system.\n\nPermitting a private right of action under section 256.37 would likely\n\nunleash       a    multiplicity   of   future   lawsuits   that   would   transform\n\naspirational goals into a series of specific mandates.             Notably, section\n\n256.37 was enacted as part of legislation that allowed the Department of\n\nEducation to waive compliance with the minimum education standards\n\nfor accredited schools under certain circumstances. See 1992 Iowa Acts\n\nch. 1159, § 1.\n\n           In addition, the fourth factor is not satisfied because the\n\nDepartment of Education has jurisdiction under Iowa Code section 256.1\n\nto act in a policymaking capacity and provide statewide supervision of\n\neducation in the State of Iowa. Iowa Code § 256.1(1) (“The department of\n\neducation is established to act in a policymaking and advisory capacity\n\f                                          58\n\nand to exercise general supervision over the state system of education\n\n. . . .”).   A private cause of action under section 256.37 would intrude\n\ninto an area in which a state administrative agency, the Department of\n\nEducation, already has exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n         Because neither the second, third, nor fourth elements of a private\n\nright of action is present here, we affirm the district court’s ruling that\n\nsection 256.37 does not provide a private remedy.\n\n         Given our disposition of plaintiffs’ substantive claims, we need not\n\nreach defendants’ additional arguments that mandamus is not an\n\nappropriate remedy or that the Governor of Iowa is not a proper\n\ndefendant.\n\n         IV. Conclusion.\n\n         We affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs’ first amended and substituted\n\npetition. We do not minimize the importance of the issues raised by the\n\nplaintiffs. But a respect for precedent and for our constitution requires\n\nthat we stay out of this dispute. This court in its past decisions, from\n\nKleen to Johnson to Exira, has historically deferred to the policy decisions\n\nmade by the political branches of government in this area. 26\n\n         The sixteen parents and students who brought this suit clearly\nbelieve that Iowa’s schools would benefit if we had more student testing,\n\n\n         26We do not think a resolution of this case requires us to review the history of\neducation generally or what past Iowa governors have said on the subject. We are\njudges, not historians. For judges, some history, such as our own precedent, is highly\nrelevant. But there are risks when we draw on political history as source material for\njudicial decisionmaking. One risk is that we may unwittingly diminish the importance\nof more relevant historical events, such as the ratification debates on the Iowa\nConstitution, by submerging them in other political history that has only background\nimportance. Another risk is that political trends might then be used to justify the\noutcome in a particular case. It is not surprising to us that Iowa’s governors have\nbelieved education to be a critical responsibility of government. But demonstrating that\neducation has been a vital concern of the political branches of government does not\nanswer the present question whether this particular case ought to proceed through the\njudicial branch.\n\f                                    59\n\nmore    statewide   standards,    more   statewide    uniformity,   and   a\n\nperformance-based pay system for teachers. These issues are currently\n\nbeing debated throughout our state.      The debate participants include\n\nlegislators, the governor, executive branch officials, school boards,\n\nteachers, parents, students, and taxpayers. We believe the democratic\n\nprocess is best suited for resolution of those debates and can best\n\naccommodate the competing concerns of the many interested parties.\n\n       As we said at the beginning of this opinion, we do not close the\n\ndoor to other actions alleging constitutional violations in the field of\n\neducation. We uphold only the dismissal of this case.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n       Cady, C.J., and Waterman and Zager, JJ., join this opinion. Cady,\n\nC.J., and Waterman, J., file separate concurring opinions. Wiggins, J.,\n\nfiles a dissenting opinion in which Hecht and Appel, JJ., join. Appel, J.,\n\nfiles a separate dissenting opinion in which Hecht, J., joins.\n\f                                    60\n                                                   #08–2006, King v. State\n\nCADY, Chief Justice (concurring specially).\n\n      I concur in the opinion of the majority.       I write separately to\n\nexplain my unwillingness at this time to more fully explore the\n\nconstitutional claim of a public education in Iowa and to further explain\n\nmy position on the issues in this case.\n\n      At the outset, I feel compelled to acknowledge that education is a\n\ntradition that exists today as strongly as ever.      A system of public\neducation is clearly needed to allow the youth of this state to learn the\n\nessential aspects of judgment, analysis, communication, and creativity.\n\nIt is needed to empower each generation to meet the economic, social,\n\nscientific, political, governmental, personal, and other challenges of an\n\nevolving global world. Education is the core of who we are and who we\n\nwill become. The dissenting opinion of Justice Appel has captured the\n\nrich history of this tradition in Iowa and has provided insight into its\n\nconstitutional stature.\n\n      Yet, in response to the specific claim of a constitutional right under\n\nthe education clause raised in this case, I am restrained at this time from\n\ndeciding anything more than that section 3 of the second division of\n\narticle IX of the Iowa Constitution does not alone create a right to a\n\npublic education.   This conclusion is not to say no such right exists\n\nunder the Iowa Constitution, but I am content to wait for a different case\n\nin which the petition both frames the full constitutional underpinnings\n\nand is accompanied by pleadings that would allow the underlying facts of\n\nthe case to become a helpful aid in shaping the parameters to any such\n\nright recognized to exist.   Of course, in this case, as pointed out by\n\nJustice Wiggins, the more fundamental obstacle presented is whether\n\nthis extremely important issue should even be addressed by us when the\n\f                                      61\n\nparties chose, at least initially, not to raise it as an issue for appellate\n\nreview after it was presented and decided by a district court.\n\n         The doctrine of judicial restraint expressed by Justice Wiggins is a\n\nview I would normally follow. Yet, our rules of judicial restraint are full\n\nof nuance and exceptions and ultimately rest on the particular\n\ncircumstances of each case.       As observed in the majority opinion, the\n\nprinciples of judicial restraint also embrace judicial economy, a doctrine\n\nparticularly applicable to this case. If the allegations of a case would not\n\nbe sufficient to establish a claim, assuming they were all true, judicial\n\neconomy would not be served by sending the case back for the parties to\n\ngo through the time and expense of further proceedings only for the\n\ncourts to later declare the plaintiff never had a viable claim in the first\n\nplace.\n\n         Judicial restraint is a doctrine composed of many elements, and it\n\nstrives for outcomes that are both fair and practical. In this case, it is\n\nboth fair and practical for us to examine the pleadings to determine if the\n\nplaintiffs could ever win their lawsuit if we declared the educational\n\nexperience mandated by the legislature in this state was a constitutional\n\nright. It is fair because the parties fully explored this issue before the\n\ndistrict court, and it was ultimately raised and urged at rehearing on\n\nappeal. It is practical because the case is before us, and it is in the best\n\ninterests of all concerned for us to decide the merits of the underlying\n\nclaim now.      Thus, under the particular procedural background of this\n\ncase, I conclude the doctrine of judicial restraint does not instruct us to\n\nrefrain from deciding the basic question whether or not the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to state a claim for relief. Accordingly, it is appropriate to\n\ndecide if the allegations are sufficient to support a violation of a\n\nfundamental right to an adequate education.\n\f                                     62\n\n       Normally, cases are not resolved on the pleadings. U.S. Bank v.\n\nBarbour, 770 N.W.2d 350, 353 (Iowa 2009). Moreover, we do not set a\n\nhigh bar for litigants to clear to meet the requirement for a pleading to\n\nstate a claim for relief. Id. at 354 (noting the “fair notice” requirement is\n\nmet if a petition informs the defendant of the incident giving rise to the\n\nclaim and the claim’s general nature). Instead, we follow the liberal rule\n\nof notice pleading. This rule, however, does not mean all claims clear the\n\nbar.   See O’Brien v. DiGrazia, 544 F.2d 543, 546 n.3 (1st Cir. 1976)\n\n(noting that, when plaintiff in civil rights action provides facts to support\n\nclaim, court does not have duty to “conjure up unpleaded facts that\n\nmight turn a frivolous claim of unconstitutional official action into a\n\nsubstantial one”); see also 5B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 1357, at 548–53 (3d ed. 2004) (noting\n\ncourts “will accept the pleader’s description of what happened to him or\n\nher along with any conclusion that can reasonably be drawn therefrom,”\n\nbut will not accept “conclusory allegations concerning the legal effect of\n\nthe events the plaintiff has set out if these allegations do not reasonably\n\nfollow from the pleader’s description of what happened”).\n\n       When the viability of a claim for relief is challenged, our pleading\n\nrule requires consideration of any conceivable set of facts, but only those\n\nfacts that relate to and could prove the allegations made in the petition.\n\nThe allegations of the petition, if proven by the facts, must show\n\nentitlement to relief.   Reviewing courts do not, however, consider any\n\nconceivable allegations, only any conceivable facts that support the\n\nallegations made.\n\n       In this case, the allegations of the petition, even if true, could not\n\nestablish that students in Iowa today are being denied a basic or\n\nminimally adequate education, wherever that elusive standard might\n\f                                    63\n\nland.    The plaintiffs have not made a single allegation that could\n\nestablish they have been deprived of the basic ability to read, write, or\n\ncommunicate, and they have not alleged they have been deprived of their\n\nability to gain an understanding of mathematics, science, economics,\n\ngovernment, computer-based technology, or other vital components of a\n\nbasic education. While the allegations in the petition are detailed and\n\nthoughtful, they simply do not show Iowa students are being deprived of\n\nan opportunity for an adequate education. For example, the disparities\n\nalleged to exist between school districts across Iowa may show slightly\n\ndifferent education experiences and outcomes, but those different\n\noutcomes do not establish a deprivation of basic education.\n\n        Likewise, Iowa’s recent decline of college admissions test scores\n\nand other proficiency scores do not establish a deprivation of basic\n\neducation. They merely show the state may have begun to slip, but the\n\nlevel of decline alleged is not so much that a reasonable person could say\n\nthe slip means students have been altogether deprived of a basic\n\neducation. Similarly, the absence of certain assessment mechanisms in\n\nIowa, as alleged by the plaintiffs, does not establish the deprivation of\n\nbasic education. Even Iowa’s decline in the national rankings in various\n\nsubjects does not mean students are being deprived of basic education.\n\nAgain, it merely shows we are beginning to slip or perhaps other states\n\nare beginning to improve. Finally, the broad allegations that Iowa has\n\nfailed to establish standards, enforce standards, adopt effective teacher\n\npay systems, and establish a delivery system are insufficient. Accepting\n\nall the allegations of the petition to be true, the deprivation of basic\n\neducation cannot be established. There are simply no allegations that\n\nstudents in Iowa cannot read, write, communicate, or perform the other\n\nessential aspects of education.    There are no allegations that capable\n\f                                     64\n\nstudents lack an understanding of mathematics, science, economics,\n\ngovernment, or computer-based technology.\n\n      The petition does contain some statements generally indicting the\n\npublic education system. For example, the petition states that “[m]any\n\nIowa students are not prepared to enter the workforce or postsecondary\n\neducation without additional training or remediation when they graduate\n\nfrom high school.”      The petition also alleges the educational and\n\naccreditation standards of this state “do not ensure that all students” will\n\nbe able to meet or exceed the future demands of society, be prepared for\n\nresponsible citizenship, and be prepared for further learning and\n\nproductive employment in the global economy.              The petition also\n\ngenerally declares, “[A]n ineffective education will persist for school\n\nchildren throughout their lifetimes, affecting the rate and extent of their\n\nability to be a responsible citizen, their ability to learn further, and their\n\nability to achieve productive employment in a global economy.”\n\n      To the extent such claims are actually allegations of a petition, as\n\nopposed to hortatory calls to action, they relate to the level of a basic or\n\nadequate education. Wherever a basic or adequate education might land\n\nwithin the framework of our constitution, assuming the existence of a\n\nright to education, that landing point certainly would not guarantee that\n\n“all students” would be able to meet the broad demands of the world in\n\nthe future. Nor would the right guarantee students would never need to\n\ntake a remedial course to enter the workforce or postsecondary\n\neducation.\n\n      Of course, my rejection of the pleadings in the case as a basis to\n\nsupport a constitutional right necessarily leads to the question of what\n\nallegations would need to be pled to properly support the constitutional\n\nclaim of a minimally sufficient public education. Assuming Justice Appel\n\f                                     65\n\nhas articulated the source of a constitutional claim to a public education,\n\nthe fighting issue turns to the meaning of a minimally sufficient\n\neducation. This is an issue that is indeed difficult and one that I am\n\nadmittedly without a specific answer at this time.          We landed on a\n\nminimally sufficient standard in the context of the constitutional right to\n\ncounsel, and this standard has worked well enough in applying the\n\nconstitutional right. But, public education is a totally different kettle of\n\nfish.   The point when a state’s educational system becomes minimally\n\ninsufficient would be difficult to ascertain in the context of a\n\nconstitutional analysis.     Nevertheless, the analysis would need to\n\ngenerally center on the performance of the school system and its\n\ncollective outcomes and be ultimately judged in relationship to other\n\nperformance models over a period of years. But, for now, I am simply\n\ncontent that the allegations of the petition in this case fall short and that\n\na trial to obtain the supporting evidence would not help.\n\n        Additionally, the allegations of the petition, even if true, do not\n\nestablish a violation of the equal protection clause. Even assuming the\n\ndifferent educational outcomes alleged in the petition are supported by\n\nfacts, a rational basis certainly could be articulated to justify the\n\ndifferent outcomes. This rational basis is found in the local control given\n\nto school districts.     Moreover, a rational basis to justify different\n\noutcomes does not need to be derived by courts from the record in a\n\ncase.    Importantly, similar to the way facts are assumed to support\n\nallegations in a petition to determine if a claim for relief has been stated,\n\ncourts formulate a rational basis from any information that is\n\n“realistically conceivable.” Miller v. Boone Cnty. Hosp., 394 N.W.2d 776,\n\n779 (Iowa 1986).       Thus, when considering constitutional challenges\n\nsubject to a rational-basis analysis, courts may consider the existence of\n\f                                    66\n\nany conceivable rational basis. The analysis does not require a factual\n\nbasis drawn from the record in the case. Racing Ass’n of Cent. Iowa v.\n\nFitzgerald, 675 N.W.2d 1, 7–8 & n.4 (Iowa 2004).          Accordingly, this\n\nanalysis means courts are not required to needlessly wait for a trial\n\nbefore declaring that a particular different outcome in society does not\n\nviolate the equal protection guarantee.         Different outcomes from\n\ngovernmental actions can be observed throughout society, and they\n\nviolate the equal protection clause only when government does not have\n\nan adequate justification for the different treatment.      See Varnum v.\n\nBrien, 763 N.W.2d 862, 879 (Iowa 2009).\n\n      In the end, the allegations of the petition, while alarming, simply\n\ncannot support the constitutional claim that is urged. Consequently, the\n\ncourts have no role in the resolution of this important social issue at this\n\ntime. The petition, if true, may be a call to action, but it is a call under\n\nour constitutional structure for the legislature, not the courts.       The\n\npleadings simply do not convince me that school children today in Iowa,\n\nlet alone the school children at the center of this lawsuit, are being\n\ndeprived or have been deprived of any level of education our constitution\n\nwould be able to mandate.\n\f                                    67\n                                                   #08–2006, King v. State\nWATERMAN, J. (concurring specially).\n\n      I concur in the majority’s well-reasoned decision on all issues. I\n\nwrite separately to emphasize the importance of judicial restraint when\n\nlitigants ask courts to overstep their bounds.\n\n      This case was resubmitted for a second oral argument because\n\nthree new members were added to this court. Plaintiffs’ counsel in his\n\neloquent oral argument urged our court to “do its job.” We do exactly\n\nthat today by affirming the dismissal of a well-intentioned, but legally\n\nflawed lawsuit. If these individual plaintiffs were allowed to proceed with\n\nthis case in the courts, and they somehow won the relief they seek, the\n\nend result would be judges running our public schools through\n\nstructural injunctions that second-guess the educational policy decisions\n\nmade by the elected branches of government. That is not our role. We\n\ndo not sit as the supreme school board of the State of Iowa, and we are\n\nunwilling in the guise of adjudication to usurp powers the Iowa\n\nConstitution cedes to the elected branches to run our public schools.\n\nThe separation-of-powers doctrine precludes the relief these plaintiffs\n\nseek from the courts.\n\n      To reinstate this lawsuit would set a dangerous precedent. These\n\nplaintiffs ask too much of our court jurisprudentially. It is not for courts\n\nto impose particular statewide educational standards by judicial decree.\n\nOur limited role as a coequal branch of government requires us to\n\nadjudicate cases and in doing so construe the meaning of our\n\nconstitution; the constitutional power to run our public schools lies with\n\nthe legislative and executive branches. Courts can and must step in if\n\nthat power is exercised in a way that infringes on individual rights. See,\n\ne.g., Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 514, 89\n\f                                     68\n\nS. Ct. 733, 740, 21 L. Ed. 2d 731, 742 (1969) (holding First Amendment\n\nprotection for symbolic speech required school officials to allow students\n\nto wear black armbands protesting the Vietnam War).              Such cases\n\ninvolving individual rights are well within the institutional competence of\n\ncourts to decide. No such claim is stated in this case. Nor is this case\n\nanother Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483, 74 S. Ct. 686, 98\n\nL. Ed. 873 (1954), challenging racial segregation or discrimination. No\n\nclaim of disparate treatment or any illegal classification such as race is\n\nmade here. Rather, these plaintiffs seek broad educational reform. Our\n\ncourts are not institutionally competent to make educational policy\n\njudgments. The Department of Education is in the executive branch.\n\n      It is worth repeating here Justice Scalia’s recent warning against\n\nthe use of structural injunctions in institutional reform litigation:\n\n            Structural injunctions . . . turn[] judges into long-term\n      administrators of complex social institutions such as\n      schools, prisons, and police departments. Indeed, they\n      require judges to play a role essentially indistinguishable\n      from the role ordinarily played by executive officials. . . .\n             The drawbacks of structural injunctions have been\n      described at great length elsewhere. This case illustrates\n      one of their most pernicious aspects: that they force judges\n      to engage in a form of factfinding-as-policymaking that is\n      outside the traditional judicial role. The factfinding judges\n      traditionally engage in involves the determination of past or\n      present facts based (except for a limited set of materials of\n      which courts may take “judicial notice”) exclusively upon a\n      closed trial record. That is one reason why a district judge’s\n      factual findings are entitled to plain-error review: because\n      having viewed the trial first hand he is in a better position to\n      evaluate the evidence than a judge reviewing a cold record.\n      In a very limited category of cases, judges have also\n      traditionally been called upon to make some predictive\n      judgments: which custody will best serve the interests of the\n      child, for example, or whether a particular one-shot\n      injunction will remedy the plaintiff’s grievance. When a\n      judge manages a structural injunction, however, he will\n      inevitably be required to make very broad empirical\n      predictions necessarily based in large part upon policy\n      views—the sort of predictions regularly made by legislators\n\f                                    69\n      and executive officials, but inappropriate for the Third\n      Branch.\n            ....\n             It is important to recognize that the dressing-up of\n      policy judgments as factual findings is not an error peculiar\n      to this case.       It is an unavoidable concomitant of\n      institutional-reform litigation. When a district court issues\n      an injunction, it must make a factual assessment of the\n      anticipated consequences of the injunction. And when the\n      injunction undertakes to restructure a social institution,\n      assessing the factual consequences of the injunction is\n      necessarily the sort of predictive judgment that our system of\n      government allocates to other government officials.\n             But structural injunctions do not simply invite judges\n      to indulge policy preferences. They invite judges to indulge\n      incompetent policy preferences. Three years of law school\n      and familiarity with pertinent Supreme Court precedents\n      give no insight whatsoever into the management of social\n      institutions.\n\nBrown v. Plata, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 131 S. Ct. 1910, 1953–55, 179\n\nL. Ed. 2d 969, 1015–16 (2011) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).\n\n      These admonitions apply with equal force here. A law degree and\n\nsome court room experience do not qualify judges to restructure Iowa\n\nschools or impose new statewide educational standards. If we reinstate\n\nthis case, one can easily imagine more lawsuits will be filed by other\n\nfamilies with different ideas on how to run the schools.          Whatever\n\nevidence the King plaintiffs might offer at a trial in this case presumably\n\nwould make a record very different from the evidentiary trial record to be\n\nmade by other plaintiffs with conflicting educational policy goals such as\n\nvouchers or greater local control. All such trials would be a waste of time\n\nand scarce resources in the absence of a cognizable claim upon which\n\njudicial relief may be granted.\n\n      We are affirming the dismissal of this case based on the plain\n\nmeaning of our constitution and our own precedent. Sixteen years ago\n\nour court unanimously recognized that it is not our role to “develop or\n\f                                            70\n\nchoose among schemes for public education” and that the proper forum\n\nfor such debates is “in the other branches of state government.” Exira\n\nCmty. Sch. Dist. v. State, 512 N.W.2d 787, 796 (Iowa 1994). This view is\n\nechoed by many other voices of restraint on the supreme courts of our\n\nsister states. 27\n\n       By contrast, instead of focusing on our own precedent, the dissent\n\nembarks on a wide-ranging survey of authorities.                     For example, the\n\ndissent cites several times to the United Nations’ 1948 Universal\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights, a document that includes a right to leisure\n\ntime and health care as well as a right to education.

The only education case citing\n\nthe UN Declaration was accompanied by a vigorous and well-reasoned\n\ndissent. Pauley v. Kelly, 255 S.E.2d 859, 897–900 (W. Va. 1979) (Neely,\n\nJ., dissenting). No party to this litigation cited the UN Declaration at any\n\npoint in the proceedings or argued it had any relevance. I fail to see how\n\na 1948 UN Declaration helps our court ascertain the intent of the\n\nframers of the Iowa Constitution ratified ninety years earlier. Our court\n\nhas not previously relied on UN declarations or international law to\n\ninterpret our 1857 constitution, and I would not start now.\n\n      The dissent also discusses numerous historical figures and famous\n\neducators. Yet none of them is quoted for the proposition that courts\n\nshould be running schools. I imagine all of them would be surprised by\n\nthat notion.   The divergence of views of education surveyed by the\n\ndissent is another reason why policymaking should be left to the elected\n\nbranches. How should an Iowa judge or jury in a contested case select\n\nfrom among the disparate academic viewpoints and standards? We all\n\nagree public education is vitally important. But that does not warrant\n\ncourts interfering in how our public schools are run. The lengthy dissent\n\ncites no case from any jurisdiction where court-ordered imposition of\n\nstatewide educational standards improved student outcomes.\n\n      The dissent argues we should not decide whether the amended\n\npetition states a claim upon which relief may be granted because the\n\nappellee who won dismissal below did not brief that alternative ground\n\nfor dismissal on appeal. That issue was fully briefed by both sides in the\n\ndistrict court and decided by the district court and is appropriately\n\ndecided by our court today for the reasons set forth in the majority\n\f                                           72\n\nopinion and Chief Justice Cady’s special concurrence.                  The dissenters’\n\nposition today is at odds with their zeal a mere eighteen months ago to\n\ndecide an issue the parties in another case failed to brief in district court\n\nor on appeal and that the district court never decided.                    See Feld v.\n\nBorkowski, 790 N.W.2d 72, 81–82 (Iowa 2010) (Wiggins, J., concurring\n\nspecially); id. at 82–85 (Appel, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\n\npart). The dissenters argue it was appropriate to reach the issue omitted\n\nfrom the briefs in Feld because it was inextricably intertwined with the\n\nissue briefed on appeal. The same is true in this case—whether these\n\nplaintiffs allege claims upon which judicial relief may be granted or\n\nrather nonjusticiable political questions is simply two sides of the same\n\ncoin. Notably, in Feld, Justice Wiggins posed several questions that are\n\nbetter asked in this case:\n\n       Why should we leave the question unanswered when the\n       district court will be confronted with it on remand? Why are\n       we creating a potential appeal on this issue . . . when we can\n       answer the question now? It seems to me, for us not to\n       address the issue creates extra expense for the parties and\n       the court. Accordingly, I would address the issue head on\n       and give the contact sports exception a proper burial.\n\nId. at 82. So too should we give plaintiffs’ case “a proper burial” now,\n\ninstead of remanding for a costly trial to prove allegations that, if true,\n\nprovide no grounds for judicial relief. 28\n\n       28Justice  Wiggins’ dissent asserts our majority decision “appears to overrule”\nRacing Ass’n of Central Iowa v. Fitzgerald (RACI II), 675 N.W.2d 1 (Iowa 2004). RACI II\nas a practical matter has been limited to its facts. I would expressly overrule RACI II as\nplainly erroneous. The RACI II majority, purporting to apply the federal rational-basis\ntest, held that a tax differential for casino slot machine revenue violated the equal\nprotection clause of the Iowa Constitution on remand after the unanimous United\nStates Supreme Court had held the differential did not violate federal equal protection.\n675 N.W.2d at 3. The RACI II majority thereby essentially took the position that the\nnine justices of the United States Supreme Court were irrational in applying the same\nrational-basis test in the same case, despite the well-settled and long-standing tradition\nof judicial deference to legislative economic regulation and tax classifications. RACI II\nwas wrongly decided for the reasons set forth in the eloquent separate dissents by\nJustices Cady and Carter. See id. at 16–17 (Carter, J., dissenting); id. at 17–28 (Iowa\n\f                                          73\n\n         Many generations of Iowans have been justifiably proud of the\n\nquality of our state’s public school system.               The allegations in this\n\nlawsuit shine a light on shortcomings, disturbing downward trends, and\n\noutcomes that vary from district to district. But notably absent in the\n\nvoluminous filings in this appeal is any convincing argument judicial\n\nintervention will make Iowa schools better. Plaintiffs filed no Brandeis\n\nbrief providing empirical data that their requested judicial intervention\n\nwould improve educational outcomes. The plaintiffs in this case are no\n\ndoubt optimistic and sincere in their beliefs that the educational reforms\n\nthey seek to impose statewide by judicial fiat will raise ACT scores in\n\nmany districts.      Our courts, however, are not competent to determine\n\nwhether a structural injunction imposing a new set of priorities and\n\nstandards will accomplish those worthy goals or instead lower composite\n\naverage ACT scores in districts that currently must be doing many things\n\nright.\n\n         Voters elect our governor, legislators, and school board members.\n\nIf these plaintiffs do not like how Iowa schools are run, they should turn\n\nto the ballot box, not the courts.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\n2002) (Cady, J., dissenting); see also Racing Ass’n of Cent.

I also\n\ndissent from these opinions because they reach the issue that plaintiffs’\n\npetition failed to state a claim.              Further, I dissent from Justice\n\nWaterman’s concurring opinion because he finds the constitutional\n\nclaims nonjusticiable.\n\n       A supreme court is “a court of final review and not first view.”\n\nZivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.S. ___, ___, 132 S. Ct. 1421,\n\n1430, 182 L. Ed. 2d 423, 433 (2012).                   Our cases stand for the\n\nproposition that we may affirm the district court on any basis appearing\n\nin the record and urged on appeal by the appellee. See, e.g., In re Estate\n\nof Voss, 553 N.W.2d 878, 879 n.1 (Iowa 1996); Johnston Equip. Corp. v.\n\nIndus. Indem., 489 N.W.2d 13, 17 (Iowa 1992); see also Chauffeurs,\n\nTeamsters & Helpers, Local Union No. 238 v. Iowa Civil Rights Comm’n,\n\n394 N.W.2d 375, 378 (Iowa 1986) (stating we may decide issues on\n\nappeal not reached by the district court where they have been raised in\n\nthe district court and fully briefed and argued by the parties on appeal).\n\n\n\n       29Justice  Mansfield’s opinion appears to be a plurality opinion because it\nreaches the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims under the education clause, due process\nclause, and privileges and immunities clause of the Iowa Constitution. Although\nJustice Waterman concurs in the opinion, he does so by finding the plaintiffs’ claims to\nbe nonjusticiable political questions just as the district court did.\n\f                                     75\n\nThis rule is rooted in the principle of fairness, and we have consistently\n\napplied it in our cases.\n\n      For example, in State v. Seering, 701 N.W.2d 655 (Iowa 2005), we\n\nheld the appellee waived certain arguments on appeal even though the\n\nissues were raised in and decided by the district court because the\n\nappellee failed to present the arguments in his appellate briefs.        701\n\nN.W.2d at 661–62. In Parkhurst v. White, 254 Iowa 477, 118 N.W.2d 47\n\n(1962), we held the appellee waived an issue presented to the district\n\ncourt but not briefed on appeal. 254 Iowa at 480–81, 118 N.W.2d at 49.\n\nSimilarly, in American Mutual Liability Insurance Co. v. State Auto.\n\nInsurance Association, 246 Iowa 1294, 72 N.W.2d 88 (1955), we\n\nconcluded an alternative constitutional claim was not before us because\n\nthe appellee failed to assert the claim on appeal. 246 Iowa at 1303, 72\n\nN.W.2d at 93.\n\n      This case provides further support for the reasons underlying our\n\nrule of error preservation.     Here, the district court determined the\n\nplaintiffs’ amended petition alleged facts sufficient to meet our notice\n\npleading standard.    See Hawkeye Foodservice Distribution, Inc. v. Iowa\n\nEducators Corp., 812 N.W.2d 600, 608 (Iowa 2012) (declining to adopt a\n\nheightened pleading standard).     The district court then dismissed the\n\nplaintiffs’ claims as nonjusticiable political questions.   On appeal, the\n\nplaintiffs’ argued in their appellate brief that its claims were not\n\nnonjusticiable political questions. The plaintiffs did not argue the merits\n\nof their constitutional claims or argue that their petition met our\n\npleading standard.    Indeed, because the district court did not address\n\nthe merits of the constitutional claims and ruled in the plaintiffs’ favor on\n\nthe pleading issue, it would have been unnecessary and strategically\n\nunwise to do so unless the defendants raised these issues on appeal.\n\f                                      76\n\nHowever, the defendants, the prevailing parties below, only argued in\n\ntheir appellate briefs that the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims presented\n\nnonjusticiable political questions.    The defendants did not argue the\n\nplaintiffs’ petition failed to meet our pleading standard. Therefore, under\n\nour rule of error preservation, the only issue briefed by the parties on\n\nappeal, and thus subject to consideration by this court, is the issue of\n\nwhether the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims present nonjusticiable\n\npolitical questions.\n\n      In order to reach the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims and to\n\ndetermine the plaintiffs’ petition failed to state a claim, Justice\n\nMansfield’s opinion and Chief Justice Cady’s concurring opinion rely on\n\nthe proposition that we can uphold a district court decision on a ground\n\ndifferent from the one upon which the district court based its decision as\n\nlong as the ground was urged in the district court. See DeVoss v. State,\n\n648 N.W.2d 56, 63 (2002). As already noted, this proposition stands for\n\nonly half of our rule regarding error preservation. These opinions ignore\n\nthe other half of the rule requiring the parties to brief the issues in this\n\ncourt. In fact, the cases upon which Justice Mansfield’s opinion relies to\n\nsupport its proposition support the two-part rule. Granted, we examined\n\nissues in Martinek v. Belmond-Klemme Community School District, 772\n\nN.W.2d 758 (Iowa 2009), Fennelly v. A-1 Machine & Tool Co., 728 N.W.2d\n\n163 (Iowa 2006), and Emmert v. Neiman, 245 Iowa 931, 65 N.W.2d 606\n\n(1954), that the district court did not address. However, a review of the\n\nappellate briefs in these cases, which are on file at the state law library,\n\nreveals that the parties on appeal briefed the alternate or additional\n\ngrounds upon which we relied.\n\n      Justice Mansfield’s opinion also relies on Erickson v. Erickson’s\n\nEstate, 191 Iowa 1393, 180 N.W. 664 (1920), for its proposition that we\n\f                                          77\n\ncan affirm on a ground raised in the trial court but not argued in this\n\ncourt. However, Erickson is but a relic of an earlier time. Although we\n\nhave never expressly overruled Erickson, it seems nearly a century of\n\ncase law has destroyed its precedential value.                       Surely Johnston\n\nEquipment Corporation and Voss articulate rules of error preservation\n\nthat have at the very least impliedly overruled Erickson.                   In reaching\n\nthese issues, Justice Mansfield’s opinion has effectively overruled the\n\nninety years of case law since Erickson and returned us to its archaic\n\nprinciple. After this decision, if an appellant wants to further inform the\n\ncourt as to its argument, it seems the appellant must expand upon every\n\nargument raised at the district court in its appellate brief, regardless of\n\nwhether the district court ruled in its favor on a particular issue and\n\nunprompted by any action by the appellee.                   Otherwise, the appellant\n\nrisks this court deciding an issue no party expected this court to decide.\n\nIn other words, every issue presented to the district court, no matter how\n\nirrelevant to its decision it may seem, becomes relevant on appeal.\n\n       Further,      neither   the   merits     of    the   plaintiffs’   constitutional\n\narguments      nor    the   sufficiency    of   the    pleadings     are inextricably\n\nintertwined with the issue of whether the plaintiffs’ claim sets forth a\n\npolitical question. 30      The district court decided the political question\n\n        30In special concurrences, members of this court urged the majority to abandon\n\nthe contact-sports exception when neither party so urged in their briefs. See Feld v.\nBorkowski, 790 N.W.2d 72, 81 (Iowa 2010) (Wiggins, J., specially concurring); id. at 82\n(Appel, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The specially concurring\nmembers argued the issue of abandonment of the contact-sports exception was\ninextricably intertwined with the case because, under the particular circumstances of\nthe case, resolution of the contact-sports-exception-issue was necessary for the proper\ndisposition of the case on retrial. Feld, 790 N.W.2d at 85 (Appel, J., concurring in part\nand dissenting in part); see also Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 246–47 n.12,\n102 S. Ct. 252, 261 n.12, 70 L. Ed. 2d 419, 430 n.12 (1981) (courts may consider\nquestions outside the scope of the issues of the order granting review when resolution of\nthose issues is necessary to properly dispose of the case). However, the majority\nrejected the arguments made in the special concurrences in Feld, and thus, the law of\nthis State required a party to brief and argue an issue in this court before we would\n\f                                          78\n\nissue without reference to the other issues concerning the education, due\n\nprocess, and privileges and immunities clauses of the Iowa Constitution.\n\nWe can and should do the same.\n\n       Justice Mansfield’s opinion may argue the parties raised these\n\nissues on appeal because they discussed them during oral argument.\n\nHowever, the opinion’s rationale that the parties preserved these issues\n\nfor our consideration on appeal fails for two reasons.                      First, on\n\nresubmission Justice Mansfield precipitated the references to these\n\nunbriefed issues by asking questions on these issues not raised in this\n\nappeal. 31 Justice Mansfield’s opinion cannot claim the parties preserved\n\nthese issues by raising them through questioning by the court. Second,\n\nour case law is unwavering in the proposition that we will not decide or\n\nconsider issues raised for the first time during oral argument. See Dilley\n\nv. City of Des Moines, 247 N.W.2d 187, 195 (Iowa 1976) (citing cases for\n\nthis proposition dating back to 1959).\n\n       There is a sound reason for this latter proposition. Chief Judge\n\nPosner noted, “[I]t would not be quite cricket of us to place [our] decision\n\non the ground” that was not raised until the oral argument on appeal\n\nbecause the other party may have been lulled into thinking its opponent\nwas fighting the case on another issue.             Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.\n\nCharter Barclay Hosp., Inc., 81 F.3d 53, 56 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n       Justice Mansfield’s opinion and Chief Justice Cady’s concurring\n\nopinion are perfect examples of this principle. Their analysis regarding\n_______________________________\nconsider it on appeal. Even if the special concurrences in Feld were applicable in this\ncase, the merits of the issues reached by Justice Mansfield’s opinion and the concurring\nopinion of Chief Justice Cady were not inextricably intertwined with the political\nquestion issues raised by this appeal. The majority and special concurrences seem to\nsignal a shift in our error preservation rules.\n       31Within the first three minutes of the plaintiffs’ oral argument, Justice\nMansfield began asking questions about the equal protection clause.\n\f                                      79\n\nthe education clause, due process clause, and privileges and immunities\n\nclause of the Iowa Constitution are entirely their own.         For example,\n\nwhen discussing the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim under the education\n\nclause, Justice Mansfield’s opinion provides its own analysis of article IX,\n\ndivision 2, section 3 of the Iowa Constitution. This section provides, in\n\nrelevant part, “The General Assembly shall encourage, by all suitable\n\nmeans, the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural\n\nimprovement.” Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 2, § 3 (1857 original version).\n\n       Justice Mansfield’s opinion and the concurring opinion of Chief\n\nJustice Cady fail to consider article IX, division 1, section 12, which\n\nstates:\n\n       The Board of Education shall provide for the education of all\n       the youths of the State, through a system of Common\n       Schools and such school shall be organized and kept in each\n       school district at least three months in each year. Any\n       district failing, for two consecutive years, to organize and\n       keep up a school as aforesaid may be deprived of their\n       portion of the school fund.\n\nId. art. IX, div. 1, § 12.\n\n       Although the legislature abolished the board of education referred\n\nto in section 12 in 1864 and replaced it with the superintendent of\n\neducation, the predecessor to the present department of education, the\n\ncitizens of this state never repealed the substance of 1857 article IX,\n\ndivision 1, section 12. See 1864 Iowa Acts ch. 52 §§ 1–15. In fact, this\n\ncourt used the substantive provisions of article IX, division 1, section 12\n\nto integrate Iowa schools four years after the legislature abolished the\n\nboard of education. See Clark v. Bd. of Dirs., 24 Iowa 266, 274 (1868)\n\n(quoting article IX, division 1, section 12 by stating “that provision shall\n\nbe made ‘for the education of all the youths of the State through a system\n\nof   common     schools,’    which   constitutional   declaration   has   been\n\f                                           80\n\neffectuated by enactments providing for the ‘instruction of youth between\n\nthe ages of five and twenty-one years’ ”). In Clark, the court recognized\n\nthe Iowa constitutional rights of all children to obtain an education and\n\nthat the education provided by the state must be provided equally to all\n\nchildren. Id. at 272–77. The analyses in Justice Mansfield’s opinion and\n\nthe concurring opinion of Chief Justice Cady of this important issue\n\nwithout allowing the parties to properly brief and argue it deprives the\n\nplaintiffs of their day in court. 32         As Justice Stevens of the Supreme\n\nCourt noted, “[T]he adversary process functions most effectively when we\n\nrely on the initiative of lawyers, rather than the activism of judges, to\n\nfashion the questions for review.” New Jersey v. T.L.O., 468 U.S. 1214,\n\n1216, 104 S. Ct. 3583, 3585, 82 L. Ed. 2d 881, 883 (1984) (Stevens, J.,\n\ndissenting) (emphasis added).\n\n       Justice Mansfield’s opinion and the concurring opinion of Chief\n\nJustice Cady perfectly illustrate the reasons for Justice Stevens’ warning.\n\nThese opinions address the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims in order to\n\ndismiss the case.       In doing so, these opinions fail to fully explore the\n\nparameters of the right to an education guaranteed by the Iowa\n\nConstitution. These opinions pick article IX, division 2, section 3 of the\n\nIowa Constitution to evaluate the merits of the case even though the\n\nparties did not brief or raise this section on appeal. To compound their\n\nmistake, these opinions fail to address the education clause found in\n\n\n       32Justice  Mansfield’s opinion and the concurring opinion of Chief Justice Cady\nignore this constitutional argument because it was not raised in the district court. To\nme, it is inconsistent to decide the case on appeal on issues and arguments that were\nnot raised below, but to deny the plaintiffs their day in court to develop all of their\narguments fully, including those arguments they could have made under article IX,\ndivision 1, section 12 of the Iowa Constitution. After all, the State did not appeal the\nmerits of this case. If these opinions had not reached beyond the arguments presented\nby the parties on appeal and we had decided this appeal in favor of the plaintiffs solely\non the issue of political question, it is logical to conclude the plaintiffs would have had\nthe opportunity to develop more fully their arguments in the district court on remand.\n\f                                     81\n\narticle IX, division 1, section 12 of the Iowa Constitution on the grounds\n\nthe parties did not raise it in the district court. In other words, to reach\n\na desired result, these opinions pick and choose which arguments to\n\nmake and which arguments not to make under their own error\n\npreservation rule. To me, it is inconsistent to decide the case on appeal\n\non issues and arguments the parties did not raise below, but to deny the\n\nplaintiffs their day in court to develop all of their arguments fully,\n\nincluding those arguments they could have made under article IX,\n\ndivision 1, section 12 of the Iowa Constitution.\n\n      These opinions also frame their own arguments regarding equal\n\nprotection and due process without the input of the attorneys on appeal\n\nand subsequently knock those arguments down to reach a desired result\n\nin this case. The fairest way to resolve these issues is not for the court to\n\npick and choose sua sponte which issues and arguments to decide and\n\nwhich to ignore, but rather to remand the case to the district court for\n\nthe parties to frame and fully brief all arguments relevant to this\n\nimportant issue.\n\n      An additional reason we do not decide issues raised for the first\n\ntime during oral argument is that it would be unfair to second-guess the\n\nstrategy of the State. It may have made a conscious decision not to raise\n\nthe alternative ground on appeal. See Fencl v. City of Harpers Ferry, 620\n\nN.W.2d 808, 811–12 (Iowa 2000) (stating that “we may still affirm if there\n\nis an alternative ground, raised in the district court and urged on appeal,\n\nthat can support the court’s decision”). Maybe the State wanted to focus\n\nthe appeal on what it thought was its best chance for affirmance. By not\n\nurging an alternative ground on appeal, the State may have conceded\n\nthat it would not win on its motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause\n\nof action under our liberal notice pleading rules. It is possible the State\n\f                                     82\n\ndecided it wanted to win on a summary judgment instead of procedural\n\ngrounds. It also may have decided it would have had a better chance of\n\nprevailing on a motion for summary judgment after better developing a\n\nrecord. See, e.g., Fitzgerald v. Racing Ass’n of Cent. Iowa, 539 U.S. 103,\n\n110, 123 S. Ct. 2156, 2161, 156 L. Ed. 2d 97, 105 (2003) (deciding a\n\nconstitutional claim in favor of the State after a motion for summary\n\njudgment); Varnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862, 907 (2009) (deciding a\n\nstatute was unconstitutional after developing the record in a summary\n\njudgment proceeding); Ames Rental Prop. Ass’n v. City of Ames, 736\n\nN.W.2d 255, 263 (Iowa 2007) (deciding an ordinance was constitutional\n\nafter developing the record in a summary judgment proceeding); City of\n\nWaterloo v. Selden, 251 N.W.2d 506, 510 (Iowa 1977) (finding the\n\nsummary judgment record affirmatively established at least one rational\n\nbasis, and therefore, the statute was constitutional).\n\n      Finally, an appeal is between the attorneys and the parties they\n\nrepresent. Our law clerks and judges should not be doing the work of\n\ncounsel or making strategic decisions on which issues to appeal.         See\n\nUnited States v. Wagner, 103 F.3d 551, 552 (7th Cir. 1996). We are not\n\nadvocates and should not usurp a party’s strategy.\n\n      The public has criticized this court for reaching out and deciding\n\nissues not raised or briefed on appeal. This is another case for the critics\n\nto add to their list. We cannot have a rule of law that we reach out and\n\ndecide an issue not briefed or pressed by the parties on appeal in order\n\nto achieve a desired result. Only time will tell if the court will apply this\n\nrule in a principled fashion or if the court will use it to achieve results\n\nfavored by the shifting majorities of the court. In particular, it would be\n\na most unfortunate development to see a liberal approach to preservation\n\nto deny individual rights, and a “gotcha” or cramped approach to\n\f                                       83\n\npreservation in order to avoid consideration of issues that would tend to\n\nvindicate individual rights.      See, e.g., Mulhern v. Catholic Health\n\nInitiatives, 799 N.W.2d 104, 123 (Iowa 2011) (Wiggins, J., dissenting)\n\n(explaining the majority decided the case on an issue not tried in the\n\ndistrict court or argued on appeal).\n\n      I do not see how we can continue to assert in criminal cases that\n\nerror not preserved on appeal is “waived,” or how we can say the failure\n\nto cite authority in a criminal case leads to waiver when, in this case, we\n\nhave no briefing whatsoever on issues other than on the political\n\nquestion issue.\n\n      Further, because Justice Mansfield’s opinion and concurring\n\nopinion of Chief Justice Cady reach the merits of the constitutional\n\nissues, they appear to overrule our decision in Racing Association of\n\nCentral Iowa v. Fitzgerald (RACI), 675 N.W.2d 1 (Iowa 2004), without the\n\nbenefits of an appellate brief by the parties. In those cases, we said, in\n\ndeciding a state constitutional equal protection challenge, we first\n\ndetermine whether the legislature had a valid reason to treat similarly\n\nsituated persons differently. RACI, 675 N.W.2d at 7. Next, we decide if\n\nthis reason has a basis in fact. Id. at 8.\n\n      There is no way we can do a proper analysis under our existing law\n\nas to whether the reason for the disparity has a basis in fact without the\n\nplaintiffs’ evidence and arguments on the issue. It appears members of\n\nthe court want to overrule RACI.            It is their prerogative to do so.\n\nHowever, without the plaintiffs briefing the issue, members of the court\n\nare promoting their own agenda. It would have been nice if the plaintiffs\n\nhad weighed in on these issues.\n\n      There will be time enough to sort through the complicated issues\n\nin this case.     We do a disservice to the ordinary judicial process by\n\f                                      84\n\ndeciding this case without briefing in this court and without a fuller\n\ndevelopment in the district court.      As noted by the Missouri Supreme\n\nCourt in the context of an education case, “It is unwise for courts to\n\nshortcut procedural requirements necessary to fully and fairly address\n\nthe substantive issues in cases of great public significance, when those\n\nsame procedures would be required without pause in cases of lesser\n\nmagnitude.” Comm. for Educ. Equal. v. State, 878 S.W.2d 446, 454 (Mo.\n\n1994).   In fact, I was unable to find any case dealing with a state’s\n\neducation clause that reached this important issue when the parties did\n\nnot brief it on appeal.\n\n      Justice Mansfield’s opinion also cites the political activity of the\n\nother branches of government as a reason to address the issues that\n\nwere not appealed.        I would answer the justification given by Justice\n\nMansfield’s opinion by noting the judicial branch is different from the\n\nother branches of government.        The legislative and executive branches\n\nset their own agenda and decide what issues they want to address. The\n\njudicial branch is different. We do not decide issues unless a party in a\n\nlegal action has raised the issues in the district court, has fully briefed\n\nthe issues on appeal, and has asked us to reach the issues on appeal. In\n\nshort, we do not set our own agenda.\n\n      We only decide issues raised and briefed by the parties.       To do\n\notherwise is nothing more than Justice Mansfield’s opinion and the\n\nconcurring opinion of Chief Justice Cady setting their own error\n\npreservation rules to reach issues not urged on appeal. Here, the State\n\ndid not brief the issues reached by Justice Mansfield’s opinion and the\n\nconcurring opinion of Chief Justice Cady in this appeal. Moreover, the\n\nState did not ask us to reach those issues. The mere fact the legislative\n\f                                    85\n\nand executive branches are dealing with education issues does not give\n\nthis court the license to weigh in on those issues.\n\n      This important case calls for judicial restraint.   Members of the\n\ncourt should not be espousing their own views on issues not raised or\n\nbriefed in this court. Accordingly, I would remand the case to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings on the constitutional claims.\n\n      Hecht and Appel, JJ., join this dissent.\n\f                                    86\n\n                                                  #08–2006, King v. State\n\nAPPEL, Justice (dissenting).\n\n      I respectfully dissent.\n\n      I concur with Justice Wiggins’s opinion. In light of the virtually\n\nunprecedented determination of Justice Mansfield’s opinion to reach out\n\nto uphold the district court on grounds other than those decided by the\n\ndistrict court and that the parties chose not to present on appeal, I\n\nproceed to state my views on why these alternative grounds do not\n\nprovide a basis for dismissal in this case at the very inception of the\n\nlawsuit.\n\n      In my view, education is a fundamental interest or right under the\n\nIowa Constitution. Deprivations of a basic or adequate education should\n\nbe subject to heightened judicial review, and other material differences in\n\neducation should be subject to judicial review under a meaningful\n\nrational basis test. I further believe the pleading, though not very clear,\n\nis sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss at this stage of the\n\nproceedings under our well-established liberal pleading rules.     I would\n\ntherefore reverse the district court and remand the case for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n      I. Overview of Plaintiffs’ Petition.\n\n      The plaintiffs in this case are from both rural and urban school\n\ndistricts alleging shortcomings in the education provided by the State.\n\nThey allege, among other things, that the State has failed to provide them\n\nwith “equal access to an effective education” and that the State has failed\n\n“to establish and maintain an adequate education delivery system.”\n\n      The plaintiffs’ petition in this case alleges the State’s educational\n\nrequirements and accreditation standards do not ensure that students\n\n“will be able to meet and exceed the technological, informational and\n\f                                    87\n\ncommunication demands of society so that they can be prepared for\n\nresponsible citizenship, further learning and productive employment in a\n\nglobal economy.” They claim that many Iowa students “are not prepared\n\nto enter the workforce or post-secondary education without additional\n\ntraining or remediation.”\n\n      The plaintiffs support their adequacy claim with various statistics.\n\nThey allege, for instance, that under the National Assessment of\n\nAcademic Progress standards, only thirty-three percent of Iowa fourth\n\ngrade students are proficient in math, and only thirty-seven percent of\n\nstudents are proficient in reading. It is alleged that similar proficiency\n\nlevels are achieved for eighth graders.\n\n      The plaintiffs also allege that the smallest school districts in Iowa\n\nare disadvantaged in that they have teachers with less experience and\n\nthat the teachers have nearly double the teaching assignments compared\n\nwith teachers in larger school districts. They also claim rural students\n\nhave far fewer curriculum units available to students. They allege that\n\nthere is a disparity in educational outcomes based upon where one lives.\n\n      The plaintiffs assert that the lack of adequate education violates\n\nthe education provisions of article IX of the Iowa Constitution; the\n\nprivileges and immunities clause of the Iowa Constitution; the due\n\nprocess clause of the Iowa Constitution; and statutory standards\n\nestablished in Iowa Code section 256.37, which declares that it is the\n\npolicy of the state “to provide an education system that prepares the\n\nchildren of this state to meet and exceed the technological, informational,\n\nand communications demands of our society.”           The plaintiffs seek\n\ndeclaratory relief as well as a writ of mandamus, and the district court\n\nwas urged to retain continuing jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing\n\nits orders and judgments.\n\f                                        88\n\n      II. Historical Roles of National and State Government in\n\nEducating Children.\n\n      A. Introduction.        In order to provide the necessary context for\n\nconsideration of the constitutional issues raised in Justice Mansfield’s\n\nopinion (but not in the appellate briefs), I review the contrasting roles of\n\nthe state and national governments in the provision of education to\n\nchildren.    As will be seen below, although the national government\n\ntraditionally has supported education of children through land grants\n\nand financial assistance, the responsibility for providing education to\n\nchildren has been the duty of state and local governments.\n\n      B. The Limited Role of the National Government in the\n\nEducation of Children. The education of children had little to do with\n\nthe American Revolution. The grievances against King George III in the\n\nDeclaration of Independence had nothing to do with the education of\n\nchildren. The education of children was not mentioned in the Articles of\n\nConfederation or in the United States Constitution. The only mention of\n\neducation in the debates at the constitutional convention was a\n\nsuggestion by Madison and Pickney that Congress be expressly\n\nauthorized to establish a university, a proposal that was rejected. James\n\nMadison, Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, at 477–78,\n\n639 (Bicentennial ed., W.W. Norton & Co., Inc. 1987); see Lawrence A.\n\nCremin, American Education: The National Experience 1783–1876, at 127\n\n(1980) [hereinafter Cremin].\n\n      The lack of discussion of education of children in revolutionary and\n\nconstitutional     contexts   does   not     mean   that    the   founders   were\n\nunconcerned about education.           The contrary is true.      From the very\n\nbeginning,   the    founders    were    advocates    of    expanding   children’s\n\neducation.\n\f                                    89\n\n       For example, Thomas Jefferson, while serving in the Virginia\n\nlegislature, was a fierce advocate of a Bill for the More General Diffusion\n\nof Knowledge, which would have established a system of free schools\n\nsupported by tuition and scholarships for poor boys. Ian C. Friedman,\n\nEducation Reform 8 (2004). In a letter to George Washington, Jefferson\n\nexplained it was axiomatic that liberty could never be safe but “in the\n\nhands of the people themselves, and that too of the people with a certain\n\ndegree of instruction.”     Gordon C. Lee, Learning and Liberty: The\n\nJeffersonian Tradition in Education, in Crusade Against Ignorance:\n\nThomas Jefferson on Education 19 (1961). “This,” Jefferson wrote, “is the\n\nbusiness of the state to effect, and on a general plan.” Id.\n\n       John Adams was the principal author of the Massachusetts\n\nConstitution of 1780.     As adopted, the Massachusetts Constitution of\n\n1780 provided, “Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused\n\ngenerally among the body of the people, being necessary for the\n\npreservation of their rights and liberties,” the legislature has a duty to\n\n“cherish” the interests of science and literature. Mass. Const. of 1780,\n\npt. II, ch. 5, § 2.\n\n       Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and\n\nmember of the Continental Congress, addressed the Pennsylvania\n\nlegislature with his essays, “A Plan for the Establishment of Public\n\nSchools and the Diffusion of Knowledge in Pennsylvania” and “Thoughts\n\nupon the Mode of Education Proper in a Republic.” Frederick M. Hess,\n\nThe Same Thing Over and Over: How School Reformers Get Stuck in\n\nYesterday’s Ideas 44 (2010).      Rush called for a free school in every\n\ntownship and universal education at public expense, reasoning that all\n\ncitizens, rich and poor, would have a role in selecting the nation’s leaders\n\f                                    90\n\nand that, as a result, everyone was entitled to at least a minimal amount\n\nof education in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Id. at 44–45.\n\n       Jefferson, Adams, and Rush had at least three things in common.\n\nFirst, they were advocates of education of children.    Second, they saw\n\neducation of children as linked to the successful operation of democratic\n\ngovernment. But for my purposes, the most important point is that they\n\nviewed the states as the governmental structure to deliver education to\n\ncitizens.\n\n       During the formative years of our country, the federal government\n\nsupported the education of children by providing resources to assist\n\nstate and local governments in providing education to citizens. First, the\n\nfederal government provided public land for school uses in the states\n\nthrough the Land Ordinance of 1785, which required land to be set aside\n\nfor school uses. 28 Journals of the Continental Congress 378 (May 20,\n\n1785). Second, in its organizations of the territories and admission of\n\nstates, Congress demanded educational progress.         In the Northwest\n\nOrdinance of 1787, Congress required public education to be “forever\n\nencouraged” in the covered territories.        Northwest Ordinance, 32\n\nJournals of the Continental Congress 340 (July 13, 1787). The federal\n\ngovernment itself, however, had no direct role in the education of\n\nchildren, but simply provided important financial support through land\n\ngrants to states and local governments who bore the responsibility of\n\nproviding education.\n\n       The encouragement of public education took on added meaning\n\nwhen a territory applied to become a state. Under Article IV, Section 4 of\n\nthe United States Constitution, Congress was empowered to admit states\n\nonly if they had a “Republican Form of Government.” U.S. Const. art. IV,\n\n§ 4.   As states were admitted to the Union, it became “a working\n\f                                    91\n\nassumption that public education was an essential feature of a\n\nrepublican government based upon the will of the people.” David Tyack,\n\nThomas James & Aaron Benavot, Law and the Shaping of Public\n\nEducation, 1785–1954, at 20 (1987).\n\n      Prominent antebellum education leaders such as Horace Mann of\n\nMassachusetts, Calvin Wiley of North Carolina, Caleb Mills of Indiana,\n\nSamuel Lewis of Ohio, John D. Pierce of Michigan, Robert Breckinridge of\n\nKentucky, Ninian Edwards of Illinois, Henry Barnard of Connecticut and\n\nRhode Island, and John Swett of California all recognized the role of the\n\nstates in providing education to children and youth. See David B. Tyack,\n\nTurning Points in American Educational History 125 (1967).           These\n\nprominent advocates of universal education sought to advance their\n\ncause not through pontifications in the halls of Congress, but in the local\n\nlyceum and through mechanisms of state and local government.\n\n      C. The Duty of State Government to Provide Education to\n\nChildren. In contrast to the limited role of the federal government, the\n\nstates had direct responsibility of providing education. The difference in\n\ninvolvement between the federal government and the state governments\n\non educational matters was a night and day contrast until very recently.\n\nFurther, education traditionally has been one of the most important\n\nfunctions of state government.           A brief survey of Iowa history\n\ndemonstrates these points.\n\n      While revolutionary leaders tended to emphasize education of the\n\nelite, the movement for universal education through common schools\n\nemphasizing republican virtues began in the early nineteenth century\n\nand was in full bloom during the 1830s as the movement for expanded\n\nsuffrage advanced. The focus of the common school movement was on\n\nstate and local governments. See generally Frederick M. Binder, The Age\n\f                                    92\n\nof the Common School, 1830–1865 (1974); Cremin; Carl F. Kaestle, Pillars\n\nof the Republic: Common Schools and American Society, 1780–1860\n\n(1983).\n\n      Even in the territorial days, the importance of education as a\n\nresponsibility of territorial government was recognized in Iowa. Governor\n\nHenry Dodge of the Wisconsin Territory (which included Iowa at the time)\n\nrecognized the relation between education and democratic government.\n\nIn his first inaugural address, Governor Dodge, in urging the territorial\n\nassembly to provide for the establishment of local academies for the\n\neducation of youth, spoke in obligatory terms:\n\n      It is a duty we owe to the rising generation to endeavor to\n      devise means to improve the condition of those that are to\n      succeed us; the permanence of our institutions, must\n      depend upon the intelligence of the great mass of the people.\n\n1 Benjamin F. Shambaugh, The Messages and Proclamations of the\n\nGovernors of Iowa 9 (1903) [hereinafter Shambaugh].\n\n      Once Iowa became a territory of its own apart from Wisconsin,\n\nRobert Lucas, the first Iowa territorial governor and a delegate of the\n1844 constitutional convention, was a strong advocate of education. In\n\nhis first message to the legislature of the Territory of Iowa, Lucas\n\naddressed education and particularly the need for a system of free\n\ncommon schools. John C. Parish, Iowa Biographical Series: Robert Lucas\n\n286 (1907) [hereinafter Parish].   Lucas stated: “There is no subject to\n\nwhich I wish to call your attention more emphatically, than the subject of\n\nestablishing, at the commencement of our political existence, a well\n\ndigested system of common schools.” 1 Shambaugh at 78; John Purcell\n\nStreet,   Iowa   Department   of   Public   Instruction:   Its   Origins   and\n\nDevelopment, 30 Annals of Iowa 397, 398 (1950) [hereinafter Street].\n\nLucas called on the territorial assembly to “build up a good system as\n\f                                    93\n\nfast as the population and wealth of the territory would warrant.”         1\n\nClarence Ray Aurner, History of Education in Iowa 368 (1914)\n\n[hereinafter Aurner]. The first territorial assembly responded to his call\n\nby enacting legislation calling for the establishment of common schools\n\nin school districts in the respective counties.     1 Edgar R. Harlan, A\n\nNarrative History of the People of Iowa 133 (1931) [hereinafter Harlan].\n\n      Yet, territorial government did not provide the ideal framework for\n\ndevelopment of a system of local education.       Advocates of statehood\n\nappealed to the parents of children, noting that lands reserved by the\n\nfederal government for education purposes could not be obtained without\n\nstatehood. James Alton James, Constitution and Admission of Iowa into\n\nthe Union 15 (1900). Once Iowa was admitted to statehood, Iowa received\n\na grant of five hundred thousand acres of land from the United States for\n\nschool purposes. George Chandler, Iowa and the Nation 17 (Chicago, A.\n\nFlanagan 1895).\n\n      It is thus not surprising that education was emphasized in the first\n\nIowa Constitutions. Article X of the constitutions of 1844 and 1846 dealt\n\nwith education.   The 1844 and 1846 constitutions provided that the\n\ngeneral assembly “shall encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion\n\nof intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement” through\n\n“a system of common schools.” Iowa Const. art. X, §§ 2–3 (1846); Iowa\n\nConst. art. X, §§ 2–3 (1844). According to a contemporaneous account of\n\nthe 1846 constitutional convention:\n\n            Most ample provision is made for educating the rising\n      generation. This is a feature which cannot be too highly\n      prized.—It speaks volumes for the character of our\n      population, and argues well for the prosperity of the people\n      and the success of the great enterprise in which they are\n      about to embark.        Let the moral and mental culture\n      [unintelligible in original] and the free institutions of our\n      country will be safe in their hands.\n\f                                   94\n\nFragments of the Debates of the Iowa Constitutional Conventions of 1844\n\nand 1846, at 339 (Benjamin F. Shambaugh ed., 1900) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n      The inclusion of provisions in the early Iowa Constitutions related\n\nto education was not surplusage or cosmetic features.          One of the\n\nadvantages of statehood was the establishment of machinery to develop a\n\ncoherent educational system. Beginning with the admission of Ohio as a\n\nstate in 1803, Congress required that all subsequent states provide for\n\neducation in their state constitutions as a condition of admission to\n\nstatehood. Gerald Unks, The Illusion of Intrusion: A Chronicle of Federal\n\nAid to Public Education, 49 Educ. F. 133, 136 (1985). After 1815, only\n\nNew Mexico attempted to gain admission into the Union without an\n\neducation clause, and Congress refused to go along. New Mexico then\n\nadded an education clause and was subsequently admitted into the\n\nUnion. See Inst. for Educ. Equity & Opportunity, Education in the 50\n\nStates: A Deskbook of the History of State Constitutions and Laws about\n\nEducation 29 (2008).\n\n      The very first act of the First General Assembly of Iowa was a\n\nmeasure related to school funds, demonstrating the importance of\n\neducation to the fledgling state. 1 Aurner at 16–17. The importance of\n\nthe educational function of government is reflected by the fact that the\n\nChief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court, Charles Mason, was a member\n\nof the first Iowa Board of Education. 2 Aurner at 415 n.105.\n\n      The state’s first Superintendent of Education, Thomas Hart\n\nBenton, Jr., a nephew of the famous Senator from Missouri, was a\n\nnational leader in the education movement, serving on the executive\n\ncommittee of the American Association for the Advancement of\n\nEducation.   Street, 30 Annals of Iowa at 400; Proceedings of the Fifth\n\f                                      95\n\nSession of the American Association for the Advancement of Education 3\n\n(New York, Hartford Press 1856).       Benton served as president of the\n\nEducation Convention of Iowa, which met in 1848 in the old stone capitol\n\nat Iowa City, “to promote by every laudable means the diffusion of\n\nknowledge in regard to education and especially to aid in establishing\n\nand perpetuating a system of common school instruction.”        Parish at\n\n286–87.    Benton later remarked in an 1861 report to the board of\n\neducation that “[a] wagon can better dispense with one wheel than a\n\nneighborhood with the school house.”       R.A. Harkness, Notes on Iowa\n\nEducational Work from 1860 to 1888, 12 Iowa Normal Monthly No. 7, at\n\n298 (1889).   One of Benton’s successors, Oran Fanville, remarked in\n\n1865 that “universal education is the central idea of republicanism.” Id.\n\nat 299.\n\n      Iowa’s early state governors, like Robert Lucas, were advocates for\n\neducation. In 1848, Governor Ansel Briggs recognized the constitutional\n\nsignificance of education, stating:\n      The people of Iowa have ever manifested an earnest and\n      commendable zeal in the spread of education, and,\n      especially, in the establishment of an efficient and\n      permanent system of Common Schools. Of such prominent\n      importance is this subject in their estimation, that they have\n      made the most ample provisions in the Constitution for the\n      spread of education and the support of common\n      schools . . . .\n\n1 Shambaugh at 370.\n\n      In 1852, Governor Hempstead, who was also a delegate of the 1844\n\nconstitutional convention, addressed education in his first biennial\n\nmessage to the Iowa legislature. He noted that “no subject can claim a\n\nmore pressing interest than that of public instruction.” Id. at 430. He\n\nfurther declared:\n      The first great object should be to place within the reach of\n      every child in the state, the opportunity of acquiring those\n\f                                    96\n       indispensable elements of education, which shall fit him for\n       the enlightened discharge of civil and social duties to which\n       he may be called.\n\nId. at 431. Governor Hempstead further emphasized the constitutional\n\nobligations of the state, noting that the Iowa Constitution required that\n\nthe general assembly encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of\n\nintellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement. Id.\n\n       In 1856, Governor James Grimes emphasized education in his\n\ninaugural address. Governor Grimes stated that “[t]o accomplish these\n\nhigh aims of government, the first requisite is ample provision for the\n\neducation of the youth of this State.” 2 Shambaugh at 7. He further\n\ndeclared that “[t]he State should see to it that the elements of education,\n\nlike the elements of universal nature, are above, around, and beneath\n\nall.” Id. Governor Grimes noted that “[i]t is agreed that the safety and\n\nperpetuity of our republican institutions depends upon the diffusion of\n\nintelligence among the masses of the people.” Id.\n\n       In 1856, the general assembly authorized the governor to appoint a\n\ncommission of three persons to revise and improve the school laws of\n\nIowa and to report to the general assembly. Street, 30 Annals of Iowa at\n\n402.   The commission was headed by Horace Mann, the President of\n\nAntioch College in Ohio and one of the most noted educators in the\n\nUnited States. Id. Mann strongly believed in the “[a]bsolute right to an\n\neducation of every human being that comes into the world, and which, of\n\ncourse, proves the correlative duty of every government to see that the\n\nmeans of that education are provided for all.” Serrano v. Priest, 487 P.2d\n\n1241, 1266 (Cal. 1971) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe commission investigated the state of education in other states and\n\nultimately issued a report containing its findings and recommendations.\n\n1 Aurner at 31.\n\f                                    97\n\n      The report of the Mann Commission declared that every youth was\n\nentitled to an education “in the elements of knowledge.”         Id. at 32.\n\nFurther, anyone desirous of further progress should be offered necessary\n\nopportunities. Id.   The report called for provision of common schools,\n\nhigh schools, and the university. Id. at 33. It called for supervision to be\n\nprovided by a state superintendent of public instruction, subject to the\n\nadvice of a state board of education.     Id. at 35.   Perhaps because of\n\nMann’s association with the state, a commentator two decades later\n\ndeclared that “Iowa may be called the Massachusetts of the West. . . .\n\n[T]he cause nearest the hearts of her people is ‘universal education.’ ”\n\nEditorial Preface, 12 Iowa Normal Monthly No. 7, at 1 (1889).\n\n      At the constitutional convention of 1857, considerable emphasis\n\nwas placed on education. Discussing education, James Wilson declared:\n      We know that after all the intelligence of the people is the\n      great bulwark to the stability and permanency of our\n      institutions, and looking upon it in that light, it is our duty,\n      our absolute and imperative duty, to provide the best\n      method and the best means for carrying into effect the\n      common school system of the state.\n\n2 The Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Iowa 750\n\n(W. Blair Lord reporter, Davenport, Luse, Lane & Co. 1857) [hereinafter\nDebates],   available   at   http://www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services/\n\ncollections/law-library/iaconst/. Similarly, J.C. Hall asserted that “[t]he\n\neducational department of our State is a very important one. It embraces\n\none-half of the inhabitants of the State, and for good or for evil it is\n\nproductive of the most important effects upon our population.”           Id. at\n\n725. Further, George W. Ells urged:\n      [I]n laying the foundation for an educational system, we\n      must discard all narrow views and prejudices, and not only\n      provide for the wants of the present generation, but for all\n      future generations. I desire to see the common schools of\n\f                                    98\n      this State so constituted that a thorough knowledge of all the\n      natural sciences will be taught in the most practical manner.\n      Should this point be attained they will contrast most\n      favorably with the superficial education that characterizes a\n      vast number of graduates of chartered colleges of these\n      United States.\n\n1 Debates at 602.\n\n      In light of the emphasis the Iowa framers placed on education, two\n\ndivisions were adopted that dealt with the subject.      The first division\n\ndealt primarily with the responsibilities of a state board of education,\n\nwhich was vested with authority to oversee the development of public\n\neducation in the state. Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1 (1857 original version).\n\nThe second division related to financing of public education. Id. art. IX,\n\ndiv. 2.   With respect to the constitutional provision that “the General\n\nAssembly shall encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of\n\nintellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement,” id. art. IX,\n\ndiv. 2, § 3, one scholar has noted that “[a]s a positive provision no clause\n\nhas had a wider application in popular benefits,” Harlan at 185. It is\n\nobserved that “[a]n educational system, based upon common schools . . .\n\nwas one of the cornerstones of the new commonwealth” and that Iowa\n\nwas taking a stand that at the time was distinctively “progressive.”\nHarlan at 185.\n\n      From 1857 to 1864, the state board of education performed its\n\nconstitutional duties.   In 1864, however, the newly elected governor,\n\nWilliam Stone, recommended abolition of the state board of education.\n\nGovernor Stone stated the purpose of creating the board of education\n\nwas to establish a permanent and satisfactory system of public education\n\nin Iowa. 3 Shambaugh at 7. Governor Stone urged the discontinuation\n\nof the board because the purpose had been accomplished. Id. In 1864,\n\f                                     99\n\nthe general assembly abolished the board of education and established a\n\nsuperintendent of public instruction. See 1864 Iowa Acts ch. 52, § 1.\n\n      Nothing in the historical record suggests that the abolition of the\n\nboard of education reflected a lessened constitutional commitment to\n\neducation. Experience under the 1857 constitution demonstrated that\n\nvesting legislative power over educational matters with the board, but the\n\npower of the purse with the general assembly, proved awkward at best.\n\nBut the commitment to education remained. According to a leading Iowa\n\nhistorian:\n\n      There was a belief so widespread as to be almost universal\n      that, narrow as were the powers of the State, instruction so\n      differed from all things else that every child in the\n      community was entitled to a chance at the public cost to\n      obtain the essentials of the thing called education.\n\nI George F. Parker, Iowa Pioneer Foundations 455 (1940).\n\n      Governors subsequently continued to be strong advocates for\n\neducation after the state board was abolished.         Governor Cyrus Clay\n\nCarpenter in his first inaugural address on January 11, 1872, stated in\n\nconnection with education that “[n]ext to political freedom, the most\n\nimportant element of a good government is an intelligent people.”         4\n\nShambaugh at 8. While recognizing the progress that had been made, he\n\ncalled for the establishment of a Normal School, or teachers college, to\n\ntrain teachers for their important task. Id. at 8–9.\n\n      The relationship between education and freedom was repeated by\n\nGovernor Buren Robinson Sherman in his January 12, 1882 inaugural\n\naddress. Governor Sherman declared:\n\n      The education of the masses is the surest reliance of the\n      State, and everywhere free schools exist. Through their\n      powerful enlightening influences and strong progression the\n      integrity of our political fabric, the security to the enterprise\n      of the citizen, and the equality and happiness of the people\n\f                                     100\n      are solidly assured. Popular education has become firmly\n      entrenched in the confidence of the nation, and there is no\n      feature of our whole system so near to the general heart, nor\n      regarded with such affectionate anxiety as the free public\n      schools of the country.\n\n5 Shambaugh at 241.\n\n      Further, Governor Sherman observed “our educational system”\n\nthrough all time “will prove the very sheet-anchor to our liberties, as the\n\nfree-ballot is the corner-stone to our political structure.” Id. at 242.\n\n      Governor William Larrabee took up education in his first inaugural\naddress on January 14, 1886. He declared, “If it is true, as I hold it to\n\nbe, that ignorance, poverty and crime are intimately related, it is the duty\n\nof every state to educate.”     6 Shambaugh at 14.       He noted that “[a]\n\nrepublic can survive war, famine and pestilence, but it cannot survive\n\nthe intelligence of its people.” Id. at 15.\n\n      In the Progressive Era, many educational reformers emphasized\n\nthe need to eliminate politics from education, develop a regime of experts,\n\nand offer highly differentiated education to youth based upon their ability\n\nand future role in society. It was an era of the “Education Commission.”\n\nIowa had three of them. A school commission in 1907 recommended,\n\namong other things, approval of curriculum by the superintendent of\n\npublic instruction.    Street, 30 Annals of Iowa at 445.         In 1911, the\n\n“Better Iowa Schools Commission” met and recommended increased\n\npower and efficiency in the department of public instruction, the\n\nemployment of a “rural school inspector” under the department of public\n\ninstruction, and that the office of superintendent of public instruction be\n\nconverted into a nonpartisan electoral post.       Id. at 446.    In 1939, a\n\nschool code commission reviewed the laws of Iowa and produced a\n\nreport; a second school code commission was convened in 1941 and\n\nproduced another report. Id. at 447–48. The latter code commissions\n\f                                       101\n\ncalled for strengthening the county administration of schools, that the\n\ncost of transporting pupils be paid in whole or in part by the state, that\n\none quarter of the cost of public school education should be paid from\n\nstate    funds   to   relieve   property   taxes   and   “equalize   educational\n\nopportunity,” and “[t]hat teachers be given greater security of tenure.”\n\nId. at 448–49.\n\n        While the philosophy of the progressive movement emphasized\n\ndifferent themes than the common school movement, the emphasis on\n\neducation as being critical to democratic values was a constant.             As\n\nnoted by Iowa Superintendent of Public Instruction P. E. McClenahan,\n\n“[e]ducation is a function of the state, and popular education is the only\n\nmeans of attaining social, political, and individual freedom.”             P. E.\n\nMcClenahan, Report of the Department of Public Instruction 9 (June 30,\n\n1922).\n\n        The emphasis on the need for quality education surfaced again in\n\nthe post WWII years. In September of 1954, President Eisenhower sent a\n\nletter to all state governors calling for statewide conferences on the\n\nstatus of education, and Iowa responded with a statewide conference in\n\nDes Moines in December 1954.           Letter from Dwight D. Eisenhower to\n\nGovernors (September 20, 1954) in Program from the Iowa State\n\nConference on Education (Dec. 9–10, 1954).               In the 1960s, Iowa’s\n\nDepartment of Public Instruction called for an “educational revolution,”\n\nnoting that education is no longer “a purely local concern” but “a state\n\nresponsibility.” Iowa Dep’t of Public Instruction, 63d Biennial Report 16\n\n(1966) (emphasis added). Governor Robert Ray in 1981–1982 served as\n\nchair of the Education Commission of the States, an organization\n\ndedicated to help states develop effective policies and practices in public\n\f                                         102\n\neducation.     See Education Commission of the States (Mar. 21, 2012),\n\nhttp://www.ecs.org.\n\n       In recent years, there has been what has been labeled a standards\n\nand accountability movement in education. In 1983, President Reagan’s\n\nDepartment of Education issued a report entitled, “A Nation at Risk: The\n\nImperative for Educational Reform,” which called for higher standards\n\nand more accountability in education generally.                In 1989, President\n\nGeorge    Bush     convened     a   meeting of      the    nation’s   governors     in\n\nCharlottesville, Virginia to address the perceived shortcomings in\n\neducation.     Recently, a summit on education was held attended by\n\nnational educational leaders and Iowa educators and administrators.\n\nGovernor Branstad, who has found inspiration in Robert Lucas’s\n\ntraditional commitment to education, 33 has proposed important changes\n\nto the Iowa education system, which will be the subject of public\n\ndiscussion and potential legislative action in the coming years.\n\n       This brief and nonexhaustive overview demonstrates that, in\n\ncontrast to the federal government, education has played a central role in\n\nIowa state government. While the federal government from time to time\n\nhas shown an interest in education and has been indirectly involved in\nfostering it, the states have performed the fundamentally different role of\n\nprimary provider of education.\n\n       From a historical perspective, the provision of education by Iowa\n\nstate government has been seen as one of its primary and most\n\ncelebrated functions. Recognition of the centrality and importance of the\n\nrole of state government in providing education has transcended our\n\n        33In his inaugural address in 1987, Governor Branstad, in calling for\n\neducational reform, stated that “our commitment to education is not new” and cited\n“our first territorial Governor, Robert Lucas.” 1987 S.J. 94. Governor Branstad further\nmade reference to the state’s “historic commitment to education.” Id. at 95.\n\f                                    103\n\npolitical parties and has been passed on from one generation of Iowa\n\npolitical leaders to another up to and including our present political\n\nleadership.\n\n\n      III. Relationship of Education to Democratic Government,\n\nPersonal Liberty, and Human Dignity.\n\n      The historical centrality of education to our state cannot be\n\nunderestimated.     In order to fully understand the importance of\n\neducation, however, a review of the three important functions of\n\neducation provides additional perspective.      First, education is vital to\n\ndemocratic government.        Second, education is a prerequisite for\n\nmeaningful enjoyment of fundamental constitutional rights, including\n\nenjoyment of “life, liberty, and property.” Third, it is an essential part of\n\nthe development of an autonomous personality that is a prerequisite for\n\nhuman dignity.\n\n      At the dawn of our nation, de Tocqueville recognized that “the\n\ninstruction of the people powerfully contributes to the support of a\n\ndemocratic process.” 1 Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America 342\n\n(D. Appleton & Co. 1904). Thomas Mann emphasized that education can\n\nnever be less than such\n\n      “as is indispensable for the civil functions of a witness or a\n      juror; as is necessary for the voter in municipal and national\n      affairs; and finally, as is requisite for the faithful and\n      conscientious discharge of all those duties which devolve\n      upon the inheritor of a portion of the sovereignty of this great\n      republic.”\n\nMcDuffy v. Sec’y of Exec. Office of Educ., 615 N.E.2d 516, 555 (Mass.\n\n1993) (quoting The Massachusetts System of Common Schools: Tenth\n\nAnnual Report of the Massachusetts Board of Education 17 (1849)).\n\nPresident Grant drove the point home when speaking in Des Moines on\n\f                                    104\n\nSeptember 25, 1875, when he declared that “the free school is the\n\npromoter of that intelligence which is to preserve us as a free nation.”\n\nJacob Armstrong Swisher, Iowa Biographical Series: Leonard Fletcher\n\nParker 69 (1927). Grant further noted that if another contest of national\n\nexistence were to arrive in the future, it would be “between patriotism\n\nand intelligence on the one side, and superstition, ambition and\n\nignorance on the other.” Id. at 69–70.\n\n      The relationship of education to democratic government was\n\nrecognized by John W. Studebaker, a distinguished Iowan who served as\n\nDes Moines School Superintendent before being appointed United States\n\nCommissioner     of   Education.     Studebaker     observed   that   “good\n\ngovernment through democratic processes can be preserved . . . only by\n\ndefinitely planned development of the means of public enlightenment.”\n\nJohn W. Studebaker, The American Way: Democracy at Work in the\n\nDes Moines Forums 15–16 (1935).\n\n      The United States Supreme Court recognized the linkage between\n\neducation and democracy in San Antonio Independent School District v.\n\nRodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 36, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 1298, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16, 44\n\n(1973), when it noted that democracy depends upon “an informed\n\nelectorate: a voter cannot cast his ballot intelligently unless his reading\n\nskills and thought processes have been adequately developed.”             A\n\ncorollary of the right to vote is the right to be educated so as to exercise\n\nthat right in an effective manner.    See Susan H. Bitensky, Theoretical\n\nFoundations for a Right to Education Under the U.S. Constitution: A\n\nBeginning to the End of the National Education Crisis, 86 Nw. U. L. Rev.\n\n550, 606 (1992) [hereinafter Bitensky].\n\n      Certainly the parade of Iowa’s governors cited earlier would\n\nwholeheartedly endorse the concept that education is critically important\n\f                                       105\n\nto the functioning of democratic government.               Today, without an\n\neducated people, spectacle, celebrity culture, escalating emotional\n\noutburst, and demand for instant gratification will replace rationality,\n\ntolerance, and mutual respect in the voting booths and in the public\n\nsquare.\n\n      In addition, education is now critical to meaningful enjoyment of\n\nlife in Iowa and the United States.      The prospects of a person who is\n\nuneducated are now marginal at best.                Farming is increasingly\n\nindustrialized and requires knowledge of markets, fertilizers, hybrids,\n\nand planning techniques. Manufacturing jobs are no longer unskilled,\n\nbut require sophisticated knowledge, training, and skills. Ditches are no\n\nlonger dug by hand. If a citizen is to have a meaningful right to enjoy the\n\nconstitutionally protected interests in life, liberty, and property, the\n\ncitizen must have an adequate education. Justice Cardozo captured the\n\nidea in his typically lyrical prose:\n\n      “We are free only if we know, and so in proportion to our\n      knowledge. There is no freedom without choice, and there is\n      no choice without knowledge—or none that is not illusory.\n      Implicit, therefore, in the very notion of liberty is the liberty\n      of the mind to absorb and to beget.”\n\nBitensky, 86 Nw. U. L. Rev. at 550 (quoting Benjamin N. Cardozo, The\n\nParadoxes of Legal Science 104 (photo reprint 1982) (1928)).\n\n      The importance of education in empowering individuals to\n\nparticipate meaningfully in life did not escape school officials in Iowa\n\nsmall towns. For instance, the bold statement “Knowledge is Power” was\n\nemblazoned on the third story of a school house in Persia, Iowa in 1885.\n\nSee Camilla Dieber and Peggy Beedle, Country Schools for Iowa 9 (2002).\n\n      Finally,   education    is   essential   to   the   development   of   an\n\nautonomous individual that is the essence of human dignity.                  The\n\f                                          106\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which has been ratified by the\n\nUnited States, declares that the right to education is a human right and\n\nthat the purpose of the human right is to provide for the “full\n\ndevelopment of the human personality.” Universal Declaration of Human\n\nRights, G.A. Res. 217 (III) A, art. 26, § 2, U.N. Doc. A/RES/217(III) (Dec.\n\n10, 1948). 34    As one commentator has noted, education “takes on the\n\nstatus of a human right because it is integral to and enhances human\n\ndignity through its fruits of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding” and\n\n“a prerequisite for individuals to function as fully human beings in\n\nmodern society.”       Richard Pierre Claude, The Right to Education and\n\nHuman Rights Education, in Human Rights in the World Community:\n\nIssues and Actions 211 (Richard Pierre Claude & Burns H. Veston eds.,\n\n3d ed. 2006). A lack of education severely undermines the capacity of\n\nthe individual to make meaningful life choices with respect to marriage\n\nand family, self-expression, political voice, religious observance, and\n\neconomic role and ambition. 35\n\n\n        34My citation to the education provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human\n\nRights has drawn criticism today. The criticism might more appropriately be aimed at\nEleanor Roosevelt, who chaired the drafting committee that produced the Declaration,\nor to the members of the United States Senate, which ratified it. I recognize that the\nDeclaration was designed to be nonbinding—indeed, the decision to use the term\n“Declaration” was modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence. Of\ncourse, I do not suggest that the participants in the Iowa constitutional conventions\nrelied on the Declaration, which was approved a hundred years later. I do suggest,\nhowever, that the Declaration reinforces the widely accepted view that education is\nbroadly regarded as a basic human right and that it is integrally related to the\ndevelopment of the individual. That point, it seems, has not been assailed.\n       35In  looking at legal questions from a broad perspective for nonbinding but\ninstructive lessons, I am in good company. The leaders of the American Revolution and\nthe founding fathers certainly did. See, e.g., Bernard Bailyn, The Ideological Origins of\nthe American Revolution 23–44 (Enlarged ed. 1992) (citing extensive use of foreign\nauthorities in publications associated with the American Revolution); James Madison,\nNotes of the Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, at 54, 59, 63, 76, 83, 100, 126,\n132, 136–37, 141, 143, 145, 161, 205, 207, 214–15, 223, 241, 255–56, 307, 334, 359,\n364, 418, 463 (Bicentennial ed., W.W.

In addition, the founders were all familiar with\ninternational authorities such as Vattel, Grotius, Montesquieu, Burlamaqui, and\nPufendorf. See generally Donald S.

It is a one-of-a-kind interest.          It goes to the very heart of\n\ndemocratic government, to the essence of enjoyment of life itself, and to\n\nthe core of human dignity.                 Without education, our democratic\n\ngovernment will be undermined, the quality of life will deteriorate beyond\n\nrecognition, and the realization of autonomous personality required for\n\nhuman dignity will become virtually impossible.\n\n       IV. Overview of Iowa Constitutional Provisions.\n\n       A. Positive Educational Provisions of the Iowa Constitution.\n\nAs indicated above, the United States Constitution says nothing about\n\neducation.     This is not surprising since it was universally assumed by\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\n        The framers of the Iowa Constitution applied a broad perspective to their task as\nwell, specifically in the field of education. George W. Ells, in debating the importance of\neducation during the 1857 constitutional convention, observed:\n       [I]n those countries of Europe where education has taken the deepest\n       root, and been the most generally diffused among the masses, that the\n       people are correspondingly steady, firm and abiding in their attachment\n       to free and liberal institutions of all kinds. The Germans are a striking\n       illustration of the truth of this assertion. With them, education is the\n       rule, and ignorance the exception; while with the volatile Frenchman, the\n       reverse is true.\n1 Debates at 602. It is not surprising that our caselaw has on occasion cited maxims or\nnorms of international law. See Langlas v. Iowa Life Ins. Co., 245 Iowa 717, 718, 63\nN.W.2d 885, 888 (1954) (citing international law treatise in case involving insurance\nclaim arising out of Korean war); Case v. Olson, 234 Iowa 869, 874, 14 N.W.2d 717, 720\n(1944) (citing international law of war in case involving application of soldiers’\npreference clause in civil service statute); Hill v. Baker, 32 Iowa 302, 310 (1871)\n(execution of deed held invalid as contrary to international law); Morrison v. Springer, 15\nIowa 304, 316 (1863) (citing maxims of international law in jurisdictional matter).\n        Consistent with the legal traditions exemplified by the framers of both the Iowa\nand Federal Constitutions, the University of Iowa College of Law has a program in\ninternational and comparative law.         Its website states that international and\ncomparative law “provides an essential theoretical foundation for all lawyers by\naffording unique insight into the nature of law and legal process.” See The University of\nIowa College of Law, International and Comparative Law Program (last visited April 5,\n2012), http://www.law.uiowa.edu/international/.\n\f                                       109\n\nthe founders that the education of children and youth was the obligation\n\nof the state and local government.\n\n      Article IX of the Iowa Constitution of 1857 dealing with education\n\ncontains two divisions. The first division provides, among other things,\n\nthat “[t]he educational interest of the State, including Common Schools\n\n. . . shall be under the management of a Board of Education.”          Iowa\n\nConst. art. IX, div. l, § 1.   The board was required to “provide for the\n\neducation of all the youths of the State, through a system of Common\n\nSchools.” Id. art. IX, div. 1, § 12.\n\n      Article IX of the 1857 Iowa Constitution also contains a second\n\ndivision.   The first sentence of section three of the second division\n\nparallels the substantive provisions of the 1846 constitution by providing\n\nthat “[t]he General Assembly shall encourage, by all suitable means, the\n\npromotion     of   intellectual,   scientific,   moral,   and   agricultural\n\nimprovement.” Id. art. IX, div. 2, § 3.\n\n      The second sentence of section three is more complicated than the\n\nfirst sentence. It provides, in relevant part, that the federal funds, funds\n\nfrom estates with no heirs, and funds that the general assembly may\n\nprovide, “shall be inviolably appropriated to the support of Common\n\nschools throughout the State.” Id.\n\n      During the debates surrounding the education articles in the 1857\n\nconstitution, the convention rejected a proposal that schools should be\n\n“free of charge and equally open to all.” 2 Debates at 825. The reason\n\nfor this rejection, however, was not based on a view that education was\n\nnot fundamentally important, but instead to ensure that schools in Iowa\n\ncould be racially segregated. Mr. Gillaspy, an opponent to the provision,\n\ndeclared that “[i]f the people of this state are disposed to appropriate\n\nmoney for the education of the blacks, let them do it in separate and\n\f                                   110\n\ndistinct schools . . . .” Id. In response, William Penn Clark declared that\n\n“our duty goes for providing every child in the State with an education.”\n\nId. at 826.    Eventually, a substitute amendment was offered that\n\nprovided “for the education of all the youths of the state, through a\n\nsystem of common schools.” Id. at 935. Thus, while the rejection of the\n\nproposed provision that schools be “free of charge and equally open to\n\nall” demonstrates the racial prejudices held by some members of the\n\nconstitutional convention, it does not in any way undercut the\n\nimportance the Iowa framers placed on accessible public education\n\ngenerally.\n\n      Article IX, division one, section fifteen provided the general\n\nassembly with an escape from vesting responsibility for education in the\n\nhands of an independent board of education. Under section fifteen, the\n\ngeneral assembly was vested with the power after 1863 “to abolish or re-\n\norganize said Board of Education, and provide for the educational\n\ninterest of the State in any other manner that to them shall seem best\n\nand proper.”   Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1, § 15.   In 1864, the general\n\nassembly did just that.    As a result, the constitutional provisions of\n\narticle IX, division one, section one, vesting the power to provide\n\neducation in the board of education have no current effect.\n\n      The question arises what we should make of the action of the\n\ngeneral assembly abolishing the board of education. It is clear that the\n\naction renders inoperative the constitutional provisions vesting power\n\nover education with the board of education, including the provision that\n\n“[t]he Board of Education shall provide for the education of all the youths\n\n. . . through a system of Common Schools.” See id. art IX., div. 1, § 12\n\n(emphasis added).    While the board’s constitutional duty to maintain\n\ncommon schools was clearly repealed, the duty of the state to “provide for\n\f                                     111\n\nthe educational interest,” which by definition included “Common\n\nSchools,” was not affected. See id. art. IX, div. 1, §§ 1, 15.\n\n      That the only effect of the legislative abolition of the board of\n\neducation was to shift responsibilities for the provision of education as\n\nrequired by article IX is demonstrated by the case of Clark v. Board of\n\nDirectors, 24 Iowa 266 (1868). Clark, which was decided four years after\n\nthe abolition of the board, addressed the validity of racial segregation in\n\nIowa public schools. Clark, 24 Iowa at 269–70. In concluding that racial\n\nsegregation in public schools was unlawful, we cited and relied upon\n\narticle IX, division 1, section 12, which provides that the board of\n\neducation shall provide “ ‘for the education of all the youths of the State,\n\nthrough a system of common schools.’ ” Id. at 274 (quoting Iowa Const.\n\nart. IX, div. 1, § 12). Clearly, the 1864 abolition of the board of education\n\ndid not affect the substantive requirements contained in article IX, but\n\nmerely shifted authority by abolishing the board and creating a\n\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction.      See id.; 1864 Iowa Acts ch. 52,\n\n§§ 1–2, 5 (declaring that “the Board of Education of the State of Iowa is\n\nhereby abolished,” providing for a Superintendent of Public Instruction,\n\nand charging the Superintendent with the general supervision of “all the\n\nCommon Schools of the State”); see also Hume v. Indep. Sch. Dist., 180\n\nIowa 1233, 1241, 164 N.W. 188, 191 (1917) (citing but not relying on\n\narticle IX, division 1, section 12); Burdick v. Babcock, 31 Iowa 562, 571\n\n(1871) (Cole, J., concurring) (stating “[o]ur constitution has clothed the\n\nlegislature with the power, and has expressly devolved upon it the duty\n\nof ‘providing for the education of all the youths of the State through a\n\nsystem of common schools’ ” (quoting Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1, § 12)).\n\n      The ongoing obligation of the state is also reflected in the language\n\nof article IX, sections one and fifteen, but also demonstrated by the\n\f                                    112\n\nprovisions of article IX, division two, section three, which provides for a\n\n“perpetual fund” that is “inviolably appropriated to the support of\n\nCommon schools throughout the State.” Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 2, § 3.\n\nIt would make no sense to have a “perpetual fund” that is “inviolably\n\nappropriated to the support of Common schools throughout the State” if\n\nthe state, in its discretion, could abolish common schools.         See id.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      Thus, the Iowa Constitution requires a system of common schools\n\nto educate all youths throughout the state, but in terms of the\n\nmanagement of such common schools, it allows the general assembly to\n\n“provide for the educational interest of the State” in a manner other than\n\nthrough the board of education. See id. art. IX, div. 1, § 15. After 1863,\n\nthe legislature was free to choose to manage its common schools through\n\na superintendent of public instruction, a department of education, a\n\ncommittee of scholars, or in “any other manner that to them shall seem\n\nbest and proper.” See id.\n\n      The explicit Iowa constitutional provisions related to “provid[ing]\n\nfor the education of all the youths of the State, through a system of\n\nCommon Schools” and advancing “the educational interest of the State,\n\nincluding Common Schools,” stand in stark contrast to the complete lack\n\nof explicit provisions in the United States Constitution related to\n\neducation and reflect the fundamentally different traditional roles of state\n\nand federal governments when it comes to the education of children and\n\nyouth. The Federal Constitution is generally a limited constitution with\n\nthe federal government only granted powers specifically authorized. In\n\ncontrast, the states have plenary legislative authority and have positive\n\ncommitments in the constitutional frameworks.         In Iowa, one of the\n\npositive commitments in the Iowa Constitution is to the educational\n\f                                           113\n\nmission.    Scholars have suggested that the positive rights tradition of\n\nstate constitutions differs markedly from the negative rights tradition of\n\nfederal constitutional analysis. See Helen Hershkoff, Positive Rights and\n\nState Constitutions: The Limits of Federal Rationality Review, 112 Harv. L.\n\nRev.   1131,    1134–37      (1999)    [hereinafter     Hershkoff].       While    the\n\nenforcement      of   negative    rights    contained    in   the     United   States\n\nConstitution generally has not required affirmative action by government,\n\nDeShaney v. Winnebago Cnty. Dep’t of Soc. Servs., 489 U.S. 189, 199,\n\n109 S. Ct. 998, 1006, 103 L. Ed. 2d 249, 261 (1989), quite the opposite\n\nis true with respect to positive obligations of state governments that, by\n\ndefinition, require the state to take affirmative action to meet its\n\nconstitutional responsibilities.\n\n       B. Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Iowa Constitution.\n\nThe Iowa Constitution has a privileges and immunities clause.                     The\n\nprovision is found in article I, section 6. This section provides:\n              All laws of a general nature shall have a uniform\n       operation; the General Assembly shall not grant to any\n       citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities, which,\n       upon the same terms shall not equally belong to all citizens.\n\nIowa Const. art. I, § 6.         The Iowa privileges and immunities clause\n\npredates the Federal Privileges and Immunities and Equal Protection\n\nClauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n\n       There has been much written about the relationship between state\n\nprivileges and immunities clauses and the Federal Equal Protection\n\nClause. 36 While the privileges and immunities clauses have generally not\n\n\n        36See, e.g., David Schuman, The Right to “Equal Privileges and Immunities”: A\n\nState’s Version of “Equal Protection,” 13 Vt. L. Rev. 221 (1988) [hereinafter Schuman];\nJeffrey M. Shaman, The Evolution of Equality in State Constitutional Law, 34 Rutgers\nL.J. 1013 (2003) [hereinafter Shaman]; Jonathan Thompson, The Washington\nConstitution’s Prohibition on Special Privileges and Immunities: Real Bite for “Equal\nProtection” Review of Regulatory Legislation?, 69 Temp. L. Rev. 1247 (1996); Robert F.\n\f                                      114\n\nbeen construed narrowly, there is the notion that privileges and\n\nimmunities clauses were designed, in part, to prevent narrow classes of\n\npeople from getting special advantages from government, what might be\n\nin today’s popular parlance be called crony capitalism.\n\n      To Iowa’s first Territorial Governor Robert Lucas, however, the\n\nprivileges and immunities clause of the Northwest Ordinance was linked\n\nto the right of citizens to obtain an education.         In his first inaugural\n\nspeech, Lucas juxtaposed the privileges and immunities clause with his\n\ncomments upon the need to develop education in the territory. 1\n\nShambaugh at 78.        Lucas saw the right to education as among the\n\n“privileges” of citizens of the Iowa territory.\n\n      In the nineteenth century, the United States Supreme Court was\n\ninhospitable to claims brought under the Privileges and Immunities\n\nClause and the related Equal Protection Clause in the Federal\n\nConstitution. In The Slaughter-House Cases, 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36, 21\n\nL. Ed. 394 (1872), the Court gave the Federal Privileges and Immunities\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment an extraordinarily narrow\n\ninterpretation. In Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537, 16 S. Ct. 1138, 41\n\nL. Ed. 256 (1896), the United States Supreme Court announced the\n\nseparate but equal doctrine, which stood as law for over fifty years until\n\nit was finally overturned in Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483,\n\n74 S. Ct. 686, 98 L. Ed. 873 (1954). While the United States Supreme\n\nCourt was minimizing the Federal Privileges and Immunities Clause and\n\nnarrowly interpreting equal protection, however, the Iowa Supreme Court\n\nwas breathing life and meaning into state constitutional provisions\n\nrelated to equality.\n_______________________________\nWilliams, Foreword: The Importance of an Independent State Constitutional Equality\nDoctrine in School Finance Cases and Beyond, 24 Conn. L. Rev. 675 (1992).\n\f                                       115\n\n         The dramatic story begins prior to statehood. In its first reported\n\ncase, In re Ralph, 1 Morris 1 (Iowa 1839), the Supreme Court of the\n\nTerritory of Iowa held that a slave who was voluntarily permitted to leave\n\nMissouri and travel to Iowa was a free man as the law should “extend\n\nequal protection to men of all colors and conditions.”            In re Ralph, 1\n\nMorris at 6.     This holding, of course, was the precise opposite of the\n\napproach taken by the United States Supreme Court in Dred Scott v.\n\nSandford, 60 U.S. (19 How.) 393, 15 L. Ed. 691 (1856), twenty years\n\nlater.\n\n         After statehood, the tradition of In re Ralph was extended in Clark.\n\nAs discussed above, Clark held that a person cannot be denied\n\nadmission to a public school on account of race. Clark, 24 Iowa at 274.\n\nAlthough Clark was based on statutory grounds, the decision included\n\nsweeping language with constitutional overtones. Id. at 277. In Coger v.\n\nNorthwestern Union Packet Co., 37 Iowa 145, 153–55 (1873), this court,\n\nrelying upon article I, section 1 of the Iowa Constitution, refused to\n\nendorse the separate but equal doctrine and instead held that persons of\n\ncolor were entitled to be admitted as a steamboat passenger on equal\n\nterms to white patrons. See Iowa Const. art. I, § 1 (1857) (“All men are,\n\nby nature, free and equal”).\n\n         Since the very beginning, we have interpreted Iowa’s privileges and\n\nimmunities      clause   in   a   fashion    dramatically   different   than   the\n\ninterpretation offered by the United States Supreme Court in The\n\nSlaughter-House Cases. In more recent years, we have often looked to\n\nfederal equal protection precedent for its persuasive power in interpreting\n\nour privileges and immunities provision. Callender v. Skiles, 591 N.W.2d\n\n182, 187 (Iowa 1999). We have, however, jealously guarded our right to\n\nengage in analysis under the Iowa Constitution that is independent from\n\f                                    116\n\nthe interpretations of the United States Supreme Court under the\n\nFederal Equal Protection Clause. Chi. Title Ins. Co. v. Huff, 256 N.W.2d\n\n17, 23 (Iowa 1977); Davenport Water Co. v. Iowa State Commerce\n\nComm’n, 190 N.W.2d 583, 593 (Iowa 1971), superseded by statute, Iowa\n\nCode § 17A.19(7) (1975), as recognized in Interstate Power Co. v. Iowa\n\nState Commerce Comm’n, 463 N.W.2d 699, 702 (Iowa 1990).                On a\n\nnumber of occasions, we have departed from directly applicable federal\n\nprecedent and engaged in independent analysis. See, e.g., Racing Ass’n\n\nof Cent. Iowa v. Fitzgerald (RACI), 675 N.W.2d 1, 7 (Iowa 2004); Bierkamp\n\nv. Rogers, 293 N.W.2d 577, 581–82 (Iowa 1980). When federal precedent\n\nwas lacking, we have relied on state constitutional grounds to decide\n\nimportant issues.    See Varnum v. Brien, 763 N.W.2d 862, 906 (Iowa\n\n2009).\n\n      Our independent role in our application of equal protection\n\nconcepts pursuant to the privileges and immunities clause of the Iowa\n\nConstitution is a firmly established feature of our legal tradition from the\n\nvery first days of statehood, is consistent with the evolving law in other\n\nstates, and is part of a celebrated tradition in Iowa.\n\n      C. Substantive Due Process of the Iowa Constitution.               The\n\nplaintiffs make a substantive due process claim under article I, section 9\n\nof the Iowa Constitution. Article I, section 9 states, in relevant part, that\n\n“no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due\n\nprocess of law.” Iowa Const. art. I, § 9.\n\n      The Iowa constitutional provision is parallel to a similar provision\n\nof the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States\n\nConstitution. As with other state constitutional provisions, we zealously\n\nguard our ability to interpret the Iowa Constitution differently than the\n\ninterpretations of the United States Supreme Court under the federal due\n\f                                   117\n\nprocess provision.   State v. Feregrino, 756 N.W.2d 700, 704 n.1 (Iowa\n\n2008).\n\n      In Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 403, 43 S. Ct. 625, 628, 67\n\nL. Ed. 1042, 1046–47 (1923), the United States Supreme Court\n\noverturned a conviction of a school teacher who taught foreign languages\n\nin public schools. In passing, the Court identified the right to acquire\n\nuseful knowledge as a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment. Meyer, 262 U.S. at 399–400, 43 S. Ct. at 626–27, 67 L. Ed.\n\nat 1045. While not overruled, the outcome in Meyer was based on due\n\nprocess methodology of the Lochner era and may not be reliable\n\nprecedent.\n\n      The United States Supreme Court, however, has employed\n\nsubstantive due process in a number of contexts in more recent years\n\nthat may be instructive in the present case. For instance, in Youngberg\n\nv. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 324, 102 S. Ct. 2452, 2462, 73 L. Ed. 2d 28, 42–\n\n43 (1982), the Supreme Court declared that persons subject to civil\n\ncommitment “enjoy[] constitutionally protected interests in conditions of\n\nreasonable care and safety, reasonably nonrestrictive confinement\n\nconditions, and such training as may be required by those interests.”\n\nJustice Blackmun’s opinion in Jackson v. Indiana, 406 U.S. 715, 738, 92\n\nS. Ct. 1845, 1858, 32 L. Ed. 2d 435, 450–51 (1972), suggested that due\n\nprocess requires that the nature and duration of commitment must have\n\na reasonable relationship to the reasons for commitment.\n\n      A case of potential significance is Wyatt v. Aderholt, 503 F.2d 1305\n\n(5th Cir. 1974).   Aderholt involved a class action alleging that a state\n\nschool designed to habilitate the mentally handicapped was not providing\n\nmeaningful care.      Aderholt, 503 F.2d at 1306.          Judge Wisdom\n\ncharacterized the issue as whether “federal district courts have the power\n\f                                   118\n\nto order state mental institutions to provide minimum levels of\n\npsychiatric care and treatment to persons civilly committed to the\n\ninstitutions.” Id. The Aderholt court unanimously decided the question\n\nin the affirmative. Id. at 1319. It rejected the claims of Governor George\n\nWallace that providing adequate treatment for persons civilly confined\n\nwas a question of available funds. Id. at 1317–19.\n\n      In light of these analogies, it can be asserted that, because\n\neducation is compulsory, it involves liberty and its deprivation triggers a\n\ndue process right that the infringement of liberty be reasonably related to\n\nthe intended purpose, namely, education.      See Bitensky, 86 Nw. U. L.\n\nRev. at 596 n.277; Gershon M. Ratner, A New Legal Duty For Urban\n\nPublic Schools: Effective Education in Basic Skills, 63 Tex. L. Rev. 777,\n\n823–28 (1985) [hereinafter Ratner]; Note, A Right to Learn?      Improving\n\nEducational Outcomes Through Substantive Due Process, 120 Harv. L.\n\nRev. 1323, 1328–32 (2007).\n\n      Our prior precedents recognize a due process interest in adequate\n\neducation. In Exira Community School District v. State, 512 N.W.2d 787,\n\n796 (Iowa 1994), we noted that a student has a due process right to an\n\n“adequate education.” Thus, a finding in this case that there is a due\n\nprocess right under the Iowa Constitution would not be breaking new\n\ntheoretical ground, but simply applying the tools present in existing\n\nprecedent.\n\n      V. Overview of Education Cases.\n\n      A. Introduction.    In this section, I provide an overview of two\n\nimportant cases related to education, Serrano v. Priest, 487 P.2d 1241\n\n(Cal. 1971) (Serrano I), and San Antonio Independent School District v.\n\nRodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 93 S. Ct. 1278, 36 L. Ed. 2d 16 (1973). These\n\f                                      119\n\ncases set the stage for a more detailed analysis of the rich sources of\n\nstate constitutional law regarding educational issues.\n\n       The survey will show that, even if this court were to apply the\n\nSan Antonio     framework    for    determining     whether   an   interest    is\n\n“fundamental” for equal protection purposes, such a fundamental\n\ninterest would be present in light of the explicit Iowa constitutional\n\nprovisions related to education. Further, the survey will show that, while\n\nthe cases are divided, many state supreme courts have found a\n\nfundamental interest in education because of the strong historical role of\n\nstate government in providing education to children and because of the\n\ncritical functional role of education in a democratic government.\n\n       B. The California State Supreme Court Decision in Serrano I.\n\n       1. Introduction. The first major case to consider a challenge to a\n\nstate system of education on equal protection grounds was Serrano I. In\n\nSerrano    I,   school   children    and    their   parents   challenged      the\n\nconstitutionality of public school financing in the State of California.\n\nSerrano I, 487 P.2d at 1244.        The plaintiffs claimed that reliance on\n\nproperty taxes to fund public schools caused substantial disparities in\n\nthe quality and nature of educational opportunities available to them. Id.\n\nThe district court granted the defendants’ demurrer (motion to dismiss)\n\nand the plaintiffs appealed. Id. at 1245.\n\n       2. California’s education clause. The Serrano I court rejected the\n\nclaim that California’s funding of public schools violated the education\n\nclause of the California Constitution. Id. at 1249; see Cal. Const. art. IX,\n\n§ 5.   The court held that while California was required to maintain a\n\n“system” of common schools, a “system” of common schools meant only a\n\nprescribed course of study and educational progression from grade to\n\ngrade. Serrano I, 487 P.2d at 1248–49. The Serrano I court reasoned\n\f                                    120\n\nthat the education clause, standing alone, did not require equality of\n\nspending. Id.\n\n      3. Equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.                 The\n\nSerrano I court next turned to the claim that California’s education\n\nsystem   violated   the   Equal   Protection   Clause   of   the    Fourteenth\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution. Citing the poll tax case of\n\nHarper v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 383 U.S. 663, 86 S. Ct. 1079,\n\n16 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1966), the court concluded that the reliance on\n\nproperty taxes that produced financial disparities available to school\n\ndistricts amounted to a classification based upon wealth of the district.\n\nSerrano I, 487 P.2d at 1250. The court rejected the state’s argument that\n\nbecause the discrimination was based on district wealth, no equal\n\nprotection claim could be brought. Id. at 1251–52. The court further\n\nconcluded that when a classification was based on wealth, no allegation\n\nof purposeful or intentional discrimination was required. Id. at 1253–55.\n\nThe court noted that in Harper, the poll tax was neutral on its face but\n\nwas clearly discriminatory in effect. Id. at 1254. The court further noted\n\nthat while the United States Supreme Court had not yet weighed in on\n\nthe issue, the California Supreme Court had previously held that de facto\n\nracial segregation violated the Fourteenth Amendment.              Id. at 1255\n\n(citing S.F. Unified Sch. Dist. v. Johnson, 479 P.2d 669 (Cal. 1971), and\n\nJackson v. Pasadena City Sch. Dist., 382 P.2d 878 (Cal. 1963)).\n\n      The Serrano I court also addressed the question of whether the\n\nasserted educational interest of the plaintiffs amounted to a fundamental\n\ninterest for purposes of equal protection analysis. Serrano I, 487 P.2d at\n\n1255–59. The court noted that education plays an indispensible role in\n\nmodern industrial society in two respects. Education, according to the\n\ncourt, “is a major determinant of an individual’s chances for economic\n\f                                     121\n\nand social success.” Id. at 1255–56. Second, education has “a unique\n\ninfluence on a child’s development as a citizen and his participation in\n\npolitical and community life.”       Id. at 1256.     The court compared\n\neducation with other fundamental rights such as the right to have a free\n\ntranscript or a court appointed lawyer.       Id. at 1257–58.     The court\n\nconcluded that education compared favorably in importance.                Id.\n\nAccording to the court, education, aside from reducing the crime rate,\n\nsupports “each and every other value of a democratic society—\n\nparticipation, communication, and social mobility, to name but a few.”\n\nId. at 1258 (citing the seminal work of John E. Coons, William H. Clune\n\nIII & Stephen D. Sugarman, Educational Opportunity: A Workable\n\nConstitutional Test for State Financial Structures, 57 Cal. L. Rev. 305\n\n(1969)).\n\n        Having determined that the financing scheme in California\n\ndiscriminated against school districts on the basis of wealth and affected\n\nfundamental interests, the Serrano I court proceeded to apply a\n\ncompelling state interest standard to determine its validity.     Serrano I,\n\n487 P.2d at 1259–63.       Not surprisingly, the court found the scheme\n\ninvalid under the demanding test. Id. at 1263. The court rejected the\n\nasserted state interest of local control, noting that local control could be\n\npreserved regardless of the method of financing public education. Id. at\n\n1260.      With respect to the claim that the system encouraged\n\ndecentralized decision making at the local level, the court found that\n\n“such fiscal freewill is a cruel illusion for the poor school districts.” Id.\n\nAccording to the court,\n        so long as the assessed valuation within a district’s\n        boundaries is a major determinant of how much it can spend\n        for its schools, only a district with a large tax base will be\n        truly able to decide how much it really cares about\n        education.\n\f                                     122\n\nId.   A poor district, according to the court, cannot tax itself into an\n\nexcellence that its tax rolls cannot provide. Id.\n\n       4. Privileges   and   immunities    and    uniformity   clauses   of   the\n\nCalifornia Constitution. While the Serrano I court focused primarily on\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, footnote\n\neleven of the opinion indicated that a violation of the California\n\nConstitution article I, sections 11 and 21 were also present. Id. at 1249\n\nn.11. Section 11 provided that “ ‘[a]ll laws of a general nature shall have\n\na uniform operation,’ ” while section 21 provided that “ ‘[n]o special\n\nprivileges or immunities shall ever be granted . . . nor shall any citizen,\n\nor class of citizens, be granted privileges or immunities which, upon the\n\nsame terms, shall not be granted to all citizens.’ ” Id. (quoting article I,\n\nsections 11 and 21 of the California Constitution). The Serrano I court\n\nobserved in the footnote that ordinarily the court construed these state\n\nprovisions as “ ‘substantially the equivalent’ of the equal protection\n\nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”             Id. (quoting Dep’t of Mental\n\nHygiene v. Kirchner, 400 P.2d 321, 322 (Cal. 1965)).\n\n       5. Summary.        As a result, the Serrano I court reversed the\n\ndismissal of the action by the trial court primarily on federal\n\nconstitutional grounds.      On remand, the court stated that the district\n\ncourt should engage in further proceedings, and if it entered judgment\n\nagainst the defendants, it could do so “in such a way as to permit an\n\norderly transition from an unconstitutional to a constitutional system of\n\nschool financing.” Id. at 1266.\n\n       C. Federal Developments: San Antonio.\n\n       1. Introduction.    The United States Supreme Court took up the\n\nissue of disparities of education in San Antonio.        In this case, school\n\nchildren and their parents brought a class action on behalf of all children\n\f                                     123\n\nwho live in school districts with low property valuations attacking the\n\nTexas method of financing public education.      Rodriguez v. San Antonio\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., 337 F. Supp. 280, 281 (W.D. Tex. 1971).\n\n      After a trial in which testimony and documentary evidence was\n\npresented, a three judge panel of district court judges, relying in part on\n\nSerrano I, concluded that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that the Texas\n\nscheme of financing public education violated the Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. Noting that wealthy school\n\ndistricts had more educational options than poorer ones, the district\n\ncourt concluded that “the quality of public education may not be a\n\nfunction of wealth, other than the wealth of the state as a whole.” Id. at\n\n284. By a narrow 5–4 margin, the United States Supreme Court reversed\n\nthe district court.   San Antonio, 411 U.S. at 6, 93 S. Ct. at 1282, 36\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 27.\n\n      2. Focus of San Antonio: Does strict scrutiny apply to parity claims\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause? In an opinion by Justice Powell, the\n\nSan Antonio majority first concluded that the plaintiffs failed to make a\n\nshowing of wealth discrimination sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny. Id.\n\nat 22–23, 93 S. Ct. at 1291, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 36–37. The San Antonio\n\nmajority concluded that the class of persons in the school districts\n\nattended by plaintiffs was ill defined. Id. Although the school districts\n\ngenerally had less wealth, students within the school districts were not\n\nuniformly poor. Id. According to the San Antonio majority, there was no\n\nbasis in the record to conclude that the poorest people were concentrated\n\nin the poorest districts. Id. at 23, 93 S. Ct. at 1291, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 37\n\n(emphasis added). As a result, the class of plaintiffs was not sufficiently\n\nrelated to wealth to trigger strict scrutiny.\n\f                                          124\n\n       In reaching its conclusion, the San Antonio majority noted that no\n\nclaim had been made that the plaintiffs suffered “an absolute deprivation\n\nof the desired benefit.” Id. The San Antonio majority emphasized that\n\n“the Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or\n\nprecisely equal advantages.” Id. at 24, 93 S. Ct. at 1291, 36 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n37.   The San Antonio majority further observed that Texas authorities\n\nasserted the plaintiffs were receiving an “adequate” education and that\n\n“[n]o proof was offered at trial persuasively discrediting or refuting the\n\nState’s assertion.” 37 Id. at 24, 93 S. Ct. at 1292, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 38.\n\n       In contrast to the California Supreme Court in Serrano I, the San\n\nAntonio majority also determined that while education was an important\n\ninterest, it did not amount to a fundamental interest under the Federal\n\nConstitution.     Citing Brown, the San Antonio majority recognized “the\n\nvital role of education in a free society.” Id. at 30, 93 S. Ct. at 1295, 36\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 41. Yet, the Court noted the power of the dissent in Shapiro\n\nv. Thompson, 394 U.S. 618, 89 S. Ct. 1322, 22 L. Ed. 2d 600 (1969), in\n\nwhich Justice Harlan cautioned that fundamental rights doctrine should\n\nnot extend to “ ‘[v]irtually every state statute’ ” that affects important\n\nrights. Id. at 31, 93 S. Ct. at 1295, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 41 (quoting Shapiro,\n\n394 U.S. at 661, 89 S. Ct. at 1345, 22 L. Ed. 2d at 631 (Harlan, J.,\n\ndissenting), overruled in part on other grounds by Edelman v. Jordan, 415\n\nU.S. 651, 671, 94 S. Ct. 1347, 1359–60, 39 L. Ed. 2d 662, 677 (1974)).\n\n\n\n\n       37In Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 285, 106 S. Ct. 2932, 2944, 92 L. Ed. 2d\n209, 232 (1986), Justice White noted that the issue of whether there was a fundamental\nright to a minimally adequate education was not definitively resolved in San Antonio.\nSee also Preston C. Green & Bruce D. Baker, Circumventing Rodriguez: Can Plaintiffs\nUse the Equal Protection Clause to Challenge School Finance Disparities Caused by\nInequitable State Distribution Policies?, 7 Tex. F. on C.L. & C.R. 141, 150 (2002) (noting\nunresolved question of federal law).\n\f                                    125\n\n      In order to cabin the fundamental rights doctrine, the San Antonio\n\nmajority held that a fundamental right under the Federal Equal\n\nProtection Clause is one that is explicitly or implicitly afforded protection\n\nin the United States Constitution.        Id. at 33, 93 S. Ct. at 1297, 36\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 43. Fundamental rights under the Federal Constitution thus\n\ndo not arise from an “ad hoc determination as to the social or economic\n\nimportance of that right.” Id. at 32, 93 S. Ct. at 1296, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 42.\n\n      The San Antonio majority’s test of what amounts to a fundamental\n\ninterest is noteworthy because it highlights the difference between\n\nFederal and State Constitutions.      Under the test of the San Antonio\n\nmajority, it is clear that education is not a fundamental interest under\n\nthe Federal Constitution because nowhere is education explicitly or\n\nimplicitly mentioned in the text. The opposite, of course, is true of state\n\nconstitutions, which routinely contain explicit constitutional provisions\n\nrelating to education that invariably include a duty to provide education\n\nto its citizens.    A state court desiring to follow the San Antonio\n\nformulation for determining whether an interest is fundamental would be\n\ncompelled to find such an interest in light of the prominent and explicit\n\nrole of education in the state constitution.\n\n      As in its discussion regarding the question of whether the plaintiffs\n\ndemonstrated discrimination on the basis of wealth, the San Antonio\n\nmajority emphasized in its discussion of fundamental interests that\n\n“[e]ven if it were conceded that some identifiable quantum of education is\n\na constitutionally protected prerequisite to the meaningful exercise of\n\neither right” there was no indication in the record that the present level\n\nof expenditures in the schools which the plaintiffs attended fell short. Id.\n\nat 36–37, 93 S. Ct. at 1298–99, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 45. The San Antonio\n\nmajority noted that “no charge fairly could be made that the system fails\n\f                                     126\n\nto provide each child with an opportunity to acquire the basic minimum\n\nskills necessary for the enjoyment of the rights of speech and of full\n\nparticipation in the political process.” Id. at 37, 93 S. Ct. at 1299, 36\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 45.\n\n      3. Impact of federalism and deference to states. The San Antonio\n\nmajority noted that “a century of Supreme Court adjudication under the\n\nEqual Protection Clause affirmatively supports” the application of a\n\nrational basis test to the Texas educational finance structure. Id. at 40,\n\n93 S. Ct. at 1300, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 47. The San Antonio majority stressed\n\nthat the field of taxation had been a traditional area of deference. Id.\n\nFurther, the San Antonio majority recognized that the field of education\n\ninvolved a number of complex issues that ordinarily should be left to the\n\nlegislative process. Id. at 42–43, 93 S. Ct. at 1301–02, 36 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n48–49.\n\n      Any Supreme Court review of legislation involves deference issues,\n\nand many constitutional questions before the Court can be quite\n\ncomplex.   What made the case especially troubling to the San Antonio\n\nmajority was the strong federalism concerns underlying its conclusion\n\nthat strict scrutiny of state school finance laws was inappropriate. The\n\nSan Antonio majority noted the implications of the case for the\n\nrelationship between national and state power under the federal system.\n\nId. at 44, 93 S. Ct. at 1302, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 49. The San Antonio majority\n\ndeclared “it would be difficult to imagine” a case with greater impact on\n\nthe federal system than the case before the Court in which the Court is\n\nurged to “abrogate systems of financing public education presently in\n\nexistence in virtually every State.” Id.\n\n      4. Application of rational basis test.   After determining that the\n\nproper standard of review was the traditional rational basis standard, the\n\f                                     127\n\nSan Antonio majority proceeded to consider the merits of the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim.      The three judge district court had concluded based on a\n\nsubstantial record that the Texas system failed even “to establish a\n\nreasonable basis” for a system that results in different levels of per pupil\n\nexpenditure. Rodriguez, 337 F. Supp. at 284.\n\n         The San Antonio majority disagreed with the district court,\n\nconcluding that local control provided a sufficient rational basis for the\n\nfunding scheme. The San Antonio majority emphasized that the Texas\n\nsystem of school finance assured “a basic education” for every child in\n\nthe state. San Antonio, 411 U.S. at 49, 93 S. Ct. at 1305, 36 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n52.   Local control, according to the San Antonio majority, is vital to\n\ncontinued public support for education, and it means the freedom to\n\ndevote more funds to education through local taxes.       Id. at 49–50, 93\n\nS. Ct. at 1305, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 52. The San Antonio majority noted that\n\nwhile poor school districts had reduced ability to make free decisions\n\nregarding how much they spend on education, they still “retain under\n\nthe present system a large measure of authority as to how available\n\nfunds will be allocated.” Id. at 51, 93 S. Ct. at 1306, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 53.\n\nThe state’s interest in maintenance of local control in education thus\n\nsatisfied the rational basis test under the Federal Equal Protection\n\nClause.\n\n         5. Dissents.   The majority opinion in San Antonio drew dissents\n\nfrom Justices Brennan, White, and Marshall.              Justice Brennan\n\nchallenged the holding of the majority that education did not amount to\n\na fundamental interest. He noted that education was inextricably linked\n\nto constitutional rights of voting and free speech and that, as a result,\n\neducation amounted to a fundamental interest for purposes of equal\n\f                                        128\n\nprotection. Id. at 62–63, 93 S. Ct. at 1312, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 60 (Brennan,\n\nJ., dissenting).\n\n      Justice White attacked the majority’s conclusion that local control\n\njustified the Texas finance scheme. Id. at 64–65, 93 S. Ct. at 1312–13,\n\n36 L. Ed. 2d at 61–62 (White, J., dissenting).             He asserted that while\n\nlocal control might be a valid state interest, the means chosen by Texas\n\ndid not advance it. Specifically, Justice White noted that districts with a\n\nlow tax base did not have an effective local option choice of increasing\n\nfunds available for education. Id. He further concluded that a class was\n\nobviously present for equal protection purposes, namely, the persons\n\nwho find themselves in a low property value school district. Id. at 69, 93\n\nS. Ct. at 1315, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 64.\n\n      Justice      Marshall,   joined   by     Justice   Douglas,   provided     the\n\nlengthiest dissent.     He found it an inescapable fact that if one school\n\ndistrict has more funds available per pupil than another, the former will\n\nhave a greater choice in educational planning than the latter. Id. at 83–\n\n84, 93 S. Ct. at 1322, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 72 (Marshall, J., dissenting). He\n\nattacked the majority’s notion that Texas provided an “adequate”\n\neducation, noting that the Court had never before suggested that\n\nbecause    some      “adequate”   level   of    benefits    is   provided   to   all,\n\ndiscrimination in the provision of services is acceptable. Id. at 88–89, 93\n\nS. Ct. at 1325, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 74–75. He rejected the rigidified tiered\n\napproach to equal protection, calling instead for the adoption of a more\n\nflexible test that balanced the interests of the party challenging the\n\nclassification against the state’s purported interest in sustaining the\n\nstatute. Id. at 98–110, 93 S. Ct. at 1330–36, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 81–88. In\n\nany event, Justice Marshall concluded that education certainly was a\n\n“fundamental” interest in light of its unique status in society and its\n\f                                   129\n\nnexus with other protected constitutional rights. Id. at 111, 93 S. Ct. at\n\n1336–37, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 88.\n\n      6. Summary.     The San Antonio majority rejected a federal equal\n\nprotection claim when the plaintiff sought parity in educational\n\nexpenditures. The San Antonio majority was particularly concerned that\n\nif strict scrutiny would apply to such sweeping claims, thousands of\n\nstate statutes would be invalidated.     The Court expressly reserved the\n\nquestion, however, of whether strict scrutiny would apply where a state\n\ndeprived children of an adequate education.\n\n      Further, the San Antonio Court adopted a standard for determining\n\nwhether an asserted interest or right is fundamental. While not binding\n\non a state court, the methodology, if followed, would lead to the\n\nconclusion that education, which is the subject of explicit state\n\nconstitutional provisions, is a fundamental interest for equal protection\n\npurposes.\n\n      D. The California State Court Response: Serrano II.             After\n\nSan Antonio, the California Supreme Court in Serrano v. Priest, 557 P.2d\n\n929 (Cal. 1976) (Serrano II), was asked to reconsider its decision that the\n\nCalifornia system of financing education was constitutionally infirm.\n\nDuring the trial proceedings resulting from Serrano I, San Antonio was\n\ndecided. The trial court, however, concluded that the financing scheme\n\nviolated the privileges and immunities and uniform laws clauses of the\n\nCalifornia Constitution.   Serrano II, 557 P.2d at 931.   The defendants\n\nappealed. Id.\n\n      In Serrano II, the California Supreme Court declined to follow\n\nSan Antonio in its interpretation of the state constitution.   Id. at 951.\n\nThe Serrano II court emphasized that while the state equal protection\n\nprovisions were “substantially the equivalent” of the guarantees of the\n\f                                          130\n\nFourteenth Amendment, they possessed “an independent vitality which,\n\nin a given case, may demand an analysis different from that which would\n\nobtain if only the federal standard were applicable.”               Id. at 950.     The\n\nSerrano II court noted that considerations of federalism, which played an\n\nimportant part in San Antonio, had no application to the judgment of a\n\nstate supreme court. Id. at 948–49. Further, while the Serrano II court\n\ndid not claim expertise on school financing, it noted it had the benefit of\n\n4000 pages of testimonial transcript, replete with the opinions of experts,\n\nand exhaustive findings of the district court. Id. at 952. In determining\n\nwhether a right is “fundamental” for purposes of the California equal\n\nprotection clause, the Serrano II court rejected the San Antonio test. Id.\n\nInstead, the Serrano II court declared that it would determine which\n\nlegislative classifications were subject to strict scrutiny based upon the\n\nimpact on those rights and liberties which “lie at the core of our free and\n\nrepresentative form of government.” Id.\n\n       E. Subsequent Education Cases Based on State Constitutions.\n\n       1. Overview of state court cases subsequent to San Antonio. After\n\nSerrano I, San Antonio, and Serrano II, a significant number of states\n\nconsidered challenges to state schemes of providing education. Plaintiffs\n\nchallenging state educational frameworks in state courts generally\n\nlaunched double-barreled attacks. 38            First, plaintiffs claimed that the\n\n       38See, e.g., Op. of the Justices, 624 So. 2d 107, 112 (Ala. 1993); Roosevelt\nElementary Sch.

Second, the plaintiffs asserted that the state education\n\nschemes violated equal protection under the state constitutions. These\n\ntheories, while pled separately, often operated in tandem with one\n\nanother.       In a few states, plaintiffs have also included challenges to\n\neducational structures based on substantive due process. 39\n\n       While the cases often turn upon the specific language of statutes\n\nand the nature of the factual records that are developed, the post-San\n\nAntonio state supreme court cases in which plaintiffs challenging state\n\neducational frameworks prevail are in the majority, 40 while those denying\n\nrelief constitute a substantial minority. 41 Interestingly, the jurisdictions\n\nwhere state supreme courts have departed from San Antonio include\n\nTexas, where the state supreme court invalidated the same school\n_______________________________\n(R.I. 1995); Abbeville Cnty.

In the minority of cases lost by plaintiffs, some\n\nmay be characterized as providing mixed results, such as where the\n\ncourts recognized or at least reserved the possibility of a successful claim\n\nbut found the facts insufficient to support them. 42 Many of the cases\n\nalso triggered strong dissents. 43\n\n       Many of the decisions are also based upon extensive records\n\ndeveloped by trial courts. 44          In some cases where the trial courts\n\ndismissed education claims without developing an evidentiary record,\n\nreversal has occurred. See, e.g., Idaho Sch. for Equal Educ. Opportunity v.\n\nEvans, 850 P.2d 734−35 (Idaho 1993).\n\n       2. Obstacles to judicial review: Political question and justiciability\n\ndoctrines.

Dist., 931 P.2d at 399–401 (holding equal\nprotection claim challenging school finance was subject to sliding scale scrutiny under\nstate equal protection clause, but no evidence presented to show that plaintiffs were\ndisparately affected by finance system); Sch.

The main obstacles are the\n\npolitical question doctrine and the related doctrine of justiciability.\n\n      With respect to the political question doctrine, state courts\n\nreceptive to education claims have generally found that courts have a\n\nduty to decide cases brought before them by the parties.         The duty of\n\ncourts to declare what the law is has sometimes been expressed in\n\nforceful terms.    For example, the Kentucky Supreme Court in Rose\n\ndeclared that “[t]o avoid deciding the case because of ‘legislative\n\ndiscretion’ . . . would be a denigration of our own constitutional duty. To\n\nallow the General Assembly . . . to decide whether its actions are\n\nconstitutional is literally unthinkable.” Rose v. Council for Better Educ.,\n\nInc., 790 S.W.2d 186, 209 (Ky. 1989). Similarly, in DeRolph v. State, the\n\nOhio Supreme Court declared:\n\n      We will not dodge our responsibility by asserting that this\n      case involves a nonjusticiable political question. To do so is\n      unthinkable. We refuse to undermine our role as judicial\n      arbiters and to pass our responsibilities onto the lap of the\n      General Assembly.\n\n677 N.E.2d 733, 737 (Ohio 1997); see also Conn. Coal. for Justice in\n\nEduc. Funding, Inc. v. Rell, 990 A.2d 206, 223 (Conn. 2010) (noting “ ‘it is\nwell within the province of the judiciary to determine whether a\n\ncoordinate branch of government has conducted itself’ in accordance\n\nwith ‘the authority conferred upon it by the constitution’ ” (quoting Office\n\nof the Governor v. Select Comm. of Inquiry, 858 A.2d 709, 730 (Conn.\n\n2004))); Evans, 850 P.2d at 734 (“[W]e decline to accept the respondents’\n\nargument that the other branches of government be allowed to interpret\n\nthe constitution for us. That would be an abject abdication of our role in\n\nthe American system of government.”); McDaniel v. Thomas, 285 S.E.2d\n\n156, 157 (Ga. 1981) (noting court was not called to decide which policy\n\f                                          134\n\nwas “better,” but only if existing method of financing public education\n\nmet state constitutional requirements); Columbia Falls Elementary Sch.\n\nDist. No. 6 v. State, 109 P.3d 257, 261 (Mont. 2005) (“As the final\n\nguardian and protector of the right to education, it is incumbent upon\n\nthe court to assure that the system enacted by the Legislature enforces,\n\nprotects and fulfills the right.”); Leandro v. State, 488 S.E.2d 249, 253\n\n(N.C.     1997)    (“When      a    government        action     is   challenged       as\n\nunconstitutional, the courts have a duty to determine whether that\n\naction exceeds constitutional limits.”).             A minority of state courts,\n\nhowever, view education clause and equal protection clause challenges\n\nas raising political questions. 45\n\n        3. Analysis of education clauses in state constitutions.                       As\n\nindicated above, nearly all of the state constitutions contain provisions\n\nrelated to education. The clauses come in a number of shapes and sizes\n\nthat have been categorized by commentators. Some of the clauses are\n\ncharacterized as “weak,” while others are thought to be more robust. 46\n\n        A significant number of constitutions that require the legislature to\n\nprovide for a “thorough and efficient,” “liberal,” “general and uniform,”\n\n“general, suitable, and efficient,” “a system of free common schools,” or\nan “efficient” system of schools, have been held to provide the basis for a\n\njudicially enforceable mandatory obligation to provide children with a\n\ncertain level or quality of education. 47 One court, however, has found\n\n\n        45See,e.g., Ex parte James, 836 So. 2d 813, 819 (Ala. 2002); Comm. for Educ.\nRights, 672 N.E.2d at 1193; Neb. Coal. for Educ. Equity & Adequacy, 731 N.W.2d at 183;\nOkla. Educ. Ass’n, 158 P.3d at 1066; Sundlun, 662 A.2d at 62.\n        46See  Ratner, 63 Tex. L. Rev. at 814–16 (placing Iowa’s constitutional provisions\nin a third category containing “a stronger and more specific education mandate” than in\nthe first two groups, but less strong than a fourth group).\n        47See\n            Op. of the Justices, 624 So. 2d at 110–11 (“liberal”); Lake View, 91 S.W.3d\nat 495 (“general, suitable, and efficient”); Bishop, 877 P.2d at 808 (“general and\nuniform”); Rose, 790 S.W.2d at 212–13 (“efficient”); Hornbeck, 458 A.2d at 780\n\f                                             135\n\nthat a requirement that “there shall always be free public elementary and\n\nsecondary schools” is sufficient to establish a minimum qualitative\n\nrequirement. See Rell, 990 A.2d at 227, 281–82.\n\n       On the other hand, there are cases declining to find an enforceable\n\nmandatory        duty     to    provide   an       adequate   education      based   on\n\nconstitutional provisions that provide for “a system of common\n\nschools,” 48 a requirement that schools be “thorough and uniform,” 49 a\n\nrequirement to make “adequate provision . . . for a uniform system of free\n\npublic schools,” 50 a provision establishing a “a primary obligation” for\n\n“the provision of an adequate education,” 51               a provision requiring the\n\nstate to “establish and maintain a . . . thorough system of public, free\n\ncommon schools,” 52 and a provision requiring a “general and uniform\n\nsystem of Common Schools.” 53\n\n       4. Overview of state education cases considering challenges based\n\non substantive due process. At least one court has considered challenges\n\nto state educational frameworks based on substantive due process under\n\nstate constitutions.           In Alabama, for instance, the Alabama Supreme\n\nCourt has adopted a more rigorous standard of substantive due process\n\nthan employed by the United States Supreme Court. See Mount Royal\nTowers, Inc. v. Ala. State Bd. of Health, 388 So. 2d 1209, 1213–15 (Ala.\n\n1980). In the lower court opinion attached as an appendix in Opinion of\n\n_______________________________\n(“thorough and efficient”); Campaign for Fiscal Equity, 655 N.E.2d at 665 (“a system of\nfree common schools”); DeRolph, 728 N.E.2d at 1001 (“thorough and efficient”); Tenn.\nSmall Sch. Sys., 851 S.W.2d at 150–51 (“a system of free common schools”).\n       48See Serrano I, 487 P.2d at 1248–49.\n\n       49See   Lujan, 649 P.2d at 1010–11.\n       50See   Coal. for Adequacy & Fairness, 680 So. 2d at 406.\n       51See   McDaniel, 285 S.E.2d at 165.\n       52See   Evans, 850 P.2d at 734.\n       53See   Bonner ex rel. Bonner v. Daniels, 907 N.E.2d 516, 520 (Ind. 2009).\n\f                                            136\n\nthe Justices, 624 So. 2d 107 (Ala. 1993), the Alabama circuit court\n\ndeclared that “it is well-settled in this state that when the state deprives\n\ncitizens of liberty for the purposes of benefiting them with a service, due\n\nprocess requires that the service be provided to them in an adequate\n\nform.” Op. of the Justices, 624 So. 2d at 161. This approach, however,\n\nwas later overruled by the Alabama Supreme Court in Ex parte James,\n\n836 So. 2d 813, 819 (Ala. 2002).\n\n         5. Issues arising in state education cases based on state equal\n\nprotection clauses. In state education cases arising under state privileges\n\nand immunities or state equal protection challenges, several issues\n\nrepetitively appear in the cases.           They include the standard of review,\n\nwhether a party attacking an education scheme must show intentional\n\ndiscrimination, and whether the plaintiffs have identified a class\n\nsufficient to support an equal protection claim.\n\n         A critical issue is the standard of review. A significant number of\n\nstate supreme court cases have found that education gives rise to a\n\nfundamental interest under state constitutions. These cases reach this\n\nresult in a number of ways.                  Some of them explicitly adopt the\n\nfundamental interest framework advanced in San Antonio and find that\n\nbecause education is expressly or impliedly rooted in their state\n\nconstitutions, it arises to a fundamental interest for equal protection\n\npurposes. See Washakie Cnty. Sch. Dist. No. One v. Herschler, 606 P.2d\n\n310, 333 (Wyo. 1980). Others depart from the San Antonio framework\n\nand either apply a more generous test, finding a fundamental interest\n\nbased on the underlying importance of education generally, 54 or a\n\n\n\n         54See   Serrano II, 557 P.2d at 951; Robinson v. Cahill, 351 A.2d 713, 720 (N.J.\n1975).\n\f                                           137\n\nnarrower test than in San Antonio in order to avoid a finding of\n\nfundamental interest. 55\n\n       In contrast to these cases, some state supreme courts have\n\nfollowed San Antonio and applied a rational basis standard to education\n\nchallenges.       In most of these cases, the state frameworks have been\n\nupheld. 56 But not in every case. In several cases, state supreme courts\n\nhave applied a rational basis “with teeth” test and have invalidated state\n\neducation structures on that basis. 57\n\n       A second issue is whether the plaintiff has the burden of showing\n\ndisparate treatment.          With respect to disparate treatment, the state\n\ncourts that address the issue generally build on the dissent in\n\nSan Antonio, which notes that the class consists of persons residing in\n\nlow property tax jurisdictions who are treated differently than those in\n\ntax rich geographic locations. See San Antonio, 411 U.S. at 69–70, 93\n\nS. Ct. at 1315, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 64 (White, J., dissenting); Serrano I, 487\n\nP.2d at 1261 (state’s general freedom to discriminate based on\n\ngeographical basis will be significantly curtailed by the Equal Protection\n\nClause); Tenn. Small Sch. Sys. v. McWherter, 851 S.W.2d 139, 154 (Tenn.\n\n1993) (citing substantial disparity based on school districts).\n\n       A final issue frequently arising in equal protection analysis is the\n\npower of the state’s asserted interest in local control in the education\n\narena. As noted in Serrano I and subsequent cases, local control is a\n\n“cruel illusion” if disparities are imposed on poor districts due to the\n\n       55See    Thompson, 537 P.2d at 644–45; Comm. for Educ. Rights, 672 N.E.2d at\n1194–95.\n       56See, e.g., Lujan, 649 P.2d at 1022–23. It should be noted, however, that in\nLujan the plaintiffs failed to plead or prove a denial of educational opportunity. This\namounts to the failure to plead and prove an adequacy claim. Id. at 1018; see also\nMcDaniel, 285 S.E.2d at 156.\n       57See,   e.g., DuPree, 651 S.W.2d at 93; Tenn. Small Sch. Sys., 851 S.W.2d at 154.\n\f                                        138\n\nlimitations placed on them by the system itself. Serrano I, 487 P.2d at\n\n1260; see also DuPree v. Alma Sch. Dist. No. 30, 651 S.W.2d 90, 93 (Ark.\n\n1983).    If there are disparities in educational opportunity, a factual\n\nquestion arises: Are the disparities due to local decisions, or are they\n\ncaused by the state system of financing and providing of education? See\n\nRoosevelt Elementary Sch. Dist. No. 66 v. Bishop, 877 P.2d 806, 815 (Ariz.\n\n1994) (holding question of whether disparities caused by local decision\n\nmaking or by public school system raises factual question for trial court).\n\n      6. Issues related to the type and scope of relief. A critical issue in\n\neducation cases is the type of relief sought by the plaintiffs.                 Some\n\nplaintiffs seek what some commentators have identified as parity in\n\neducational opportunity. 58 Others seek only an “adequate” or a “sound,\n\nbasic” education. The choice of relief can have dramatic implications for\n\nthe litigation.\n\n      Plaintiffs who seek parity do not require precisely the same\n\neducational opportunities, but substantially the same opportunities, as\n\nothers.        The   strength   of   parity   theory   is   that   it   is   perfectly\n\nunderstandable and judicially manageable, namely, that the educational\n\nprogram in school districts needs to be substantially the same.                   The\nproblems, however, are multiple.         Parity theory often requires that the\n\nstate abandon traditional reliance on local property taxes to fund\n\neducation. Plaintiffs seeking parity thus raise a specter of “Robin Hood”\n\nremedies whereby wealthier school districts are required to transfer\n\neducational funds to poorer districts, with the result that the quality of\n\neducation in more fortunate school districts suffers.\n\n\n\n      58See,e.g., William E. Thro, Judicial Paradigms of Educational Equality, 174\nEduc. Law Rep. 1, 7 (2003).\n\f                                    139\n\n      In part because of the difficulties of parity theory, plaintiffs have\n\ndeveloped an alternate theory that does not seek parity but instead\n\nadequacy.   The advantage of adequacy theory is obvious: it does not\n\nrequire that any wealthy school district transfer funds or sacrifice its\n\nprogram, but merely requires the state to ensure that it provides an\n\nadequate education to all students.       The adequacy approach does not\n\nrequire the complete abandonment of local property taxes.\n\n      The major challenge with adequacy theory is the development of a\n\nproper standard.      For example, in Abbeville County School District v.\n\nState, 515 S.E.2d 535, 540 (S.C. 1999), the South Carolina Supreme\n\nCourt found a right to a “minimally adequate education.” According to\n\nthe South Carolina Supreme Court, a minimally adequate education\n\nincluded:\n\n            1) the ability to read, write, and speak the English\n      language, and knowledge of mathematics and physical\n      science;\n             2) a fundamental knowledge of economic, social, and\n      political systems, and of history and governmental\n      processes; and\n             3) academic and vocational skills.\n\nAbbeville Cnty. Sch. Dist., 515 S.E.2d at 540.\n\n      The Kentucky Supreme Court in Rose developed a more detailed\n\nseven-factor test. The Kentucky Supreme Court has stated that in order\n\nto provide an adequate education, the state must establish a system of\n\neducation with the ultimate goal of providing to each and every child\n\nseven capabilities:\n\n      (i) sufficient oral and written communication skills to enable\n      students to function in a complex and rapidly changing\n      civilization; (ii) sufficient knowledge of economic, social, and\n      political systems to enable the student to make informed\n      choices; (iii) sufficient understanding of governmental\n      processes to enable the student to understand the issues\n      that affect his or her community, state, and nation; (iv)\n\f                                    140\n      sufficient self-knowledge and knowledge of his or her mental\n      and physical wellness; (v) sufficient grounding in the arts to\n      enable each student to appreciate his or her cultural and\n      historical heritage; (vi) sufficient training or preparation for\n      advanced training in either academic or vocational fields so\n      as to enable each child to choose and pursue life work\n      intelligently; and (vii) sufficient levels of academic or\n      vocational skills to enable public school students to compete\n      favorably with their counterparts in surrounding states, in\n      academics or in the job market.\n\nRose, 790 S.W.2d at 212; Leandro, 488 S.E.2d at 255 (adopting an\n\nadaptation of the Rose standards); see also Campaign for Fiscal Equity,\n\nInc. v. State, 801 N.E.2d 326, 330 (N.Y. 2003) (adopting standard of\n\nadequacy).\n\n      A third approach to adequacy was taken by the Arkansas Supreme\n\nCourt in Lake View School District No. 25 v. Huckabee, 91 S.W.3d 472\n\n(Ark. 2002).   In Lake View, the Arkansas Supreme Court declared in\n\norder to provide an “adequate” education, the state must provide\n\nstandards, develop a system to determine whether the goals are being\n\nmet, and establish a system of accountability to determine whether\n\nfunds that are being spent are providing educational opportunity. Lake\n\nView, 91 S.W.3d at 500.\n\n      In addition to type of relief, a second issue arises regarding the\n\nscope of relief.    Many courts in the first instance after finding\n\nconstitutional violations merely provide declaratory relief and exercise\n\ncontinuing jurisdiction to review legislative responses to court rulings.\n\nFor example, in Lake View, the court stressed that it had no intention “to\n\nmonitor or superintend the public schools of this state.” Id. at 511. The\n\ncourt instead affirmed a lower court order granting declaratory relief and\n\nindicated that it would not hesitate to review the state’s school funding\n\nsystem once again in an appropriate case. Id.; see also Horton v. Meskill,\n\n376 A.2d 359, 375 (Conn. 1977) (noting that while it is emphatically the\n\f                                          141\n\nduty of the court to declare what the law is, remedies could be limited to\n\ndeclaratory relief out of respect for other branches of government); Rose,\n\n790 S.W.2d at 214 (declining to direct specific action); Campaign for\n\nFiscal Equity, Inc., 801 N.E.2d at 344–45 (discussing dialogue with\n\nlegislature).    Initially, at least, the remedies of these courts do not\n\nintrude deeply on the legislative process other than to declare legal\n\nrequirement. Over time, however, courts have become more involved in\n\ncrafting specific legislative remedies in the face of legislative inaction or\n\nintransigence.     See, e.g., Abbott ex rel. Abbott v. Burke, 971 A.2d 989,\n\n994–96 (N.J. 2009).\n\n       VI. Application of State Constitutional Principles in Iowa.\n\n       A. Threshold Question.            The district court determined that the\n\nissues raised in this case were nonjusticiable political questions.                      I\n\ndisagree.    We are called upon, in this case, to decide what the law\n\nmeans. This is the heart of judicial review. We are not called upon to\n\nexercise the authority expressly delegated to another branch of\n\ngovernment. See, e.g., Rell, 990 A.2d at 217–25. We are called upon to\n\ndo our job.      See Martin H. Redish, Judicial Review and the “Political\n\nQuestion,” 79 Nw. U. L. Rev. 1031, 1059–60 (1984); see generally Louis\n\nHenkin, Is There a “Political Question” Doctrine?, 85 Yale L.J. 597 (1976).\n\nNotwithstanding some contrary dicta dusted about in Justice Mansfield’s\n\nopinion, there is clearly no “political question” posed in this case.\n\n       B. State Education Clause.                The Iowa education clause is\n\ncategorized by some scholars as a fairly strong education clause.59\n\n        59William E. Thro, Note, To Render Them Safe: The Analysis of State\n\nConstitutional Provisions in Public School Finance Reform Litigation, 75 Va. L. Rev. 1639,\n1666 & n.118 (1989) (characterizing Iowa’s education provisions as a Category III\nprovision that provides a “stronger and more specific” mandate than Categories I and II,\nbut less specific than Category IV). On the other hand, another commentator has noted\nthat other states, such as Virginia, Montana, Louisiana, and Washington, have\n\f                                          142\n\nRegardless of this characterization, it seems clear that education in Iowa\n\nis a highly valued constitutional interest. Iowa would not have gained\n\nadmission to the Union as a state without an education clause.                       An\n\narticle of the 1857 constitution was devoted exclusively to education.\n\nAlthough the Iowa Constitution authorized the general assembly to\n\nrepeal provisions vesting authority over school matters in a board of\n\neducation, this constitutional option related solely to the manner in\n\nwhich     the   state’s   constitutional     interest    in   education     would     be\n\nimplemented. The Iowa Constitution, read in context, requires a system\n\nof “Common schools throughout the State.” See Iowa Const. art. IX, div.\n\n2, § 3. We said as much in Clark, where we emphasized that the State\n\nhad an obligation under article IX, division 1, section 12 to provide “for\n\nthe education of all the youths of the State, through a system of common\n\nschools.”    Clark, 24 Iowa at 274 (quoting Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1,\n\n§ 12).\n\n         Our constitutional provisions without question are as strong as\n\nothers in which a constitutional right to an adequate education has been\n\nfound. See, e.g., Rell, 990 A.2d at 210–12 (simply stating there shall be\n\n“free public elementary and secondary schools” in the state); McDuffy,\n\n615 N.E.2d at 517, 526 (stating that it shall be the duty of legislators “to\n\ncherish” public schools and grammar schools); Campaign for Fiscal\n\nEquity, Inc., 801 N.E.2d at 328 (“a system of free common schools”). The\n\nstrong emphasis on education in the text (establishing “Common schools\n\nthroughout the State”) and in our state government tradition cannot be\n\ndoubted. For these reasons, the State at oral argument conceded that it\n_______________________________\neducation clauses that seem to demand a higher quality of education than the Iowa\nprovisions and suggests that the Iowa provision is among state constitutional provisions\n“[s]etting [l]ower [s]tandards.” See Molly McUsic, The Use of Education Clauses in School\nFinance Reform Litigation, 28 Harv. J. on Legis. 307, 334–37 (1991).\n\f                                   143\n\ncould not constitutionally refuse to provide public education to children\n\nand youth.\n\n       The State’s concession was not a blunder but the product of\n\ninescapable logic and a desire to avoid looking foolish.         The Iowa\n\nconstitutional provisions in article IX cannot be read to suggest that the\n\nlegislature has the discretion to withdraw from public education and\n\nclose the public schools. But, if there is a requirement that the State\n\nprovide a public education for children and youth through “Common\n\nschools throughout the State,” it certainly must be implied that the\n\neducation provided in the common schools must be a meaningful\n\neducation and not just some empty formalism.        There must be some\n\nsubstance to the mandatory duty, some concrete reality, some meat on\n\nthe bones. Just as the “right to counsel” under the Federal and State\n\nConstitutions means the right to “effective” assistance of counsel,\n\nMcMann v. Richardson, 397 U.S. 759, 771 & n.14, 90 S. Ct. 1441, 1449\n\n& n.14, 25 L. Ed. 2d 763, 773 & n.14 (1970), the duty of the state to\n\nprovide common schools throughout the state requires that the\n\neducation in the schools meet minimum standards of adequacy.\n\n       Nothing in Kleen v. Porter, 237 Iowa 1160, 23 N.W.2d 904 (1946),\n\nis to the contrary.   Kleen involved a question of providing additional\n\nfunds for public schools, but did not address in any way the duty of the\n\nstate to maintain common schools throughout the state. Kleen, 237 Iowa\n\nat 1167–69, 23 N.W.2d at 908–09. In fact, by citing article IX, division 1,\n\nsection 12, Kleen supports the view of an ongoing obligation to provide a\n\nsystem of common schools to all youth. See id. at 1162, 23 N.W.2d at\n\n905.\n\n       Further, while Justice Mansfield’s opinion makes much of the fact\n\nthat the framers did not include the word “free” in the education clause,\n\f                                      144\n\nthis is hardly dispositive of whether there is a mandatory duty to make\n\nmeaningful public education available in the common schools to\n\neveryone who desires an education.          Charges that prevented a person\n\nfrom obtaining a public education in common schools would surely go\n\nthe way of the poll tax. See Harper, 383 U.S. at 666–68, 86 S. Ct. at\n\n1081–82, 16 L. Ed. 2d at 172–73.\n\n      Justice Mansfield’s opinion states that because the plaintiffs did\n\nnot cite article IX, division 1, section 12 of the Iowa Constitution in their\n\ntrial brief, it can ignore the provision by regarding the argument as\n\nwaived. Article IX, division 2, section 3, however, cannot be torn away\n\nfrom the previous constitutional provision. To begin with, the language\n\nof article IX, division 2, section 3 requiring the legislature to “encourage,\n\nby all suitable means, the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and\n\nagricultural improvement” in my view incorporates within its scope the\n\nobligation to establish “a system of Common Schools” as required by\n\narticle IX, division 1, section 12.    My incorporation theory is strongly\n\nsupported by reference in article IX, division 2, section 3 to a perpetual\n\nfund for “Common schools throughout the State,” namely, the “system of\n\nCommon Schools” referred to in article IX, division 1, section 12. In my\n\nview, Justice Mansfield’s opinion seeks to separate the twins that were\n\njoined at birth in a way that elevates form over substance. See Office of\n\nConsumer Advocate v. Iowa State Commerce Comm’n, 465 N.W.2d 280,\n\n283–84 (Iowa 1991) (holding error is preserved under Due Process Clause\n\neven though the party merely cited to the Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nstating to rule otherwise would “elevate[] form over substance”).         In\n\naddition, it is difficult to understand how Justice Mansfield’s opinion\n\nfinds that the education, due process, and privileges and immunities\n\nissues, though not briefed on appeal, are properly before the court as\n\f                                    145\n\n“interrelated” with the issue of justiciability, while the substantive\n\nobligations of article IX, division 1, section 12 and article IX, division 2,\n\nsection 3 are not.\n\n      In any event, there is no question that the issue of whether\n\neducation is a fundamental interest under the privileges and immunities\n\nclause of the Iowa Constitution was preserved in the trial court, and\n\naccording to Justice Mansfield’s opinion, may be considered on appeal\n\neven though the matter has not been briefed before this court.\n\nTherefore, even assuming the claim under article IX, division 1, section\n\n12 is “waived,” the issue of applicability of the privileges and immunities\n\nclause remains very much alive under the issue preservation reasoning\n\nof Justice Mansfield’s opinion. Any right to an education under article IX\n\nis coextensive to the fundamental right to an education under the\n\nprivileges and immunities clause, the only difference being the right to an\n\neducation under article IX does not require a classification.\n\n      C. Privileges and Immunities Clause.             The first issue for\n\nconsideration under Iowa’s privileges and immunities clause is whether\n\neducation may be characterized as a fundamental interest under the\n\ntraditional framework. If one utilizes the test enunciated in San Antonio,\n\nthe answer is plainly yes.     According to San Antonio, a fundamental\n\ninterest is present when an interest is explicitly or implicitly protected by\n\nconstitutional provisions. See San Antonio, 411 U.S. at 33, 93 S. Ct. at\n\n1297, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 43. Plainly, the Iowa education articles meet the\n\ntest. Further, under San Antonio, the question of whether there is a\n\nfundamental interest in a minimally adequate education was expressly\n\nreserved.   Id. at 36–37, 93 S. Ct. at 1298–99, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 44–45.\n\nThus, even applying the federal constitutional test, a student’s interest in\n\f                                          146\n\nan adequate education would be a fundamental interest under the Iowa\n\nConstitution in light of the explicit provisions for education.\n\n       Further, aside from the San Antonio test, I conclude education is a\n\nfundamental interest under other tests fashioned by state supreme\n\ncourts.       The express Iowa constitutional provisions; the centrality of\n\neducation to our state’s history; the strong and unqualified traditional\n\nsupport for education of Iowa’s political leaders; the inextricable\n\nrelationship between education and other key constitutional rights,\n\nnamely, the right to vote, the right to serve on juries, the right to petition\n\ngovernment, and the undeniable proposition that an individual has little\n\nprospect of enjoying life, liberty, and property without an education in\n\nthe postmodern world; and the centrality of education to human dignity;\n\nall convince me that education must be considered a fundamental\n\ninterest under Iowa’s privileges and immunities clause. See Serrano I,\n\n487 P.2d at 1255–59; Robinson v. Cahill, 351 A.2d 713, 720 (N.J. 1975).\n\nTo characterize the interest in education as something other than\n\nfundamental seems like a play on words. 60                  I would thus join the\n\nsupreme        courts   of   Arkansas,     California,    Connecticut,      Kentucky,\n\nMinnesota, New Jersey, Tennessee, Washington, West Virginia, Virginia,\nand Wisconsin in finding that education is an interest that may trigger\n\nheightened scrutiny under state privileges and immunities or equal\n\nprotection clauses. 61\n\n\n       60As  noted above, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, article 26,\ndescribes the right to a public education as a human right. The Universal Declaration\nhas been ratified by the United States. The case of The Paquete Habana, 175 U.S. 677,\n20 S. Ct. 290, 44 L. Ed. 320 (1900), stands for the proposition that international treaty\nobligations are binding upon United States courts. The West Virginia Supreme Court\nrelied on the Universal Declaration in declaring that education is a fundamental right\nunder its state constitution. Pauley, 255 S.E.2d at 863 n.5, 878.\n       61See, e.g., DuPree, 651 S.W.2d at 93; Serrano II, 557 P.2d at 952; Horton, 376\n\nA.2d at 373; Rose, 790 S.W.2d at 206; Skeen, 505 N.W.2d at 313–14; Robinson, 351\n\f                                        147\n\n       In    fact,   the   motivating   reasons     for   not   finding   education\n\n“fundamental” has nothing to do with its importance or essential\n\ncharacter.      Instead, courts are sometimes reluctant to characterize\n\neducation as “fundamental” because they fear the consequences of strict\n\nscrutiny, which has been described as strict in theory but fatal in fact.\n\nSee, e.g., McDaniel, 285 S.E.2d at 167 (citing need to avoid inflexible\n\nconstitutional restraints that result from strict scrutiny); Norman\n\nDorsen, Equal Protection of the Laws, 74 Colum. L. Rev. 357, 362 (1974)\n\n(noting that the “sharp dichotomy between the rational basis and strict\n\nscrutiny tests produces back-door evasions of the two-tiered formula”);\n\nGerald Gunther, Foreword: In Search of Evolving Doctrine on a Changing\n\nCourt: A Model for a Newer Equal Protection, 86 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 8 (1972)\n\n[hereinafter Gunther] (first suggesting strict in theory, fatal in fact\n\nformulation); Martha M. McCarthy, Is The Equal Protection Clause Still A\n\nViable Tool for Effecting Educational Reform?, 6 J.L. & Educ. 159, 178\n\n(1977) (noting rigor of strict scrutiny test has caused courts to limit\n\nrights identified as suspect or fundamental so as not to unduly invade\n\nlegislative power). The fatal-in-fact feature of strict scrutiny is thought to\n\nbe inappropriate in situations involving complex matters such as\n\neducation.\n\n       I find merit in the argument that strict scrutiny as traditionally\n\napplied by the United States Supreme Court and by this court should not\n\nbe used to evaluate all educational differences between school districts.\n\nFor instance, a marginal or insubstantial difference between school\n\ndistricts—such as the failure to offer a handful of noncore courses, or the\n\n_______________________________\nA.2d at 720; Tenn.

This concern over the\n\nconsequences of strict scrutiny, however, can be addressed by limiting\n\nheightened review only to asserted violations of a right to an adequate or\n\nbasic education.\n\n      The concept of heightened protection for an adequate or basic\n\neducation but not for all educational differences has support in the\n\ncaselaw of other states. For example, both the Minnesota and Wisconsin\n\nSupreme Courts have adopted such an approach in their efforts to sort\n\nthrough the constitutional issues related to education.      See Skeen v.\n\nState, 505 N.W.2d 299, 315 (Minn. 1993); Kukor v. Grover, 436 N.W.2d\n\n568, 579 (Wis. 1989).\n\n      By limiting heightened scrutiny to the deprivation of an adequate\n\nor basic education and by employing a lesser degree of scrutiny to\n\nlegislative classifications that do not impinge on an adequate education,\n\nstate officials would have ample breathing room for their important\n\npolicy-making role, yet still require that the state provide all students\n\nwith a meaningful educational opportunity.\n\n      The next question which arises is the content of a basic or\n\nadequate education that triggers heightened scrutiny.       Based on the\n\nreasoning of the adequacy cases cited above, I conclude that a basic or\n\nadequate education must be sufficient to allow a person to participate\n\nmeaningfully in democracy through the right to vote, the right to petition\n\ngovernment, and jury duty, and to have meaningful prospects of enjoying\n\n“life, liberty, and property.”   In order to achieve these ends, education\n\nmust be sufficient to allow an individual a meaningful opportunity to\n\nparticipate in economic life in the postmodern world. See Campaign for\n\nFiscal Equity, Inc., 801 N.E.2d at 330–32; Hoke Cnty. Bd. of Educ. v.\n\f                                    149\n\nState, 599 S.E.2d 365, 379–81 (N.C. 2004); Abbeville Cnty. Sch. Dist.,\n\n515 S.E.2d at 540; Rose, 790 S.W.2d at 211–13.          In order to satisfy\n\nthese demands, I would adopt a variant of the factors in Rose and other\n\nadequacy cases: An educational program must, among other things,\n\ninclude effectively teaching the ability to read and write, to communicate\n\neffectively, to perform in mathematical computations, to have exposure to\n\nscientific principles, to have a basic understanding of economics and\n\ngovernment, and to learn how to use computer-based technology that is\n\nso indispensible in the postmodern world. An education program need\n\nnot guarantee results to meet the constitutional test, but it must provide\n\na meaningful educational opportunity to participate in the political,\n\nsocial, and economic life.\n\n      I would not, however, adopt the approach of the Arkansas\n\nSupreme Court in Lake View. While the adoption of standards, systems\n\nof monitoring, and systems of accountability might help ensure\n\ncompliance with the substantive constitutional requirements outlined in\n\nthis opinion, I would not mandate the precise manner in which the State\n\nperforms its constitutional obligation. I would decline to enter the fray of\n\neducational philosophy other than as required to ensure that children\n\nhave a reasonable opportunity to a basic education and that all other\n\nmaterial differences in educational opportunity be justified by a rational\n\nbasis as described below.\n\n      The defense to privileges-and-immunities-type claims is, of course,\n\ninvariably “local control.” But local control is not an automatic trump\n\ncard that applies as a matter of law in all cases involving educational\n\ninterests as Justice Mansfield’s opinion seems to believe.         Instead,\n\nwhether “local control” will be sufficient to carry the day will depend\n\nupon a number of determinations. First, the court must determine, as a\n\f                                          150\n\nmatter of fact, whether the alleged shortcomings in education are\n\npresent. Second, the court must determine if the plaintiff can prove that\n\nstate action has caused the deprivations.                   Third, assuming that\n\ndeprivations are present and they are caused by the state, the question\n\narises whether the deprivation is sufficient to undermine the right to an\n\nadequate or basic education. If the shortcomings deprive the plaintiffs of\n\na   basic   education,      then    heightened     scrutiny     will   apply    to   the\n\nclassification. To the extent “local control” is asserted as the legitimate\n\nbasis for a classification, the decision to provide different services must\n\nbe a discretionary choice of local administrators and not the result of\n\nstate law or legal structure that forces local decision makers into\n\nHobson’s choices. See Tenn. Small School Sys., 851 S.W.2d at 154–55\n\n(the issue is not whether local control is a good thing, but whether the\n\nstatutory framework actually promotes it or undercuts it). Local control,\n\nhowever, must not be a “euphemism masking gross inequalities in the\n\nabilities of school districts to meet their needs.” Lujan v. Colo. State Bd.\n\nof Educ., 649 P.2d 1005, 1040 (Colo. 1982) (Lohr, J., dissenting). 62\n\n       My approach to Iowa’s privileges and immunities clause is not\n\nnecessarily a departure from federal precedent. As noted in San Antonio\nand Papasan, the question of whether there is a fundamental right to a\n\nminimally adequate education is still open under the Federal Equal\n\n\n\n       62There  is a suggestion that to find any meaningful judicial role in the field of\neducation under a state constitution would set a “dangerous” precedent. Such an\nextreme characterization is belied by court decisions in rulings in many states,\nincluding Texas, New York, California, South Carolina, New Jersey, Arkansas, West\nVirginia, Kentucky, and Washington. The suggestion of dangerousness would likely be\nsurprising to the four sober dissenting Justices of the United States Supreme Court in\nSan Antonio. While the decisions of the various state supreme courts and the opinions\nof the four dissenting Justices in San Antonio are not, of course, “dangerous,” they may\nbe controversial. Of course, judicial decisions are driven by applicable legal principles\nand underlying facts, not by public approval or disapproval.\n\f                                          151\n\nProtection Clause. See Papasan v. Allain, 478 U.S. 265, 285, 106 S. Ct.\n\n2932, 2944, 92 L. Ed. 2d 209, 232 (1986); San Antonio, 411 U.S. at 36–\n\n37, 93 S. Ct. at 1298–99, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 44–45. Moreover, applying the\n\nSan Antonio test of what amounts to a fundamental interest (explicit or\n\nimplicit protection in the constitution itself), my conclusion seems\n\ninescapable. In any event, even if my approach affords greater protection\n\nto education under our privileges and immunities clause than is\n\navailable under the Federal Equal Protection Clause, this is not unusual.\n\nState courts in at least twenty-one states have interpreted their equality\n\nclauses more expansively than the United States Supreme Court’s\n\ninterpretation of equal protection. See Jeffrey M. Shaman, The Evolution\n\nof Equality in State Constitutional Law, 34 Rutgers L.J. 1013, 1031\n\n(2003).\n\n       To the extent plaintiffs show a classification affecting education\n\nthat does not impinge upon their fundamental right to an adequate\n\neducation, I conclude that a type of rational basis test should apply. A\n\nsimple declaration that such nonfundamental classifications are subject\n\nto rational basis review is not the end of the matter.                   As has been\n\nrepeatedly and widely recognized, there are many variations and\n\npermutations of the rational basis test. 63\n\n        63See, e.g., Robert C.

See Gunther, 86\n\nHarv. L. Rev. at 20–24.    In a series of opinions, Justice Marshall and\n\nJustice Stevens have pointed out the inconsistencies in the Court’s cases\n\nand advocated an honest reevaluation of the doctrine.             See City of\n\nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 451–55, 105 S. Ct. at 3260–63, 87 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n327–30 (1985) (Stevens, J., concurring); Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427\n\nU.S. 307, 321–22, 96 S. Ct. 2562, 2571–72, 49 L. Ed. 2d 520, 529–30\n\n(1976) (Marshall, J., dissenting). So far, the United States Supreme Court\n\nhas not explicitly resolved the tensions in its cases.\n\n      Aside from inconsistency, there is another reason for state\n\nsupreme courts to depart from federal precedent when analyzing equal\n\nprotection-type claims. A major factor in the highly deferential rational\n\nbasis standard developed by the United States Supreme Court is the\n\ndesire to honor federalism and to avoid imposing national solutions onto\n\nthe states. Justice Harlan warned long ago that national application of\n\nfederal standards to the states in order to give the states elbow room in\n\f                                         154\n\ntheir criminal processes would lead to a dilution of substantive\n\nconstitutional protections.

Indeed, federalism constraints were a\n\nmotivating factor in the Supreme Court’s refusal to impose strict scrutiny\n\nin San Antonio. Because of the federalism concerns, the Federal Equal\n\nProtection Clause tends to be among the most underenforced of\n\nconstitutional provisions. See Hershkoff, 112 Harv. L. Rev. at 1134–38;\n\nLawrence Gene Sager, Fair Measure: The Legal Status of Underenforced\n\nConstitutional Norms, 91 Harv. L. Rev. 1212, 1218 (1978).                         The\n\nfederalism concern, of course, is wholly absent when state courts\n\nconsider claims under the state constitutions.\n\n       As a result, it is not surprising that a number of state supreme\n\ncourts have declined to follow the federal model and have developed their\n\nown approach to equal protection or privileges and immunities review.64\n\nMany of the more than a dozen states that have privileges and\n\nimmunities type language rely to some extent on the tiered federal model,\n\nbut there are many variations. Several states have rejected the “any\n\nconceivable basis” rationality standard for more exacting judicial review\nof some legislative classifications.            See, e.g., Trujillo v. City of\n\nAlbuquerque, 965 P.2d 305, 314 (N.M. 1998); MacCallum v. Seymour, 686\n\nA.2d 935, 938–39 (Vt. 1996). Other states, for instance, have adopted a\n\nunitary test that balances the nature of the right, the extent to which the\n\ngovernment intrudes upon the right, and the need for the restriction.\n\n\n       64For  a rich description of state constitutional provisions related to equal\ntreatment under the law and the power of state courts to interpret them independently\nof federal law, see 1 Jennifer Friesen, State Constitutional Law: Litigating Individual\nRights, Claims, and Defenses § 3:01, at 3–2 through 3–15 (4th ed. 2006). See also\nSchuman, 13 Vt. L. Rev. at 221–22; Shaman, 34 Rutgers L.J. at 1029–56.\n\f                                    155\n\nSee, e.g., Dep’t of Revenue v. Cosio, 858 P.2d 621, 629 (Alaska 1993);\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Cent. N.J. v. Farmer, 762 A.2d 620, 632–43 (N.J.\n\n2000). Other states have adopted a system of means-focused scrutiny\n\nthat appears more intensive than the most lenient standard sometimes\n\napplied by the United States Supreme Court. See, e.g., State v. Mowrey,\n\n9 P.3d 1217, 1221 (Idaho 2000).\n\n      The variability in “rational basis” tests is demonstrated in the state\n\neducation cases. Some courts, like Indiana, have declared over a strong\n\ndissent that, as a matter of law, local control is an adequate rational\n\nbasis to justify a state framework for providing education. Other states,\n\nhowever, like Arkansas, have found after the development of substantial\n\nfactual records that their system of state funding fails to meet even the\n\nrational basis test. See, e.g., DuPree, 651 S.W.2d at 95.\n\n      There is much to be said for a more searching rational basis\n\nreview. The “any conceivable basis” test tends to be no review at all. The\n\ncases show some striking examples, like Louisiana legislation where only\n\nlicensed florists may arrange flowers, defended as a health measure, and\n\nan Oklahoma statute preventing anyone other than a person with a\n\nlicense in mortuary science from selling caskets.     See Clark Neily, No\n\nSuch Thing: Litigating Under the Rational Basis Test, 1 N.Y.U. J. L. &\n\nLiberty 898, 906 (2005).\n\n      The suggestion that the incantation of the phrase “local control” is\n\nsufficient to decide this case at this stage as a matter of law cannot stand\n\nscrutiny.   When an allegation of a violation of our privileges and\n\nimmunities clause in the field of education is alleged, we should turn a\n\ncocked ear, not a blind eye.       When local control is asserted as a\n\njustification for differences in educational quality, we should consider\n\nwhether local educational leaders are, in fact, making local choices\n\f                                    156\n\nentitled to deference, or whether they are forced into Hobson’s choices\n\nbecause of an educational structure that prevents them from delivering a\n\nquality education. The concept was well expressed by one observer, who\n\nnoted that “[e]verywhere, local autonomy is compromised by centralized\n\nauthority. . . . Practically, the rhetoric of local autonomy is difficult to\n\ntake seriously given overwhelming evidence of the fiscal, political, and\n\njudicial domination of local governments by higher tiers of the state.”\n\nGordon L. Clark, Judges and the Cities: Interpreting Local Autonomy 113–\n\n14 (1985) (citation omitted). In other words, the question we should ask\n\nis this: Is local control really at work, or is it a euphemism masking\n\ninequalities in the ability of school districts to provide educational\n\nopportunities to its students?   See Lujan, 649 P.2d at 1040 (Lohr, J.,\n\ndissenting).\n\n      Justice Mansfield’s opinion employs the label “local control”\n\nwithout analysis of exactly what that means.         In San Antonio, local\n\ncontrol was favored because it encouraged citizen participation in\n\ndecision making, permitted the structuring of school programs to fit local\n\nneeds, and encouraged “experimentation, innovation, and a healthy\n\ncompetition for educational excellence.” San Antonio, 411 U.S. at 50, 93\n\nS. Ct. at 1305, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 52–53. Should we declare, as a matter of\n\nlaw, that the distinctions between the various school districts in this case\n\nwere the result of these factors? Is it not possible that, in this case, the\n\nstate regulatory framework in actuality deprives local school boards of\n\nlocal control in the sense that they do not have the practical ability to\n\nmake considered policy choices? Would the responsible school officials\n\nin the districts where the plaintiffs reside claim that the alleged dramatic\n\ndifferences in teacher experience, course loads per teacher, and\n\ncurriculum offerings were the result of a local, discretionary choice or\n\f                                           157\n\nwould they cite systemic limitations?                 Does the way education is\n\nstructured in Iowa promote local control or restrict it? We will, of course,\n\nnever know the answer to these questions in light of the summary\n\ndismissal of the case without the development of a factual record.\n\n       In RACI, we conducted a meaningful rational basis review.\n\nFitzgerald, 675 N.W.2d at 7–8. We were not content to rest solely on the\n\npleadings, but conducted a factual inquiry to see whether the purported\n\njustifications, while conceivable, were in fact sufficient to support a\n\nstatutory distinction.       Specifically, we noted that the conceivable state\n\ninterest must have “a basis in fact.” Id.\n\n       In my view, we should apply a meaningful rational basis test in\n\nthis case with respect to classifications which adversely affect the\n\nplaintiffs but do not arise to deprivations of an adequate education. It\n\nallows    substantial     deference      to   decisions     of   other    branches      of\n\ngovernment, but imposes a reality check to prevent arbitrary and\n\nirrational distinctions from creeping into educational structures in the\n\nname of “local control.” 65\n\n       D. Due Process Clause. I have no doubt that there is a potential\n\ndue process claim in light of the compulsory nature of school attending.\nWe said as much in Exira. The notion is uncontroversial that where a\n\n       65The   claim that this court should not function as an elected school board\ncreates a straw person. No one advocated interference with the daily administration of\nschool boards in this case or in the dozens of other state court cases that have found a\nfundamental right to a basic education. While we must maintain a healthy respect for\nthe other branches of government, we must fearlessly perform our role as judges to\nensure that the other branches of government perform their duties in a manner\nconsistent with the Iowa Constitution. Indeed, the very purpose of the privileges and\nimmunities clause in the Iowa Constitution is to restrain elected officials from treating\ncitizens differently in ways that do not make sense. Bromides about elections and\nballot boxes do not assist the court in its performance of the difficult but essential role\nof judicial review established by Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2\nL. Ed. 60, 73 (1803). To suggest that elected bodies always have the last word in\neducational matters is, of course, the argument raised in opposition to Brown.\n\f                                   158\n\nliberty interest is impaired—and surely it is impaired by mandatory\n\nschool attendance—the deprivation of liberty must be rationally related\n\nto a legitimate state objective. Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324, 102 S. Ct. at\n\n2462, 73 L. Ed. 2d at 42–43. There is also no doubt that education is a\n\nlegitimate state objective. The question under due process is whether the\n\neducation received by the person whose liberty is impaired is rationally\n\nrelated to the state’s legitimate interest in educating citizens.      Any\n\napplication of the due process clause, however, would give the state a\n\nwide range of permissible action in providing education to its charges.\n\nThere is no due process right to a specific kind of education, but only a\n\nsufficiently reasonable educational effort to justify the intrusion on the\n\nliberty interest.\n\n      E. Application of Law to Facts Alleged in the Petition. Having\n\nestablished the necessary legal framework, the question remains whether\n\nthe petition alleges sufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss. Our\n\npleading caselaw requires a general notice of the nature of the claim, but\n\ndoes not require pleading of detailed facts. Davis v. Ottumwa YMCA, 438\n\nN.W.2d 10, 13 (Iowa 1989). We have stated that pleading is sufficient if\n\nit apprises the opposing party of the nature of the incident out of which\n\nthe claim arose and the general nature of the action.         Haugland v.\n\nSchmidt, 349 N.W.2d 121, 123 (Iowa 1984).       We have stated that “[i]n\n\nIowa, very little is required by way of pleading to provide notice.” Wilker\n\nv. Wilker, 630 N.W.2d 590, 595 (Iowa 2001).       Notice pleading in Iowa\n\ndoes not require pleading of ultimate facts that support the elements of\n\nthe cause of action but only facts sufficient to apprise the defendant of\n\nfair notice of the claim. Schmidt v. Wilkinson, 340 N.W.2d 282, 283–84\n\n(Iowa 1983).\n\f                                      159\n\n         Our principles of pleading were well stated in U.S. Bank v. Barbour,\n\n770 N.W.2d 350, 353–54 (Iowa 2009), in which we stated that “[n]early\n\nevery case will survive a motion to dismiss” and that the “fair notice”\n\nrequirement is met if the petition “informs the defendant of the incident\n\ngiving rise to the claim and of the claim’s general nature.” We recently\n\naffirmed our approach in Hawkeye Foodservice Distribution, Inc. v. Iowa\n\nEducators Corp., 812 N.W.2d 600, 609 (Iowa 2012), in which we rejected\n\nan effort to institute a heightened pleading requirement sometimes used\n\nby the United States Supreme Court, see, e.g., Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S.\n\n662, 678–79, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949–50, 173 L. Ed. 2d 868, 883–84\n\n(2009), and Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S. Ct.\n\n1955, 1973–74, 167 L. Ed. 2d 929, 949 (2007), and reaffirmed our\n\ntraditional generous pleading approach.\n\n         I conclude that the plaintiffs’ claim should not be dismissed at this\n\nstage.     The plaintiffs claim they are being deprived of an “effective\n\neducation” and an “adequate education.” They claim their education is\n\nso deficient that students “are not prepared to enter the workforce or\n\npost-secondary education” and are not “prepared for responsible\n\ncitizenship, further learning and productive employment in a global\n\neconomy.” They have also pled differences in the quality of education in\n\ntheir school districts in terms of teacher experience, course loads, and\n\ncourse offerings. In light of our pleading rules, which have been held to\n\nprovide that “very little is required by way of pleading to provide notice,”\n\nthese allegations are sufficient to raise a claim of adequacy that cannot\n\nbe precluded as a matter of law at this stage of the proceedings. See\n\nWilker, 630 N.W.2d at 595; Herschler, 606 P.2d at 316 (attack on\n\n“system” is sufficient to survive motion to dismiss); see also Lujan, 649\n\nP.2d at 1010 (appellees did not plead or prove denial of educational\n\f                                        160\n\nopportunity); Hornbeck v. Somerset Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 458 A.2d 758, 780\n\n(Md. 1983) (no allegation of deprivation of a right to adequate education).\n\n       In any event, there is no question that the plaintiffs state a claim\n\nreviewable under a rational basis test, which in my view requires factual\n\ndevelopment of the relationship between the purported purposes of the\n\npolicies that cause the differences between school districts and whether\n\nthe means chosen rationally advance them. Preexisting commitment to\n\nthe ideology of “Our Localism” does not form a legally sufficient basis for\n\nrejecting a more nuanced inquiry when an interest as important as\n\neducation is involved. 66\n\n       It may well be, of course, that the plaintiffs may fail, in whole or in\n\npart, to prove their case. But they are entitled to attempt to prove it. A\n\nmotion to dismiss is not a vehicle to dismiss claims that some on an\n\nappellate court may perceive as weak. The only issue when considering\n\na motion to dismiss is the “petitioner’s right of access to the district\n\ncourt, not the merits of his allegations.” Rieff v. Evans, 630 N.W.2d 278,\n\n284 (Iowa 2001) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).                The\n\napproach taken in Justice Mansfield’s opinion to the pleading in this\n\ncase is a marked departure from our pleading requirements generally\nand has no precedential value except to dispose of this case.\n\n       F. Remedies. It is sometimes suggested that remedial difficulties\n\nrequire the judiciary to abandon the field of enforcing state constitutional\n\ncommands related to education. Ordinarily, respect for the coordinate\n\nbranches of government requires a court not to unduly intrude onto the\n\nworkings of the other branches. As a result, in a case such as this one,\n\n\n       66The term “Our Localism” was coined by Richard Briffault in two important\nscholarly articles, Richard Briffault, Our Localism: Part I—The Structure of Local\nGovernment Law, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1 (1990), and Richard Briffault, Our Localism: Part\nII—Localism and Legal Theory, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 346 (1990).\n\f                                    161\n\nthere is little to be gained, and much to be lost, by premature entry of\n\ndetailed mandatory orders. If a constitutional violation is found, there\n\nwill be a number of different possibilities that the legislature may wish to\n\nconsider to solve the problem. As long as the ultimate action complies\n\nwith the constitutional commands, this court has no interest in invading\n\nthe discretion of the legislature. As Justice Jackson stated years ago, a\n\nholding of invalidity under the Equal Protection Clause “does not disable\n\nany governmental body from dealing with the subject at hand.”           Ry.\n\nExpress Agency v. New York, 336 U.S. 106, 112, 69 S. Ct. 463, 466, 93\n\nL. Ed. 533, 540 (1949) (Jackson, J., concurring).\n\n      The case against “The Structural Injunction” in the education\n\ncontext was made by Chief Justice Roy Moore, formerly of the Alabama\n\nSupreme Court, in Ex parte James. In that case, Chief Justice Moore\n\nwent to great lengths to undermine the power of judicial review and to\n\nsuggest that the courts must generally defer to political branches of\n\ngovernment. Ex parte James, 836 So. 2d at 856 (Moore, C.J., concurring\n\nin the result in part and dissenting in part).\n\n      I do not find, however, that problems related to remedies should\n\noust this court’s ability to consider the substantive merits of this case.\n\nSuch an approach would establish an unwise precedent.            Broadside\n\nstatements regarding “The Structural Injunction,” for instance, threaten\n\nto undermine not only the result in this case, but bedrock cases such as\n\nBrown, Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 83 S. Ct. 792, 9 L. Ed. 2d\n\n799 (1963), the courageous holding in Aderholt, and countless less\n\ncelebrated cases dealing with the nitty gritty of obtaining constitutional\n\ncompliance with respect to overcrowded prison systems and grossly\n\ninadequate mental health facilities.      Sweeping declarations regarding\n\nremedies also ignore the highly nuanced approaches of many state\n\f                                     162\n\ncourts to remedial issues related to the provision of adequate education\n\nthat emphasize collaboration over confrontation. See, e.g., Rell, 990 A.2d\n\nat 221–23 (discussing need for flexible, graduate remedies); Campaign for\n\nFiscal Equity, Inc., 801 N.E.2d at 344–49 (N.Y. 2003) (discussing flexible\n\nremedies in education context).\n\n      While a prudent and respectful approach to potential remedies\n\nmakes sense, this case should not be a springboard for this court to\n\nadopt a radical doctrine that threatens many decades of jurisprudence.\n\nA disabling doctrine of sharply curtailed remedies would reduce the\n\nguarantees of the State and Federal Constitutions that protect individual\n\nliberties and establish affirmative duties to hollow platitudes.           This\n\nindirect substantive evisceration of our State and Federal Constitutions\n\nis a project that may appeal to others, but not to me.\n\n      VII. Conclusion.\n\n      In my view, regardless of whether the plaintiffs have pled and/or\n\npreserved a claim under article IX of the Iowa Constitution or stated a\n\nclaim under the Due Process Clauses of the Iowa and Federal\n\nConstitutions, I believe it is inescapable that education is a fundamental\n\ninterest under the state constitutional guarantee of equal protection.\n\nBecause of the sensitive nature of educational decision making, however,\n\nI would differentiate between a basic or adequate education and other\n\nelements of education that fall outside that category.        I would apply\n\nheightened scrutiny with respect to claims of deprivation of adequate\n\neducation and only a rational basis type scrutiny to other claims.\n\n      Having   determined    these   legal   issues,   I   would   apply   our\n\ntraditionally liberal pleading standards to the plaintiffs’ petition.      The\n\npetition is not very precise and does not clearly outline what government\n\f                                       163\n\naction is causing what deprivation. Nevertheless, I am not prepared to\n\nsay at this stage that there is no possibility that the plaintiffs will be able\n\nto show an entitlement to relief. Rather than rush to judgment in this\n\ncase without the development of an adequate factual record, I would\n\ndeny the motion to dismiss and remand the case to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n      Hecht, J., joins this dissent.\n\f",

Charles City Community Schools\n\nBoard of Education, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2040776\"><a href=\"/opinion/2040776/johnson-v-charles-city-comm-schools-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">368</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (Iowa 1985), we observed that the\n\n“state has a clear right to set minimum educational standards for all its\n\nchildren and a corresponding responsibility to see to it that those\n\nstandards are honored.” Yet we also concluded that a “court is without\n\neither the resources or the expertise necessary” to draft minimum\n\neducational standards for private religious schools. Id. at 80.\n\n      This case concerns Iowa’s standards for public schools. It asks us,\n\nin effect, to require the state to impose additional public school\n\nstandards, urging that such action is both constitutionally and\n\nstatutorily required.\n\n      Adhering to the lessons of the Johnson case, we decline the\n\ninvitation. We hold that plaintiffs’ specific challenges to the educational\n\npolicies of this state are properly directed to the plaintiffs’ elected\n\nrepresentatives, rather than the courts. We find the plaintiffs have not\n\nstated claims for relief under article IX, division 2, section 3, article I,\n\nsection 6, or article I, section 9 of the Iowa Constitution, or Iowa Code\n\nsection 256.37 (2007).\n\n      Our decision does not foreclose future constitutional challenges to\n\nactions taken by state or local officials in the vital field of public\n\neducation.   We decide only that this case, brought by these plaintiffs,\n\nshould not go forward because the factual allegations, even if proved, do\n\nnot set forth a potential constitutional or statutory violation under the\n\nforegoing provisions.\n\n      Accordingly, we affirm the district court’s dismissal of the plaintiffs’\n\npetition.\n\f                                     4\n\n      I. Facts and Procedural Background.\n\n      Because this case was decided on a motion to dismiss, our relevant\n\npoint of reference is the plaintiffs’ petition. The plaintiffs’ first amended\n\nand substituted petition, which the district court ultimately dismissed, is\n\ntwenty-three pages long.      It includes a two-page summary, entitled\n\n“Nature of the Lawsuit,” as well as thirteen pages of “Factual\n\nAllegations.”\n\n      The sixteen named plaintiffs are students or parents of students\n\nwho attended or currently attend public schools in the Davenport, Des\n\nMoines, or West Harrison Community School Districts. As explained by\n\nplaintiffs’ counsel at oral argument, plaintiffs’ position is that Iowa’s\n\neducational system is not adequately serving students in either the\n\nlargest (e.g., Davenport and Des Moines) or the smallest (e.g., West\n\nHarrison) school districts. The case is not brought as a class action.\n\n      According to the initial summary contained in the petition, “[t]he\n\nquiet, ugly truth is that Iowa’s educational system is but a shadow of its\n\nglorious past and our leaders are whistling by its graveyard.” Plaintiffs\n\nallege that there exists a “disparity in educational outcomes [in Iowa]\n\nbased upon where one goes to school” and there has been a “failure[] to\n\nprovide similar educational opportunities for all of Iowa’s students.”\n\n      Plaintiffs have not named any local school officials as defendants.\n\nThey have sued, rather, the State of Iowa, the Governor of Iowa, the Iowa\n\nDepartment of Education, and the Director of the Department. In their\n\ninitial summary, plaintiffs allege that these statewide entities and\n\nofficials “have failed to establish standards, failed to enforce any\n\nstandards, failed to adopt effective educator pay systems, and failed to\n\nestablish and maintain an adequate education delivery system.”\n\f                                           5\n\n       In the ensuing factual allegations, plaintiffs allege that Iowa’s\n\nstatewide laws and rules are “broad educational requirements and\n\naccreditation standards for schools within the State of Iowa.” They do\n\nnot, in plaintiffs’ view, contain “specific, detailed information regarding\n\nthe courses that schools must provide or offer to [their] students nor do\n\nthey set forth any details regarding the skills that must be attained by\n\nstudents at each grade level.” Repeatedly, plaintiffs criticize Iowa for the\n\nlack of “state-mandated standards.” They maintain that Iowa is the only\n\nstate without any statewide academic standards.                 Plaintiffs also fault\n\nIowa for not “providing specific testing of students at various educational\n\nlevels and in a variety of subject matters like other states,” instead\n\nrelying on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) and the Iowa Test of\n\nEducational Development (ITED).\n\n       This part of the petition refers to a number of reports and studies.1\n\nFor example, plaintiffs note that according to Education Week’s Quality\n\nCounts 2008 report, Iowa received a “C” for educational performance. 2\n\n       Plaintiffs also cite Iowa Department of Education statistics that, in\n\ntheir view, show how students attending the smallest school districts\n\n(less than 250 students) are disadvantaged.                      According to the\nDepartment’s 2007 Annual Condition of Education report, teachers in\n\n\n       1See  Tellabs, Inc. v.

Unsurprisingly, according to the petition,\n\nstudents in the smallest districts also have fewer curriculum units\n\navailable to them. 3 Id. at 112.\n\n       Additionally, students from Iowa’s smallest school districts receive,\n\non average, lower ACT scores. In 2007, according to the Department of\n\nEducation report, the average ACT composite score was 21.3 for students\n\nat districts in the lowest enrollment category (less than 250 students).\n\nId. at 192. By contrast, the average ACT composite score was 22.5 for\n\nstudents attending districts in the largest enrollment category. Id. The\n\npetition notes, however, that the national average ACT composite score\n\nwas 21.2.      Id. at 186.    Thus, all categories of school districts in Iowa\n\nscored above the national average. 4\n\n       Plaintiffs further allege that Iowa’s ranking in science and math is\n“consistently declining”; that Iowa “has continued to decline in the\n\nnational rankings for math and reading proficiencies and other measures\n\nof student achievement”; that “Iowa ranks well below the national\n\naverage for students taking gateway courses such as Algebra, Algebra 2\n\n       3On   the other hand, the 2007 report indicates that students at the smallest\nschool districts benefit, on average, from much smaller class size. The Annual Condition\nof Education, at 122. For example, the relevant comparisons are 11.9 versus 20.5\nstudents per class for kindergarten, 11.8 versus 21.4 per class for first grade, 13.1\nversus 21.6 for second grade, and 13.7 versus 22.7 for third grade. Id.\n       4The  2007 report further reveals that Iowa’s average ACT composite score of\n22.3 was tied with Wisconsin for second place in the nation. Id. at 185.\n\f                                      7\n\nor Geometry”; that “Iowa ranks thirty-eighth in the nation for AP\n\n[Advanced Placement] test scores”; and that “[m]any Iowa students are\n\nnot prepared to enter the workforce or post-secondary education without\n\nadditional training or remediation when they graduate from high school.”\n\n       Some of the factual allegations concern “the circumstances of the\n\nplaintiffs.”   These allegations do not actually discuss the plaintiffs\n\nindividually, but rather their school districts. According to the petition,\n\none of the districts, West Harrison, has approximately 500 students.\n\n(Thus, it does not fall into the smallest category of school district, i.e.,\n\nless than 250 students, referenced earlier in the petition.) Among other\n\nthings, plaintiffs allege that West Harrison had an average ACT\n\ncomposite score of 18.6 in 2006, nearly three and a half points below the\n\naverage ACT score for all Iowa students; that only ten to twelve percent of\n\nWest Harrison’s teachers have advanced degrees; that West Harrison\n\ndoes not have anyone on staff to assist high school students with college\n\nplanning or other career counseling; and that classes at West Harrison\n\ndo not adequately prepare students for a college level curriculum.\n\n       With regard to the Davenport school district, plaintiffs do not find\n\nfault with teacher experience, staffing, or class availability, but allege\n\nthat its average composite ACT score in 2007 was 20.5. No allegations\n\nare made as to teacher experience, staffing, class availability, or ACT\n\nscores in the Des Moines school district.      However, with respect to all\n\nthree of the school districts, plaintiffs allege that the percentages of\n\nstudents found proficient in math and reading according to ITBS and\n\nITED scores generally have ranged between fifty and seventy percent, a\n\nlevel that plaintiffs appear to believe is unsatisfactory.\n\n       The petition has two counts seeking relief. In Count I, plaintiffs\n\nrequest a declaratory judgment.           They allege that education is a\n\f                                      8\n\nfundamental right or alternatively that the current education laws (“or\n\nlack thereof”) are “irrational, arbitrary, and capricious” and not\n\n“rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest.” They also allege\n\nthat “some students are receiving a more effective education than other\n\nstudents based solely upon where the student resides.” They allege the\n\ndefendants have “failed to establish and provide access to an effective\n\neducation” by (1) “failing to establish educational standards,” (2) failing\n\nto enforce and utilize such standards, (3) “failing to implement a\n\nprofessional pay system for educators consistent with such standards,”\n\n(4) “failing to provide equal access,” and (5) “failing to develop an effective\n\norganizational and delivery system and failing to address or abolish the\n\ndisparities among different school[] districts in Iowa.”          They allege\n\nviolations of the due process, equal protection, and education clauses of\n\nthe Iowa Constitution and Iowa Code section 256.37.\n\n      Count II seeks an order of mandamus. It alleges similar failures\n\non the part of the defendants, but goes on to assert that these failures\n\namount to a breach of duty and requests an order directing the\n\ndefendants to provide an effective education.\n\n      Finally, plaintiffs’ prayer for relief seeks a declaration that the\n\ndefendants have failed to provide an effective education in accordance\n\nwith the due process, equal protection, and education clauses and Iowa\n\nCode section 256.37.       It also requests an order of mandamus or\n\npermanent injunction directing the defendants to (1) undertake all\n\nsuitable means to provide an effective education; (2) develop educational\n\ncontent and performance standards for all Iowa school districts which\n\ndetail required course offerings, instructor capabilities, and testing\n\nrequirements,    among    other   things;   (3) improve   or    develop   state\n\nassessments;     (4) develop   and    enforce    professional    development\n\f                                          9\n\nprograms; (5) implement a career ladder to enhance recruitment and\n\nretention of quality teachers; (6) enforce the standards by identifying and\n\nenforcing consequences for failure to follow and implement such\n\nstandards;       (7) “develop    educational   management       and   governance\n\narrangements to mitigate all procedural and structural impediments to\n\nan effective education”; and (8) “[c]lose the achievement gaps among the\n\nschool[] districts in Iowa.”\n\n      Plaintiffs’ original petition was filed April 3; their first amended and\n\nsubstituted petition on April 30. On June 21, 2008, the defendants filed\n\na motion to dismiss. In their nine-page motion, the defendants argued:\n\n(1) all the constitutional claims raised a nonjusticiable political question;\n\n(2) the equal protection and due process claims failed to state a claim;\n\n(3) there   is    no   private    cause   of   action   under   section   256.37;\n\n(4) mandamus did not lie; (5) the Governor could not be sued; and (6) the\n\nIowa Administrative Procedures Act was the exclusive means of obtaining\n\nreview of acts or omissions by the Department of Education.\n\n      This motion was resisted on all grounds by plaintiffs; a hearing\n\nwas held; and on November 21, 2008, the district court granted the\n\ndefendants’ motion.\n\n      In a thoughtful sixteen-page ruling, the district court found the\n\nplaintiffs had stated claims for relief under the equal protection clause\n\nand the due process clause, but all their constitutional claims presented\n\na nonjusticiable political question, and their statutory claim under\n\nsection 256.37 failed because that provision does not afford a private\n\nright of action. The court also found the plaintiffs had not satisfied the\n\nprerequisites for seeking mandamus. The court dismissed the action in\n\nits entirety for these reasons, declining to reach the defendants’\n\nremaining asserted grounds for dismissal. Plaintiffs appeal.\n\f                                           10\n\n       II.

Analysis.\n\n       A. Introduction.           We begin our analysis of this case by\n\ndiscussing, briefly, what it is not.         For one thing, this is not a school\n\nfunding case.      Plaintiffs do not allege that Iowa has a funding system\n\nthat discriminates among school districts or even one that funds schools\n\ninadequately. 5 Also, plaintiffs are not questioning any specific law, rule,\n\n       5Approximately   forty-one other state supreme courts have considered broad\nconstitutional challenges to the state education system. The vast majority of these\ncases have been primarily concerned with the state’s method of funding education—i.e.,\nallegations that funding is either inequitable, inadequate, or both.

The Education Clause.                 We first consider plaintiffs’ claims\n\nunder article IX, division 2, section 3 of the Iowa Constitution. 7 In its\n\nentirety, this section reads as follows:\n\n              Perpetual support fund.         Sec. 3.    The General\n       Assembly shall encourage, by all suitable means, the\n       promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural\n       improvement. The proceeds of all lands that have been, or\n       hereafter may be, granted by the United States to this State,\n       for the support of schools, which may have been or shall\n       hereafter be sold, or disposed of, and the five hundred\n       thousand acres of land granted to the new States, under an\n       act of Congress, distributing the proceeds of the public lands\n       among the several States of the Union, approved in the year\n       of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and forty-one, and\n       all estates of deceased persons who may have died without\n       leaving a will or heir, and also such percent as has been or\n       may hereafter be granted by Congress, on the sale of lands\n       in this State, shall be, and remain a perpetual fund, the\n       interest of which, together with all rents of the unsold lands,\n       and such other means as the General Assembly may provide,\n\n        6This case was originally argued in March 2010, before three current members\n\njoined this court. It was then reargued in June 2011. Even at the first oral argument,\nsome of the questioning related to the merits of plaintiffs’ claims, including the following\nquestions taken from the recording:\n       I take it this is a bit of an attack on local control, correct me if I’m wrong?\n       Aren’t you in essence saying that a local school board then would not have\n       the authority to say: well we want to set our tax rates at a certain level;\n       we are concerned about economic development in this rural setting, we\n       don’t want to get the taxes up high; we choose not to promote advanced\n       placement courses and instead we want to have a broad based athletic\n       program.\n       Supposing there were a uniform standard, number one wouldn’t that pose\n       a risk of a lower standard as the legislature considers what’s uniform\n       across the board that they want to bring the rural districts up and maybe\n       the urban districts down?\n       Secondly, supposing that standard were established could a wealthier\n       district then elect to apply a richer environment?\n(Emphasis added.)\n       7Plaintiffs  do not argue, either here or below, that they have claims under\ndivision 1 of article IX of the Iowa Constitution.\n\f                                          17\n      shall be inviolably appropriated to the support of common\n      schools throughout the state.\n\nIowa Const. art. IX, div. 2, § 3 (1857 original version) (emphasis added).\n\nThe present controversy concerns the italicized first sentence above,\n\nwhich both parties refer to as “the education clause.” 8\n      Plaintiffs    contend      the   education      clause   imposes   judicially\n\nenforceable obligations on Iowa’s legislature to promote education by “all\n\nsuitable means.”       Defendants counter that plaintiffs’ claims under the\n\nclause present a nonjusticiable political question.             Otherwise stated,\n\ndefendants maintain that the education clause reflects a grant of funding\n\nauthority to the legislature, not a limit upon legislative policy in the field\n\nof education.\n\n      Constitutional provisions, like statutes, need to be read in context.\n\nSee Iowa Elec.

The first\n\ndivision of article IX, captioned “Education,” established a state board of\n\neducation and conferred on that board powers and duties relating to\n\neducation policy. In particular, section 1 of that division provided, “The\n\neducational interest of the State, including Common Schools and other\n\neducational institutions, shall be under the management of a Board of\n\nEducation . . . .” Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1, § 1. Section 8 authorized\n\nthe board of education “to legislate and make all needful rules and\n\nregulations in relation to Common Schools,” although it also permitted\n\n\n\n\n      8We   have not used that term previously in any case.\n\f                                     18\n\nthe general assembly to “alter[], amend[] or repeal[]” the board’s acts,\n\nrules and regulations after they had been adopted. Id. art. IX, div. 1, § 8.\n\n       The second division of article IX, captioned “School Funds and\n\nSchool Lands,” sets forth provisions relating to the funding of education,\n\nespecially through the sale of state-owned lands.        Whereas the first\n\ndivision entrusted the “educational interest” to the board of education,\n\nthe second division made clear that funding would be the legislature’s\n\ndomain.    Hence, the first section of the second division states, “[t]he\n\neducational and school funds and lands, shall be under the control and\n\nmanagement of the General Assembly of this state.” Id. art. IX, div. 2,\n\n§ 1.\n\n       The third section of the second division, wherein the education\n\nclause is found, is entitled “Perpetual support fund.” Id. art IX, div. 2,\n\n§ 3.   The clause itself then follows.      The remaining language of this\n\nsection, after the education clause, speaks in terms of “a perpetual fund,\n\nthe interest of which, together with all rents of the unsold lands, and\n\nsuch other means as the General Assembly may provide, shall be\n\ninviolably appropriated to the support of Common schools throughout\n\nthe State.”   Id.   All this, we believe,   supports a construction of the\n\neducation clause as a funding provision, which allocated to the general\n\nassembly the authority to provide money for education, and thereby to\n\n“encourage [various forms of improvement] by all suitable means.” Id.\n\n       We discussed this dichotomy between education policy (covered by\n\nthe first division of article IX) and education funding (the subject of the\n\nsecond division) at some length in District Township of the City of\n\nDubuque v. City of Dubuque, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cl. Ch.</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1858), decided just a year\n\nafter the adoption of 1857 constitution. There we found unconstitutional\n\na wide-ranging law enacted by the general assembly to provide for “the\n\f                                          19\n\npublic instruction of the state of Iowa” on the ground that “[p]ower to\n\nlegislate upon the subject of education, is conferred upon the board [of\n\neducation]” and the legislature can only act in the realm of education\n\npolicy to alter, amend, or repeal the board’s prior acts.               Dist. Twp., 7\n\nClarke at 271–72, 285–86. 9 We emphasized that laws “which provide a\n\nsystem of education, sometimes known by the name of ‘school laws’ . . .\n\nare to originate with the board[,]” whereas laws “for the levying of taxes—\n\nthose making appropriations of money—and those for the control and\n\nmanagement of the educational and school funds and lands—are to be\n\npassed by the general assembly.” Id. at 286.\n\n       A year later, in Clayton County High School v. Clayton County, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">175</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1859), reinforcing the lesson of the Dubuque case, we held the\n\ngeneral assembly lacked constitutional authority to establish high\n\nschools. We specifically rejected the argument that such schools “may\n\nrightfully be provided for by the General Assembly, to whom is committed\n\nthe duty of encouraging, by all suitable means, the promotion of\n\nintellectual, scientific, moral and agricultural improvement.”                 Clayton\n\nCnty., 9 Iowa at 176.

Our decision there was based on\ninterpretation of language originally passed by the board of education in 1860 in the\nwake of the Dubuque decision and subsequently reaffirmed on several occasions by the\nlegislature. Clark, 24 Iowa at 271–73. The language in question required “the\ninstruction of youth between the ages of five and twenty-one years.” Id. at 271. We\nreasoned that this language prohibited the exclusion of persons of color from the\ncommon schools. Id. at 276. Our opinion cited section 12 of the first division of article\nIX—one of the original constitutional provisions relating to the board—as providing\nauthority for the board’s 1860 enactment. Id. at 271. In this case, plaintiffs have not\ncited or relied upon section 12 or any of the other original constitutional provisions in\nthe first division relating to the board of education.\n\f                                          20\n\nestablishment of which, as well as its subsequent management and\n\ncontrol, has been committed by the constitution to the Board of\n\nEducation.” Id. at 177. In short, at a time when the 1857 constitution\n\nwas quite fresh in people’s minds, we reached the conclusion that no\n\naspect of the Iowa Constitution, including the education clause,\n\nauthorized the legislature to provide for public schools (as opposed to\n\nmerely funding them).        Since the contemporary view of our court was\n\nthat the education clause did not even allow the legislature to establish\n\npublic schools, it seems difficult for us to conceive that the clause could\n\nhave been seen as a source of enforceable minimum standards for such\n\nschools.\n\n          This interpretation of the education clause as a grant of funding\n\nauthority is further confirmed by section 15 of the first division of article\n\nIX:\n\n                 At any time after the year One thousand eight hundred\n          and sixty three, the General Assembly shall have power to\n          abolish or re-organize said Board of Education, and provide\n          for the educational interest of the State in any other manner\n          that to them shall seem best and proper.\n\nIowa Const. art. IX, div. 1, § 15. In short, section 15 of the first division\nauthorized the general assembly to eliminate the board of education at\n\nany time after 1863 and thereafter provide for “the educational interest of\n\nthe State in any other manner that to them shall seem best and proper.”\n\nId. As it turned out, the legislature abolished the board of education at\n\nthe earliest possible opportunity in 1864. See 1864 Iowa Acts ch. 52,\n\n§ 1. 10\n\n\n       10We are not called upon to decide in this case whether the abolition of the\n\nboard of education gave the legislature plenary authority to address education policy or\nwhether that authority is subject to any limits that previously applied to the board of\neducation.\n\f                                      21\n\n      Placed in context, section 15 reaffirms the dividing line between\n\nthe first division of article IX, which addressed education policy, and the\n\nsecond division, which identified funding sources. Section 15 made clear\n\nthat the board of education would control education policy (subject to a\n\npossible legislative override) until at least 1863, but thereafter the\n\nlegislature could take over that responsibility “in any other manner that\n\nto them shall seem best and proper.” Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1, § 15.\n\n      One episode from the 1857 constitutional convention debates also\n\nsuggests that our founders did not intend for section 3 of the second\n\ndivision to constrain the general assembly’s authority with respect to\n\neducation policy. On March 3, 1857, George Ells of Davenport proposed\n\namending that section to include a guarantee of a free public education.\n\nSpecifically, he sought to add a clause at the end of the section so it\n\nwould read, “shall be inviolably appropriated to the support of common\n\nschools throughout the state, in which tuition shall be without charge.”\n\nSee 2 The Debates of the Constitutional Convention; of the State of Iowa\n\n968 (W. Blair Lord reporter, Davenport, Luse, Lane & Co. 1857)\n\n[hereinafter Debates] (emphasis added), available at http://www.state\n\nlibraryofiowa.org/services/law-library/iaconst.\n\n      Ells’s proposal came under immediate criticism.         J.C. Hall of\n\nBurlington objected that the issue of free public schools should be left “to\n\nbe determined in the future, as the public exigencies may require.” Id.\n\nA.H. Marvin of Monticello observed:\n\n             We should not, in my opinion, be bound by a\n      constitutional provision to make our common schools free to\n      all, but should let the several districts regulate this matter\n      for themselves. If we do that, I will warrant you that poor\n      children will never be turned out of our common schools.\n\f                                          22\n\nId. at 969. Harvey Skiff of Newton commented, “If we should incorporate\n\nthe provision of the gentleman from Scott [Mr. Ells] into our constitution,\n\nit would become established as organic law, which could not be\n\nrepealed.” Id. Although another delegate (Rufus Clarke of Mt. Pleasant)\n\nspoke in favor of the amendment, it was quickly defeated by a vote of\n\ntwenty-five to eight. Id. at 970–72.\n\n       This exchange indicates the delegates to the 1857 convention did\n\nnot believe that section 3, as it was ultimately approved, contained a\n\nright to a free public education. And if section 3 did not assure a right to\n\na free public education, it seems untenable to argue that section 3\n\ncontained a judicially enforceable right to a free public education with\n\ncertain minimum standards of quality.             Iowa’s constitutional delegates\n\nhad an opportunity to make a guarantee of free public education part of\n\n“organic law,” id. at 969, and declined to do so. 11\n\n       Our decision in Kleen v. Porter lends further support to the view\n\nthat the education clause does not constrain legislative policies in the\n\nfield of education. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3434480\"><a href=\"/opinion/3436675/kleen-v-porter/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">1160</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3434480\"><a href=\"/opinion/3436675/kleen-v-porter/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">904</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1946). Kleen was a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action seeking to have declared unconstitutional\n\ntwo laws that appropriated money from the general fund to school\ndistricts on a targeted basis to reimburse certain transportation expenses\n\nand bring all districts up to a certain minimum level of per-pupil\n\nfunding.    237 Iowa at 1161, 23 N.W.2d at 905. The petition asserted\n\n       11Earlier  in the convention, Marvin had proposed an amendment that would\nhave provided, “And the legislature shall provide for raising funds sufficient so that\nschools shall be kept in each district at least six months in each year, which schools\nshall be free of charge and equally open to all.” 2 Debates, at 825. That amendment\nalso was rejected, following a debate that had unfortunate racial overtones. Id. at 825–\n30.\n       Unlike the earlier Marvin amendment, the later Ells amendment was directed to\nsection 3 of the second division. There is no indication in the debates that the Ells\namendment was rejected for racial reasons.

Id.; see also Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 2, § 7 (“The\n\nmoney subject to the support and maintenance of common schools shall\n\nbe distributed to the districts in proportion to the number                of youths,\n\nbetween the ages of five and twenty-one years, in such manner as may\n\nbe provided by the General Assembly.”). 12 We disagreed. We held that\n\nthe enumeration requirement applied only to appropriations from the\n\n“permanent school fund” established by article IX, division 2, not other\n\nfunding sources. Kleen, 237 Iowa at 1165–66, 23 N.W.2d at 907. We\n\nconstrued the first sentence of section 3—“The General Assembly shall\n\nencourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of intellectual, scientific,\n\nmoral, and agricultural improvement”—as designed to give the legislature\n\n“broad authority” to augment the income from the permanent school\n\nfund without being subject to the enumeration requirement in section 7.\n\nId. at 1166, 23 N.W.2d at 907. Thus, Kleen saw the education clause as\n\na grant of broad funding authority to the general assembly.\n\n      In sum, given the wording and location of the education clause in\n\nour constitution, and our prior interpretations of that clause, we do not\n\nbelieve plaintiffs have stated a claim thereunder. Plaintiffs’ criticisms of\n\nstate education policy do not amount to a violation of article IX, division\n\n2, section 3.\n\n      It is a well-established principle that the courts will not intervene\n\nor attempt to adjudicate a challenge to a legislative action involving a\n\n“political question.”     Des Moines Register & Tribune Co. v.

See, e.g.,\n\nIowa Const. art. I, §§ 3–4, 6–9, 11–19, 21, 23–24. Moreover, as noted\n\nabove, the education clause must be read in conjunction with the broad\n\npolicy-making authority conferred by article IX, division 1, section 15,\n\nwhich states that the general assembly shall have power after 1863 to\n\n“provide for the educational interest of the state in any other manner\n\nthat to them shall seem best and proper.” Kinzer v.

The clause says that the legislature shall\n\n“encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of intellectual,\n\nscientific, moral, and agricultural improvement.”    Iowa Const. art.

Of course, the clause does not even contain the\n\nwords “schools” or “education.” Does this mean that we as judges can\n\norder the state to foster moral improvement in adults? 13\n\n       As we note above, most of the prior challenges to state education\n\nsystems have been, in whole or in part, about funding.                     Courts are\n\naccustomed to dealing with questions of financial discrimination. See,\n\ne.g., State v.

They employ language that is both more\nforceful and more specific. Connecticut’s clause provides, “There shall always be free\npublic elementary and secondary schools in the state. The general assembly shall\nimplement this principle by appropriate legislation.”       Conn. Const. art. 8, § 1.\nMassachusetts’ clause states:\n       Wisdom, and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused generally among the\n       body of the people, being necessary for the preservation of their rights\n       and liberties; and as these depend on spreading the opportunities and\n       advantages of education in the various parts of the country, and among\n       the different orders of the people, it shall be the duty of legislatures and\n       magistrates, in all future periods of this commonwealth, to cherish the\n       interests of literature and the sciences, and all seminaries of them;\n       especially the university at Cambridge, public schools and grammar\n       schools in the towns . . . .\nMass.

Bonner, 907 N.E.2d at 520. In the court’s view “[j]udicial\n\nenforceability is more plausible as to the second duty than the first.” Id.\n\nThus, the court found that this section required the legislature to\nestablish free public schools, but “does not impose upon government an\n\naffirmative duty to achieve any particular standard of resulting\n\neducational quality.     This determination is delegated to the sound\n\nlegislative discretion of the General Assembly.” Id. at 522.

Adding the word\n\n“suitable” to either clause, or both, does not alter the basic contrast\n\nbetween      an   amorphous         goal   (“intellectual,     scientific,    moral,     and\n\nagricultural improvement”) and a more specific one (“the support and\n\nmaintenance of an efficient system of public free schools”).

By the\nsame token, it differs dramatically from the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the\nFourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which by its terms protects certain\nprivileges and immunities of “citizens of the United States” from being abridged by the\nstates.

Typically, we decide claims brought by individuals who allege\n\ndenial of their constitutional right to equal protection, even when the\n\nclaim pertains to an area where the legislative branch has been vested\n\nwith considerable authority. See, e.g., Luse, 254 N.W.2d at 328 (holding\n\nthat an equal protection challenge to a general assembly election contest\n\nwas justiciable notwithstanding the authority conferred by article III,\n\nsection 7 to each house to determine such matters).

Although we found the Exira district itself lacked\n\nstanding, id. at 790, we reached the merits of the equal protection and\n\nsubstantive due process challenges brought by the parent-taxpayers and\n\nstudents under both the U.S. and the Iowa Constitutions.                  We\n\nsummarized their complaints as follows:\n\n      They believe the financing mechanism in section 282.18(8) is\n      unreasonable because it requires a transfer of locally\n      generated tax revenues without a showing of need. What the\n      appellants want is a financing scheme that would require a\n      showing that the receiving district “needs” the tax dollars\n      more than the sending district. Otherwise—the appellants\n      argue—a significant loss of students could ultimately destroy\n      a sending district.\n\n             ....\n\n            Appellants’ complaint boils down to this. Before open\n      enrollment, the state had achieved through the financing\n      formula educational equality for every student in Iowa.\n      During the first year of open enrollment, Exira experienced a\n      $70,000 loss in tax revenues necessary to educate the\n      students remaining in the Exira school district.         This\n      resulted in a substantial disparity in funds available for\n      education between Exira and Audubon. This disparity has\n      disturbed the educational equality previously existing.\n\nId. at 793–94.\n\n      Significantly, the plaintiffs in Exira did not allege that the statute\n\nin question infringed upon a fundamental right. Id. at 793. Thus, for\n\nboth equal protection and substantive due process purposes, we applied\n\nthe rational basis test. Id. Quoting an earlier case, we held that when a\n\nstatute bears “ ‘a definite, rational relationship to a legitimate purpose,’ ”\n\nit must be allowed to stand.       Id. (quoting Kent v. Polk Cnty.

Id.\n\n      Applying the rational basis test, we found that the financing\n\nmechanism        “easily   passes   constitutional   muster”   because   open\n\nenrollment results in greater access to educational opportunities and the\n\nlegislature’s chosen method of financing open enrollment “maintains per\n\npupil equity.” Id. at 795. Regarding the parent-taxpayers’ “relative need”\n\nargument, i.e., that the Exira district needed the money it was\n\ntransferring to Audubon in order to survive, we commented, “In the final\n\nanalysis, the appellants’ relative need argument is really all about a\n\nschool district’s alleged due process right to exist.”         Id.   We then\n\nresponded to this argument as follows:\n\n             If it chooses to do so, the legislature can—without\n      constitutional impediment—terminate a school district’s\n      existence.       And when the legislature enacted open\n      enrollment legislation, it knew full well that its ultimate\n      effect might mean the demise of some smaller schools.\n      Despite this knowledge, the legislature made a policy\n      decision—right or wrong—to go with open enrollment. It is\n      not for us to judge the wisdom of such a policy. That was a\n      legislative call.\n\n            In yielding the call to the legislative branch of\n      government, we are not insensitive to the feelings and\n      strongly-held views of patrons of smaller schools, such as\n      the Exira school. We recognize that individuals and families\n      sense a way of life is in the balance and vehemently\n      challenge any assumption that centralization of schools\n      improves the quality of education. The proper forum for this\n      debate is however not in the courts, but in the other\n      branches of state government. Our clear duty is to interpret\n      and apply the law given to us, and not to develop or choose\n      among schemes for public education.\n\nId. at 795–96.\n\f                                    36\n\n      At the end of our opinion, we turned specifically to the due process\n\nand equal protection claims of the Exira students.      We rejected their\n\nsubstantive due process claim, observing, “We know of no authority that\n\nsays a student’s desire to be educated in a certain school district [i.e.,\n\nExira] rises to the level of a right protected by due process.” Id. at 796.\n\nWe added that a student has “a due process right to an adequate\n\neducation,” but noted, “That right—as we have demonstrated [in our\n\nprevious rational basis analysis]—is furthered, not diminished, by the\n\nfunding mechanism in section 282.18(8).”      Id.   We also overruled the\n\nstudents’ equal protection challenge, stating: “Nor do we think such\n\nstudents are treated differently for equal protection purposes. We say\n\nthis because section 282.18(8) assures every student roughly the same\n\namount of funds for his or her education wherever that student is\n\neducated.” Id. In short, we concluded that the statute “does indeed have\n\na rational basis,” which “disposes of” both the equal protection and the\n\nsubstantive due process challenges. Id.\n\n      We believe several lessons can be drawn from Exira.        First, we\n\nrecognized that students have a due process right to an adequate\n\neducation, although we did not characterize it as a fundamental right.\n\nId. at 796. (The plaintiffs did not allege that a fundamental right was at\n\nissue in their case, id. at 793, and we accepted that position for purposes\n\nof our decision.)   Second, we held there is no due process right to be\n\neducated in a particular school district. Id. at 796. Third, we found a\n\nfunding mechanism that assured roughly the same amount of per-pupil\n\nfunding regardless of the district did not treat students differently or\n\nviolate equal protection. Id. Finally, we expressed the view that debates\n\nover whether “centralization of schools improves the quality of education”\n\nbelonged in the legislature and not the courts. Id. at 795–96.\n\f                                    37\n\n      As an initial matter, we note that any equal protection claim,\n\nwhether in the education context or elsewhere, requires an allegation of\n\ndisparate treatment, not merely disparate impact.       Indeed, plaintiffs’\n\ncounsel conceded as much at oral argument. To allege a viable equal\n\nprotection claim, plaintiffs must allege that the defendants are treating\n\nsimilarly situated persons differently.    Thus, in State v. Wade, we\n\nrejected an argument that a special sentence for both felony and\n\nmisdemeanor sex offenders violated equal protection. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1945475\"><a href=\"/opinion/1945475/state-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">757</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">618</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n625 (Iowa 2008).

Article IX, section 1 of the California Constitution is\n\nentitled “Encouragement of education” and reads in its entirety as\n\nfollows:\n\n      A general diffusion of knowledge and intelligence being\n      essential to the preservation of the rights and liberties of the\n      people, the Legislature shall encourage by all suitable means\n      the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and\n      agricultural improvement.\n\nCal. Const. art. IX, § 1.\n\n      While California apparently borrowed some of this wording from\n\nthe Iowa Constitution, see Crosby v. Lyon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 245 (1869), its\n\neducation clause is essentially a stand-alone provision.       In Iowa, by\n\f                                     41\n\ncontrast, the education clause is the first sentence of a funding section\n\nentitled “Perpetual support fund” that, in turn, falls within a series of\n\nfunding provisions. Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 2, § 3.\n\n      Contrasting with the reasoning of the California Supreme Court is\n\nthat of the Indiana Supreme Court. In Bonner, the court affirmed the\n\ndismissal of the plaintiffs’ state equal protection and due process claims,\n\ndetermining that there was no fundamental constitutional right to an\n\nadequate public education in Indiana. 907 N.E.2d at 522. The court\n\nreached this result despite the presence of an education clause similar to\n\nIowa’s in the Indiana Constitution. The court noted that the clause “does\n\nnot speak in terms of a right or entitlement to education” and that the\n\nIndiana Bill of Rights contains no reference to education. Id. The same\n\nis true in Iowa. The “Bill of Rights” and “Right of Suffrage” in the Iowa\n\nConstitution make no mention of education. See Iowa Const. arts. I, II.\n\n      We defer to another day the question whether education can\n\namount to a fundamental right under the Iowa Constitution, thereby\n\ntriggering heightened scrutiny.      For present purposes, we conclude\n\nsimply that the matters alleged in plaintiffs’ petition, even if true, do not\n\namount to a deprivation of such a right.          In Hensler, we recently\n\nacknowledged there is a fundamental parental right to exercise care,\n\ncustody, and control over children. 790 N.W.2d at 581–82. Yet not all\n\nalleged infringements upon this right trigger strict scrutiny. Id. at 582.\n\nRather, we required in Hensler that the challenged governmental action\n\n“directly and substantially intrude into [the parent’s] decision-making\n\nauthority over her child.” Id. at 583. Similarly here, even if we assume\n\nthere is a fundamental right to a basic education at some level, the\n\nplaintiffs’ allegations do not show a denial of that right.     No plaintiff\n\nalleges anything specific to his or her (or his or her child’s) own actual\n\f                                    42\n\neducation.      Rather, their allegations are largely a hodgepodge of\n\nstatistics. Some of these numbers relate to Iowa’s performance as a state\n\nand show a deterioration or decline in Iowa’s ranking or a below-average\n\nscore.     Others relate to ACT scores, reading proficiency, and math\n\nproficiency ratings in the Davenport, Des Moines, or West Harrison\n\nschool districts. These data, in the plaintiffs’ view, demonstrate the need\n\nfor more statewide standards and requirements.       But even if all true,\n\nthey do not amount to a deprivation of a fundamental right as to these\n\nplaintiffs.\n\n         In Exira, we commented that the proper forum for debate over\n\nschool centralization is “not in the courts, but in the other branches of\n\nstate government.”    512 N.W.2d at 796.     In a way, this case involves\n\nanother phase of the same debate.          These plaintiffs want greater\n\ncentralization–—“state-mandated standards,” state-mandated “specific\n\ntesting of students at various educational levels in a variety of subject\n\nmatters,” and a state-mandated “professional pay system for educators.”\n\n         Because in this particular case the allegations do not show a\n\ndeprivation of a fundamental right, even if we assume there is a\n\nfundamental right to education at some level, we apply the rational basis\n\ntest.    In previous discussions of both the Federal and the Iowa Equal\n\nProtection Clause, we have found a rational basis review applies when\n\n“ ‘social or economic legislation is at issue.’ ” Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at\n\n817 (quoting City of Cleburne v.

Since the State does not have to produce evidence,\n\nand only a “plausible” justification is required, see Ames Rental Prop.\n\nAss’n, 736 N.W.2d at 259, there are certainly occasions where a rational\n\nbasis test can be applied on the pleadings without taking evidence. In\n\nthis case, unless the well-pleaded facts (if true) would show that Iowa’s\n\neducational system is not rationally related to a legitimate state goal,\n\nthere is no reason for the case to proceed further.\n\n       Disregarding plaintiffs’ legal conclusions (for example, that Iowa’s\n\neducation system is “irrational, arbitrary and capricious” or that the\n\ndefendants have failed to provide an “effective education”), 23 we are left\n\nwith the following allegations: (1) Iowa has fewer state standards and\n\nrequirements than other states (although it has some); (2) Iowa’s schools\n\nhave a mediocre national ranking on some measures according to some\n\nsources; (3) the smaller school districts in Iowa on average have less\n\nexperienced and credentialed teachers and offer fewer classes; (4) three\n\ndistricts (Davenport, Des Moines, and West Harrison) have substantial\npercentages of students who are not demonstrating proficiency in\n\nreading and math according to certain standardized tests; and (5) one\n\ndistrict (West Harrison) does not do a good job of preparing students for\n\ncollege. Plaintiffs attribute the last four points to the first—that is, they\n\nblame the lack of state-mandated standards in various areas for the\n\nundistinguished rankings on certain national score charts and the\n\n\n       23Ifthere is a constitutional right to an “effective education,” then alleging that\nthe defendants have failed to provide such an education amounts to a mere legal\nconclusion.\n\f                                    45\n\nconcerns noted with respect to smaller and larger school districts. But\n\nfor purposes of the rational basis test, we need only find a reasonable\n\nrelationship to a legitimate state purpose.    See, e.g., Comm. for Educ.\n\nRights, 672 N.E.2d at 1196 (affirming dismissal of complaint on this\n\nground after applying rational basis test and finding Illinois’s system for\n\nfunding public education rationally related to the legitimate state\n\npurpose of local control).\n\n      We can conceive of a rational basis for the set of circumstances\n\ndescribed by plaintiffs. The Iowa legislature may have decided that local\n\nschool board autonomy is preferable in certain instances to state\n\nmandates.    The legislature may also have concluded that it is more\n\nequitable to provide an equal or roughly equal amount of resources to\n\neach state school district, on a per capita basis, and then give those\n\nschool districts the primary responsibility for determining how that\n\nmoney will be spent.     See Iowa Code § 257.1(2) (providing that “each\n\nschool district in the state is entitled to receive foundation aid in an\n\namount per pupil equal to the difference between the per pupil\n\nfoundation tax . . . and the combined foundation base per pupil or the\n\ncombined district cost per pupil, whichever is less”). The legislature may\n\nalso have decided that it is important to preserve school districts in rural\n\nareas, even though the smaller size of those districts may not allow them\n\nto offer the same kinds of programs as larger districts. The legislature\n\nmay have determined that time spent on standardized testing of\n\nstudents—and preparation for such tests—detracts from time spent in\n\nother areas of learning. Additionally, the legislature may have decided\n\nthat school districts in Iowa are aware of their students’ math and\n\nreading proficiency rates, but have many other pressing concerns, and\n\f                                             46\n\nthat it would be best to defer to the judgment of local administrators\n\nregarding the areas that require the most attention.\n\n       Local control, equity in per-pupil funding, maintenance of existing\n\nrural school districts, and conservation of scarce classroom time and\n\nresources are all legitimate governmental interests. As claimed interests,\n\nthey are “realistically conceivable.”             Miller v. Boone Cnty.

While\n\nacknowledging the undeniable importance of education, our court has\n\npreviously characterized it as an area where there is no true consensus\n\nand where needs change over time.

Midwest Check Cashing, Inc., 728 N.W.2d at 404 n.6.\n\n      Regardless, there is an additional reason why we conclude\n\nplaintiffs have not alleged facts that, if true, would amount to a denial of\n\nsubstantive due process.     As we have already pointed out, we are not\n\ndeciding today whether there is a fundamental right to a basic education\n\nembraced within the Iowa Constitution.       If there is such a right, the\n\nplaintiffs have not alleged that they have been deprived of it. Therefore,\n\nthe rational basis test applies.\n\n      Typically, when the rational basis test is involved, we evaluate that\n\nbasis similarly for equal protection and due process purposes. Midwest\n\nCheck Cashing, Inc., 728 N.W.2d at 405; Sanchez, 692 N.W.2d at 820\n\n(concluding that “[f]or the reasons discussed in the equal protection\n\nanalysis,” a statute meets the rational basis test and does not violate\n\nsubstantive due process).     For the rational basis test to be met, there\n\nneed only be a reasonable fit between the governmental interest and the\n\nmeans utilized to advance that interest. The legislature need not employ\n\nthe best means of achieving that interest. Hensler, 790 N.W.2d at 584.\n\nThe plaintiff by contrast must negate every reasonable basis upon which\n\nthe government’s act may be sustained. Zaber, 789 N.W.2d at 640.\n\n      Our decision in Exira illustrates how the rational basis test works\n\nin practice. Applying that test, we found the financing provision of the\n\nopen enrollment statute to be constitutional because it gave “access to\n\neducational opportunities” even though “its ultimate effect might mean\n\nthe demise of some smaller schools.” Exira, 512 N.W.2d at 795–96. “It is\n\nnot for us to judge the wisdom of such a policy. That was a legislative\n\f                                     52\n\ncall.” Id. at 795. “Our clear duty is to interpret and apply the law given\n\nto us, and not to develop or choose among schemes for public\n\neducation.” Id. at 796. In other words, the possibility that the financing\n\nprovision could be counterproductive and lead to fewer educational\n\nopportunities (due to “the demise of some smaller schools”) was not\n\nrelevant to a rational basis analysis.\n\n      For the reasons already discussed under equal protection, we\n\nbelieve the plaintiffs have not alleged facts that if true would establish a\n\nsubstantive due process violation. They have alleged certain aspects of\n\nIowa’s K–12 educational performance, by some criteria, are mediocre or\n\neven below national averages.        They have alleged Iowa has fewer\n\nstatewide standards than other states. They have alleged some urban\n\n(Davenport and Des Moines) and rural (West Harrison) districts offer\n\nfewer services or, on average, have less favorable educational outcomes\n\nthan other districts.

The plaintiffs also assert a statutory\n\nclaim under Iowa Code section 256.37, which provides:\n\n             It is the policy of the state of Iowa to provide an\n      education system that prepares the children of this state to\n      meet and exceed the technological, informational, and\n      communications demands of our society.          The general\n      assembly finds that the current education system must be\n      transformed to deliver the enriched educational program that\n      the adults of the future will need to have to compete in\n      tomorrow’s world. The general assembly further finds that\n      the education system must strive to reach the following\n      goals:\n\n               1. All children in Iowa must start school ready to\n      learn.\n\n             2. Iowa’s high school graduation rate must increase to\n      at least ninety percent.\n\n            3. Students graduating from Iowa’s education system\n      must demonstrate competency in challenging subject matter,\n      and must have learned to use their minds well, so they may\n      be prepared for responsible citizenship, further learning, and\n      productive employment in a global economy.\n\n           4. Iowa students must be first in the world in science\n      and mathematics achievement.\n\n             5.

Is there any indication of legislative intent, explicit or\n          implicit, to either create or deny such a remedy?\n\n      3. Would allowing such a cause of action be consistent with\n         the underlying purpose of the legislation?\n\n      4.

But we conclude\n\nthe second, third, and fourth factors listed above do not support a\n\nprivate right of action, and therefore hold plaintiffs’ claim under section\n\n256.37 was properly dismissed.\n\n      Regarding the second Marcus/Cort factor, the language of section\n\n256.37 does not indicate legislative intent to create a remedy. Rather,\n\nthe section merely sets forth a general statement of policy with six “goals”\n\nthe “education system must strive to reach.”         Iowa Code § 256.37\n\n(emphasis added).     The legislature specifically used the terms “goals”\ninstead   of   more    concrete   language    such    as   “standards”   or\n\n“requirements.” Also, the legislature used the aspirational phrase “must\n\nstrive to reach” instead of a more demanding phrase such as “must\n\nreach.” Id.\n\n      Furthermore, the wording of the goals themselves reflects a\n\nlegislative purpose to make only a policy pronouncement. Throughout\n\f                                           57\n\nthe statute, broad and sweeping language such as “all” and “every” is\n\nused. Id. The goals are thus utopian in nature. For example, the final\n\ngoal states, “Every school in Iowa must be free of drugs and violence\n\n. . . .”    Id.   Did the legislature intend to allow a student to bring suit\n\nwhenever his or her school is not entirely “free of drugs and violence”?\n\nWe think not.\n\n           The placement of section 37 within Chapter 256 of the Iowa Code\n\nalso supports the proposition that it is simply a policy statement.\n\nSection 256.37 is located within subchapter I, entitled “General\n\nProvisions.”       This subchapter generally describes education policy in\n\nIowa and establishes the Department of Education. Many other sections\n\nwithin the same “General Provisions” subchapter also begin with the\n\nlanguage, “It is the policy . . . .” See, e.g., id. §§ 256.18, .38.\n\n           The third Marcus/Cort factor is also unmet here because allowing a\n\nprivate cause of action would be inconsistent with section 256.37’s\n\npurpose of delineating general goals for Iowa’s educational system.\n\nPermitting a private right of action under section 256.37 would likely\n\nunleash       a    multiplicity   of   future   lawsuits   that   would   transform\n\naspirational goals into a series of specific mandates.             Notably, section\n\n256.37 was enacted as part of legislation that allowed the Department of\n\nEducation to waive compliance with the minimum education standards\n\nfor accredited schools under certain circumstances. See 1992 Iowa Acts\n\nch. 1159, § 1.\n\n           In addition, the fourth factor is not satisfied because the\n\nDepartment of Education has jurisdiction under Iowa Code section 256.1\n\nto act in a policymaking capacity and provide statewide supervision of\n\neducation in the State of Iowa. Iowa Code § 256.1(1) (“The department of\n\neducation is established to act in a policymaking and advisory capacity\n\f                                          58\n\nand to exercise general supervision over the state system of education\n\n. . . .”).   A private cause of action under section 256.37 would intrude\n\ninto an area in which a state administrative agency, the Department of\n\nEducation, already has exclusive jurisdiction.\n\n         Because neither the second, third, nor fourth elements of a private\n\nright of action is present here, we affirm the district court’s ruling that\n\nsection 256.37 does not provide a private remedy.\n\n         Given our disposition of plaintiffs’ substantive claims, we need not\n\nreach defendants’ additional arguments that mandamus is not an\n\nappropriate remedy or that the Governor of Iowa is not a proper\n\ndefendant.\n\n         IV. Conclusion.\n\n         We affirm the dismissal of plaintiffs’ first amended and substituted\n\npetition. We do not minimize the importance of the issues raised by the\n\nplaintiffs. But a respect for precedent and for our constitution requires\n\nthat we stay out of this dispute. This court in its past decisions, from\n\nKleen to Johnson to Exira, has historically deferred to the policy decisions\n\nmade by the political branches of government in this area. 26\n\n         The sixteen parents and students who brought this suit clearly\nbelieve that Iowa’s schools would benefit if we had more student testing,\n\n\n         26We do not think a resolution of this case requires us to review the history of\neducation generally or what past Iowa governors have said on the subject. We are\njudges, not historians. For judges, some history, such as our own precedent, is highly\nrelevant. But there are risks when we draw on political history as source material for\njudicial decisionmaking. One risk is that we may unwittingly diminish the importance\nof more relevant historical events, such as the ratification debates on the Iowa\nConstitution, by submerging them in other political history that has only background\nimportance. Another risk is that political trends might then be used to justify the\noutcome in a particular case. It is not surprising to us that Iowa’s governors have\nbelieved education to be a critical responsibility of government. But demonstrating that\neducation has been a vital concern of the political branches of government does not\nanswer the present question whether this particular case ought to proceed through the\njudicial branch.\n\f                                    59\n\nmore    statewide   standards,    more   statewide    uniformity,   and   a\n\nperformance-based pay system for teachers. These issues are currently\n\nbeing debated throughout our state.      The debate participants include\n\nlegislators, the governor, executive branch officials, school boards,\n\nteachers, parents, students, and taxpayers. We believe the democratic\n\nprocess is best suited for resolution of those debates and can best\n\naccommodate the competing concerns of the many interested parties.\n\n       As we said at the beginning of this opinion, we do not close the\n\ndoor to other actions alleging constitutional violations in the field of\n\neducation. We uphold only the dismissal of this case.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n       Cady, C.J., and Waterman and Zager, JJ., join this opinion.

State\n\nCADY, Chief Justice (concurring specially).\n\n      I concur in the opinion of the majority.       I write separately to\n\nexplain my unwillingness at this time to more fully explore the\n\nconstitutional claim of a public education in Iowa and to further explain\n\nmy position on the issues in this case.\n\n      At the outset, I feel compelled to acknowledge that education is a\n\ntradition that exists today as strongly as ever.      A system of public\neducation is clearly needed to allow the youth of this state to learn the\n\nessential aspects of judgment, analysis, communication, and creativity.\n\nIt is needed to empower each generation to meet the economic, social,\n\nscientific, political, governmental, personal, and other challenges of an\n\nevolving global world. Education is the core of who we are and who we\n\nwill become. The dissenting opinion of Justice Appel has captured the\n\nrich history of this tradition in Iowa and has provided insight into its\n\nconstitutional stature.\n\n      Yet, in response to the specific claim of a constitutional right under\n\nthe education clause raised in this case, I am restrained at this time from\n\ndeciding anything more than that section 3 of the second division of\n\narticle IX of the Iowa Constitution does not alone create a right to a\n\npublic education.   This conclusion is not to say no such right exists\n\nunder the Iowa Constitution, but I am content to wait for a different case\n\nin which the petition both frames the full constitutional underpinnings\n\nand is accompanied by pleadings that would allow the underlying facts of\n\nthe case to become a helpful aid in shaping the parameters to any such\n\nright recognized to exist.   Of course, in this case, as pointed out by\n\nJustice Wiggins, the more fundamental obstacle presented is whether\n\nthis extremely important issue should even be addressed by us when the\n\f                                      61\n\nparties chose, at least initially, not to raise it as an issue for appellate\n\nreview after it was presented and decided by a district court.\n\n         The doctrine of judicial restraint expressed by Justice Wiggins is a\n\nview I would normally follow. Yet, our rules of judicial restraint are full\n\nof nuance and exceptions and ultimately rest on the particular\n\ncircumstances of each case.       As observed in the majority opinion, the\n\nprinciples of judicial restraint also embrace judicial economy, a doctrine\n\nparticularly applicable to this case. If the allegations of a case would not\n\nbe sufficient to establish a claim, assuming they were all true, judicial\n\neconomy would not be served by sending the case back for the parties to\n\ngo through the time and expense of further proceedings only for the\n\ncourts to later declare the plaintiff never had a viable claim in the first\n\nplace.\n\n         Judicial restraint is a doctrine composed of many elements, and it\n\nstrives for outcomes that are both fair and practical. In this case, it is\n\nboth fair and practical for us to examine the pleadings to determine if the\n\nplaintiffs could ever win their lawsuit if we declared the educational\n\nexperience mandated by the legislature in this state was a constitutional\n\nright. It is fair because the parties fully explored this issue before the\n\ndistrict court, and it was ultimately raised and urged at rehearing on\n\nappeal. It is practical because the case is before us, and it is in the best\n\ninterests of all concerned for us to decide the merits of the underlying\n\nclaim now.      Thus, under the particular procedural background of this\n\ncase, I conclude the doctrine of judicial restraint does not instruct us to\n\nrefrain from deciding the basic question whether or not the plaintiffs\n\nhave failed to state a claim for relief. Accordingly, it is appropriate to\n\ndecide if the allegations are sufficient to support a violation of a\n\nfundamental right to an adequate education.\n\f                                     62\n\n       Normally, cases are not resolved on the pleadings.

Miller,\n\nFederal Practice and Procedure § 1357, at 548–53 (3d ed. 2004) (noting\n\ncourts “will accept the pleader’s description of what happened to him or\n\nher along with any conclusion that can reasonably be drawn therefrom,”\n\nbut will not accept “conclusory allegations concerning the legal effect of\n\nthe events the plaintiff has set out if these allegations do not reasonably\n\nfollow from the pleader’s description of what happened”).\n\n       When the viability of a claim for relief is challenged, our pleading\n\nrule requires consideration of any conceivable set of facts, but only those\n\nfacts that relate to and could prove the allegations made in the petition.\n\nThe allegations of the petition, if proven by the facts, must show\n\nentitlement to relief.   Reviewing courts do not, however, consider any\n\nconceivable allegations, only any conceivable facts that support the\n\nallegations made.\n\n       In this case, the allegations of the petition, even if true, could not\n\nestablish that students in Iowa today are being denied a basic or\n\nminimally adequate education, wherever that elusive standard might\n\f                                    63\n\nland.    The plaintiffs have not made a single allegation that could\n\nestablish they have been deprived of the basic ability to read, write, or\n\ncommunicate, and they have not alleged they have been deprived of their\n\nability to gain an understanding of mathematics, science, economics,\n\ngovernment, computer-based technology, or other vital components of a\n\nbasic education. While the allegations in the petition are detailed and\n\nthoughtful, they simply do not show Iowa students are being deprived of\n\nan opportunity for an adequate education. For example, the disparities\n\nalleged to exist between school districts across Iowa may show slightly\n\ndifferent education experiences and outcomes, but those different\n\noutcomes do not establish a deprivation of basic education.\n\n        Likewise, Iowa’s recent decline of college admissions test scores\n\nand other proficiency scores do not establish a deprivation of basic\n\neducation. They merely show the state may have begun to slip, but the\n\nlevel of decline alleged is not so much that a reasonable person could say\n\nthe slip means students have been altogether deprived of a basic\n\neducation. Similarly, the absence of certain assessment mechanisms in\n\nIowa, as alleged by the plaintiffs, does not establish the deprivation of\n\nbasic education. Even Iowa’s decline in the national rankings in various\n\nsubjects does not mean students are being deprived of basic education.\n\nAgain, it merely shows we are beginning to slip or perhaps other states\n\nare beginning to improve. Finally, the broad allegations that Iowa has\n\nfailed to establish standards, enforce standards, adopt effective teacher\n\npay systems, and establish a delivery system are insufficient. Accepting\n\nall the allegations of the petition to be true, the deprivation of basic\n\neducation cannot be established. There are simply no allegations that\n\nstudents in Iowa cannot read, write, communicate, or perform the other\n\nessential aspects of education.    There are no allegations that capable\n\f                                     64\n\nstudents lack an understanding of mathematics, science, economics,\n\ngovernment, or computer-based technology.\n\n      The petition does contain some statements generally indicting the\n\npublic education system. For example, the petition states that “[m]any\n\nIowa students are not prepared to enter the workforce or postsecondary\n\neducation without additional training or remediation when they graduate\n\nfrom high school.”      The petition also alleges the educational and\n\naccreditation standards of this state “do not ensure that all students” will\n\nbe able to meet or exceed the future demands of society, be prepared for\n\nresponsible citizenship, and be prepared for further learning and\n\nproductive employment in the global economy.              The petition also\n\ngenerally declares, “[A]n ineffective education will persist for school\n\nchildren throughout their lifetimes, affecting the rate and extent of their\n\nability to be a responsible citizen, their ability to learn further, and their\n\nability to achieve productive employment in a global economy.”\n\n      To the extent such claims are actually allegations of a petition, as\n\nopposed to hortatory calls to action, they relate to the level of a basic or\n\nadequate education. Wherever a basic or adequate education might land\n\nwithin the framework of our constitution, assuming the existence of a\n\nright to education, that landing point certainly would not guarantee that\n\n“all students” would be able to meet the broad demands of the world in\n\nthe future. Nor would the right guarantee students would never need to\n\ntake a remedial course to enter the workforce or postsecondary\n\neducation.\n\n      Of course, my rejection of the pleadings in the case as a basis to\n\nsupport a constitutional right necessarily leads to the question of what\n\nallegations would need to be pled to properly support the constitutional\n\nclaim of a minimally sufficient public education. Assuming Justice Appel\n\f                                     65\n\nhas articulated the source of a constitutional claim to a public education,\n\nthe fighting issue turns to the meaning of a minimally sufficient\n\neducation. This is an issue that is indeed difficult and one that I am\n\nadmittedly without a specific answer at this time.          We landed on a\n\nminimally sufficient standard in the context of the constitutional right to\n\ncounsel, and this standard has worked well enough in applying the\n\nconstitutional right. But, public education is a totally different kettle of\n\nfish.   The point when a state’s educational system becomes minimally\n\ninsufficient would be difficult to ascertain in the context of a\n\nconstitutional analysis.     Nevertheless, the analysis would need to\n\ngenerally center on the performance of the school system and its\n\ncollective outcomes and be ultimately judged in relationship to other\n\nperformance models over a period of years. But, for now, I am simply\n\ncontent that the allegations of the petition in this case fall short and that\n\na trial to obtain the supporting evidence would not help.\n\n        Additionally, the allegations of the petition, even if true, do not\n\nestablish a violation of the equal protection clause. Even assuming the\n\ndifferent educational outcomes alleged in the petition are supported by\n\nfacts, a rational basis certainly could be articulated to justify the\n\ndifferent outcomes. This rational basis is found in the local control given\n\nto school districts.     Moreover, a rational basis to justify different\n\noutcomes does not need to be derived by courts from the record in a\n\ncase.    Importantly, similar to the way facts are assumed to support\n\nallegations in a petition to determine if a claim for relief has been stated,\n\ncourts formulate a rational basis from any information that is\n\n“realistically conceivable.” Miller v.

Thus, when considering constitutional challenges\n\nsubject to a rational-basis analysis, courts may consider the existence of\n\f                                    66\n\nany conceivable rational basis. The analysis does not require a factual\n\nbasis drawn from the record in the case. Racing Ass’n of Cent.

Consequently, the\n\ncourts have no role in the resolution of this important social issue at this\n\ntime. The petition, if true, may be a call to action, but it is a call under\n\nour constitutional structure for the legislature, not the courts.       The\n\npleadings simply do not convince me that school children today in Iowa,\n\nlet alone the school children at the center of this lawsuit, are being\n\ndeprived or have been deprived of any level of education our constitution\n\nwould be able to mandate.\n\f                                    67\n                                                   #08–2006, King v. State\nWATERMAN, J. (concurring specially).\n\n      I concur in the majority’s well-reasoned decision on all issues. I\n\nwrite separately to emphasize the importance of judicial restraint when\n\nlitigants ask courts to overstep their bounds.\n\n      This case was resubmitted for a second oral argument because\n\nthree new members were added to this court. Plaintiffs’ counsel in his\n\neloquent oral argument urged our court to “do its job.” We do exactly\n\nthat today by affirming the dismissal of a well-intentioned, but legally\n\nflawed lawsuit. If these individual plaintiffs were allowed to proceed with\n\nthis case in the courts, and they somehow won the relief they seek, the\n\nend result would be judges running our public schools through\n\nstructural injunctions that second-guess the educational policy decisions\n\nmade by the elected branches of government. That is not our role. We\n\ndo not sit as the supreme school board of the State of Iowa, and we are\n\nunwilling in the guise of adjudication to usurp powers the Iowa\n\nConstitution cedes to the elected branches to run our public schools.\n\nThe separation-of-powers doctrine precludes the relief these plaintiffs\n\nseek from the courts.\n\n      To reinstate this lawsuit would set a dangerous precedent. These\n\nplaintiffs ask too much of our court jurisprudentially. It is not for courts\n\nto impose particular statewide educational standards by judicial decree.\n\nOur limited role as a coequal branch of government requires us to\n\nadjudicate cases and in doing so construe the meaning of our\n\nconstitution; the constitutional power to run our public schools lies with\n\nthe legislative and executive branches. Courts can and must step in if\n\nthat power is exercised in a way that infringes on individual rights. See,\n\ne.g., Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Cmty. Sch.

No\n\nclaim of disparate treatment or any illegal classification such as race is\n\nmade here. Rather, these plaintiffs seek broad educational reform. Our\n\ncourts are not institutionally competent to make educational policy\n\njudgments. The Department of Education is in the executive branch.\n\n      It is worth repeating here Justice Scalia’s recent warning against\n\nthe use of structural injunctions in institutional reform litigation:\n\n            Structural injunctions . . . turn[] judges into long-term\n      administrators of complex social institutions such as\n      schools, prisons, and police departments. Indeed, they\n      require judges to play a role essentially indistinguishable\n      from the role ordinarily played by executive officials. . . .\n             The drawbacks of structural injunctions have been\n      described at great length elsewhere. This case illustrates\n      one of their most pernicious aspects: that they force judges\n      to engage in a form of factfinding-as-policymaking that is\n      outside the traditional judicial role. The factfinding judges\n      traditionally engage in involves the determination of past or\n      present facts based (except for a limited set of materials of\n      which courts may take “judicial notice”) exclusively upon a\n      closed trial record. That is one reason why a district judge’s\n      factual findings are entitled to plain-error review: because\n      having viewed the trial first hand he is in a better position to\n      evaluate the evidence than a judge reviewing a cold record.\n      In a very limited category of cases, judges have also\n      traditionally been called upon to make some predictive\n      judgments: which custody will best serve the interests of the\n      child, for example, or whether a particular one-shot\n      injunction will remedy the plaintiff’s grievance. When a\n      judge manages a structural injunction, however, he will\n      inevitably be required to make very broad empirical\n      predictions necessarily based in large part upon policy\n      views—the sort of predictions regularly made by legislators\n\f                                    69\n      and executive officials, but inappropriate for the Third\n      Branch.\n            ....\n             It is important to recognize that the dressing-up of\n      policy judgments as factual findings is not an error peculiar\n      to this case.       It is an unavoidable concomitant of\n      institutional-reform litigation. When a district court issues\n      an injunction, it must make a factual assessment of the\n      anticipated consequences of the injunction. And when the\n      injunction undertakes to restructure a social institution,\n      assessing the factual consequences of the injunction is\n      necessarily the sort of predictive judgment that our system of\n      government allocates to other government officials.\n             But structural injunctions do not simply invite judges\n      to indulge policy preferences. They invite judges to indulge\n      incompetent policy preferences. Three years of law school\n      and familiarity with pertinent Supreme Court precedents\n      give no insight whatsoever into the management of social\n      institutions.\n\nBrown v.

Whatever\n\nevidence the King plaintiffs might offer at a trial in this case presumably\n\nwould make a record very different from the evidentiary trial record to be\n\nmade by other plaintiffs with conflicting educational policy goals such as\n\nvouchers or greater local control.

Our court\n\nhas not previously relied on UN declarations or international law to\n\ninterpret our 1857 constitution, and I would not start now.\n\n      The dissent also discusses numerous historical figures and famous\n\neducators. Yet none of them is quoted for the proposition that courts\n\nshould be running schools. I imagine all of them would be surprised by\n\nthat notion.   The divergence of views of education surveyed by the\n\ndissent is another reason why policymaking should be left to the elected\n\nbranches. How should an Iowa judge or jury in a contested case select\n\nfrom among the disparate academic viewpoints and standards? We all\n\nagree public education is vitally important.

The lengthy dissent\n\ncites no case from any jurisdiction where court-ordered imposition of\n\nstatewide educational standards improved student outcomes.\n\n      The dissent argues we should not decide whether the amended\n\npetition states a claim upon which relief may be granted because the\n\nappellee who won dismissal below did not brief that alternative ground\n\nfor dismissal on appeal.

The dissenters argue it was appropriate to reach the issue omitted\n\nfrom the briefs in Feld because it was inextricably intertwined with the\n\nissue briefed on appeal. The same is true in this case—whether these\n\nplaintiffs allege claims upon which judicial relief may be granted or\n\nrather nonjusticiable political questions is simply two sides of the same\n\ncoin. Notably, in Feld, Justice Wiggins posed several questions that are\n\nbetter asked in this case:\n\n       Why should we leave the question unanswered when the\n       district court will be confronted with it on remand? Why are\n       we creating a potential appeal on this issue . . . when we can\n       answer the question now? It seems to me, for us not to\n       address the issue creates extra expense for the parties and\n       the court. Accordingly, I would address the issue head on\n       and give the contact sports exception a proper burial.\n\nId. at 82. So too should we give plaintiffs’ case “a proper burial” now,\n\ninstead of remanding for a costly trial to prove allegations that, if true,\n\nprovide no grounds for judicial relief. 28\n\n       28Justice  Wiggins’ dissent asserts our majority decision “appears to overrule”\nRacing Ass’n of Central Iowa v.

RACI II\nas a practical matter has been limited to its facts. I would expressly overrule RACI II as\nplainly erroneous. The RACI II majority, purporting to apply the federal rational-basis\ntest, held that a tax differential for casino slot machine revenue violated the equal\nprotection clause of the Iowa Constitution on remand after the unanimous United\nStates Supreme Court had held the differential did not violate federal equal protection.\n675 N.W.2d at 3. The RACI II majority thereby essentially took the position that the\nnine justices of the United States Supreme Court were irrational in applying the same\nrational-basis test in the same case, despite the well-settled and long-standing tradition\nof judicial deference to legislative economic regulation and tax classifications. RACI II\nwas wrongly decided for the reasons set forth in the eloquent separate dissents by\nJustices Cady and Carter. See id. at 16–17 (Carter, J., dissenting); id. at 17–28 (Iowa\n\f                                          73\n\n         Many generations of Iowans have been justifiably proud of the\n\nquality of our state’s public school system.               The allegations in this\n\nlawsuit shine a light on shortcomings, disturbing downward trends, and\n\noutcomes that vary from district to district. But notably absent in the\n\nvoluminous filings in this appeal is any convincing argument judicial\n\nintervention will make Iowa schools better. Plaintiffs filed no Brandeis\n\nbrief providing empirical data that their requested judicial intervention\n\nwould improve educational outcomes. The plaintiffs in this case are no\n\ndoubt optimistic and sincere in their beliefs that the educational reforms\n\nthey seek to impose statewide by judicial fiat will raise ACT scores in\n\nmany districts.      Our courts, however, are not competent to determine\n\nwhether a structural injunction imposing a new set of priorities and\n\nstandards will accomplish those worthy goals or instead lower composite\n\naverage ACT scores in districts that currently must be doing many things\n\nright.\n\n         Voters elect our governor, legislators, and school board members.\n\nIf these plaintiffs do not like how Iowa schools are run, they should turn\n\nto the ballot box, not the courts.\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\n2002) (Cady, J., dissenting); see also Racing Ass’n of Cent.

Here, the district court determined the\n\nplaintiffs’ amended petition alleged facts sufficient to meet our notice\n\npleading standard.    See Hawkeye Foodservice Distribution, Inc. v. Iowa\n\nEducators Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">812</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 608 (Iowa 2012) (declining to adopt a\n\nheightened pleading standard).     The district court then dismissed the\n\nplaintiffs’ claims as nonjusticiable political questions.   On appeal, the\n\nplaintiffs’ argued in their appellate brief that its claims were not\n\nnonjusticiable political questions. The plaintiffs did not argue the merits\n\nof their constitutional claims or argue that their petition met our\n\npleading standard.    Indeed, because the district court did not address\n\nthe merits of the constitutional claims and ruled in the plaintiffs’ favor on\n\nthe pleading issue, it would have been unnecessary and strategically\n\nunwise to do so unless the defendants raised these issues on appeal.\n\f                                      76\n\nHowever, the defendants, the prevailing parties below, only argued in\n\ntheir appellate briefs that the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims presented\n\nnonjusticiable political questions.    The defendants did not argue the\n\nplaintiffs’ petition failed to meet our pleading standard. Therefore, under\n\nour rule of error preservation, the only issue briefed by the parties on\n\nappeal, and thus subject to consideration by this court, is the issue of\n\nwhether the plaintiffs’ constitutional claims present nonjusticiable\n\npolitical questions.\n\n      In order to reach the merits of the plaintiffs’ claims and to\n\ndetermine the plaintiffs’ petition failed to state a claim, Justice\n\nMansfield’s opinion and Chief Justice Cady’s concurring opinion rely on\n\nthe proposition that we can uphold a district court decision on a ground\n\ndifferent from the one upon which the district court based its decision as\n\nlong as the ground was urged in the district court. See DeVoss v. State,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1685266\"><a href=\"/opinion/1685266/devoss-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 63 (2002). As already noted, this proposition stands for\n\nonly half of our rule regarding error preservation. These opinions ignore\n\nthe other half of the rule requiring the parties to brief the issues in this\n\ncourt. In fact, the cases upon which Justice Mansfield’s opinion relies to\n\nsupport its proposition support the two-part rule. Granted, we examined\n\nissues in Martinek v.

However, a review of the\n\nappellate briefs in these cases, which are on file at the state law library,\n\nreveals that the parties on appeal briefed the alternate or additional\n\ngrounds upon which we relied.\n\n      Justice Mansfield’s opinion also relies on Erickson v. Erickson’s\n\nEstate, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">1393</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1920), for its proposition that we\n\f                                          77\n\ncan affirm on a ground raised in the trial court but not argued in this\n\ncourt. However, Erickson is but a relic of an earlier time. Although we\n\nhave never expressly overruled Erickson, it seems nearly a century of\n\ncase law has destroyed its precedential value.                       Surely Johnston\n\nEquipment Corporation and Voss articulate rules of error preservation\n\nthat have at the very least impliedly overruled Erickson.                   In reaching\n\nthese issues, Justice Mansfield’s opinion has effectively overruled the\n\nninety years of case law since Erickson and returned us to its archaic\n\nprinciple. After this decision, if an appellant wants to further inform the\n\ncourt as to its argument, it seems the appellant must expand upon every\n\nargument raised at the district court in its appellate brief, regardless of\n\nwhether the district court ruled in its favor on a particular issue and\n\nunprompted by any action by the appellee.                   Otherwise, the appellant\n\nrisks this court deciding an issue no party expected this court to decide.\n\nIn other words, every issue presented to the district court, no matter how\n\nirrelevant to its decision it may seem, becomes relevant on appeal.\n\n       Further,      neither   the   merits     of    the   plaintiffs’   constitutional\n\narguments      nor    the   sufficiency    of   the    pleadings     are inextricably\n\nintertwined with the issue of whether the plaintiffs’ claim sets forth a\n\npolitical question. 30      The district court decided the political question\n\n        30In special concurrences, members of this court urged the majority to abandon\n\nthe contact-sports exception when neither party so urged in their briefs. See Feld v.\nBorkowski, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">790</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81 (Iowa 2010) (Wiggins, J., specially concurring); id. at 82\n(Appel, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).

However, the majority\nrejected the arguments made in the special concurrences in Feld, and thus, the law of\nthis State required a party to brief and argue an issue in this court before we would\n\f                                          78\n\nissue without reference to the other issues concerning the education, due\n\nprocess, and privileges and immunities clauses of the Iowa Constitution.\n\nWe can and should do the same.\n\n       Justice Mansfield’s opinion may argue the parties raised these\n\nissues on appeal because they discussed them during oral argument.\n\nHowever, the opinion’s rationale that the parties preserved these issues\n\nfor our consideration on appeal fails for two reasons.                      First, on\n\nresubmission Justice Mansfield precipitated the references to these\n\nunbriefed issues by asking questions on these issues not raised in this\n\nappeal. 31 Justice Mansfield’s opinion cannot claim the parties preserved\n\nthese issues by raising them through questioning by the court. Second,\n\nour case law is unwavering in the proposition that we will not decide or\n\nconsider issues raised for the first time during oral argument. See Dilley\n\nv.

Their analysis regarding\n_______________________________\nconsider it on appeal. Even if the special concurrences in Feld were applicable in this\ncase, the merits of the issues reached by Justice Mansfield’s opinion and the concurring\nopinion of Chief Justice Cady were not inextricably intertwined with the political\nquestion issues raised by this appeal. The majority and special concurrences seem to\nsignal a shift in our error preservation rules.\n       31Within the first three minutes of the plaintiffs’ oral argument, Justice\nMansfield began asking questions about the equal protection clause.\n\f                                      79\n\nthe education clause, due process clause, and privileges and immunities\n\nclause of the Iowa Constitution are entirely their own.         For example,\n\nwhen discussing the merits of the plaintiffs’ claim under the education\n\nclause, Justice Mansfield’s opinion provides its own analysis of article IX,\n\ndivision 2, section 3 of the Iowa Constitution. This section provides, in\n\nrelevant part, “The General Assembly shall encourage, by all suitable\n\nmeans, the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural\n\nimprovement.” Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 2, § 3 (1857 original version).\n\n       Justice Mansfield’s opinion and the concurring opinion of Chief\n\nJustice Cady fail to consider article IX, division 1, section 12, which\n\nstates:\n\n       The Board of Education shall provide for the education of all\n       the youths of the State, through a system of Common\n       Schools and such school shall be organized and kept in each\n       school district at least three months in each year. Any\n       district failing, for two consecutive years, to organize and\n       keep up a school as aforesaid may be deprived of their\n       portion of the school fund.\n\nId. art. IX, div. 1, § 12.\n\n       Although the legislature abolished the board of education referred\n\nto in section 12 in 1864 and replaced it with the superintendent of\n\neducation, the predecessor to the present department of education, the\n\ncitizens of this state never repealed the substance of 1857 article IX,\n\ndivision 1, section 12. See 1864 Iowa Acts ch. 52 §§ 1–15. In fact, this\n\ncourt used the substantive provisions of article IX, division 1, section 12\n\nto integrate Iowa schools four years after the legislature abolished the\n\nboard of education. See Clark v. Bd. of Dirs., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 274 (1868)\n\n(quoting article IX, division 1, section 12 by stating “that provision shall\n\nbe made ‘for the education of all the youths of the State through a system\n\nof   common     schools,’    which   constitutional   declaration   has   been\n\f                                           80\n\neffectuated by enactments providing for the ‘instruction of youth between\n\nthe ages of five and twenty-one years’ ”). In Clark, the court recognized\n\nthe Iowa constitutional rights of all children to obtain an education and\n\nthat the education provided by the state must be provided equally to all\n\nchildren.

The analyses in Justice Mansfield’s opinion and\n\nthe concurring opinion of Chief Justice Cady of this important issue\n\nwithout allowing the parties to properly brief and argue it deprives the\n\nplaintiffs of their day in court. 32         As Justice Stevens of the Supreme\n\nCourt noted, “[T]he adversary process functions most effectively when we\n\nrely on the initiative of lawyers, rather than the activism of judges, to\n\nfashion the questions for review.” New Jersey v.

In doing so, these opinions fail to fully explore the\n\nparameters of the right to an education guaranteed by the Iowa\n\nConstitution. These opinions pick article IX, division 2, section 3 of the\n\nIowa Constitution to evaluate the merits of the case even though the\n\nparties did not brief or raise this section on appeal. To compound their\n\nmistake, these opinions fail to address the education clause found in\n\n\n       32Justice  Mansfield’s opinion and the concurring opinion of Chief Justice Cady\nignore this constitutional argument because it was not raised in the district court. To\nme, it is inconsistent to decide the case on appeal on issues and arguments that were\nnot raised below, but to deny the plaintiffs their day in court to develop all of their\narguments fully, including those arguments they could have made under article IX,\ndivision 1, section 12 of the Iowa Constitution. After all, the State did not appeal the\nmerits of this case. If these opinions had not reached beyond the arguments presented\nby the parties on appeal and we had decided this appeal in favor of the plaintiffs solely\non the issue of political question, it is logical to conclude the plaintiffs would have had\nthe opportunity to develop more fully their arguments in the district court on remand.\n\f                                     81\n\narticle IX, division 1, section 12 of the Iowa Constitution on the grounds\n\nthe parties did not raise it in the district court. In other words, to reach\n\na desired result, these opinions pick and choose which arguments to\n\nmake and which arguments not to make under their own error\n\npreservation rule. To me, it is inconsistent to decide the case on appeal\n\non issues and arguments the parties did not raise below, but to deny the\n\nplaintiffs their day in court to develop all of their arguments fully,\n\nincluding those arguments they could have made under article IX,\n\ndivision 1, section 12 of the Iowa Constitution.\n\n      These opinions also frame their own arguments regarding equal\n\nprotection and due process without the input of the attorneys on appeal\n\nand subsequently knock those arguments down to reach a desired result\n\nin this case. The fairest way to resolve these issues is not for the court to\n\npick and choose sua sponte which issues and arguments to decide and\n\nwhich to ignore, but rather to remand the case to the district court for\n\nthe parties to frame and fully brief all arguments relevant to this\n\nimportant issue.\n\n      An additional reason we do not decide issues raised for the first\n\ntime during oral argument is that it would be unfair to second-guess the\n\nstrategy of the State. It may have made a conscious decision not to raise\n\nthe alternative ground on appeal. See Fencl v. City of Harpers Ferry, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1718602\"><a href=\"/opinion/1718602/fencl-v-city-of-harpers-ferry/\"><span class=\"volume\">620</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 811–12 (Iowa 2000) (stating that “we may still affirm if there\n\nis an alternative ground, raised in the district court and urged on appeal,\n\nthat can support the court’s decision”). Maybe the State wanted to focus\n\nthe appeal on what it thought was its best chance for affirmance. By not\n\nurging an alternative ground on appeal, the State may have conceded\n\nthat it would not win on its motion to dismiss for failure to state a cause\n\nof action under our liberal notice pleading rules. It is possible the State\n\f                                     82\n\ndecided it wanted to win on a summary judgment instead of procedural\n\ngrounds.

We are not\n\nadvocates and should not usurp a party’s strategy.\n\n      The public has criticized this court for reaching out and deciding\n\nissues not raised or briefed on appeal. This is another case for the critics\n\nto add to their list. We cannot have a rule of law that we reach out and\n\ndecide an issue not briefed or pressed by the parties on appeal in order\n\nto achieve a desired result. Only time will tell if the court will apply this\n\nrule in a principled fashion or if the court will use it to achieve results\n\nfavored by the shifting majorities of the court. In particular, it would be\n\na most unfortunate development to see a liberal approach to preservation\n\nto deny individual rights, and a “gotcha” or cramped approach to\n\f                                       83\n\npreservation in order to avoid consideration of issues that would tend to\n\nvindicate individual rights.      See, e.g., Mulhern v.

Fitzgerald (RACI), </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1937110\"><a href=\"/opinion/1937110/racing-assn-of-central-iowa-v-fitzgerald/\"><span class=\"volume\">675</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Iowa 2004), without the\n\nbenefits of an appellate brief by the parties.

RACI, 675 N.W.2d at 7. Next, we decide if\n\nthis reason has a basis in fact. Id. at 8.\n\n      There is no way we can do a proper analysis under our existing law\n\nas to whether the reason for the disparity has a basis in fact without the\n\nplaintiffs’ evidence and arguments on the issue. It appears members of\n\nthe court want to overrule RACI.            It is their prerogative to do so.\n\nHowever, without the plaintiffs briefing the issue, members of the court\n\nare promoting their own agenda. It would have been nice if the plaintiffs\n\nhad weighed in on these issues.\n\n      There will be time enough to sort through the complicated issues\n\nin this case.     We do a disservice to the ordinary judicial process by\n\f                                      84\n\ndeciding this case without briefing in this court and without a fuller\n\ndevelopment in the district court.      As noted by the Missouri Supreme\n\nCourt in the context of an education case, “It is unwise for courts to\n\nshortcut procedural requirements necessary to fully and fairly address\n\nthe substantive issues in cases of great public significance, when those\n\nsame procedures would be required without pause in cases of lesser\n\nmagnitude.” Comm. for Educ.

In fact, I was unable to find any case dealing with a state’s\n\neducation clause that reached this important issue when the parties did\n\nnot brief it on appeal.\n\n      Justice Mansfield’s opinion also cites the political activity of the\n\nother branches of government as a reason to address the issues that\n\nwere not appealed.        I would answer the justification given by Justice\n\nMansfield’s opinion by noting the judicial branch is different from the\n\nother branches of government.        The legislative and executive branches\n\nset their own agenda and decide what issues they want to address. The\n\njudicial branch is different. We do not decide issues unless a party in a\n\nlegal action has raised the issues in the district court, has fully briefed\n\nthe issues on appeal, and has asked us to reach the issues on appeal. In\n\nshort, we do not set our own agenda.\n\n      We only decide issues raised and briefed by the parties.       To do\n\notherwise is nothing more than Justice Mansfield’s opinion and the\n\nconcurring opinion of Chief Justice Cady setting their own error\n\npreservation rules to reach issues not urged on appeal. Here, the State\n\ndid not brief the issues reached by Justice Mansfield’s opinion and the\n\nconcurring opinion of Chief Justice Cady in this appeal. Moreover, the\n\nState did not ask us to reach those issues. The mere fact the legislative\n\f                                    85\n\nand executive branches are dealing with education issues does not give\n\nthis court the license to weigh in on those issues.\n\n      This important case calls for judicial restraint.   Members of the\n\ncourt should not be espousing their own views on issues not raised or\n\nbriefed in this court. Accordingly, I would remand the case to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings on the constitutional claims.\n\n      Hecht and Appel, JJ., join this dissent.\n\f                                    86\n\n                                                  #08–2006, King v. State\n\nAPPEL, Justice (dissenting).\n\n      I respectfully dissent.\n\n      I concur with Justice Wiggins’s opinion. In light of the virtually\n\nunprecedented determination of Justice Mansfield’s opinion to reach out\n\nto uphold the district court on grounds other than those decided by the\n\ndistrict court and that the parties chose not to present on appeal, I\n\nproceed to state my views on why these alternative grounds do not\n\nprovide a basis for dismissal in this case at the very inception of the\n\nlawsuit.\n\n      In my view, education is a fundamental interest or right under the\n\nIowa Constitution. Deprivations of a basic or adequate education should\n\nbe subject to heightened judicial review, and other material differences in\n\neducation should be subject to judicial review under a meaningful\n\nrational basis test. I further believe the pleading, though not very clear,\n\nis sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss at this stage of the\n\nproceedings under our well-established liberal pleading rules.     I would\n\ntherefore reverse the district court and remand the case for further\n\nproceedings.\n\n      I. Overview of Plaintiffs’ Petition.\n\n      The plaintiffs in this case are from both rural and urban school\n\ndistricts alleging shortcomings in the education provided by the State.\n\nThey allege, among other things, that the State has failed to provide them\n\nwith “equal access to an effective education” and that the State has failed\n\n“to establish and maintain an adequate education delivery system.”\n\n      The plaintiffs’ petition in this case alleges the State’s educational\n\nrequirements and accreditation standards do not ensure that students\n\n“will be able to meet and exceed the technological, informational and\n\f                                    87\n\ncommunication demands of society so that they can be prepared for\n\nresponsible citizenship, further learning and productive employment in a\n\nglobal economy.” They claim that many Iowa students “are not prepared\n\nto enter the workforce or post-secondary education without additional\n\ntraining or remediation.”\n\n      The plaintiffs support their adequacy claim with various statistics.\n\nThey allege, for instance, that under the National Assessment of\n\nAcademic Progress standards, only thirty-three percent of Iowa fourth\n\ngrade students are proficient in math, and only thirty-seven percent of\n\nstudents are proficient in reading. It is alleged that similar proficiency\n\nlevels are achieved for eighth graders.\n\n      The plaintiffs also allege that the smallest school districts in Iowa\n\nare disadvantaged in that they have teachers with less experience and\n\nthat the teachers have nearly double the teaching assignments compared\n\nwith teachers in larger school districts. They also claim rural students\n\nhave far fewer curriculum units available to students. They allege that\n\nthere is a disparity in educational outcomes based upon where one lives.\n\n      The plaintiffs assert that the lack of adequate education violates\n\nthe education provisions of article IX of the Iowa Constitution; the\n\nprivileges and immunities clause of the Iowa Constitution; the due\n\nprocess clause of the Iowa Constitution; and statutory standards\n\nestablished in Iowa Code section 256.37, which declares that it is the\n\npolicy of the state “to provide an education system that prepares the\n\nchildren of this state to meet and exceed the technological, informational,\n\nand communications demands of our society.”           The plaintiffs seek\n\ndeclaratory relief as well as a writ of mandamus, and the district court\n\nwas urged to retain continuing jurisdiction for the purpose of enforcing\n\nits orders and judgments.\n\f                                        88\n\n      II. Historical Roles of National and State Government in\n\nEducating Children.\n\n      A. Introduction.        In order to provide the necessary context for\n\nconsideration of the constitutional issues raised in Justice Mansfield’s\n\nopinion (but not in the appellate briefs), I review the contrasting roles of\n\nthe state and national governments in the provision of education to\n\nchildren.    As will be seen below, although the national government\n\ntraditionally has supported education of children through land grants\n\nand financial assistance, the responsibility for providing education to\n\nchildren has been the duty of state and local governments.\n\n      B. The Limited Role of the National Government in the\n\nEducation of Children. The education of children had little to do with\n\nthe American Revolution. The grievances against King George III in the\n\nDeclaration of Independence had nothing to do with the education of\n\nchildren. The education of children was not mentioned in the Articles of\n\nConfederation or in the United States Constitution. The only mention of\n\neducation in the debates at the constitutional convention was a\n\nsuggestion by Madison and Pickney that Congress be expressly\n\nauthorized to establish a university, a proposal that was rejected. James\n\nMadison, Notes of Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787, at 477–78,\n\n639 (Bicentennial ed., W.W. Norton & Co., Inc. 1987); see Lawrence A.\n\nCremin, American Education: The National Experience 1783–1876, at 127\n\n(1980) [hereinafter Cremin].\n\n      The lack of discussion of education of children in revolutionary and\n\nconstitutional     contexts   does   not     mean   that    the   founders   were\n\nunconcerned about education.           The contrary is true.      From the very\n\nbeginning,   the    founders    were    advocates    of    expanding   children’s\n\neducation.\n\f                                    89\n\n       For example, Thomas Jefferson, while serving in the Virginia\n\nlegislature, was a fierce advocate of a Bill for the More General Diffusion\n\nof Knowledge, which would have established a system of free schools\n\nsupported by tuition and scholarships for poor boys. Ian C. Friedman,\n\nEducation Reform 8 (2004). In a letter to George Washington, Jefferson\n\nexplained it was axiomatic that liberty could never be safe but “in the\n\nhands of the people themselves, and that too of the people with a certain\n\ndegree of instruction.”     Gordon C. Lee, Learning and Liberty: The\n\nJeffersonian Tradition in Education, in Crusade Against Ignorance:\n\nThomas Jefferson on Education 19 (1961). “This,” Jefferson wrote, “is the\n\nbusiness of the state to effect, and on a general plan.” Id.\n\n       John Adams was the principal author of the Massachusetts\n\nConstitution of 1780.     As adopted, the Massachusetts Constitution of\n\n1780 provided, “Wisdom and knowledge, as well as virtue, diffused\n\ngenerally among the body of the people, being necessary for the\n\npreservation of their rights and liberties,” the legislature has a duty to\n\n“cherish” the interests of science and literature. Mass. Const. of 1780,\n\npt. II, ch. 5, § 2.\n\n       Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and\n\nmember of the Continental Congress, addressed the Pennsylvania\n\nlegislature with his essays, “A Plan for the Establishment of Public\n\nSchools and the Diffusion of Knowledge in Pennsylvania” and “Thoughts\n\nupon the Mode of Education Proper in a Republic.” Frederick M. Hess,\n\nThe Same Thing Over and Over: How School Reformers Get Stuck in\n\nYesterday’s Ideas 44 (2010).      Rush called for a free school in every\n\ntownship and universal education at public expense, reasoning that all\n\ncitizens, rich and poor, would have a role in selecting the nation’s leaders\n\f                                    90\n\nand that, as a result, everyone was entitled to at least a minimal amount\n\nof education in reading, writing, and arithmetic. Id. at 44–45.\n\n       Jefferson, Adams, and Rush had at least three things in common.\n\nFirst, they were advocates of education of children.    Second, they saw\n\neducation of children as linked to the successful operation of democratic\n\ngovernment. But for my purposes, the most important point is that they\n\nviewed the states as the governmental structure to deliver education to\n\ncitizens.\n\n       During the formative years of our country, the federal government\n\nsupported the education of children by providing resources to assist\n\nstate and local governments in providing education to citizens. First, the\n\nfederal government provided public land for school uses in the states\n\nthrough the Land Ordinance of 1785, which required land to be set aside\n\nfor school uses. 28 Journals of the Continental Congress 378 (May 20,\n\n1785). Second, in its organizations of the territories and admission of\n\nstates, Congress demanded educational progress.         In the Northwest\n\nOrdinance of 1787, Congress required public education to be “forever\n\nencouraged” in the covered territories.        Northwest Ordinance, 32\n\nJournals of the Continental Congress 340 (July 13, 1787). The federal\n\ngovernment itself, however, had no direct role in the education of\n\nchildren, but simply provided important financial support through land\n\ngrants to states and local governments who bore the responsibility of\n\nproviding education.\n\n       The encouragement of public education took on added meaning\n\nwhen a territory applied to become a state. Under Article IV, Section 4 of\n\nthe United States Constitution, Congress was empowered to admit states\n\nonly if they had a “Republican Form of Government.” U.S. Const. art. IV,\n\n§ 4.   As states were admitted to the Union, it became “a working\n\f                                    91\n\nassumption that public education was an essential feature of a\n\nrepublican government based upon the will of the people.” David Tyack,\n\nThomas James & Aaron Benavot, Law and the Shaping of Public\n\nEducation, 1785–1954, at 20 (1987).\n\n      Prominent antebellum education leaders such as Horace Mann of\n\nMassachusetts, Calvin Wiley of North Carolina, Caleb Mills of Indiana,\n\nSamuel Lewis of Ohio, John D. Pierce of Michigan, Robert Breckinridge of\n\nKentucky, Ninian Edwards of Illinois, Henry Barnard of Connecticut and\n\nRhode Island, and John Swett of California all recognized the role of the\n\nstates in providing education to children and youth. See David B. Tyack,\n\nTurning Points in American Educational History 125 (1967).           These\n\nprominent advocates of universal education sought to advance their\n\ncause not through pontifications in the halls of Congress, but in the local\n\nlyceum and through mechanisms of state and local government.\n\n      C. The Duty of State Government to Provide Education to\n\nChildren. In contrast to the limited role of the federal government, the\n\nstates had direct responsibility of providing education. The difference in\n\ninvolvement between the federal government and the state governments\n\non educational matters was a night and day contrast until very recently.\n\nFurther, education traditionally has been one of the most important\n\nfunctions of state government.           A brief survey of Iowa history\n\ndemonstrates these points.\n\n      While revolutionary leaders tended to emphasize education of the\n\nelite, the movement for universal education through common schools\n\nemphasizing republican virtues began in the early nineteenth century\n\nand was in full bloom during the 1830s as the movement for expanded\n\nsuffrage advanced. The focus of the common school movement was on\n\nstate and local governments. See generally Frederick M. Binder, The Age\n\f                                    92\n\nof the Common School, 1830–1865 (1974); Cremin; Carl F. Kaestle, Pillars\n\nof the Republic: Common Schools and American Society, 1780–1860\n\n(1983).\n\n      Even in the territorial days, the importance of education as a\n\nresponsibility of territorial government was recognized in Iowa. Governor\n\nHenry Dodge of the Wisconsin Territory (which included Iowa at the time)\n\nrecognized the relation between education and democratic government.\n\nIn his first inaugural address, Governor Dodge, in urging the territorial\n\nassembly to provide for the establishment of local academies for the\n\neducation of youth, spoke in obligatory terms:\n\n      It is a duty we owe to the rising generation to endeavor to\n      devise means to improve the condition of those that are to\n      succeed us; the permanence of our institutions, must\n      depend upon the intelligence of the great mass of the people.\n\n1 Benjamin F. Shambaugh, The Messages and Proclamations of the\n\nGovernors of Iowa 9 (1903) [hereinafter Shambaugh].\n\n      Once Iowa became a territory of its own apart from Wisconsin,\n\nRobert Lucas, the first Iowa territorial governor and a delegate of the\n1844 constitutional convention, was a strong advocate of education. In\n\nhis first message to the legislature of the Territory of Iowa, Lucas\n\naddressed education and particularly the need for a system of free\n\ncommon schools. John C. Parish, Iowa Biographical Series: Robert Lucas\n\n286 (1907) [hereinafter Parish].   Lucas stated: “There is no subject to\n\nwhich I wish to call your attention more emphatically, than the subject of\n\nestablishing, at the commencement of our political existence, a well\n\ndigested system of common schools.” 1 Shambaugh at 78; John Purcell\n\nStreet,   Iowa   Department   of   Public   Instruction:   Its   Origins   and\n\nDevelopment, 30 Annals of Iowa 397, 398 (1950) [hereinafter Street].\n\nLucas called on the territorial assembly to “build up a good system as\n\f                                    93\n\nfast as the population and wealth of the territory would warrant.”         1\n\nClarence Ray Aurner, History of Education in Iowa 368 (1914)\n\n[hereinafter Aurner]. The first territorial assembly responded to his call\n\nby enacting legislation calling for the establishment of common schools\n\nin school districts in the respective counties.     1 Edgar R. Harlan, A\n\nNarrative History of the People of Iowa 133 (1931) [hereinafter Harlan].\n\n      Yet, territorial government did not provide the ideal framework for\n\ndevelopment of a system of local education.       Advocates of statehood\n\nappealed to the parents of children, noting that lands reserved by the\n\nfederal government for education purposes could not be obtained without\n\nstatehood. James Alton James, Constitution and Admission of Iowa into\n\nthe Union 15 (1900). Once Iowa was admitted to statehood, Iowa received\n\na grant of five hundred thousand acres of land from the United States for\n\nschool purposes. George Chandler, Iowa and the Nation 17 (Chicago, A.\n\nFlanagan 1895).\n\n      It is thus not surprising that education was emphasized in the first\n\nIowa Constitutions. Article X of the constitutions of 1844 and 1846 dealt\n\nwith education.   The 1844 and 1846 constitutions provided that the\n\ngeneral assembly “shall encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion\n\nof intellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement” through\n\n“a system of common schools.” Iowa Const. art. X, §§ 2–3 (1846); Iowa\n\nConst. art. X, §§ 2–3 (1844). According to a contemporaneous account of\n\nthe 1846 constitutional convention:\n\n            Most ample provision is made for educating the rising\n      generation. This is a feature which cannot be too highly\n      prized.—It speaks volumes for the character of our\n      population, and argues well for the prosperity of the people\n      and the success of the great enterprise in which they are\n      about to embark.        Let the moral and mental culture\n      [unintelligible in original] and the free institutions of our\n      country will be safe in their hands.\n\f                                   94\n\nFragments of the Debates of the Iowa Constitutional Conventions of 1844\n\nand 1846, at 339 (Benjamin F. Shambaugh ed., 1900) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n      The inclusion of provisions in the early Iowa Constitutions related\n\nto education was not surplusage or cosmetic features.          One of the\n\nadvantages of statehood was the establishment of machinery to develop a\n\ncoherent educational system. Beginning with the admission of Ohio as a\n\nstate in 1803, Congress required that all subsequent states provide for\n\neducation in their state constitutions as a condition of admission to\n\nstatehood. Gerald Unks, The Illusion of Intrusion: A Chronicle of Federal\n\nAid to Public Education, 49 Educ. F. 133, 136 (1985). After 1815, only\n\nNew Mexico attempted to gain admission into the Union without an\n\neducation clause, and Congress refused to go along. New Mexico then\n\nadded an education clause and was subsequently admitted into the\n\nUnion. See Inst. for Educ. Equity & Opportunity, Education in the 50\n\nStates: A Deskbook of the History of State Constitutions and Laws about\n\nEducation 29 (2008).\n\n      The very first act of the First General Assembly of Iowa was a\n\nmeasure related to school funds, demonstrating the importance of\n\neducation to the fledgling state. 1 Aurner at 16–17. The importance of\n\nthe educational function of government is reflected by the fact that the\n\nChief Justice of the Iowa Supreme Court, Charles Mason, was a member\n\nof the first Iowa Board of Education. 2 Aurner at 415 n.105.\n\n      The state’s first Superintendent of Education, Thomas Hart\n\nBenton, Jr., a nephew of the famous Senator from Missouri, was a\n\nnational leader in the education movement, serving on the executive\n\ncommittee of the American Association for the Advancement of\n\nEducation.   Street, 30 Annals of Iowa at 400; Proceedings of the Fifth\n\f                                      95\n\nSession of the American Association for the Advancement of Education 3\n\n(New York, Hartford Press 1856).       Benton served as president of the\n\nEducation Convention of Iowa, which met in 1848 in the old stone capitol\n\nat Iowa City, “to promote by every laudable means the diffusion of\n\nknowledge in regard to education and especially to aid in establishing\n\nand perpetuating a system of common school instruction.”        Parish at\n\n286–87.    Benton later remarked in an 1861 report to the board of\n\neducation that “[a] wagon can better dispense with one wheel than a\n\nneighborhood with the school house.”       R.A. Harkness, Notes on Iowa\n\nEducational Work from 1860 to 1888, 12 Iowa Normal Monthly No. 7, at\n\n298 (1889).   One of Benton’s successors, Oran Fanville, remarked in\n\n1865 that “universal education is the central idea of republicanism.” Id.\n\nat 299.\n\n      Iowa’s early state governors, like Robert Lucas, were advocates for\n\neducation. In 1848, Governor Ansel Briggs recognized the constitutional\n\nsignificance of education, stating:\n      The people of Iowa have ever manifested an earnest and\n      commendable zeal in the spread of education, and,\n      especially, in the establishment of an efficient and\n      permanent system of Common Schools. Of such prominent\n      importance is this subject in their estimation, that they have\n      made the most ample provisions in the Constitution for the\n      spread of education and the support of common\n      schools . . . .\n\n1 Shambaugh at 370.\n\n      In 1852, Governor Hempstead, who was also a delegate of the 1844\n\nconstitutional convention, addressed education in his first biennial\n\nmessage to the Iowa legislature. He noted that “no subject can claim a\n\nmore pressing interest than that of public instruction.” Id. at 430. He\n\nfurther declared:\n      The first great object should be to place within the reach of\n      every child in the state, the opportunity of acquiring those\n\f                                    96\n       indispensable elements of education, which shall fit him for\n       the enlightened discharge of civil and social duties to which\n       he may be called.\n\nId. at 431. Governor Hempstead further emphasized the constitutional\n\nobligations of the state, noting that the Iowa Constitution required that\n\nthe general assembly encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of\n\nintellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement. Id.\n\n       In 1856, Governor James Grimes emphasized education in his\n\ninaugural address. Governor Grimes stated that “[t]o accomplish these\n\nhigh aims of government, the first requisite is ample provision for the\n\neducation of the youth of this State.” 2 Shambaugh at 7. He further\n\ndeclared that “[t]he State should see to it that the elements of education,\n\nlike the elements of universal nature, are above, around, and beneath\n\nall.” Id. Governor Grimes noted that “[i]t is agreed that the safety and\n\nperpetuity of our republican institutions depends upon the diffusion of\n\nintelligence among the masses of the people.” Id.\n\n       In 1856, the general assembly authorized the governor to appoint a\n\ncommission of three persons to revise and improve the school laws of\n\nIowa and to report to the general assembly. Street, 30 Annals of Iowa at\n\n402.   The commission was headed by Horace Mann, the President of\n\nAntioch College in Ohio and one of the most noted educators in the\n\nUnited States. Id. Mann strongly believed in the “[a]bsolute right to an\n\neducation of every human being that comes into the world, and which, of\n\ncourse, proves the correlative duty of every government to see that the\n\nmeans of that education are provided for all.” Serrano v. Priest, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1126695\"><a href=\"/opinion/1126695/serrano-v-priest/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1241</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1266 (Cal. 1971) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe commission investigated the state of education in other states and\n\nultimately issued a report containing its findings and recommendations.\n\n1 Aurner at 31.\n\f                                    97\n\n      The report of the Mann Commission declared that every youth was\n\nentitled to an education “in the elements of knowledge.”         Id. at 32.\n\nFurther, anyone desirous of further progress should be offered necessary\n\nopportunities. Id.   The report called for provision of common schools,\n\nhigh schools, and the university. Id. at 33. It called for supervision to be\n\nprovided by a state superintendent of public instruction, subject to the\n\nadvice of a state board of education.     Id. at 35.   Perhaps because of\n\nMann’s association with the state, a commentator two decades later\n\ndeclared that “Iowa may be called the Massachusetts of the West. . . .\n\n[T]he cause nearest the hearts of her people is ‘universal education.’ ”\n\nEditorial Preface, 12 Iowa Normal Monthly No. 7, at 1 (1889).\n\n      At the constitutional convention of 1857, considerable emphasis\n\nwas placed on education. Discussing education, James Wilson declared:\n      We know that after all the intelligence of the people is the\n      great bulwark to the stability and permanency of our\n      institutions, and looking upon it in that light, it is our duty,\n      our absolute and imperative duty, to provide the best\n      method and the best means for carrying into effect the\n      common school system of the state.\n\n2 The Debates of the Constitutional Convention of the State of Iowa 750\n\n(W. Blair Lord reporter, Davenport, Luse, Lane & Co. 1857) [hereinafter\nDebates],   available   at   http://www.statelibraryofiowa.org/services/\n\ncollections/law-library/iaconst/. Similarly, J.C. Hall asserted that “[t]he\n\neducational department of our State is a very important one. It embraces\n\none-half of the inhabitants of the State, and for good or for evil it is\n\nproductive of the most important effects upon our population.”           Id. at\n\n725. Further, George W. Ells urged:\n      [I]n laying the foundation for an educational system, we\n      must discard all narrow views and prejudices, and not only\n      provide for the wants of the present generation, but for all\n      future generations. I desire to see the common schools of\n\f                                    98\n      this State so constituted that a thorough knowledge of all the\n      natural sciences will be taught in the most practical manner.\n      Should this point be attained they will contrast most\n      favorably with the superficial education that characterizes a\n      vast number of graduates of chartered colleges of these\n      United States.\n\n1 Debates at 602.\n\n      In light of the emphasis the Iowa framers placed on education, two\n\ndivisions were adopted that dealt with the subject.      The first division\n\ndealt primarily with the responsibilities of a state board of education,\n\nwhich was vested with authority to oversee the development of public\n\neducation in the state. Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1 (1857 original version).\n\nThe second division related to financing of public education. Id. art. IX,\n\ndiv. 2.   With respect to the constitutional provision that “the General\n\nAssembly shall encourage, by all suitable means, the promotion of\n\nintellectual, scientific, moral, and agricultural improvement,” id. art. IX,\n\ndiv. 2, § 3, one scholar has noted that “[a]s a positive provision no clause\n\nhas had a wider application in popular benefits,” Harlan at 185. It is\n\nobserved that “[a]n educational system, based upon common schools . . .\n\nwas one of the cornerstones of the new commonwealth” and that Iowa\n\nwas taking a stand that at the time was distinctively “progressive.”\nHarlan at 185.\n\n      From 1857 to 1864, the state board of education performed its\n\nconstitutional duties.   In 1864, however, the newly elected governor,\n\nWilliam Stone, recommended abolition of the state board of education.\n\nGovernor Stone stated the purpose of creating the board of education\n\nwas to establish a permanent and satisfactory system of public education\n\nin Iowa. 3 Shambaugh at 7. Governor Stone urged the discontinuation\n\nof the board because the purpose had been accomplished. Id. In 1864,\n\f                                     99\n\nthe general assembly abolished the board of education and established a\n\nsuperintendent of public instruction. See 1864 Iowa Acts ch. 52, § 1.\n\n      Nothing in the historical record suggests that the abolition of the\n\nboard of education reflected a lessened constitutional commitment to\n\neducation. Experience under the 1857 constitution demonstrated that\n\nvesting legislative power over educational matters with the board, but the\n\npower of the purse with the general assembly, proved awkward at best.\n\nBut the commitment to education remained. According to a leading Iowa\n\nhistorian:\n\n      There was a belief so widespread as to be almost universal\n      that, narrow as were the powers of the State, instruction so\n      differed from all things else that every child in the\n      community was entitled to a chance at the public cost to\n      obtain the essentials of the thing called education.\n\nI George F. Parker, Iowa Pioneer Foundations 455 (1940).\n\n      Governors subsequently continued to be strong advocates for\n\neducation after the state board was abolished.         Governor Cyrus Clay\n\nCarpenter in his first inaugural address on January 11, 1872, stated in\n\nconnection with education that “[n]ext to political freedom, the most\n\nimportant element of a good government is an intelligent people.”         4\n\nShambaugh at 8. While recognizing the progress that had been made, he\n\ncalled for the establishment of a Normal School, or teachers college, to\n\ntrain teachers for their important task. Id. at 8–9.\n\n      The relationship between education and freedom was repeated by\n\nGovernor Buren Robinson Sherman in his January 12, 1882 inaugural\n\naddress. Governor Sherman declared:\n\n      The education of the masses is the surest reliance of the\n      State, and everywhere free schools exist. Through their\n      powerful enlightening influences and strong progression the\n      integrity of our political fabric, the security to the enterprise\n      of the citizen, and the equality and happiness of the people\n\f                                     100\n      are solidly assured. Popular education has become firmly\n      entrenched in the confidence of the nation, and there is no\n      feature of our whole system so near to the general heart, nor\n      regarded with such affectionate anxiety as the free public\n      schools of the country.\n\n5 Shambaugh at 241.\n\n      Further, Governor Sherman observed “our educational system”\n\nthrough all time “will prove the very sheet-anchor to our liberties, as the\n\nfree-ballot is the corner-stone to our political structure.” Id. at 242.\n\n      Governor William Larrabee took up education in his first inaugural\naddress on January 14, 1886. He declared, “If it is true, as I hold it to\n\nbe, that ignorance, poverty and crime are intimately related, it is the duty\n\nof every state to educate.”     6 Shambaugh at 14.       He noted that “[a]\n\nrepublic can survive war, famine and pestilence, but it cannot survive\n\nthe intelligence of its people.” Id. at 15.\n\n      In the Progressive Era, many educational reformers emphasized\n\nthe need to eliminate politics from education, develop a regime of experts,\n\nand offer highly differentiated education to youth based upon their ability\n\nand future role in society. It was an era of the “Education Commission.”\n\nIowa had three of them. A school commission in 1907 recommended,\n\namong other things, approval of curriculum by the superintendent of\n\npublic instruction.    Street, 30 Annals of Iowa at 445.         In 1911, the\n\n“Better Iowa Schools Commission” met and recommended increased\n\npower and efficiency in the department of public instruction, the\n\nemployment of a “rural school inspector” under the department of public\n\ninstruction, and that the office of superintendent of public instruction be\n\nconverted into a nonpartisan electoral post.       Id. at 446.    In 1939, a\n\nschool code commission reviewed the laws of Iowa and produced a\n\nreport; a second school code commission was convened in 1941 and\n\nproduced another report. Id. at 447–48. The latter code commissions\n\f                                       101\n\ncalled for strengthening the county administration of schools, that the\n\ncost of transporting pupils be paid in whole or in part by the state, that\n\none quarter of the cost of public school education should be paid from\n\nstate    funds   to   relieve   property   taxes   and   “equalize   educational\n\nopportunity,” and “[t]hat teachers be given greater security of tenure.”\n\nId. at 448–49.\n\n        While the philosophy of the progressive movement emphasized\n\ndifferent themes than the common school movement, the emphasis on\n\neducation as being critical to democratic values was a constant.             As\n\nnoted by Iowa Superintendent of Public Instruction P. E. McClenahan,\n\n“[e]ducation is a function of the state, and popular education is the only\n\nmeans of attaining social, political, and individual freedom.”             P. E.\n\nMcClenahan, Report of the Department of Public Instruction 9 (June 30,\n\n1922).\n\n        The emphasis on the need for quality education surfaced again in\n\nthe post WWII years. In September of 1954, President Eisenhower sent a\n\nletter to all state governors calling for statewide conferences on the\n\nstatus of education, and Iowa responded with a statewide conference in\n\nDes Moines in December 1954.           Letter from Dwight D. Eisenhower to\n\nGovernors (September 20, 1954) in Program from the Iowa State\n\nConference on Education (Dec. 9–10, 1954).               In the 1960s, Iowa’s\n\nDepartment of Public Instruction called for an “educational revolution,”\n\nnoting that education is no longer “a purely local concern” but “a state\n\nresponsibility.” Iowa Dep’t of Public Instruction, 63d Biennial Report 16\n\n(1966) (emphasis added). Governor Robert Ray in 1981–1982 served as\n\nchair of the Education Commission of the States, an organization\n\ndedicated to help states develop effective policies and practices in public\n\f                                         102\n\neducation.     See Education Commission of the States (Mar. 21, 2012),\n\nhttp://www.ecs.org.\n\n       In recent years, there has been what has been labeled a standards\n\nand accountability movement in education. In 1983, President Reagan’s\n\nDepartment of Education issued a report entitled, “A Nation at Risk: The\n\nImperative for Educational Reform,” which called for higher standards\n\nand more accountability in education generally.                In 1989, President\n\nGeorge    Bush     convened     a   meeting of      the    nation’s   governors     in\n\nCharlottesville, Virginia to address the perceived shortcomings in\n\neducation.     Recently, a summit on education was held attended by\n\nnational educational leaders and Iowa educators and administrators.\n\nGovernor Branstad, who has found inspiration in Robert Lucas’s\n\ntraditional commitment to education, 33 has proposed important changes\n\nto the Iowa education system, which will be the subject of public\n\ndiscussion and potential legislative action in the coming years.\n\n       This brief and nonexhaustive overview demonstrates that, in\n\ncontrast to the federal government, education has played a central role in\n\nIowa state government. While the federal government from time to time\n\nhas shown an interest in education and has been indirectly involved in\nfostering it, the states have performed the fundamentally different role of\n\nprimary provider of education.\n\n       From a historical perspective, the provision of education by Iowa\n\nstate government has been seen as one of its primary and most\n\ncelebrated functions. Recognition of the centrality and importance of the\n\nrole of state government in providing education has transcended our\n\n        33In his inaugural address in 1987, Governor Branstad, in calling for\n\neducational reform, stated that “our commitment to education is not new” and cited\n“our first territorial Governor, Robert Lucas.” 1987 S.J. 94. Governor Branstad further\nmade reference to the state’s “historic commitment to education.” Id. at 95.\n\f                                    103\n\npolitical parties and has been passed on from one generation of Iowa\n\npolitical leaders to another up to and including our present political\n\nleadership.\n\n\n      III. Relationship of Education to Democratic Government,\n\nPersonal Liberty, and Human Dignity.\n\n      The historical centrality of education to our state cannot be\n\nunderestimated.     In order to fully understand the importance of\n\neducation, however, a review of the three important functions of\n\neducation provides additional perspective.      First, education is vital to\n\ndemocratic government.        Second, education is a prerequisite for\n\nmeaningful enjoyment of fundamental constitutional rights, including\n\nenjoyment of “life, liberty, and property.” Third, it is an essential part of\n\nthe development of an autonomous personality that is a prerequisite for\n\nhuman dignity.\n\n      At the dawn of our nation, de Tocqueville recognized that “the\n\ninstruction of the people powerfully contributes to the support of a\n\ndemocratic process.” 1 Alexis de Tocqueville, Democracy in America 342\n\n(D. Appleton & Co. 1904). Thomas Mann emphasized that education can\n\nnever be less than such\n\n      “as is indispensable for the civil functions of a witness or a\n      juror; as is necessary for the voter in municipal and national\n      affairs; and finally, as is requisite for the faithful and\n      conscientious discharge of all those duties which devolve\n      upon the inheritor of a portion of the sovereignty of this great\n      republic.”\n\nMcDuffy v.

Grant further noted that if another contest of national\n\nexistence were to arrive in the future, it would be “between patriotism\n\nand intelligence on the one side, and superstition, ambition and\n\nignorance on the other.” Id. at 69–70.\n\n      The relationship of education to democratic government was\n\nrecognized by John W. Studebaker, a distinguished Iowan who served as\n\nDes Moines School Superintendent before being appointed United States\n\nCommissioner     of   Education.     Studebaker     observed   that   “good\n\ngovernment through democratic processes can be preserved . . . only by\n\ndefinitely planned development of the means of public enlightenment.”\n\nJohn W. Studebaker, The American Way: Democracy at Work in the\n\nDes Moines Forums 15–16 (1935).\n\n      The United States Supreme Court recognized the linkage between\n\neducation and democracy in San Antonio Independent School District v.\n\nRodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108751\"><a href=\"/opinion/108751/san-antonio-independent-school-dist-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108751\"><a href=\"/opinion/108751/san-antonio-independent-school-dist-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Rev.\n\n550, 606 (1992) [hereinafter Bitensky].\n\n      Certainly the parade of Iowa’s governors cited earlier would\n\nwholeheartedly endorse the concept that education is critically important\n\f                                       105\n\nto the functioning of democratic government.               Today, without an\n\neducated people, spectacle, celebrity culture, escalating emotional\n\noutburst, and demand for instant gratification will replace rationality,\n\ntolerance, and mutual respect in the voting booths and in the public\n\nsquare.\n\n      In addition, education is now critical to meaningful enjoyment of\n\nlife in Iowa and the United States.      The prospects of a person who is\n\nuneducated are now marginal at best.                Farming is increasingly\n\nindustrialized and requires knowledge of markets, fertilizers, hybrids,\n\nand planning techniques. Manufacturing jobs are no longer unskilled,\n\nbut require sophisticated knowledge, training, and skills. Ditches are no\n\nlonger dug by hand. If a citizen is to have a meaningful right to enjoy the\n\nconstitutionally protected interests in life, liberty, and property, the\n\ncitizen must have an adequate education. Justice Cardozo captured the\n\nidea in his typically lyrical prose:\n\n      “We are free only if we know, and so in proportion to our\n      knowledge. There is no freedom without choice, and there is\n      no choice without knowledge—or none that is not illusory.\n      Implicit, therefore, in the very notion of liberty is the liberty\n      of the mind to absorb and to beget.”\n\nBitensky, 86 Nw. U. L. Rev. at 550 (quoting Benjamin N. Cardozo, The\n\nParadoxes of Legal Science 104 (photo reprint 1982) (1928)).\n\n      The importance of education in empowering individuals to\n\nparticipate meaningfully in life did not escape school officials in Iowa\n\nsmall towns. For instance, the bold statement “Knowledge is Power” was\n\nemblazoned on the third story of a school house in Persia, Iowa in 1885.\n\nSee Camilla Dieber and Peggy Beedle, Country Schools for Iowa 9 (2002).\n\n      Finally,   education    is   essential   to   the   development   of   an\n\nautonomous individual that is the essence of human dignity.                  The\n\f                                          106\n\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, which has been ratified by the\n\nUnited States, declares that the right to education is a human right and\n\nthat the purpose of the human right is to provide for the “full\n\ndevelopment of the human personality.” Universal Declaration of Human\n\nRights, G.A. Res. 217 (III) A, art. 26, § 2, U.N. Doc. A/RES/217(III) (Dec.\n\n10, 1948). 34    As one commentator has noted, education “takes on the\n\nstatus of a human right because it is integral to and enhances human\n\ndignity through its fruits of knowledge, wisdom, and understanding” and\n\n“a prerequisite for individuals to function as fully human beings in\n\nmodern society.”       Richard Pierre Claude, The Right to Education and\n\nHuman Rights Education, in Human Rights in the World Community:\n\nIssues and Actions 211 (Richard Pierre Claude & Burns H. Veston eds.,\n\n3d ed. 2006). A lack of education severely undermines the capacity of\n\nthe individual to make meaningful life choices with respect to marriage\n\nand family, self-expression, political voice, religious observance, and\n\neconomic role and ambition. 35\n\n\n        34My citation to the education provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human\n\nRights has drawn criticism today. The criticism might more appropriately be aimed at\nEleanor Roosevelt, who chaired the drafting committee that produced the Declaration,\nor to the members of the United States Senate, which ratified it. I recognize that the\nDeclaration was designed to be nonbinding—indeed, the decision to use the term\n“Declaration” was modeled on the United States Declaration of Independence. Of\ncourse, I do not suggest that the participants in the Iowa constitutional conventions\nrelied on the Declaration, which was approved a hundred years later. I do suggest,\nhowever, that the Declaration reinforces the widely accepted view that education is\nbroadly regarded as a basic human right and that it is integrally related to the\ndevelopment of the individual. That point, it seems, has not been assailed.\n       35In  looking at legal questions from a broad perspective for nonbinding but\ninstructive lessons, I am in good company. The leaders of the American Revolution and\nthe founding fathers certainly did.

It is a one-of-a-kind interest.          It goes to the very heart of\n\ndemocratic government, to the essence of enjoyment of life itself, and to\n\nthe core of human dignity.                 Without education, our democratic\n\ngovernment will be undermined, the quality of life will deteriorate beyond\n\nrecognition, and the realization of autonomous personality required for\n\nhuman dignity will become virtually impossible.\n\n       IV. Overview of Iowa Constitutional Provisions.\n\n       A. Positive Educational Provisions of the Iowa Constitution.\n\nAs indicated above, the United States Constitution says nothing about\n\neducation.     This is not surprising since it was universally assumed by\n\n\n\n\n_______________________________\n        The framers of the Iowa Constitution applied a broad perspective to their task as\nwell, specifically in the field of education. George W. Ells, in debating the importance of\neducation during the 1857 constitutional convention, observed:\n       [I]n those countries of Europe where education has taken the deepest\n       root, and been the most generally diffused among the masses, that the\n       people are correspondingly steady, firm and abiding in their attachment\n       to free and liberal institutions of all kinds. The Germans are a striking\n       illustration of the truth of this assertion. With them, education is the\n       rule, and ignorance the exception; while with the volatile Frenchman, the\n       reverse is true.\n1 Debates at 602. It is not surprising that our caselaw has on occasion cited maxims or\nnorms of international law. See Langlas v. Iowa Life Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">717</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 718, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1714517\"><a href=\"/opinion/1714517/langlas-v-iowa-life-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 888 (1954) (citing international law treatise in case involving insurance\nclaim arising out of Korean war); Case v.

Its website states that international and\ncomparative law “provides an essential theoretical foundation for all lawyers by\naffording unique insight into the nature of law and legal process.” See The University of\nIowa College of Law, International and Comparative Law Program (last visited April 5,\n2012), http://www.law.uiowa.edu/international/.\n\f                                       109\n\nthe founders that the education of children and youth was the obligation\n\nof the state and local government.\n\n      Article IX of the Iowa Constitution of 1857 dealing with education\n\ncontains two divisions. The first division provides, among other things,\n\nthat “[t]he educational interest of the State, including Common Schools\n\n. . . shall be under the management of a Board of Education.”          Iowa\n\nConst. art. IX, div. l, § 1.   The board was required to “provide for the\n\neducation of all the youths of the State, through a system of Common\n\nSchools.” Id. art. IX, div. 1, § 12.\n\n      Article IX of the 1857 Iowa Constitution also contains a second\n\ndivision.   The first sentence of section three of the second division\n\nparallels the substantive provisions of the 1846 constitution by providing\n\nthat “[t]he General Assembly shall encourage, by all suitable means, the\n\npromotion     of   intellectual,   scientific,   moral,   and   agricultural\n\nimprovement.” Id. art. IX, div. 2, § 3.\n\n      The second sentence of section three is more complicated than the\n\nfirst sentence. It provides, in relevant part, that the federal funds, funds\n\nfrom estates with no heirs, and funds that the general assembly may\n\nprovide, “shall be inviolably appropriated to the support of Common\n\nschools throughout the State.” Id.\n\n      During the debates surrounding the education articles in the 1857\n\nconstitution, the convention rejected a proposal that schools should be\n\n“free of charge and equally open to all.” 2 Debates at 825. The reason\n\nfor this rejection, however, was not based on a view that education was\n\nnot fundamentally important, but instead to ensure that schools in Iowa\n\ncould be racially segregated. Mr. Gillaspy, an opponent to the provision,\n\ndeclared that “[i]f the people of this state are disposed to appropriate\n\nmoney for the education of the blacks, let them do it in separate and\n\f                                   110\n\ndistinct schools . . . .” Id. In response, William Penn Clark declared that\n\n“our duty goes for providing every child in the State with an education.”\n\nId. at 826.    Eventually, a substitute amendment was offered that\n\nprovided “for the education of all the youths of the state, through a\n\nsystem of common schools.” Id. at 935. Thus, while the rejection of the\n\nproposed provision that schools be “free of charge and equally open to\n\nall” demonstrates the racial prejudices held by some members of the\n\nconstitutional convention, it does not in any way undercut the\n\nimportance the Iowa framers placed on accessible public education\n\ngenerally.\n\n      Article IX, division one, section fifteen provided the general\n\nassembly with an escape from vesting responsibility for education in the\n\nhands of an independent board of education. Under section fifteen, the\n\ngeneral assembly was vested with the power after 1863 “to abolish or re-\n\norganize said Board of Education, and provide for the educational\n\ninterest of the State in any other manner that to them shall seem best\n\nand proper.”   Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1, § 15.   In 1864, the general\n\nassembly did just that.    As a result, the constitutional provisions of\n\narticle IX, division one, section one, vesting the power to provide\n\neducation in the board of education have no current effect.\n\n      The question arises what we should make of the action of the\n\ngeneral assembly abolishing the board of education. It is clear that the\n\naction renders inoperative the constitutional provisions vesting power\n\nover education with the board of education, including the provision that\n\n“[t]he Board of Education shall provide for the education of all the youths\n\n. . . through a system of Common Schools.” See id. art IX., div. 1, § 12\n\n(emphasis added).    While the board’s constitutional duty to maintain\n\ncommon schools was clearly repealed, the duty of the state to “provide for\n\f                                     111\n\nthe educational interest,” which by definition included “Common\n\nSchools,” was not affected. See id. art. IX, div. 1, §§ 1, 15.\n\n      That the only effect of the legislative abolition of the board of\n\neducation was to shift responsibilities for the provision of education as\n\nrequired by article IX is demonstrated by the case of Clark v. Board of\n\nDirectors, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Iowa</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1868). Clark, which was decided four years after\n\nthe abolition of the board, addressed the validity of racial segregation in\n\nIowa public schools. Clark, 24 Iowa at 269–70. In concluding that racial\n\nsegregation in public schools was unlawful, we cited and relied upon\n\narticle IX, division 1, section 12, which provides that the board of\n\neducation shall provide “ ‘for the education of all the youths of the State,\n\nthrough a system of common schools.’ ” Id. at 274 (quoting Iowa Const.\n\nart. IX, div. 1, § 12). Clearly, the 1864 abolition of the board of education\n\ndid not affect the substantive requirements contained in article IX, but\n\nmerely shifted authority by abolishing the board and creating a\n\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction.

IX, div. 1, § 12)).\n\n      The ongoing obligation of the state is also reflected in the language\n\nof article IX, sections one and fifteen, but also demonstrated by the\n\f                                    112\n\nprovisions of article IX, division two, section three, which provides for a\n\n“perpetual fund” that is “inviolably appropriated to the support of\n\nCommon schools throughout the State.” Iowa Const. art.

See id.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n      Thus, the Iowa Constitution requires a system of common schools\n\nto educate all youths throughout the state, but in terms of the\n\nmanagement of such common schools, it allows the general assembly to\n\n“provide for the educational interest of the State” in a manner other than\n\nthrough the board of education. See id. art. IX, div. 1, § 15. After 1863,\n\nthe legislature was free to choose to manage its common schools through\n\na superintendent of public instruction, a department of education, a\n\ncommittee of scholars, or in “any other manner that to them shall seem\n\nbest and proper.” See id.\n\n      The explicit Iowa constitutional provisions related to “provid[ing]\n\nfor the education of all the youths of the State, through a system of\n\nCommon Schools” and advancing “the educational interest of the State,\n\nincluding Common Schools,” stand in stark contrast to the complete lack\n\nof explicit provisions in the United States Constitution related to\n\neducation and reflect the fundamentally different traditional roles of state\n\nand federal governments when it comes to the education of children and\n\nyouth. The Federal Constitution is generally a limited constitution with\n\nthe federal government only granted powers specifically authorized. In\n\ncontrast, the states have plenary legislative authority and have positive\n\ncommitments in the constitutional frameworks.         In Iowa, one of the\n\npositive commitments in the Iowa Constitution is to the educational\n\f                                           113\n\nmission.

These\n\f                                      119\n\ncases set the stage for a more detailed analysis of the rich sources of\n\nstate constitutional law regarding educational issues.\n\n       The survey will show that, even if this court were to apply the\n\nSan Antonio     framework    for    determining     whether   an   interest    is\n\n“fundamental” for equal protection purposes, such a fundamental\n\ninterest would be present in light of the explicit Iowa constitutional\n\nprovisions related to education. Further, the survey will show that, while\n\nthe cases are divided, many state supreme courts have found a\n\nfundamental interest in education because of the strong historical role of\n\nstate government in providing education to children and because of the\n\ncritical functional role of education in a democratic government.\n\n       B. The California State Supreme Court Decision in Serrano I.\n\n       1. Introduction. The first major case to consider a challenge to a\n\nstate system of education on equal protection grounds was Serrano I. In\n\nSerrano    I,   school   children    and    their   parents   challenged      the\n\nconstitutionality of public school financing in the State of California.\n\nSerrano I, 487 P.2d at 1244.        The plaintiffs claimed that reliance on\n\nproperty taxes to fund public schools caused substantial disparities in\n\nthe quality and nature of educational opportunities available to them. Id.\n\nThe district court granted the defendants’ demurrer (motion to dismiss)\n\nand the plaintiffs appealed. Id. at 1245.\n\n       2. California’s education clause. The Serrano I court rejected the\n\nclaim that California’s funding of public schools violated the education\n\nclause of the California Constitution. Id. at 1249; see Cal. Const. art. IX,\n\n§ 5.   The court held that while California was required to maintain a\n\n“system” of common schools, a “system” of common schools meant only a\n\nprescribed course of study and educational progression from grade to\n\ngrade. Serrano I, 487 P.2d at 1248–49. The Serrano I court reasoned\n\f                                    120\n\nthat the education clause, standing alone, did not require equality of\n\nspending. Id.\n\n      3. Equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.                 The\n\nSerrano I court next turned to the claim that California’s education\n\nsystem   violated   the   Equal   Protection   Clause   of   the    Fourteenth\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">169</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1966), the court concluded that the reliance on\n\nproperty taxes that produced financial disparities available to school\n\ndistricts amounted to a classification based upon wealth of the district.\n\nSerrano I, 487 P.2d at 1250. The court rejected the state’s argument that\n\nbecause the discrimination was based on district wealth, no equal\n\nprotection claim could be brought. Id. at 1251–52. The court further\n\nconcluded that when a classification was based on wealth, no allegation\n\nof purposeful or intentional discrimination was required. Id. at 1253–55.\n\nThe court noted that in Harper, the poll tax was neutral on its face but\n\nwas clearly discriminatory in effect. Id. at 1254. The court further noted\n\nthat while the United States Supreme Court had not yet weighed in on\n\nthe issue, the California Supreme Court had previously held that de facto\n\nracial segregation violated the Fourteenth Amendment.              Id. at 1255\n\n(citing S.F. Unified Sch. Dist. v.

Serrano I, 487 P.2d at\n\n1255–59. The court noted that education plays an indispensible role in\n\nmodern industrial society in two respects. Education, according to the\n\ncourt, “is a major determinant of an individual’s chances for economic\n\f                                     121\n\nand social success.” Id. at 1255–56. Second, education has “a unique\n\ninfluence on a child’s development as a citizen and his participation in\n\npolitical and community life.”       Id. at 1256.     The court compared\n\neducation with other fundamental rights such as the right to have a free\n\ntranscript or a court appointed lawyer.       Id. at 1257–58.     The court\n\nconcluded that education compared favorably in importance.                Id.\n\nAccording to the court, education, aside from reducing the crime rate,\n\nsupports “each and every other value of a democratic society—\n\nparticipation, communication, and social mobility, to name but a few.”\n\nId. at 1258 (citing the seminal work of John E. Coons, William H. Clune\n\nIII & Stephen D. Sugarman, Educational Opportunity: A Workable\n\nConstitutional Test for State Financial Structures, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 305\n\n(1969)).\n\n        Having determined that the financing scheme in California\n\ndiscriminated against school districts on the basis of wealth and affected\n\nfundamental interests, the Serrano I court proceeded to apply a\n\ncompelling state interest standard to determine its validity.     Serrano I,\n\n487 P.2d at 1259–63.       Not surprisingly, the court found the scheme\n\ninvalid under the demanding test. Id. at 1263. The court rejected the\n\nasserted state interest of local control, noting that local control could be\n\npreserved regardless of the method of financing public education. Id. at\n\n1260.      With respect to the claim that the system encouraged\n\ndecentralized decision making at the local level, the court found that\n\n“such fiscal freewill is a cruel illusion for the poor school districts.” Id.\n\nAccording to the court,\n        so long as the assessed valuation within a district’s\n        boundaries is a major determinant of how much it can spend\n        for its schools, only a district with a large tax base will be\n        truly able to decide how much it really cares about\n        education.\n\f                                     122\n\nId.   A poor district, according to the court, cannot tax itself into an\n\nexcellence that its tax rolls cannot provide. Id.\n\n       4. Privileges   and   immunities    and    uniformity   clauses   of   the\n\nCalifornia Constitution. While the Serrano I court focused primarily on\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, footnote\n\neleven of the opinion indicated that a violation of the California\n\nConstitution article I, sections 11 and 21 were also present. Id. at 1249\n\nn.11. Section 11 provided that “ ‘[a]ll laws of a general nature shall have\n\na uniform operation,’ ” while section 21 provided that “ ‘[n]o special\n\nprivileges or immunities shall ever be granted . . . nor shall any citizen,\n\nor class of citizens, be granted privileges or immunities which, upon the\n\nsame terms, shall not be granted to all citizens.’ ” Id. (quoting article I,\n\nsections 11 and 21 of the California Constitution). The Serrano I court\n\nobserved in the footnote that ordinarily the court construed these state\n\nprovisions as “ ‘substantially the equivalent’ of the equal protection\n\nclause of the Fourteenth Amendment.”             Id. (quoting Dep’t of Mental\n\nHygiene v. Kirchner, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">321</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 322 (Cal. 1965)).\n\n       5. Summary.        As a result, the Serrano I court reversed the\n\ndismissal of the action by the trial court primarily on federal\n\nconstitutional grounds.      On remand, the court stated that the district\n\ncourt should engage in further proceedings, and if it entered judgment\n\nagainst the defendants, it could do so “in such a way as to permit an\n\norderly transition from an unconstitutional to a constitutional system of\n\nschool financing.” Id. at 1266.\n\n       C. Federal Developments: San Antonio.\n\n       1. Introduction.    The United States Supreme Court took up the\n\nissue of disparities of education in San Antonio.        In this case, school\n\nchildren and their parents brought a class action on behalf of all children\n\f                                     123\n\nwho live in school districts with low property valuations attacking the\n\nTexas method of financing public education.      Rodriguez v. San Antonio\n\nIndep. Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 281 (W.D. Tex. 1971).\n\n      After a trial in which testimony and documentary evidence was\n\npresented, a three judge panel of district court judges, relying in part on\n\nSerrano I, concluded that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that the Texas\n\nscheme of financing public education violated the Equal Protection\n\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Id. Noting that wealthy school\n\ndistricts had more educational options than poorer ones, the district\n\ncourt concluded that “the quality of public education may not be a\n\nfunction of wealth, other than the wealth of the state as a whole.” Id. at\n\n284. By a narrow 5–4 margin, the United States Supreme Court reversed\n\nthe district court.   San Antonio, 411 U.S. at 6, 93 S. Ct. at 1282, 36\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 27.\n\n      2. Focus of San Antonio: Does strict scrutiny apply to parity claims\n\nunder the Equal Protection Clause? In an opinion by Justice Powell, the\n\nSan Antonio majority first concluded that the plaintiffs failed to make a\n\nshowing of wealth discrimination sufficient to trigger strict scrutiny. Id.\n\nat 22–23, 93 S. Ct. at 1291, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 36–37. The San Antonio\n\nmajority concluded that the class of persons in the school districts\n\nattended by plaintiffs was ill defined. Id. Although the school districts\n\ngenerally had less wealth, students within the school districts were not\n\nuniformly poor. Id. According to the San Antonio majority, there was no\n\nbasis in the record to conclude that the poorest people were concentrated\n\nin the poorest districts. Id. at 23, 93 S. Ct. at 1291, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 37\n\n(emphasis added). As a result, the class of plaintiffs was not sufficiently\n\nrelated to wealth to trigger strict scrutiny.\n\f                                          124\n\n       In reaching its conclusion, the San Antonio majority noted that no\n\nclaim had been made that the plaintiffs suffered “an absolute deprivation\n\nof the desired benefit.” Id. The San Antonio majority emphasized that\n\n“the Equal Protection Clause does not require absolute equality or\n\nprecisely equal advantages.” Id. at 24, 93 S. Ct. at 1291, 36 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n37.   The San Antonio majority further observed that Texas authorities\n\nasserted the plaintiffs were receiving an “adequate” education and that\n\n“[n]o proof was offered at trial persuasively discrediting or refuting the\n\nState’s assertion.” 37 Id. at 24, 93 S. Ct. at 1292, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 38.\n\n       In contrast to the California Supreme Court in Serrano I, the San\n\nAntonio majority also determined that while education was an important\n\ninterest, it did not amount to a fundamental interest under the Federal\n\nConstitution.     Citing Brown, the San Antonio majority recognized “the\n\nvital role of education in a free society.” Id. at 30, 93 S. Ct. at 1295, 36\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 41.

Green & Bruce D. Baker, Circumventing Rodriguez: Can Plaintiffs\nUse the Equal Protection Clause to Challenge School Finance Disparities Caused by\nInequitable State Distribution Policies?, 7 Tex. F. on C.L. & C.R. 141, 150 (2002) (noting\nunresolved question of federal law).\n\f                                    125\n\n      In order to cabin the fundamental rights doctrine, the San Antonio\n\nmajority held that a fundamental right under the Federal Equal\n\nProtection Clause is one that is explicitly or implicitly afforded protection\n\nin the United States Constitution.        Id. at 33, 93 S. Ct. at 1297, 36\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 43. Fundamental rights under the Federal Constitution thus\n\ndo not arise from an “ad hoc determination as to the social or economic\n\nimportance of that right.” Id. at 32, 93 S. Ct. at 1296, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 42.\n\n      The San Antonio majority’s test of what amounts to a fundamental\n\ninterest is noteworthy because it highlights the difference between\n\nFederal and State Constitutions.      Under the test of the San Antonio\n\nmajority, it is clear that education is not a fundamental interest under\n\nthe Federal Constitution because nowhere is education explicitly or\n\nimplicitly mentioned in the text. The opposite, of course, is true of state\n\nconstitutions, which routinely contain explicit constitutional provisions\n\nrelating to education that invariably include a duty to provide education\n\nto its citizens.    A state court desiring to follow the San Antonio\n\nformulation for determining whether an interest is fundamental would be\n\ncompelled to find such an interest in light of the prominent and explicit\n\nrole of education in the state constitution.\n\n      As in its discussion regarding the question of whether the plaintiffs\n\ndemonstrated discrimination on the basis of wealth, the San Antonio\n\nmajority emphasized in its discussion of fundamental interests that\n\n“[e]ven if it were conceded that some identifiable quantum of education is\n\na constitutionally protected prerequisite to the meaningful exercise of\n\neither right” there was no indication in the record that the present level\n\nof expenditures in the schools which the plaintiffs attended fell short. Id.\n\nat 36–37, 93 S. Ct. at 1298–99, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 45. The San Antonio\n\nmajority noted that “no charge fairly could be made that the system fails\n\f                                     126\n\nto provide each child with an opportunity to acquire the basic minimum\n\nskills necessary for the enjoyment of the rights of speech and of full\n\nparticipation in the political process.” Id. at 37, 93 S. Ct. at 1299, 36\n\nL. Ed. 2d at 45.\n\n      3. Impact of federalism and deference to states. The San Antonio\n\nmajority noted that “a century of Supreme Court adjudication under the\n\nEqual Protection Clause affirmatively supports” the application of a\n\nrational basis test to the Texas educational finance structure. Id. at 40,\n\n93 S. Ct. at 1300, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 47. The San Antonio majority stressed\n\nthat the field of taxation had been a traditional area of deference. Id.\n\nFurther, the San Antonio majority recognized that the field of education\n\ninvolved a number of complex issues that ordinarily should be left to the\n\nlegislative process. Id. at 42–43, 93 S. Ct. at 1301–02, 36 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n48–49.\n\n      Any Supreme Court review of legislation involves deference issues,\n\nand many constitutional questions before the Court can be quite\n\ncomplex.   What made the case especially troubling to the San Antonio\n\nmajority was the strong federalism concerns underlying its conclusion\n\nthat strict scrutiny of state school finance laws was inappropriate. The\n\nSan Antonio majority noted the implications of the case for the\n\nrelationship between national and state power under the federal system.\n\nId. at 44, 93 S. Ct. at 1302, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 49. The San Antonio majority\n\ndeclared “it would be difficult to imagine” a case with greater impact on\n\nthe federal system than the case before the Court in which the Court is\n\nurged to “abrogate systems of financing public education presently in\n\nexistence in virtually every State.” Id.\n\n      4. Application of rational basis test.   After determining that the\n\nproper standard of review was the traditional rational basis standard, the\n\f                                     127\n\nSan Antonio majority proceeded to consider the merits of the plaintiffs’\n\nclaim.      The three judge district court had concluded based on a\n\nsubstantial record that the Texas system failed even “to establish a\n\nreasonable basis” for a system that results in different levels of per pupil\n\nexpenditure. Rodriguez, 337 F. Supp. at 284.\n\n         The San Antonio majority disagreed with the district court,\n\nconcluding that local control provided a sufficient rational basis for the\n\nfunding scheme. The San Antonio majority emphasized that the Texas\n\nsystem of school finance assured “a basic education” for every child in\n\nthe state. San Antonio, 411 U.S. at 49, 93 S. Ct. at 1305, 36 L. Ed. 2d at\n\n52.   Local control, according to the San Antonio majority, is vital to\n\ncontinued public support for education, and it means the freedom to\n\ndevote more funds to education through local taxes.       Id. at 49–50, 93\n\nS. Ct. at 1305, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 52. The San Antonio majority noted that\n\nwhile poor school districts had reduced ability to make free decisions\n\nregarding how much they spend on education, they still “retain under\n\nthe present system a large measure of authority as to how available\n\nfunds will be allocated.” Id. at 51, 93 S. Ct. at 1306, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 53.\n\nThe state’s interest in maintenance of local control in education thus\n\nsatisfied the rational basis test under the Federal Equal Protection\n\nClause.\n\n         5. Dissents.   The majority opinion in San Antonio drew dissents\n\nfrom Justices Brennan, White, and Marshall.              Justice Brennan\n\nchallenged the holding of the majority that education did not amount to\n\na fundamental interest. He noted that education was inextricably linked\n\nto constitutional rights of voting and free speech and that, as a result,\n\neducation amounted to a fundamental interest for purposes of equal\n\f                                        128\n\nprotection. Id. at 62–63, 93 S. Ct. at 1312, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 60 (Brennan,\n\nJ., dissenting).\n\n      Justice White attacked the majority’s conclusion that local control\n\njustified the Texas finance scheme. Id. at 64–65, 93 S. Ct. at 1312–13,\n\n36 L. Ed. 2d at 61–62 (White, J., dissenting).             He asserted that while\n\nlocal control might be a valid state interest, the means chosen by Texas\n\ndid not advance it. Specifically, Justice White noted that districts with a\n\nlow tax base did not have an effective local option choice of increasing\n\nfunds available for education. Id. He further concluded that a class was\n\nobviously present for equal protection purposes, namely, the persons\n\nwho find themselves in a low property value school district. Id. at 69, 93\n\nS. Ct. at 1315, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 64.\n\n      Justice      Marshall,   joined   by     Justice   Douglas,   provided     the\n\nlengthiest dissent.     He found it an inescapable fact that if one school\n\ndistrict has more funds available per pupil than another, the former will\n\nhave a greater choice in educational planning than the latter. Id. at 83–\n\n84, 93 S. Ct. at 1322, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 72 (Marshall, J., dissenting). He\n\nattacked the majority’s notion that Texas provided an “adequate”\n\neducation, noting that the Court had never before suggested that\n\nbecause    some      “adequate”   level   of    benefits    is   provided   to   all,\n\ndiscrimination in the provision of services is acceptable.

He rejected the rigidified tiered\n\napproach to equal protection, calling instead for the adoption of a more\n\nflexible test that balanced the interests of the party challenging the\n\nclassification against the state’s purported interest in sustaining the\n\nstatute. Id. at 98–110, 93 S. Ct. at 1330–36, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 81–88. In\n\nany event, Justice Marshall concluded that education certainly was a\n\n“fundamental” interest in light of its unique status in society and its\n\f                                   129\n\nnexus with other protected constitutional rights. Id. at 111, 93 S. Ct. at\n\n1336–37, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 88.\n\n      6. Summary.     The San Antonio majority rejected a federal equal\n\nprotection claim when the plaintiff sought parity in educational\n\nexpenditures. The San Antonio majority was particularly concerned that\n\nif strict scrutiny would apply to such sweeping claims, thousands of\n\nstate statutes would be invalidated.     The Court expressly reserved the\n\nquestion, however, of whether strict scrutiny would apply where a state\n\ndeprived children of an adequate education.\n\n      Further, the San Antonio Court adopted a standard for determining\n\nwhether an asserted interest or right is fundamental. While not binding\n\non a state court, the methodology, if followed, would lead to the\n\nconclusion that education, which is the subject of explicit state\n\nconstitutional provisions, is a fundamental interest for equal protection\n\npurposes.\n\n      D. The California State Court Response: Serrano II.             After\n\nSan Antonio, the California Supreme Court in Serrano v. Priest, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1148513\"><a href=\"/opinion/1148513/serrano-v-priest/\"><span class=\"volume\">557</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Cal. 1976) (Serrano II), was asked to reconsider its decision that the\n\nCalifornia system of financing education was constitutionally infirm.\n\nDuring the trial proceedings resulting from Serrano I, San Antonio was\n\ndecided. The trial court, however, concluded that the financing scheme\n\nviolated the privileges and immunities and uniform laws clauses of the\n\nCalifornia Constitution.   Serrano II, 557 P.2d at 931.   The defendants\n\nappealed. Id.\n\n      In Serrano II, the California Supreme Court declined to follow\n\nSan Antonio in its interpretation of the state constitution.   Id. at 951.\n\nThe Serrano II court emphasized that while the state equal protection\n\nprovisions were “substantially the equivalent” of the guarantees of the\n\f                                          130\n\nFourteenth Amendment, they possessed “an independent vitality which,\n\nin a given case, may demand an analysis different from that which would\n\nobtain if only the federal standard were applicable.”               Id. at 950.     The\n\nSerrano II court noted that considerations of federalism, which played an\n\nimportant part in San Antonio, had no application to the judgment of a\n\nstate supreme court. Id. at 948–49. Further, while the Serrano II court\n\ndid not claim expertise on school financing, it noted it had the benefit of\n\n4000 pages of testimonial transcript, replete with the opinions of experts,\n\nand exhaustive findings of the district court. Id. at 952. In determining\n\nwhether a right is “fundamental” for purposes of the California equal\n\nprotection clause, the Serrano II court rejected the San Antonio test. Id.\n\nInstead, the Serrano II court declared that it would determine which\n\nlegislative classifications were subject to strict scrutiny based upon the\n\nimpact on those rights and liberties which “lie at the core of our free and\n\nrepresentative form of government.” Id.\n\n       E. Subsequent Education Cases Based on State Constitutions.\n\n       1. Overview of state court cases subsequent to San Antonio. After\n\nSerrano I, San Antonio, and Serrano II, a significant number of states\n\nconsidered challenges to state schemes of providing education. Plaintiffs\n\nchallenging state educational frameworks in state courts generally\n\nlaunched double-barreled attacks. 38            First, plaintiffs claimed that the\n\n       38See, e.g., Op. of the Justices, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1113751\"><a href=\"/opinion/1113751/opinion-of-the-justices/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 112 (Ala. 1993); Roosevelt\nElementary Sch.

Analysis of education clauses in state constitutions.                       As\n\nindicated above, nearly all of the state constitutions contain provisions\n\nrelated to education. The clauses come in a number of shapes and sizes\n\nthat have been categorized by commentators. Some of the clauses are\n\ncharacterized as “weak,” while others are thought to be more robust. 46\n\n        A significant number of constitutions that require the legislature to\n\nprovide for a “thorough and efficient,” “liberal,” “general and uniform,”\n\n“general, suitable, and efficient,” “a system of free common schools,” or\nan “efficient” system of schools, have been held to provide the basis for a\n\njudicially enforceable mandatory obligation to provide children with a\n\ncertain level or quality of education. 47 One court, however, has found\n\n\n        45See,e.g., Ex parte James, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1885183\"><a href=\"/opinion/1885183/ex-parte-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">836</span> <span class=\"reporter\">So. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">813</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 819 (Ala. 2002); Comm. for Educ.\nRights, 672 N.E.2d at 1193; Neb.

Overview of state education cases considering challenges based\n\non substantive due process. At least one court has considered challenges\n\nto state educational frameworks based on substantive due process under\n\nstate constitutions.

Issues arising in state education cases based on state equal\n\nprotection clauses. In state education cases arising under state privileges\n\nand immunities or state equal protection challenges, several issues\n\nrepetitively appear in the cases.           They include the standard of review,\n\nwhether a party attacking an education scheme must show intentional\n\ndiscrimination, and whether the plaintiffs have identified a class\n\nsufficient to support an equal protection claim.\n\n         A critical issue is the standard of review. A significant number of\n\nstate supreme court cases have found that education gives rise to a\n\nfundamental interest under state constitutions. These cases reach this\n\nresult in a number of ways.                  Some of them explicitly adopt the\n\nfundamental interest framework advanced in San Antonio and find that\n\nbecause education is expressly or impliedly rooted in their state\n\nconstitutions, it arises to a fundamental interest for equal protection\n\npurposes. See Washakie Cnty. Sch. Dist. No. One v. Herschler, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1145115\"><a href=\"/opinion/1145115/washakie-cty-sch-dist-no-one-v-herschler/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">310</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 (Wyo. 1980). Others depart from the San Antonio framework\n\nand either apply a more generous test, finding a fundamental interest\n\nbased on the underlying importance of education generally, 54 or a\n\n\n\n         54See   Serrano II, 557 P.2d at 951; Robinson v. Cahill, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1436931\"><a href=\"/opinion/1436931/robinson-v-cahill/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 720 (N.J.\n1975).\n\f                                           137\n\nnarrower test than in San Antonio in order to avoid a finding of\n\nfundamental interest. 55\n\n       In contrast to these cases, some state supreme courts have\n\nfollowed San Antonio and applied a rational basis standard to education\n\nchallenges.       In most of these cases, the state frameworks have been\n\nupheld. 56 But not in every case. In several cases, state supreme courts\n\nhave applied a rational basis “with teeth” test and have invalidated state\n\neducation structures on that basis. 57\n\n       A second issue is whether the plaintiff has the burden of showing\n\ndisparate treatment.          With respect to disparate treatment, the state\n\ncourts that address the issue generally build on the dissent in\n\nSan Antonio, which notes that the class consists of persons residing in\n\nlow property tax jurisdictions who are treated differently than those in\n\ntax rich geographic locations.

Bishop, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2613339\"><a href=\"/opinion/2613339/roosevelt-elem-school-dist-v-bishop/\"><span class=\"volume\">877</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 815 (Ariz.\n\n1994) (holding question of whether disparities caused by local decision\n\nmaking or by public school system raises factual question for trial court).\n\n      6. Issues related to the type and scope of relief. A critical issue in\n\neducation cases is the type of relief sought by the plaintiffs.                 Some\n\nplaintiffs seek what some commentators have identified as parity in\n\neducational opportunity. 58 Others seek only an “adequate” or a “sound,\n\nbasic” education. The choice of relief can have dramatic implications for\n\nthe litigation.\n\n      Plaintiffs who seek parity do not require precisely the same\n\neducational opportunities, but substantially the same opportunities, as\n\nothers.        The   strength   of   parity   theory   is   that   it   is   perfectly\n\nunderstandable and judicially manageable, namely, that the educational\n\nprogram in school districts needs to be substantially the same.                   The\nproblems, however, are multiple.         Parity theory often requires that the\n\nstate abandon traditional reliance on local property taxes to fund\n\neducation. Plaintiffs seeking parity thus raise a specter of “Robin Hood”\n\nremedies whereby wealthier school districts are required to transfer\n\neducational funds to poorer districts, with the result that the quality of\n\neducation in more fortunate school districts suffers.\n\n\n\n      58See,e.g., William E. Thro, Judicial Paradigms of Educational Equality, 174\nEduc. Law Rep. 1, 7 (2003).\n\f                                    139\n\n      In part because of the difficulties of parity theory, plaintiffs have\n\ndeveloped an alternate theory that does not seek parity but instead\n\nadequacy.   The advantage of adequacy theory is obvious: it does not\n\nrequire that any wealthy school district transfer funds or sacrifice its\n\nprogram, but merely requires the state to ensure that it provides an\n\nadequate education to all students.       The adequacy approach does not\n\nrequire the complete abandonment of local property taxes.\n\n      The major challenge with adequacy theory is the development of a\n\nproper standard.      For example, in Abbeville County School District v.\n\nState, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1335495\"><a href=\"/opinion/1335495/abbeville-county-school-dist-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 540 (S.C. 1999), the South Carolina Supreme\n\nCourt found a right to a “minimally adequate education.” According to\n\nthe South Carolina Supreme Court, a minimally adequate education\n\nincluded:\n\n            1) the ability to read, write, and speak the English\n      language, and knowledge of mathematics and physical\n      science;\n             2) a fundamental knowledge of economic, social, and\n      political systems, and of history and governmental\n      processes; and\n             3) academic and vocational skills.\n\nAbbeville Cnty. Sch. Dist., 515 S.E.2d at 540.\n\n      The Kentucky Supreme Court in Rose developed a more detailed\n\nseven-factor test. The Kentucky Supreme Court has stated that in order\n\nto provide an adequate education, the state must establish a system of\n\neducation with the ultimate goal of providing to each and every child\n\nseven capabilities:\n\n      (i) sufficient oral and written communication skills to enable\n      students to function in a complex and rapidly changing\n      civilization; (ii) sufficient knowledge of economic, social, and\n      political systems to enable the student to make informed\n      choices; (iii) sufficient understanding of governmental\n      processes to enable the student to understand the issues\n      that affect his or her community, state, and nation; (iv)\n\f                                    140\n      sufficient self-knowledge and knowledge of his or her mental\n      and physical wellness; (v) sufficient grounding in the arts to\n      enable each student to appreciate his or her cultural and\n      historical heritage; (vi) sufficient training or preparation for\n      advanced training in either academic or vocational fields so\n      as to enable each child to choose and pursue life work\n      intelligently; and (vii) sufficient levels of academic or\n      vocational skills to enable public school students to compete\n      favorably with their counterparts in surrounding states, in\n      academics or in the job market.\n\nRose, 790 S.W.2d at 212; Leandro, 488 S.E.2d at 255 (adopting an\n\nadaptation of the Rose standards); see also Campaign for Fiscal Equity,\n\nInc. v.

Lake\n\nView, 91 S.W.3d at 500.\n\n      In addition to type of relief, a second issue arises regarding the\n\nscope of relief.    Many courts in the first instance after finding\n\nconstitutional violations merely provide declaratory relief and exercise\n\ncontinuing jurisdiction to review legislative responses to court rulings.\n\nFor example, in Lake View, the court stressed that it had no intention “to\n\nmonitor or superintend the public schools of this state.” Id. at 511. The\n\ncourt instead affirmed a lower court order granting declaratory relief and\n\nindicated that it would not hesitate to review the state’s school funding\n\nsystem once again in an appropriate case.

The district court determined that the\n\nissues raised in this case were nonjusticiable political questions.                      I\n\ndisagree.    We are called upon, in this case, to decide what the law\n\nmeans. This is the heart of judicial review.

State Education Clause.                The Iowa education clause is\n\ncategorized by some scholars as a fairly strong education clause.59\n\n        59William E. Thro, Note, To Render Them Safe: The Analysis of State\n\nConstitutional Provisions in Public School Finance Reform Litigation, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">L</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. Rev. 1639,\n1666 & n.118 (1989) (characterizing Iowa’s education provisions as a Category III\nprovision that provides a “stronger and more specific” mandate than Categories I and II,\nbut less specific than Category IV). On the other hand, another commentator has noted\nthat other states, such as Virginia, Montana, Louisiana, and Washington, have\n\f                                          142\n\nRegardless of this characterization, it seems clear that education in Iowa\n\nis a highly valued constitutional interest. Iowa would not have gained\n\nadmission to the Union as a state without an education clause.                       An\n\narticle of the 1857 constitution was devoted exclusively to education.\n\nAlthough the Iowa Constitution authorized the general assembly to\n\nrepeal provisions vesting authority over school matters in a board of\n\neducation, this constitutional option related solely to the manner in\n\nwhich     the   state’s   constitutional     interest    in   education     would     be\n\nimplemented. The Iowa Constitution, read in context, requires a system\n\nof “Common schools throughout the State.” See Iowa Const. art. IX, div.\n\n2, § 3. We said as much in Clark, where we emphasized that the State\n\nhad an obligation under article IX, division 1, section 12 to provide “for\n\nthe education of all the youths of the State, through a system of common\n\nschools.”    Clark, 24 Iowa at 274 (quoting Iowa Const. art. IX, div. 1,\n\n§ 12).\n\n         Our constitutional provisions without question are as strong as\n\nothers in which a constitutional right to an adequate education has been\n\nfound. See, e.g., Rell, 990 A.2d at 210–12 (simply stating there shall be\n\n“free public elementary and secondary schools” in the state); McDuffy,\n\n615 N.E.2d at 517, 526 (stating that it shall be the duty of legislators “to\n\ncherish” public schools and grammar schools); Campaign for Fiscal\n\nEquity, Inc., 801 N.E.2d at 328 (“a system of free common schools”). The\n\nstrong emphasis on education in the text (establishing “Common schools\n\nthroughout the State”) and in our state government tradition cannot be\n\ndoubted. For these reasons, the State at oral argument conceded that it\n_______________________________\neducation clauses that seem to demand a higher quality of education than the Iowa\nprovisions and suggests that the Iowa provision is among state constitutional provisions\n“[s]etting [l]ower [s]tandards.” See Molly McUsic, The Use of Education Clauses in School\nFinance Reform Litigation, 28 Harv. J. on Legis. 307, 334–37 (1991).\n\f                                   143\n\ncould not constitutionally refuse to provide public education to children\n\nand youth.\n\n       The State’s concession was not a blunder but the product of\n\ninescapable logic and a desire to avoid looking foolish.         The Iowa\n\nconstitutional provisions in article IX cannot be read to suggest that the\n\nlegislature has the discretion to withdraw from public education and\n\nclose the public schools. But, if there is a requirement that the State\n\nprovide a public education for children and youth through “Common\n\nschools throughout the State,” it certainly must be implied that the\n\neducation provided in the common schools must be a meaningful\n\neducation and not just some empty formalism.        There must be some\n\nsubstance to the mandatory duty, some concrete reality, some meat on\n\nthe bones.

Kleen involved a question of providing additional\n\nfunds for public schools, but did not address in any way the duty of the\n\nstate to maintain common schools throughout the state. Kleen, 237 Iowa\n\nat 1167–69, 23 N.W.2d at 908–09. In fact, by citing article IX, division 1,\n\nsection 12, Kleen supports the view of an ongoing obligation to provide a\n\nsystem of common schools to all youth. See id. at 1162, 23 N.W.2d at\n\n905.\n\n       Further, while Justice Mansfield’s opinion makes much of the fact\n\nthat the framers did not include the word “free” in the education clause,\n\f                                      144\n\nthis is hardly dispositive of whether there is a mandatory duty to make\n\nmeaningful public education available in the common schools to\n\neveryone who desires an education.          Charges that prevented a person\n\nfrom obtaining a public education in common schools would surely go\n\nthe way of the poll tax. See Harper, 383 U.S. at 666–68, 86 S. Ct. at\n\n1081–82, 16 L. Ed. 2d at 172–73.\n\n      Justice Mansfield’s opinion states that because the plaintiffs did\n\nnot cite article IX, division 1, section 12 of the Iowa Constitution in their\n\ntrial brief, it can ignore the provision by regarding the argument as\n\nwaived. Article IX, division 2, section 3, however, cannot be torn away\n\nfrom the previous constitutional provision. To begin with, the language\n\nof article IX, division 2, section 3 requiring the legislature to “encourage,\n\nby all suitable means, the promotion of intellectual, scientific, moral, and\n\nagricultural improvement” in my view incorporates within its scope the\n\nobligation to establish “a system of Common Schools” as required by\n\narticle IX, division 1, section 12.    My incorporation theory is strongly\n\nsupported by reference in article IX, division 2, section 3 to a perpetual\n\nfund for “Common schools throughout the State,” namely, the “system of\n\nCommon Schools” referred to in article IX, division 1, section 12. In my\n\nview, Justice Mansfield’s opinion seeks to separate the twins that were\n\njoined at birth in a way that elevates form over substance. See Office of\n\nConsumer Advocate v. Iowa State Commerce Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1652864\"><a href=\"/opinion/1652864/consumer-advocate-v-commerce-comn/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">280</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n283–84 (Iowa 1991) (holding error is preserved under Due Process Clause\n\neven though the party merely cited to the Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nstating to rule otherwise would “elevate[] form over substance”).         In\n\naddition, it is difficult to understand how Justice Mansfield’s opinion\n\nfinds that the education, due process, and privileges and immunities\n\nissues, though not briefed on appeal, are properly before the court as\n\f                                    145\n\n“interrelated” with the issue of justiciability, while the substantive\n\nobligations of article IX, division 1, section 12 and article IX, division 2,\n\nsection 3 are not.\n\n      In any event, there is no question that the issue of whether\n\neducation is a fundamental interest under the privileges and immunities\n\nclause of the Iowa Constitution was preserved in the trial court, and\n\naccording to Justice Mansfield’s opinion, may be considered on appeal\n\neven though the matter has not been briefed before this court.\n\nTherefore, even assuming the claim under article IX, division 1, section\n\n12 is “waived,” the issue of applicability of the privileges and immunities\n\nclause remains very much alive under the issue preservation reasoning\n\nof Justice Mansfield’s opinion. Any right to an education under article IX\n\nis coextensive to the fundamental right to an education under the\n\nprivileges and immunities clause, the only difference being the right to an\n\neducation under article IX does not require a classification.\n\n      C. Privileges and Immunities Clause.             The first issue for\n\nconsideration under Iowa’s privileges and immunities clause is whether\n\neducation may be characterized as a fundamental interest under the\n\ntraditional framework. If one utilizes the test enunciated in San Antonio,\n\nthe answer is plainly yes.     According to San Antonio, a fundamental\n\ninterest is present when an interest is explicitly or implicitly protected by\n\nconstitutional provisions. See San Antonio, 411 U.S. at 33, 93 S. Ct. at\n\n1297, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 43. Plainly, the Iowa education articles meet the\n\ntest. Further, under San Antonio, the question of whether there is a\n\nfundamental interest in a minimally adequate education was expressly\n\nreserved.   Id. at 36–37, 93 S. Ct. at 1298–99, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 44–45.\n\nThus, even applying the federal constitutional test, a student’s interest in\n\f                                          146\n\nan adequate education would be a fundamental interest under the Iowa\n\nConstitution in light of the explicit provisions for education.\n\n       Further, aside from the San Antonio test, I conclude education is a\n\nfundamental interest under other tests fashioned by state supreme\n\ncourts.       The express Iowa constitutional provisions; the centrality of\n\neducation to our state’s history; the strong and unqualified traditional\n\nsupport for education of Iowa’s political leaders; the inextricable\n\nrelationship between education and other key constitutional rights,\n\nnamely, the right to vote, the right to serve on juries, the right to petition\n\ngovernment, and the undeniable proposition that an individual has little\n\nprospect of enjoying life, liberty, and property without an education in\n\nthe postmodern world; and the centrality of education to human dignity;\n\nall convince me that education must be considered a fundamental\n\ninterest under Iowa’s privileges and immunities clause.

Instead, courts are sometimes reluctant to characterize\n\neducation as “fundamental” because they fear the consequences of strict\n\nscrutiny, which has been described as strict in theory but fatal in fact.\n\nSee, e.g., McDaniel, 285 S.E.2d at 167 (citing need to avoid inflexible\n\nconstitutional restraints that result from strict scrutiny); Norman\n\nDorsen, Equal Protection of the Laws, 74 Colum.

This concern over the\n\nconsequences of strict scrutiny, however, can be addressed by limiting\n\nheightened review only to asserted violations of a right to an adequate or\n\nbasic education.\n\n      The concept of heightened protection for an adequate or basic\n\neducation but not for all educational differences has support in the\n\ncaselaw of other states. For example, both the Minnesota and Wisconsin\n\nSupreme Courts have adopted such an approach in their efforts to sort\n\nthrough the constitutional issues related to education.

Based on the\n\nreasoning of the adequacy cases cited above, I conclude that a basic or\n\nadequate education must be sufficient to allow a person to participate\n\nmeaningfully in democracy through the right to vote, the right to petition\n\ngovernment, and jury duty, and to have meaningful prospects of enjoying\n\n“life, liberty, and property.”   In order to achieve these ends, education\n\nmust be sufficient to allow an individual a meaningful opportunity to\n\nparticipate in economic life in the postmodern world.

In order to satisfy\n\nthese demands, I would adopt a variant of the factors in Rose and other\n\nadequacy cases: An educational program must, among other things,\n\ninclude effectively teaching the ability to read and write, to communicate\n\neffectively, to perform in mathematical computations, to have exposure to\n\nscientific principles, to have a basic understanding of economics and\n\ngovernment, and to learn how to use computer-based technology that is\n\nso indispensible in the postmodern world. An education program need\n\nnot guarantee results to meet the constitutional test, but it must provide\n\na meaningful educational opportunity to participate in the political,\n\nsocial, and economic life.\n\n      I would not, however, adopt the approach of the Arkansas\n\nSupreme Court in Lake View. While the adoption of standards, systems\n\nof monitoring, and systems of accountability might help ensure\n\ncompliance with the substantive constitutional requirements outlined in\n\nthis opinion, I would not mandate the precise manner in which the State\n\nperforms its constitutional obligation. I would decline to enter the fray of\n\neducational philosophy other than as required to ensure that children\n\nhave a reasonable opportunity to a basic education and that all other\n\nmaterial differences in educational opportunity be justified by a rational\n\nbasis as described below.\n\n      The defense to privileges-and-immunities-type claims is, of course,\n\ninvariably “local control.” But local control is not an automatic trump\n\ncard that applies as a matter of law in all cases involving educational\n\ninterests as Justice Mansfield’s opinion seems to believe.         Instead,\n\nwhether “local control” will be sufficient to carry the day will depend\n\nupon a number of determinations. First, the court must determine, as a\n\f                                          150\n\nmatter of fact, whether the alleged shortcomings in education are\n\npresent. Second, the court must determine if the plaintiff can prove that\n\nstate action has caused the deprivations.                   Third, assuming that\n\ndeprivations are present and they are caused by the state, the question\n\narises whether the deprivation is sufficient to undermine the right to an\n\nadequate or basic education. If the shortcomings deprive the plaintiffs of\n\na   basic   education,      then    heightened     scrutiny     will   apply    to   the\n\nclassification. To the extent “local control” is asserted as the legitimate\n\nbasis for a classification, the decision to provide different services must\n\nbe a discretionary choice of local administrators and not the result of\n\nstate law or legal structure that forces local decision makers into\n\nHobson’s choices. See Tenn. Small School Sys., 851 S.W.2d at 154–55\n\n(the issue is not whether local control is a good thing, but whether the\n\nstatutory framework actually promotes it or undercuts it). Local control,\n\nhowever, must not be a “euphemism masking gross inequalities in the\n\nabilities of school districts to meet their needs.” Lujan v. Colo.

Moreover, applying the\n\nSan Antonio test of what amounts to a fundamental interest (explicit or\n\nimplicit protection in the constitution itself), my conclusion seems\n\ninescapable. In any event, even if my approach affords greater protection\n\nto education under our privileges and immunities clause than is\n\navailable under the Federal Equal Protection Clause, this is not unusual.\n\nState courts in at least twenty-one states have interpreted their equality\n\nclauses more expansively than the United States Supreme Court’s\n\ninterpretation of equal protection.

So far, the United States Supreme Court\n\nhas not explicitly resolved the tensions in its cases.\n\n      Aside from inconsistency, there is another reason for state\n\nsupreme courts to depart from federal precedent when analyzing equal\n\nprotection-type claims. A major factor in the highly deferential rational\n\nbasis standard developed by the United States Supreme Court is the\n\ndesire to honor federalism and to avoid imposing national solutions onto\n\nthe states. Justice Harlan warned long ago that national application of\n\nfederal standards to the states in order to give the states elbow room in\n\f                                         154\n\ntheir criminal processes would lead to a dilution of substantive\n\nconstitutional protections.

Indeed, federalism constraints were a\n\nmotivating factor in the Supreme Court’s refusal to impose strict scrutiny\n\nin San Antonio. Because of the federalism concerns, the Federal Equal\n\nProtection Clause tends to be among the most underenforced of\n\nconstitutional provisions. See Hershkoff, 112 Harv. L. Rev. at 1134–38;\n\nLawrence Gene Sager, Fair Measure: The Legal Status of Underenforced\n\nConstitutional Norms, 91 Harv. L. Rev. 1212, 1218 (1978).                         The\n\nfederalism concern, of course, is wholly absent when state courts\n\nconsider claims under the state constitutions.\n\n       As a result, it is not surprising that a number of state supreme\n\ncourts have declined to follow the federal model and have developed their\n\nown approach to equal protection or privileges and immunities review.64\n\nMany of the more than a dozen states that have privileges and\n\nimmunities type language rely to some extent on the tiered federal model,\n\nbut there are many variations. Several states have rejected the “any\n\nconceivable basis” rationality standard for more exacting judicial review\nof some legislative classifications.            See, e.g., Trujillo v. City of\n\nAlbuquerque, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">965</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314 (N.M. 1998); MacCallum v.

Some courts, like Indiana, have declared over a strong\n\ndissent that, as a matter of law, local control is an adequate rational\n\nbasis to justify a state framework for providing education. Other states,\n\nhowever, like Arkansas, have found after the development of substantial\n\nfactual records that their system of state funding fails to meet even the\n\nrational basis test. See, e.g., DuPree, 651 S.W.2d at 95.\n\n      There is much to be said for a more searching rational basis\n\nreview. The “any conceivable basis” test tends to be no review at all. The\n\ncases show some striking examples, like Louisiana legislation where only\n\nlicensed florists may arrange flowers, defended as a health measure, and\n\nan Oklahoma statute preventing anyone other than a person with a\n\nlicense in mortuary science from selling caskets.     See Clark Neily, No\n\nSuch Thing: Litigating Under the Rational Basis Test, 1 N.Y.U. J. L. &\n\nLiberty 898, 906 (2005).\n\n      The suggestion that the incantation of the phrase “local control” is\n\nsufficient to decide this case at this stage as a matter of law cannot stand\n\nscrutiny.   When an allegation of a violation of our privileges and\n\nimmunities clause in the field of education is alleged, we should turn a\n\ncocked ear, not a blind eye.       When local control is asserted as a\n\njustification for differences in educational quality, we should consider\n\nwhether local educational leaders are, in fact, making local choices\n\f                                    156\n\nentitled to deference, or whether they are forced into Hobson’s choices\n\nbecause of an educational structure that prevents them from delivering a\n\nquality education. The concept was well expressed by one observer, who\n\nnoted that “[e]verywhere, local autonomy is compromised by centralized\n\nauthority. . . . Practically, the rhetoric of local autonomy is difficult to\n\ntake seriously given overwhelming evidence of the fiscal, political, and\n\njudicial domination of local governments by higher tiers of the state.”\n\nGordon L. Clark, Judges and the Cities: Interpreting Local Autonomy 113–\n\n14 (1985) (citation omitted). In other words, the question we should ask\n\nis this: Is local control really at work, or is it a euphemism masking\n\ninequalities in the ability of school districts to provide educational\n\nopportunities to its students?   See Lujan, 649 P.2d at 1040 (Lohr, J.,\n\ndissenting).\n\n      Justice Mansfield’s opinion employs the label “local control”\n\nwithout analysis of exactly what that means.         In San Antonio, local\n\ncontrol was favored because it encouraged citizen participation in\n\ndecision making, permitted the structuring of school programs to fit local\n\nneeds, and encouraged “experimentation, innovation, and a healthy\n\ncompetition for educational excellence.” San Antonio, 411 U.S. at 50, 93\n\nS. Ct. at 1305, 36 L. Ed. 2d at 52–53. Should we declare, as a matter of\n\nlaw, that the distinctions between the various school districts in this case\n\nwere the result of these factors? Is it not possible that, in this case, the\n\nstate regulatory framework in actuality deprives local school boards of\n\nlocal control in the sense that they do not have the practical ability to\n\nmake considered policy choices? Would the responsible school officials\n\nin the districts where the plaintiffs reside claim that the alleged dramatic\n\ndifferences in teacher experience, course loads per teacher, and\n\ncurriculum offerings were the result of a local, discretionary choice or\n\f                                           157\n\nwould they cite systemic limitations?                 Does the way education is\n\nstructured in Iowa promote local control or restrict it? We will, of course,\n\nnever know the answer to these questions in light of the summary\n\ndismissal of the case without the development of a factual record.\n\n       In RACI, we conducted a meaningful rational basis review.\n\nFitzgerald, 675 N.W.2d at 7–8. We were not content to rest solely on the\n\npleadings, but conducted a factual inquiry to see whether the purported\n\njustifications, while conceivable, were in fact sufficient to support a\n\nstatutory distinction.       Specifically, we noted that the conceivable state\n\ninterest must have “a basis in fact.” Id.\n\n       In my view, we should apply a meaningful rational basis test in\n\nthis case with respect to classifications which adversely affect the\n\nplaintiffs but do not arise to deprivations of an adequate education. It\n\nallows    substantial     deference      to   decisions     of   other    branches      of\n\ngovernment, but imposes a reality check to prevent arbitrary and\n\nirrational distinctions from creeping into educational structures in the\n\nname of “local control.” 65\n\n       D. Due Process Clause. I have no doubt that there is a potential\n\ndue process claim in light of the compulsory nature of school attending.\nWe said as much in Exira. The notion is uncontroversial that where a\n\n       65The   claim that this court should not function as an elected school board\ncreates a straw person. No one advocated interference with the daily administration of\nschool boards in this case or in the dozens of other state court cases that have found a\nfundamental right to a basic education. While we must maintain a healthy respect for\nthe other branches of government, we must fearlessly perform our role as judges to\nensure that the other branches of government perform their duties in a manner\nconsistent with the Iowa Constitution. Indeed, the very purpose of the privileges and\nimmunities clause in the Iowa Constitution is to restrain elected officials from treating\ncitizens differently in ways that do not make sense. Bromides about elections and\nballot boxes do not assist the court in its performance of the difficult but essential role\nof judicial review established by Marbury v.

Youngberg, 457 U.S. at 324, 102 S. Ct. at\n\n2462, 73 L. Ed. 2d at 42–43. There is also no doubt that education is a\n\nlegitimate state objective. The question under due process is whether the\n\neducation received by the person whose liberty is impaired is rationally\n\nrelated to the state’s legitimate interest in educating citizens.      Any\n\napplication of the due process clause, however, would give the state a\n\nwide range of permissible action in providing education to its charges.\n\nThere is no due process right to a specific kind of education, but only a\n\nsufficiently reasonable educational effort to justify the intrusion on the\n\nliberty interest.\n\n      E. Application of Law to Facts Alleged in the Petition. Having\n\nestablished the necessary legal framework, the question remains whether\n\nthe petition alleges sufficient facts to survive a motion to dismiss.

The plaintiffs claim they are being deprived of an “effective\n\neducation” and an “adequate education.” They claim their education is\n\nso deficient that students “are not prepared to enter the workforce or\n\npost-secondary education” and are not “prepared for responsible\n\ncitizenship, further learning and productive employment in a global\n\neconomy.” They have also pled differences in the quality of education in\n\ntheir school districts in terms of teacher experience, course loads, and\n\ncourse offerings. In light of our pleading rules, which have been held to\n\nprovide that “very little is required by way of pleading to provide notice,”\n\nthese allegations are sufficient to raise a claim of adequacy that cannot\n\nbe precluded as a matter of law at this stage of the proceedings. See\n\nWilker, 630 N.W.2d at 595; Herschler, 606 P.2d at 316 (attack on\n\n“system” is sufficient to survive motion to dismiss); see also Lujan, 649\n\nP.2d at 1010 (appellees did not plead or prove denial of educational\n\f                                        160\n\nopportunity); Hornbeck v.

Preexisting commitment to\n\nthe ideology of “Our Localism” does not form a legally sufficient basis for\n\nrejecting a more nuanced inquiry when an interest as important as\n\neducation is involved. 66\n\n       It may well be, of course, that the plaintiffs may fail, in whole or in\n\npart, to prove their case. But they are entitled to attempt to prove it. A\n\nmotion to dismiss is not a vehicle to dismiss claims that some on an\n\nappellate court may perceive as weak. The only issue when considering\n\na motion to dismiss is the “petitioner’s right of access to the district\n\ncourt, not the merits of his allegations.” Rieff v.

The\n\napproach taken in Justice Mansfield’s opinion to the pleading in this\n\ncase is a marked departure from our pleading requirements generally\nand has no precedential value except to dispose of this case.\n\n       F. Remedies. It is sometimes suggested that remedial difficulties\n\nrequire the judiciary to abandon the field of enforcing state constitutional\n\ncommands related to education. Ordinarily, respect for the coordinate\n\nbranches of government requires a court not to unduly intrude onto the\n\nworkings of the other branches. As a result, in a case such as this one,\n\n\n       66The term “Our Localism” was coined by Richard Briffault in two important\nscholarly articles, Richard Briffault, Our Localism: Part I—The Structure of Local\nGovernment Law, 90 Colum. L. Rev. 1 (1990), and Richard Briffault, Our Localism: Part\nII—Localism and Legal Theory, 90 Colum. L.

If a constitutional violation is found, there\n\nwill be a number of different possibilities that the legislature may wish to\n\nconsider to solve the problem. As long as the ultimate action complies\n\nwith the constitutional commands, this court has no interest in invading\n\nthe discretion of the legislature. As Justice Jackson stated years ago, a\n\nholding of invalidity under the Equal Protection Clause “does not disable\n\nany governmental body from dealing with the subject at hand.”           Ry.\n\nExpress Agency v.

Sweeping declarations regarding\n\nremedies also ignore the highly nuanced approaches of many state\n\f                                     162\n\ncourts to remedial issues related to the provision of adequate education\n\nthat emphasize collaboration over confrontation. See, e.g., Rell, 990 A.2d\n\nat 221–23 (discussing need for flexible, graduate remedies); Campaign for\n\nFiscal Equity, Inc., 801 N.E.2d at 344–49 (N.Y. 2003) (discussing flexible\n\nremedies in education context).\n\n      While a prudent and respectful approach to potential remedies\n\nmakes sense, this case should not be a springboard for this court to\n\nadopt a radical doctrine that threatens many decades of jurisprudence.\n\nA disabling doctrine of sharply curtailed remedies would reduce the\n\nguarantees of the State and Federal Constitutions that protect individual\n\nliberties and establish affirmative duties to hollow platitudes.           This\n\nindirect substantive evisceration of our State and Federal Constitutions\n\nis a project that may appeal to others, but not to me.\n\n      VII. Conclusion.\n\n      In my view, regardless of whether the plaintiffs have pled and/or\n\npreserved a claim under article IX of the Iowa Constitution or stated a\n\nclaim under the Due Process Clauses of the Iowa and Federal\n\nConstitutions, I believe it is inescapable that education is a fundamental\n\ninterest under the state constitutional guarantee of equal protection.\n\nBecause of the sensitive nature of educational decision making, however,\n\nI would differentiate between a basic or adequate education and other\n\nelements of education that fall outside that category.        I would apply\n\nheightened scrutiny with respect to claims of deprivation of adequate\n\neducation and only a rational basis type scrutiny to other claims.\n\n      Having   determined    these   legal   issues,   I   would   apply   our\n\ntraditionally liberal pleading standards to the plaintiffs’ petition.      The\n\npetition is not very precise and does not clearly outline what government\n\f                                       163\n\naction is causing what deprivation. Nevertheless, I am not prepared to\n\nsay at this stage that there is no possibility that the plaintiffs will be able\n\nto show an entitlement to relief. Rather than rush to judgment in this\n\ncase without the development of an adequate factual record, I would\n\ndeny the motion to dismiss and remand the case to the district court for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n      Hecht, J., joins this dissent.\n\f</pre>",
