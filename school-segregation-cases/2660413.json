We affirm.\n\n\n                              I.      BACKGROUND\n\nA.    Complaint Allegations\n\n      Bascom Palmer Eye Institute (“Bascom Palmer”), which is a part of the\n\nUniversity of Miami (“the University”), houses an ophthalmology residency\n\nprogram at its facility. Each year, seven physicians are offered positions as\n\nresidents in the ophthalmology residency program. All seven positions are filled\n\nthrough the Association of University Professors Ophthalmology Matching\n\nProgram. “Graduates of recognized medical schools” are eligible to enter the\n\nresidency program. R. at 289. A Basic Affiliation Agreement (“BAA”) between\n\nthe University of Miami and the Public Health Trust of Jackson Health System\n\n(“the Trust”) sets forth how the residency programs under the Trust’s auspices are\n\nconducted, including the ophthalmology residency program at Bascom Palmer.\n\nThe BAA provides that residents are not students of the University, but rather are\n\nfull-time employees.\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f              Case: 14-13704       Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 3 of 23\n\n\n      Pouyeh is from Iran; he attended medical school there. In 2010, 2011, and\n\n2012, he applied for a position as an ophthalmology resident at Bascom Palmer.\n\nPouyeh alleged he had the following qualifications for the position: (1) scoring in\n\nthe 99th and 96th percentiles on unspecified tests, (2) having recommendation\n\nletters, (3) having two years of research and clinical experience in ophthalmology,\n\n(4) giving presentations and publishing papers in ophthalmology, (5) being an\n\nauthor and reviewer for the American Academy of Ophthalmology Journal,\n\n(6) writing a book chapter about a topic in ophthalmology, and (7) being a top\n\nstudent in medical school in Iran. During this period, Pouyeh also was a volunteer-\n\nresearch fellow at Bascom Palmer. He was not selected for a residency position\n\nfor any of the years he applied.\n\n      After Pouyeh was not selected for a 2011 residency position, he filed a\n\ncomplaint on January 23, 2012, with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission (“EEOC”) and alleged discrimination. In his EEOC complaint,\n\nPouyeh alleged he had applied for the residency program in 2011 and was not\n\nselected because of his national origin. He stated specifically that program\n\ndirector, Dr. Stephen Gedde, and other faculty members had told him Bascom\n\nPalmer does not “hire doctors for residency in eye surgery who are graduates from\n\na medical school outside of the United States.” R. at 284. In July or August 2012,\n\nPouyeh’s volunteer-research position was terminated. On December 6, 2012,\n\n\n                                            3\n\f              Case: 14-13704    Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 4 of 23\n\n\nPouyeh went to Bascom Palmer to attend a weekly continuing-medical-education\n\nconference open to doctors and other healthcare professionals. While Pouyeh was\n\nusing the restroom at Bascom Palmer, security guards threw him on the floor and\n\ndetained him there until the police arrived and arrested him for trespassing.\n\n      Pouyeh’s Third Amended Complaint contained nine counts of\n\ndiscrimination and named as defendants Bascom Palmer; the Trust; Dr. Gedde and\n\nthe members of the Residency Selection Committee (Dr. James Banta, Dr. Craig\n\nMcKeown, Dr. Richard Lee, Dr. Wendy Lee, Dr. Audina Berrocal) (collectively,\n\n“the individual defendants”); Bascom Palmer Chairman Dr. Eduardo C. Alfonso,\n\nand Trust Associate Dean of Graduate Medical Education, Dr. Richard Parish.\n\nCounts 1 through 4 were against Bascom Palmer and the Trust. Counts 1 through\n\n3 concerned Pouyeh’s allegation his application for a position as a resident was\n\ndenied. In each of the counts, he alleged specifically (1) he had applied for the\n\nposition; (2) he was not interviewed; (3) he was treated differently than American\n\ninterviewees; (4) Bascom Palmer and the Trust knew of his national origin or\n\nalienage; (5) other immigrant Iranian doctors also were excluded from interviews;\n\nand (6) his national origin or alienage was a motivating factor in declining to\n\ninterview him.\n\n      In Count 1, Pouyeh alleged Bascom Palmer and the Trust engaged in\n\neducation-based discrimination, in violation of Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, by\n\n\n                                          4\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 5 of 23\n\n\ndenying his application for a residency position. Additionally, Pouyeh alleged he\n\nwas deprived of the ability to participate in the weekly continuing-medical-\n\neducation conference, because of his national origin. In Count 2, Pouyeh alleged\n\nBascom Palmer and the Trust engaged in employment discrimination, in violation\n\nof Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), and the Florida Civil Rights Act\n\n(“FCRA”), Fla. Stat. § 760.10 by denying his application to the residency program.\n\nIn Count 3, Pouyeh alleged Bascom Palmer and the Trust engaged in employment\n\ndiscrimination for failing to hire him, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. In Count 4,\n\nPouyeh alleged Bascom Palmer and the Trust retaliated against him and violated\n\nTitle VII and the FCRA, by (1) terminating his volunteer-research position after he\n\nfiled his EEOC complaint, (2) failing to hire him for a 2012 resident position, and\n\n(3) having him arrested for trespassing. In Count 5, Pouyeh named Bascom\n\nPalmer, the Trust, and Dr. Gedde as defendants; he alleged 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\nretaliation on the same basis as Count 4.\n\n      Count 6 named as defendants Bascom Palmer, the Trust, and the individual\n\ndefendants. Pouyeh alleged the defendants engaged in FCRA discrimination by\n\npreventing him from obtaining a medical license. In Count 7, Pouyeh alleged Dr.\n\nGedde and the other individual defendants deprived him of his due process right to\n\nemployment, education, and to obtain a medical license, in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983. In Count 8, Pouyeh alleged the individual defendants conspired to\n\n\n                                            5\n\f              Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 6 of 23\n\n\ninterfere with his constitutional rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985, on a\n\nsimilar basis. In Count 9, Pouyeh alleged Dr. Eduardo, Dr. Parish, and the\n\nmembers of the Residency Selection Committee negligently failed to prevent the\n\nconspiracy from depriving him of his civil rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1986.\n\nB.    Dismissal of Proposed Amended Complaint\n\n      Bascom Palmer, the Trust, and the individual defendants all filed motions to\n\ndismiss Pouyeh’s Third Amended Complaint. Thereafter, Pouyeh filed a motion to\n\namend his complaint further and to join additional defendants. He attached to his\n\nmotion a proposed Fourth Amended Complaint. A magistrate judge issued a\n\nReport and Recommendation (“R&R”), recommending some of Pouyeh’s claims\n\nbe dismissed. The magistrate judge recommended granting Bascom Palmer’s\n\nmotion to dismiss Counts 1 through 6, because (1) the University, not Bascom\n\nPalmer, was the proper defendant; and (2) under the BAA, the University did not\n\nassert sufficient control over the residency program to be Pouyeh’s prospective\n\nemployer.\n\n      The magistrate judge then addressed the Trust’s motion to dismiss. At the\n\noutset, she explained, although Pouyeh purported to raise a claim of Title VI\n\neducation discrimination in Count 1, it was more correctly construed as a claim of\n\nemployment discrimination, because residents were employees, not students, under\n\nthe BAA. The magistrate judge recommended Count 1 be dismissed with\n\n\n                                           6\n\f              Case: 14-13704    Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 7 of 23\n\n\nprejudice for failure to allege the Trust received federal funding for the primary\n\npurpose of employment. She recommended the Trust’s motion be denied\n\nregarding the Title VII and FCRA claims in Counts 2, 4, and 6. She further\n\nrecommended the Trust’s motion be granted concerning the § 1981 claims in\n\nCounts 3 and 5.\n\n      The magistrate judge also recommended the individual defendants’ motion\n\nto dismiss be granted with respect to the § 1981 and FCRA claims in Counts 5 and\n\n6. She explained the claim of FCRA discrimination in obtaining a medical license\n\nin Count 6 was not cognizable against individuals. She recommended the\n\nindividual defendants’ motion be denied with respect to the §§ 1983, 1985, and\n\n1986 claims in Counts 7 through 9. The magistrate judge further recommended\n\nPouyeh’s request to file his proposed Fourth Amended Complaint be denied,\n\nbecause it failed to comport with federal and local rules of procedure, but he\n\nshould be given one final opportunity to file an amended complaint.\n\n      Over Pouyeh’s objections, the district judge adopted the R&R in part,\n\ndismissed his Third Amended Complaint with prejudice but denied him leave to\n\nfile another amended complaint. The judge determined the Third Amended\n\nComplaint failed to state a claim against Bascom Palmer, because Bascom Palmer\n\nwas not Pouyeh’s prospective employer under the BAA. The judge adopted the\n\nrecommendation of the R&R that Count 1 be dismissed with prejudice regarding\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                Case: 14-13704       Date Filed: 05/28/2015          Page: 8 of 23\n\n\nthe Trust, and Counts 5 and 6 be dismissed with prejudice regarding the individual\n\ndefendants. Concerning the remaining claims, the judge determined Pouyeh’s\n\nThird Amended Complaint failed to provide sufficient facts to state a plausible\n\nclaim for discrimination.\n\n                                    II.    DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Incorporation of Arguments\n\n      As an initial matter, in several places in Pouyeh’s initial and reply briefs, he\n\npurports to incorporate arguments raised in other documents. For example, he\n\npurports to incorporate portions of his Third Amended Complaint and arguments\n\nmade in a motion he filed in this Court to have the standard for deciding motions to\n\ndismiss set forth in Iqbal1 and Twombly2 declared unconstitutional. In his reply\n\nbrief, he purports to incorporate all arguments he plans to present in his opening\n\nand reply briefs in a different appeal pending before this court.\n\n      “[A]lthough we are to give liberal construction to the pleadings of pro se\n\nlitigants, we nevertheless have required them to conform to procedural rules.”\n\nAlbra v. Advan, Inc., 490 F.3d 826, 829 (11th Cir. 2007) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted). “Moreover, we do not address arguments raised for the first time in a pro\n\nse litigant’s reply brief.” Timson v. Sampson, 518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir. 2008).\n\n      1\n          Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S. Ct. 1937 (2008).\n\n      2\n          Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S. Ct. 1955 (2006).\n\n\n                                                8\n\f              Case: 14-13704      Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 9 of 23\n\n\nWe have explained that an appellant may not incorporate by reference arguments\n\nmade elsewhere, including before the district judge, because “[m]ere citation to\n\ndocuments [filed in district court] does not meet the[] requirements” set forth in the\n\nRules of Appellate Procedure. Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts, B.V. v. Consorcio\n\nBarr S.A., 377 F.3d 1164, 1167 n.4 (11th Cir. 2004).\n\n      Pouyeh’s purported adoption of the briefs from his other appeal is\n\ninsufficient, because he cannot raise an issue for the first time in a reply brief. See\n\nTimson, 518 F.3d at 874. We will not consider any argument raised in his other\n\nappeal that also is not raised in his initial brief in this appeal. See id. His\n\npurported incorporation by reference of his pleadings in district court similarly\n\nfails to comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure. See Albra, 490 F.3d at 829;\n\nFour Seasons Hotels & Resorts, B.V., 377 F.3d at 1167 n.4. Finally, his purported\n\nadoption of his motion to have Iqbal and Twombly deemed unconstitutional is\n\nineffective, because a panel of this court has already denied that motion.\n\nB.    Abandoned Issues\n\n      We first determine Pouyeh has abandoned any argument the district judge\n\nerred in dismissing Counts 4, 5, 6 (against the Trust and Bascom Palmer), 7, 8, and\n\n9 from his Third Amended Complaint. He also has abandoned any argument the\n\ndistrict judge erred in denying his motion to amend. An issue not briefed on\n\nappeal by a pro se litigant is deemed abandoned, and its merits will not be\n\n\n                                            9\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 10 of 23\n\n\naddressed. Timson, 518 F.3d at 874; Access Now, Inc. v. Sw. Airlines Co., 385\n\nF.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir. 2004). “[A]n appellant abandons a claim when he\n\neither makes only passing references to it or raises it in a perfunctory manner\n\nwithout supporting arguments and authority.” Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins.\n\nCo., 739 F.3d 678, 681 (11th Cir. 2014).\n\n      Although Pouyeh provides argument concerning the dismissal of his\n\ndiscrimination claims under Title VII, the FCRA, § 1981, and the dismissal of his\n\n§ 1981 retaliation claim, he does not discuss the Title VII and FCRA retaliation he\n\nalleged in Count 4. See Timson, 518 F.3d at 874. In his initial brief, Pouyeh does\n\nnot discuss his §§ 1983, 1985, and 1986 claims in Counts 7, 8, and 9. See Timson,\n\n518 F.3d at 874. In his reply brief, Pouyeh argues Bascom Palmer’s alleged policy\n\nof excluding graduates of foreign medical schools violates his equal protection\n\nrights and § 1983; that argument, however, is insufficient to raise the issue on\n\nappeal, because a litigant may not raise an issue on appeal for the first time in a\n\nreply brief. See Timson, 518 F.3d at 874. While Pouyeh provides some argument\n\nrelated to Count 6, the FCRA claim related to his inability to obtain a medical\n\nlicense, his argument is limited to the improper dismissal of the claim against the\n\nindividual defendants. Therefore, he has abandoned any argument the district\n\njudge erred in dismissing Count 6 against the Trust and Bascom Palmer. See\n\nTimson, 518 F.3d at 874; Access Now, Inc., 385 F.3d at 1330.\n\n\n                                           10\n\f               Case: 14-13704   Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 11 of 23\n\n\n      Similarly, Pouyeh provides no meaningful argument the district judge erred\n\nin dismissing his § 1981 retaliation claim in Count 5. See Timson, 518 F.3d at 874;\n\nAccess Now, Inc., 385 F.3d at 1330. Pouyeh raises several arguments in his initial\n\nbrief related to the magistrate judge’s reasoning for recommending Count 5 be\n\ndismissed, but those arguments are unavailing, because the district judge\n\n(1) declined to adopt that portion of the R&R, and (2) dismissed the Third\n\nAmended Complaint, since the complaint was too conclusory to survive a motion\n\nto dismiss, not for the reasons given in the R&R.\n\n      Finally, Pouyeh provides no argument related to the denial of his motion to\n\namend in his initial brief or reply brief; therefore, he has abandoned the issue. See\n\nTimson, 518 F.3d at 874; Access Now, Inc., 385 F.3d at 1330. Although he makes\n\npassing references to his motion to amend and his proposed Fourth Amended\n\nComplaint, those references are insufficient to raise the issue. See Sapuppo, 739\n\nF.3d at 681.\n\nC.    Constitutionality of Iqbal and Twombly\n\n      On appeal, Pouyeh argues the standard for determining\n\nFederal Rule Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss set forth by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Iqbal and Twombly is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has not\n\noverturned either of those decisions; they remain controlling law. See Jaffree v.\n\nWallace, 705 F.2d 1526, 1532 (11th Cir. 1983) (“Federal district courts and circuit\n\n\n                                         11\n\f             Case: 14-13704      Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 12 of 23\n\n\ncourts are bound to adhere to the controlling decisions of the United States\n\nSupreme Court.”). Pouyeh’s constitutional challenge to Iqbal and Twombly is\n\nmeritless.\n\nD.    Title VI Discrimination, Count 1\n\n      Pouyeh argues the district judge misconstrued his Title VI claim as one\n\nalleging employment discrimination, rather than education discrimination. He\n\nargues ophthalmology-resident positions are dual employment and education\n\npositions; consequently, they are open to a Title VI education-discrimination\n\nchallenge. Because his claim was one of education discrimination, Pouyeh argues\n\nhis allegation in his Third Amended Complaint that Bascom Palmer received\n\nfederal financial assistance was sufficient to sue the Trust, because the two entities\n\ncollaborated in running the ophthalmology-residency program. He also maintains\n\nhis trespassing arrest was an act of retaliation for his having sued Bascom Palmer\n\nfor discrimination, which allegedly supports a claim of Title VI retaliation.\n\n      We review de novo a district judge’s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule\n\n12(b)(6). Redland Co., Inc. v. Bank of Am. Corp., 568 F.3d 1232, 1234 (11th Cir.\n\n2009). “[W]e may affirm the dismissal of a complaint on any ground supported by\n\nthe record even if that ground was not considered by the district court . . . .”\n\nSeminole Tribe of Fla. v. Fla. Dep’t of Revenue, 750 F.3d 1238, 1242 (11th Cir.\n\n2014), cert. denied, 135 S. Ct. 947 (2015). We will not consider an issue that was\n\n\n                                           12\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 13 of 23\n\n\nnot raised before the district judge and is raised on appeal for the first time. Access\n\nNow, Inc., 385 F.3d at 1331.\n\n      A complaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing\n\nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). This pleading standard\n\n“does not require detailed factual allegations, but it demands more than an\n\nunadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n\n678, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (internal quotation marks omitted). “A pleading that offers\n\nlabels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\n\nwill not do.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, a complaint must\n\ncontain more than “naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement.” Id.\n\n(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). “To survive a motion to dismiss,\n\na complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim\n\nfor relief that is plausible on its face.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\nplaintiff must plead sufficient facts to allow the district judge to draw a reasonable\n\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct. Id. “The plausibility\n\nstandard . . . asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\n\nunlawfully.” Id.\n\n      In ruling on a motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true all of the\n\nallegations contained in a complaint but need not accept legal conclusions:\n\n“Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere\n\n\n                                          13\n\f              Case: 14-13704      Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 14 of 23\n\n\nconclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id. Courts are “not bound to accept as true\n\na legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.” Id. at 678, 129 S. Ct. at\n\n1949-50 (internal quotation marks omitted). In the Rule 12(b) motion-to-dismiss\n\ncontext, a judge generally may not consider materials outside of the four corners of\n\na complaint without first converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Day v. Taylor, 400 F.3d 1272, 1275-76 (11th Cir. 2005). A\n\ncourt may consider a document that has been attached to a motion to dismiss,\n\nhowever, if it is central to the plaintiff’s claims and its authenticity is not\n\nchallenged. Id. at 1276.\n\n      Title VI provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground\n\nof race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\n\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\n\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. Pouyeh consistently\n\nhas maintained his Title VI claim is one of education, not employment\n\ndiscrimination. Consequently, we do not consider the merits of the district judge’s\n\ndismissal of any Title VI employment claim. We also note we may consider the\n\nBAA, even though it was not attached to the complaint. See Day, 400 F.3d at\n\n1275-76. Although attached to Bascom Palmer’s motion to dismiss, the operative\n\nBAA was central to Pouyeh’s claims against Bascom Palmer, and Pouyeh\n\nreferenced the BAA specifically in his complaint. See id. Moreover, Pouyeh has\n\n\n                                            14\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 15 of 23\n\n\nnot disputed the authenticity of the BAA. See id. at 1276. Based on the denial of\n\nhis residency application, Pouyeh’s claim of Title VI education discrimination is\n\nflawed, because the BAA makes clear medical residents are employees, not\n\nstudents. Therefore, Pouyeh has failed to show that, as a prospective medical\n\nresident, he was excluded from, denied participation in, or denied the benefits of an\n\neducational, rather than employment, program or activity. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.\n\n      Pouyeh’s allegation that he suffered education discrimination because he\n\nwas barred from attending the weekly medical conference also falls short of stating\n\na plausible claim for relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S. Ct. at 1949. His\n\nThird Amended Complaint contained a claim he was barred access to a weekly\n\nmorning-medical conference at Bascom Palmer at the time he was arrested for\n\ntrespassing. His claim falls short, because Pouyeh’s allegation his exclusion was\n\nmotivated by his national origin is wholly conclusory. See id. Pouyeh simply\n\nasserted he was arrested for trespassing because of his national origin, but that\n\namounts to “an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because he failed to allege sufficient facts to\n\nshow plausibly his arrest for trespassing was improperly motivated by his national\n\norigin, his Title VI claim in Count 1 properly was dismissed. See id.\n\n      Pouyeh did not include a Title VI retaliation claim argument in his Third\n\nAmended Complaint; consequently, he may not raise it on appeal. See Access\n\n\n                                          15\n\f              Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 16 of 23\n\n\nNow, Inc., 385 F.3d at 1331. Pouyeh states he included this claim in his proposed\n\nFourth Amended Complaint, but that has no effect, because (1) he was not given\n\nleave to file his proposed Fourth Amended Complaint, and (2) he has abandoned\n\nany argument the district judge erred in denying him leave to file it. See id. at\n\n1330. Therefore, Pouyeh’s attempt to raise a Title VI retaliation claim is\n\nunavailing.\n\nE.    Alleged Employment Discrimination, Counts 2 and 3\n\n      Pouyeh argues he proved a prima facie case of discrimination based on his\n\nnational origin, because (1) all seven slots during the three years he applied were\n\nfilled by “Americans”; (2) Pouyeh had prior ophthalmology, clinical, and other\n\nvaluable experiences the other applicants did not have; and (3) consequently, it\n\nreasonably could be assumed he was more qualified than those who were given\n\nresidency positions. Pouyeh also states Bascom Palmer’s alleged policy of not\n\nhiring graduates of foreign medical schools disproportionately affects\n\nforeign-born-medical students.\n\n      Title VII, the FCRA, and § 1981 all prohibit an employer from engaging in\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of an individual’s national origin. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1981, 2000e-2(a); Fla. Stat. § 760.10(1)(a). We have explained claims brought\n\nunder § 1981 and the FCRA need not be analyzed separately from Title VII claims,\n\nbased on the same conduct. See Rice-Lamar v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., 232\n\n\n                                          16\n\f             Case: 14-13704      Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 17 of 23\n\n\nF.3d 836, 843 n.11 (11th Cir. 2000) (“The elements of a claim of race\n\ndiscrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 are also the same as a Title VII disparate\n\ntreatment claim in the employment context.”); Harper v. Blockbuster Entm’t\n\nCorp., 139 F.3d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir. 1998) (“The Florida courts have held that\n\ndecisions construing Title VII are applicable when considering claims under the\n\n[FCRA], because the Florida act was patterned after Title VII.”).\n\n      Under Title VII, an employer may not “fail or refuse to hire . . . any\n\nindividual . . . because of such individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national\n\norigin.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1). Similarly, an employer may not “limit,\n\nsegregate, or classify his employees or applicants for employment in any way\n\nwhich would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\n\nopportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because of\n\nsuch individual’s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.” Id. § 2000e-2(a)(2).\n\nTitle VII provides that “an unlawful employment practice is established when the\n\ncomplaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\n\nwas a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors\n\nalso motivated the practice.” Id. § 2000e-2(m). There are two types of actionable\n\ndiscrimination under Title VII: disparate treatment and disparate impact. Spivey v.\n\nBeverly Enters., Inc., 196 F.3d 1309, 1312 (11th Cir. 1999). “Although proof of\n\ndiscriminatory intent is necessary for a plaintiff to succeed on a claim of disparate\n\n\n                                           17\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 18 of 23\n\n\ntreatment, a claim of disparate impact does not require evidence of intentional\n\ndiscrimination.” Id.\n\n      A potential employee may prove a prospective employer discriminated\n\nagainst him through direct or circumstantial evidence. E.E.O.C. v. Joe’s Stone\n\nCrabs, Inc., 296 F.3d 1265, 1272 (11th Cir. 2002). “Direct evidence of\n\ndiscrimination is evidence, that, if believed, proves the existence of a fact in issue\n\nwithout inference or presumption.” Id. (internal quotation marks and alterations\n\nomitted). With circumstantial evidence, a plaintiff may prove his case via the\n\nburden-shifting framework in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792,\n\n93 S. Ct. 1817 (1973). Id. Where a plaintiff seeks to prove his claims with\n\ncircumstantial evidence, “[i]n a traditional failure-to-hire case,” he establishes a\n\nprima facie case of disparate treatment by showing that: “(1) [he] was a member of\n\na protected class; (2) [he] applied and was qualified for a position for which the\n\nemployer was accepting applications; (3) despite [his] qualifications, [he] was not\n\nhired; and (4) the position remained open or was filled by another person outside\n\nof [his] protected class.” Id. at 1273. “Although a Title VII complaint need not\n\nallege facts sufficient to make out a classic McDonnell Douglas prima facie case, it\n\nmust provide enough factual matter (taken as true) to suggest intentional . . .\n\ndiscrimination.” Davis v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consol., 516 F.3d 955, 974\n\n(11th Cir. 2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n\n                                          18\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 19 of 23\n\n\n      A plaintiff may prove a prima facie case of disparate impact discrimination\n\nby the following two-step process: “First the plaintiff must identify the specific\n\nemployment practice that allegedly has a disproportionate impact. Second, the\n\nplaintiff must demonstrate causation by offering statistical evidence sufficient to\n\nshow that the challenged practice has resulted in prohibited discrimination.”\n\nSpivey, 196 F.3d at 1314 (citation omitted).\n\n      We do not analyze Pouyeh’s Title VII, FCRA, and § 1981 claims in Counts\n\n2 and 3 separately, because the two counts allege the same intentional\n\ndiscrimination based on the same facts. See Rice-Lamar, 232 F.3d at 843 n.11;\n\nHarper, 139 F.3d at 1387. The district judge properly dismissed Pouyeh’s\n\ndiscrimination claims, since Pouyeh did not provide sufficient factual matter to\n\nsuggest discrimination. See Davis, 516 F.3d at 974. First, Pouyeh failed to state a\n\nplausible claim of disparate treatment discrimination. He pled two of the four\n\nrequirements to establish a prima facie case of discrimination: (1) he was a\n\nmember of a protected class, based on his national origin, and (2) the residency\n\nposition was filled by someone outside of his protected class. See Joe’s Stone\n\nCrabs, Inc., 296 F.3d at 1273. Nevertheless, Pouyeh failed to provide sufficient\n\nfactual matter to show he was qualified for the position. See id. He alleged in\n\nconclusory fashion he was qualified; he stated he had graduated from medical\n\nschool in Iran and had clinical and research experience, but he did not allege the\n\n\n                                          19\n\f              Case: 14-13704       Date Filed: 05/28/2015      Page: 20 of 23\n\n\nspecific qualifications necessary for resident physicians at Bascom Palmer or that\n\nhe had fulfilled them. Pouyeh’s allegation he was qualified for the position\n\namounts to a threadbare recital of an element of his Title VII claim, which the\n\ndistrict judge was not obligated to accept as true. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129\n\nS. Ct. at 1949.\n\n       Pouyeh alleges Bascom Palmer had a policy of not accepting graduates of\n\nforeign medical schools. This allegation cuts against Pouyeh’s allegations of\n\ndiscrimination, because it suggests one of the necessary qualifications to be a\n\nresident physician at Bascom Palmer is graduating from an American medical\n\nschool. Moreover, the most plausible explanation for Pouyeh’s application being\n\nrejected is the foreign medical school from which he graduated was not among the\n\nrecognized medical schools. On the facts alleged in Pouyeh’s complaint, his\n\nallegation of discrimination based on national origin amounted to no more than “an\n\nunadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n\n678, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Construed liberally, Pouyeh’s complaint also sought to raise a disparate\n\nimpact claim, based on Bascom Palmer’s alleged policy of not hiring graduates of\n\nforeign medical schools. 3 Nevertheless, Pouyeh did not allege any facts in his\n\n\n       3\n         Pouyeh states on appeal he did not raise a disparate impact claim, because the alleged\ndiscrimination was intentional. Nevertheless, we construe his Third Amended Complaint to raise\n\n\n                                              20\n\f               Case: 14-13704        Date Filed: 05/28/2015       Page: 21 of 23\n\n\ncomplaint, such as statistics, sufficient to show the practice of not hiring graduates\n\nof foreign medical schools has resulted in prohibited discrimination. See Spivey,\n\n196 F.3d at 1314. Instead, he stated he knew of only one other immigrant Iranian\n\ndoctor, who had applied and not obtained a residency position; however, he did not\n\nprovide any information about that individual’s background. Even if accepted as\n\ntrue, that fact is insufficient to show the alleged practice of not hiring graduates of\n\nforeign medical institutions resulted in prohibited discrimination, since it gives no\n\ninsight into statistical information. See Spivey, 196 F.3d at 1314. Pouyeh makes\n\nsome conclusory assertions regarding statistical disparities in his reply brief, but\n\nthose assertions are unavailing, because they are speculative and were not argued\n\nin his initial brief on appeal. See Timson, 518 F.3d at 874. Therefore, Pouyeh’s\n\nThird Amended Complaint did not state a plausible disparate impact claim.\n\nF.     FCRA Discrimination in Obtaining a Medical License, Count 6\n\n       Pouyeh argues the district judge improperly reasoned the individual\n\ndefendants could not be sued under the FCRA. Under the FCRA:\n\n               Whenever, in order to engage in a profession, occupation,\n               or trade, it is required that a person receive a license,\n               certification, or other credential, become a member or an\n               associate of any club, association, or other organization,\n\n\nsuch a claim, because (1) it referenced Bascom Palmer’s alleged policy of excluding graduates\nof foreign medical schools, and (2) on appeal, he argues that policy had a disproportionate effect\non foreign-born, medical-school graduates. See Spivey, 196 F.3d at 1314 (explaining the\nrequirements of disparate impact claims).\n\n\n                                                21\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 22 of 23\n\n\n             or pass any examination, it is an unlawful employment\n             practice for any person to discriminate against any other\n             person seeking such license, certification, or other\n             credential, seeking to become a member or associate of\n             such club, association, or other organization, or seeking\n             to take or pass such examination, because of such other\n             person’s race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age,\n             handicap, or marital status.\n\nFla. Stat. § 760.10(5).\n\n      Even if Pouyeh is correct that he can raise a claim against the individual\n\ndefendants under § 760.10(5), the record provides ample support for the dismissal.\n\nSee Seminole Tribe of Fla., 750 F.3d at 1242 (recognizing we may affirm for any\n\nreason supported by the record). Pouyeh’s claim in Count 6 was based on the\n\nsame conduct as his discrimination claims in Counts 2 and 3, the denial of his\n\napplication for a residency position. As we have explained, his discrimination\n\nallegations were too conclusory to survive dismissal. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678,\n\n129 S. Ct. at 1949.\n\n                              III.   CONCLUSION\n\n      Pouyeh has failed to show the standards for deciding motions to dismiss set\n\nforth in Iqbal and Twombly are unconstitutional. Under those standards, the\n\ndistrict judge properly dismissed Counts 1, 2, 3, and 6 against the individual\n\ndefendants, because those counts do not state a plausible claim for relief. Pouyeh\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\f               Case: 14-13704       Date Filed: 05/28/2015       Page: 23 of 23\n\n\nhas abandoned any argument the district judge erred in dismissing Counts 4, 5, 6\n\nagainst the Trust and Bascom Palmer, and Counts 7, 8, and 9. 4\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          Because we have affirmed the district judge’s dismissal of Counts 1, 2, 3, and 6 against\nthe individual defendants on the basis that Pouyeh’s claims were too conclusory to state plausible\nclaims for relief, we do not address the alternative arguments raised by Bascom Palmer: (1) it\nwas a fictitious entity that could not be sued; and (2) even if it could be sued, it was not sued\nproperly, because it was not Pouyeh’s actual or prospective employer. For the same reason, we\ndo not address Pouyeh’s argument Bascom Palmer was the Trust’s agent for purposes of the\nresidency program.\n\n\n                                               23\n\f",

We affirm.\n\n\n                              I.      BACKGROUND\n\nA.    Complaint Allegations\n\n      Bascom Palmer Eye Institute (“Bascom Palmer”), which is a part of the\n\nUniversity of Miami (“the University”), houses an ophthalmology residency\n\nprogram at its facility. Each year, seven physicians are offered positions as\n\nresidents in the ophthalmology residency program. All seven positions are filled\n\nthrough the Association of University Professors Ophthalmology Matching\n\nProgram. “Graduates of recognized medical schools” are eligible to enter the\n\nresidency program. R. at 289. A Basic Affiliation Agreement (“BAA”) between\n\nthe University of Miami and the Public Health Trust of Jackson Health System\n\n(“the Trust”) sets forth how the residency programs under the Trust’s auspices are\n\nconducted, including the ophthalmology residency program at Bascom Palmer.\n\nThe BAA provides that residents are not students of the University, but rather are\n\nfull-time employees.\n\n\n\n                                            2\n\f              Case: 14-13704       Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 3 of 23\n\n\n      Pouyeh is from Iran; he attended medical school there. In 2010, 2011, and\n\n2012, he applied for a position as an ophthalmology resident at Bascom Palmer.\n\nPouyeh alleged he had the following qualifications for the position: (1) scoring in\n\nthe 99th and 96th percentiles on unspecified tests, (2) having recommendation\n\nletters, (3) having two years of research and clinical experience in ophthalmology,\n\n(4) giving presentations and publishing papers in ophthalmology, (5) being an\n\nauthor and reviewer for the American Academy of Ophthalmology Journal,\n\n(6) writing a book chapter about a topic in ophthalmology, and (7) being a top\n\nstudent in medical school in Iran. During this period, Pouyeh also was a volunteer-\n\nresearch fellow at Bascom Palmer. He was not selected for a residency position\n\nfor any of the years he applied.\n\n      After Pouyeh was not selected for a 2011 residency position, he filed a\n\ncomplaint on January 23, 2012, with the Equal Employment Opportunity\n\nCommission (“EEOC”) and alleged discrimination. In his EEOC complaint,\n\nPouyeh alleged he had applied for the residency program in 2011 and was not\n\nselected because of his national origin. He stated specifically that program\n\ndirector, Dr. Stephen Gedde, and other faculty members had told him Bascom\n\nPalmer does not “hire doctors for residency in eye surgery who are graduates from\n\na medical school outside of the United States.” R. at 284. In July or August 2012,\n\nPouyeh’s volunteer-research position was terminated. On December 6, 2012,\n\n\n                                            3\n\f              Case: 14-13704    Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 4 of 23\n\n\nPouyeh went to Bascom Palmer to attend a weekly continuing-medical-education\n\nconference open to doctors and other healthcare professionals. While Pouyeh was\n\nusing the restroom at Bascom Palmer, security guards threw him on the floor and\n\ndetained him there until the police arrived and arrested him for trespassing.\n\n      Pouyeh’s Third Amended Complaint contained nine counts of\n\ndiscrimination and named as defendants Bascom Palmer; the Trust; Dr. Gedde and\n\nthe members of the Residency Selection Committee (Dr. James Banta, Dr. Craig\n\nMcKeown, Dr. Richard Lee, Dr. Wendy Lee, Dr. Audina Berrocal) (collectively,\n\n“the individual defendants”); Bascom Palmer Chairman Dr. Eduardo C. Alfonso,\n\nand Trust Associate Dean of Graduate Medical Education, Dr. Richard Parish.\n\nCounts 1 through 4 were against Bascom Palmer and the Trust. Counts 1 through\n\n3 concerned Pouyeh’s allegation his application for a position as a resident was\n\ndenied. In each of the counts, he alleged specifically (1) he had applied for the\n\nposition; (2) he was not interviewed; (3) he was treated differently than American\n\ninterviewees; (4) Bascom Palmer and the Trust knew of his national origin or\n\nalienage; (5) other immigrant Iranian doctors also were excluded from interviews;\n\nand (6) his national origin or alienage was a motivating factor in declining to\n\ninterview him.\n\n      In Count 1, Pouyeh alleged Bascom Palmer and the Trust engaged in\n\neducation-based discrimination, in violation of Title VI, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d, by\n\n\n                                          4\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 5 of 23\n\n\ndenying his application for a residency position. Additionally, Pouyeh alleged he\n\nwas deprived of the ability to participate in the weekly continuing-medical-\n\neducation conference, because of his national origin. In Count 2, Pouyeh alleged\n\nBascom Palmer and the Trust engaged in employment discrimination, in violation\n\nof Title VII, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1), and the Florida Civil Rights Act\n\n(“FCRA”), Fla. Stat. § 760.10 by denying his application to the residency program.\n\nIn Count 3, Pouyeh alleged Bascom Palmer and the Trust engaged in employment\n\ndiscrimination for failing to hire him, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. In Count 4,\n\nPouyeh alleged Bascom Palmer and the Trust retaliated against him and violated\n\nTitle VII and the FCRA, by (1) terminating his volunteer-research position after he\n\nfiled his EEOC complaint, (2) failing to hire him for a 2012 resident position, and\n\n(3) having him arrested for trespassing. In Count 5, Pouyeh named Bascom\n\nPalmer, the Trust, and Dr. Gedde as defendants; he alleged 42 U.S.C. § 1981\n\nretaliation on the same basis as Count 4.\n\n      Count 6 named as defendants Bascom Palmer, the Trust, and the individual\n\ndefendants. Pouyeh alleged the defendants engaged in FCRA discrimination by\n\npreventing him from obtaining a medical license. In Count 7, Pouyeh alleged Dr.\n\nGedde and the other individual defendants deprived him of his due process right to\n\nemployment, education, and to obtain a medical license, in violation of 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983. In Count 8, Pouyeh alleged the individual defendants conspired to\n\n\n                                            5\n\f              Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 6 of 23\n\n\ninterfere with his constitutional rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1985, on a\n\nsimilar basis. In Count 9, Pouyeh alleged Dr. Eduardo, Dr. Parish, and the\n\nmembers of the Residency Selection Committee negligently failed to prevent the\n\nconspiracy from depriving him of his civil rights, in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1986.\n\nB.    Dismissal of Proposed Amended Complaint\n\n      Bascom Palmer, the Trust, and the individual defendants all filed motions to\n\ndismiss Pouyeh’s Third Amended Complaint. Thereafter, Pouyeh filed a motion to\n\namend his complaint further and to join additional defendants. He attached to his\n\nmotion a proposed Fourth Amended Complaint. A magistrate judge issued a\n\nReport and Recommendation (“R&R”), recommending some of Pouyeh’s claims\n\nbe dismissed. The magistrate judge recommended granting Bascom Palmer’s\n\nmotion to dismiss Counts 1 through 6, because (1) the University, not Bascom\n\nPalmer, was the proper defendant; and (2) under the BAA, the University did not\n\nassert sufficient control over the residency program to be Pouyeh’s prospective\n\nemployer.\n\n      The magistrate judge then addressed the Trust’s motion to dismiss. At the\n\noutset, she explained, although Pouyeh purported to raise a claim of Title VI\n\neducation discrimination in Count 1, it was more correctly construed as a claim of\n\nemployment discrimination, because residents were employees, not students, under\n\nthe BAA. The magistrate judge recommended Count 1 be dismissed with\n\n\n                                           6\n\f              Case: 14-13704    Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 7 of 23\n\n\nprejudice for failure to allege the Trust received federal funding for the primary\n\npurpose of employment. She recommended the Trust’s motion be denied\n\nregarding the Title VII and FCRA claims in Counts 2, 4, and 6. She further\n\nrecommended the Trust’s motion be granted concerning the § 1981 claims in\n\nCounts 3 and 5.\n\n      The magistrate judge also recommended the individual defendants’ motion\n\nto dismiss be granted with respect to the § 1981 and FCRA claims in Counts 5 and\n\n6. She explained the claim of FCRA discrimination in obtaining a medical license\n\nin Count 6 was not cognizable against individuals. She recommended the\n\nindividual defendants’ motion be denied with respect to the §§ 1983, 1985, and\n\n1986 claims in Counts 7 through 9. The magistrate judge further recommended\n\nPouyeh’s request to file his proposed Fourth Amended Complaint be denied,\n\nbecause it failed to comport with federal and local rules of procedure, but he\n\nshould be given one final opportunity to file an amended complaint.\n\n      Over Pouyeh’s objections, the district judge adopted the R&R in part,\n\ndismissed his Third Amended Complaint with prejudice but denied him leave to\n\nfile another amended complaint. The judge determined the Third Amended\n\nComplaint failed to state a claim against Bascom Palmer, because Bascom Palmer\n\nwas not Pouyeh’s prospective employer under the BAA. The judge adopted the\n\nrecommendation of the R&R that Count 1 be dismissed with prejudice regarding\n\n\n                                          7\n\f                Case: 14-13704       Date Filed: 05/28/2015          Page: 8 of 23\n\n\nthe Trust, and Counts 5 and 6 be dismissed with prejudice regarding the individual\n\ndefendants. Concerning the remaining claims, the judge determined Pouyeh’s\n\nThird Amended Complaint failed to provide sufficient facts to state a plausible\n\nclaim for discrimination.\n\n                                    II.    DISCUSSION\n\nA.    Incorporation of Arguments\n\n      As an initial matter, in several places in Pouyeh’s initial and reply briefs, he\n\npurports to incorporate arguments raised in other documents. For example, he\n\npurports to incorporate portions of his Third Amended Complaint and arguments\n\nmade in a motion he filed in this Court to have the standard for deciding motions to\n\ndismiss set forth in Iqbal1 and Twombly2 declared unconstitutional. In his reply\n\nbrief, he purports to incorporate all arguments he plans to present in his opening\n\nand reply briefs in a different appeal pending before this court.\n\n      “[A]lthough we are to give liberal construction to the pleadings of pro se\n\nlitigants, we nevertheless have required them to conform to procedural rules.”\n\nAlbra v.

See\n\nTimson, 518 F.3d at 874. We will not consider any argument raised in his other\n\nappeal that also is not raised in his initial brief in this appeal. See id. His\n\npurported incorporation by reference of his pleadings in district court similarly\n\nfails to comply with the Rules of Appellate Procedure. See Albra, 490 F.3d at 829;\n\nFour Seasons Hotels & Resorts, B.V., 377 F.3d at 1167 n.4. Finally, his purported\n\nadoption of his motion to have Iqbal and Twombly deemed unconstitutional is\n\nineffective, because a panel of this court has already denied that motion.\n\nB.    Abandoned Issues\n\n      We first determine Pouyeh has abandoned any argument the district judge\n\nerred in dismissing Counts 4, 5, 6 (against the Trust and Bascom Palmer), 7, 8, and\n\n9 from his Third Amended Complaint. He also has abandoned any argument the\n\ndistrict judge erred in denying his motion to amend. An issue not briefed on\n\nappeal by a pro se litigant is deemed abandoned, and its merits will not be\n\n\n                                            9\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 10 of 23\n\n\naddressed.

Airlines Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76731\"><a href=\"/opinion/76731/access-now-inc-v-southwest-airlines-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1324</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1330 (11th Cir. 2004). “[A]n appellant abandons a claim when he\n\neither makes only passing references to it or raises it in a perfunctory manner\n\nwithout supporting arguments and authority.” Sapuppo v. Allstate Floridian Ins.\n\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">739</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">678</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 681 (11th Cir. 2014).\n\n      Although Pouyeh provides argument concerning the dismissal of his\n\ndiscrimination claims under Title VII, the FCRA, § 1981, and the dismissal of his\n\n§ 1981 retaliation claim, he does not discuss the Title VII and FCRA retaliation he\n\nalleged in Count 4. See Timson, 518 F.3d at 874. In his initial brief, Pouyeh does\n\nnot discuss his §§ 1983, 1985, and 1986 claims in Counts 7, 8, and 9. See Timson,\n\n518 F.3d at 874. In his reply brief, Pouyeh argues Bascom Palmer’s alleged policy\n\nof excluding graduates of foreign medical schools violates his equal protection\n\nrights and § 1983; that argument, however, is insufficient to raise the issue on\n\nappeal, because a litigant may not raise an issue on appeal for the first time in a\n\nreply brief. See Timson, 518 F.3d at 874. While Pouyeh provides some argument\n\nrelated to Count 6, the FCRA claim related to his inability to obtain a medical\n\nlicense, his argument is limited to the improper dismissal of the claim against the\n\nindividual defendants. Therefore, he has abandoned any argument the district\n\njudge erred in dismissing Count 6 against the Trust and Bascom Palmer. See\n\nTimson, 518 F.3d at 874; Access Now, Inc., 385 F.3d at 1330.\n\n\n                                           10\n\f               Case: 14-13704   Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 11 of 23\n\n\n      Similarly, Pouyeh provides no meaningful argument the district judge erred\n\nin dismissing his § 1981 retaliation claim in Count 5. See Timson, 518 F.3d at 874;\n\nAccess Now, Inc., 385 F.3d at 1330. Pouyeh raises several arguments in his initial\n\nbrief related to the magistrate judge’s reasoning for recommending Count 5 be\n\ndismissed, but those arguments are unavailing, because the district judge\n\n(1) declined to adopt that portion of the R&R, and (2) dismissed the Third\n\nAmended Complaint, since the complaint was too conclusory to survive a motion\n\nto dismiss, not for the reasons given in the R&R.\n\n      Finally, Pouyeh provides no argument related to the denial of his motion to\n\namend in his initial brief or reply brief; therefore, he has abandoned the issue. See\n\nTimson, 518 F.3d at 874; Access Now, Inc., 385 F.3d at 1330. Although he makes\n\npassing references to his motion to amend and his proposed Fourth Amended\n\nComplaint, those references are insufficient to raise the issue. See Sapuppo, 739\n\nF.3d at 681.\n\nC.    Constitutionality of Iqbal and Twombly\n\n      On appeal, Pouyeh argues the standard for determining\n\nFederal Rule Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss set forth by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Iqbal and Twombly is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has not\n\noverturned either of those decisions; they remain controlling law. See Jaffree v.\n\nWallace, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1526</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1532 (11th Cir. 1983) (“Federal district courts and circuit\n\n\n                                         11\n\f             Case: 14-13704      Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 12 of 23\n\n\ncourts are bound to adhere to the controlling decisions of the United States\n\nSupreme Court.”). Pouyeh’s constitutional challenge to Iqbal and Twombly is\n\nmeritless.\n\nD.    Title VI Discrimination, Count 1\n\n      Pouyeh argues the district judge misconstrued his Title VI claim as one\n\nalleging employment discrimination, rather than education discrimination. He\n\nargues ophthalmology-resident positions are dual employment and education\n\npositions; consequently, they are open to a Title VI education-discrimination\n\nchallenge. Because his claim was one of education discrimination, Pouyeh argues\n\nhis allegation in his Third Amended Complaint that Bascom Palmer received\n\nfederal financial assistance was sufficient to sue the Trust, because the two entities\n\ncollaborated in running the ophthalmology-residency program. He also maintains\n\nhis trespassing arrest was an act of retaliation for his having sued Bascom Palmer\n\nfor discrimination, which allegedly supports a claim of Title VI retaliation.\n\n      We review de novo a district judge’s grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule\n\n12(b)(6).

Access\n\nNow, Inc., 385 F.3d at 1331.\n\n      A complaint must contain “a short and plain statement of the claim showing\n\nthat the pleader is entitled to relief.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). This pleading standard\n\n“does not require detailed factual allegations, but it demands more than an\n\nunadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n\n678, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (internal quotation marks omitted). “A pleading that offers\n\nlabels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\n\nwill not do.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, a complaint must\n\ncontain more than “naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancement.” Id.\n\n(alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). “To survive a motion to dismiss,\n\na complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, to state a claim\n\nfor relief that is plausible on its face.” Id. (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\nplaintiff must plead sufficient facts to allow the district judge to draw a reasonable\n\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct. Id. “The plausibility\n\nstandard . . . asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted\n\nunlawfully.” Id.\n\n      In ruling on a motion to dismiss, a judge must accept as true all of the\n\nallegations contained in a complaint but need not accept legal conclusions:\n\n“Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere\n\n\n                                          13\n\f              Case: 14-13704      Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 14 of 23\n\n\nconclusory statements, do not suffice.” Id.

In the Rule 12(b) motion-to-dismiss\n\ncontext, a judge generally may not consider materials outside of the four corners of\n\na complaint without first converting the motion to dismiss into a motion for\n\nsummary judgment. Day v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789570\"><a href=\"/opinion/789570/dl-day-nick-ceh-v-john-t-taylor-e-joseph-shoen-u-haul/\"><span class=\"volume\">400</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1272</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1275-76 (11th Cir. 2005). A\n\ncourt may consider a document that has been attached to a motion to dismiss,\n\nhowever, if it is central to the plaintiff’s claims and its authenticity is not\n\nchallenged. Id. at 1276.\n\n      Title VI provides that “[n]o person in the United States shall, on the ground\n\nof race, color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the\n\nbenefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity\n\nreceiving Federal financial assistance.” 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. Pouyeh consistently\n\nhas maintained his Title VI claim is one of education, not employment\n\ndiscrimination. Consequently, we do not consider the merits of the district judge’s\n\ndismissal of any Title VI employment claim. We also note we may consider the\n\nBAA, even though it was not attached to the complaint. See Day, 400 F.3d at\n\n1275-76. Although attached to Bascom Palmer’s motion to dismiss, the operative\n\nBAA was central to Pouyeh’s claims against Bascom Palmer, and Pouyeh\n\nreferenced the BAA specifically in his complaint. See id. Moreover, Pouyeh has\n\n\n                                            14\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 15 of 23\n\n\nnot disputed the authenticity of the BAA. See id. at 1276. Based on the denial of\n\nhis residency application, Pouyeh’s claim of Title VI education discrimination is\n\nflawed, because the BAA makes clear medical residents are employees, not\n\nstudents. Therefore, Pouyeh has failed to show that, as a prospective medical\n\nresident, he was excluded from, denied participation in, or denied the benefits of an\n\neducational, rather than employment, program or activity. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d.\n\n      Pouyeh’s allegation that he suffered education discrimination because he\n\nwas barred from attending the weekly medical conference also falls short of stating\n\na plausible claim for relief. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129 S. Ct. at 1949. His\n\nThird Amended Complaint contained a claim he was barred access to a weekly\n\nmorning-medical conference at Bascom Palmer at the time he was arrested for\n\ntrespassing. His claim falls short, because Pouyeh’s allegation his exclusion was\n\nmotivated by his national origin is wholly conclusory. See id. Pouyeh simply\n\nasserted he was arrested for trespassing because of his national origin, but that\n\namounts to “an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted). Because he failed to allege sufficient facts to\n\nshow plausibly his arrest for trespassing was improperly motivated by his national\n\norigin, his Title VI claim in Count 1 properly was dismissed. See id.\n\n      Pouyeh did not include a Title VI retaliation claim argument in his Third\n\nAmended Complaint; consequently, he may not raise it on appeal. See Access\n\n\n                                          15\n\f              Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 16 of 23\n\n\nNow, Inc., 385 F.3d at 1331. Pouyeh states he included this claim in his proposed\n\nFourth Amended Complaint, but that has no effect, because (1) he was not given\n\nleave to file his proposed Fourth Amended Complaint, and (2) he has abandoned\n\nany argument the district judge erred in denying him leave to file it. See id. at\n\n1330. Therefore, Pouyeh’s attempt to raise a Title VI retaliation claim is\n\nunavailing.\n\nE.    Alleged Employment Discrimination, Counts 2 and 3\n\n      Pouyeh argues he proved a prima facie case of discrimination based on his\n\nnational origin, because (1) all seven slots during the three years he applied were\n\nfilled by “Americans”; (2) Pouyeh had prior ophthalmology, clinical, and other\n\nvaluable experiences the other applicants did not have; and (3) consequently, it\n\nreasonably could be assumed he was more qualified than those who were given\n\nresidency positions. Pouyeh also states Bascom Palmer’s alleged policy of not\n\nhiring graduates of foreign medical schools disproportionately affects\n\nforeign-born-medical students.\n\n      Title VII, the FCRA, and § 1981 all prohibit an employer from engaging in\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of an individual’s national origin. See 42 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1981, 2000e-2(a); Fla. Stat. § 760.10(1)(a). We have explained claims brought\n\nunder § 1981 and the FCRA need not be analyzed separately from Title VII claims,\n\nbased on the same conduct. See Rice-Lamar v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., 232\n\n\n                                          16\n\f             Case: 14-13704      Date Filed: 05/28/2015    Page: 17 of </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">836</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 843 n.11 (11th Cir. 2000) (“The elements of a claim of race\n\ndiscrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 are also the same as a Title VII disparate\n\ntreatment claim in the employment context.”); Harper v.

Second, the\n\nplaintiff must demonstrate causation by offering statistical evidence sufficient to\n\nshow that the challenged practice has resulted in prohibited discrimination.”\n\nSpivey, 196 F.3d at 1314 (citation omitted).\n\n      We do not analyze Pouyeh’s Title VII, FCRA, and § 1981 claims in Counts\n\n2 and 3 separately, because the two counts allege the same intentional\n\ndiscrimination based on the same facts. See Rice-Lamar, 232 F.3d at 843 n.11;\n\nHarper, 139 F.3d at 1387. The district judge properly dismissed Pouyeh’s\n\ndiscrimination claims, since Pouyeh did not provide sufficient factual matter to\n\nsuggest discrimination. See Davis, 516 F.3d at 974. First, Pouyeh failed to state a\n\nplausible claim of disparate treatment discrimination. He pled two of the four\n\nrequirements to establish a prima facie case of discrimination: (1) he was a\n\nmember of a protected class, based on his national origin, and (2) the residency\n\nposition was filled by someone outside of his protected class. See Joe’s Stone\n\nCrabs, Inc., 296 F.3d at 1273. Nevertheless, Pouyeh failed to provide sufficient\n\nfactual matter to show he was qualified for the position. See id. He alleged in\n\nconclusory fashion he was qualified; he stated he had graduated from medical\n\nschool in Iran and had clinical and research experience, but he did not allege the\n\n\n                                          19\n\f              Case: 14-13704       Date Filed: 05/28/2015      Page: 20 of 23\n\n\nspecific qualifications necessary for resident physicians at Bascom Palmer or that\n\nhe had fulfilled them. Pouyeh’s allegation he was qualified for the position\n\namounts to a threadbare recital of an element of his Title VII claim, which the\n\ndistrict judge was not obligated to accept as true. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678, 129\n\nS. Ct. at 1949.\n\n       Pouyeh alleges Bascom Palmer had a policy of not accepting graduates of\n\nforeign medical schools. This allegation cuts against Pouyeh’s allegations of\n\ndiscrimination, because it suggests one of the necessary qualifications to be a\n\nresident physician at Bascom Palmer is graduating from an American medical\n\nschool. Moreover, the most plausible explanation for Pouyeh’s application being\n\nrejected is the foreign medical school from which he graduated was not among the\n\nrecognized medical schools. On the facts alleged in Pouyeh’s complaint, his\n\nallegation of discrimination based on national origin amounted to no more than “an\n\nunadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.” Iqbal, 556 U.S. at\n\n678, 129 S. Ct. at 1949 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n       Construed liberally, Pouyeh’s complaint also sought to raise a disparate\n\nimpact claim, based on Bascom Palmer’s alleged policy of not hiring graduates of\n\nforeign medical schools. 3 Nevertheless, Pouyeh did not allege any facts in his\n\n\n       3\n         Pouyeh states on appeal he did not raise a disparate impact claim, because the alleged\ndiscrimination was intentional. Nevertheless, we construe his Third Amended Complaint to raise\n\n\n                                              20\n\f               Case: 14-13704        Date Filed: 05/28/2015       Page: 21 of 23\n\n\ncomplaint, such as statistics, sufficient to show the practice of not hiring graduates\n\nof foreign medical schools has resulted in prohibited discrimination. See Spivey,\n\n196 F.3d at 1314. Instead, he stated he knew of only one other immigrant Iranian\n\ndoctor, who had applied and not obtained a residency position; however, he did not\n\nprovide any information about that individual’s background. Even if accepted as\n\ntrue, that fact is insufficient to show the alleged practice of not hiring graduates of\n\nforeign medical institutions resulted in prohibited discrimination, since it gives no\n\ninsight into statistical information. See Spivey, 196 F.3d at 1314. Pouyeh makes\n\nsome conclusory assertions regarding statistical disparities in his reply brief, but\n\nthose assertions are unavailing, because they are speculative and were not argued\n\nin his initial brief on appeal. See Timson, 518 F.3d at 874. Therefore, Pouyeh’s\n\nThird Amended Complaint did not state a plausible disparate impact claim.\n\nF.     FCRA Discrimination in Obtaining a Medical License, Count 6\n\n       Pouyeh argues the district judge improperly reasoned the individual\n\ndefendants could not be sued under the FCRA. Under the FCRA:\n\n               Whenever, in order to engage in a profession, occupation,\n               or trade, it is required that a person receive a license,\n               certification, or other credential, become a member or an\n               associate of any club, association, or other organization,\n\n\nsuch a claim, because (1) it referenced Bascom Palmer’s alleged policy of excluding graduates\nof foreign medical schools, and (2) on appeal, he argues that policy had a disproportionate effect\non foreign-born, medical-school graduates. See Spivey, 196 F.3d at 1314 (explaining the\nrequirements of disparate impact claims).\n\n\n                                                21\n\f             Case: 14-13704     Date Filed: 05/28/2015   Page: 22 of 23\n\n\n             or pass any examination, it is an unlawful employment\n             practice for any person to discriminate against any other\n             person seeking such license, certification, or other\n             credential, seeking to become a member or associate of\n             such club, association, or other organization, or seeking\n             to take or pass such examination, because of such other\n             person’s race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age,\n             handicap, or marital status.\n\nFla. Stat. § 760.10(5).\n\n      Even if Pouyeh is correct that he can raise a claim against the individual\n\ndefendants under § 760.10(5), the record provides ample support for the dismissal.\n\nSee Seminole Tribe of Fla., 750 F.3d at 1242 (recognizing we may affirm for any\n\nreason supported by the record). Pouyeh’s claim in Count 6 was based on the\n\nsame conduct as his discrimination claims in Counts 2 and 3, the denial of his\n\napplication for a residency position. As we have explained, his discrimination\n\nallegations were too conclusory to survive dismissal. See Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678,\n\n129 S. Ct. at 1949.\n\n                              III.   CONCLUSION\n\n      Pouyeh has failed to show the standards for deciding motions to dismiss set\n\nforth in Iqbal and Twombly are unconstitutional. Under those standards, the\n\ndistrict judge properly dismissed Counts 1, 2, 3, and 6 against the individual\n\ndefendants, because those counts do not state a plausible claim for relief. Pouyeh\n\n\n\n\n                                         22\n\f               Case: 14-13704       Date Filed: 05/28/2015       Page: 23 of 23\n\n\nhas abandoned any argument the district judge erred in dismissing Counts 4, 5, 6\n\nagainst the Trust and Bascom Palmer, and Counts 7, 8, and 9. 4\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n          Because we have affirmed the district judge’s dismissal of Counts 1, 2, 3, and 6 against\nthe individual defendants on the basis that Pouyeh’s claims were too conclusory to state plausible\nclaims for relief, we do not address the alternative arguments raised by Bascom Palmer: (1) it\nwas a fictitious entity that could not be sued; and (2) even if it could be sued, it was not sued\nproperly, because it was not Pouyeh’s actual or prospective employer. For the same reason, we\ndo not address Pouyeh’s argument Bascom Palmer was the Trust’s agent for purposes of the\nresidency program.\n\n\n                                               23\n\f</pre>",
