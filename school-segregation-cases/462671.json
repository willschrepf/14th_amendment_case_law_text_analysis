The decree ordered the enforcement of the district court's 1968 order as subsequently modified, requiring the desegregation of public schools in Walton County, Georgia and in the City of Social Circle, Georgia.  On March 31, 1981 this court, in an unpublished opinion, remanded the case to the district court so that it could enter appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law relative to the various motions pending in the case.  On July 27, 1981, in response to our remand order, the district court entered its \"Order Disposing of All Pending Motions\".  The district court permitted the substitution of additional plaintiffs for the original named plaintiffs whose claims had become moot.  The district court also vacated its previous decisions allowing the Walton County parents to intervene.  The proposed intervenors filed their notice of appeal on July 31, 1981.  On November 6, 1981, the district court denied the appellant Walton County Board of Education's motion to modify its original desegregation decree.  The appellant county board filed its notice of appeal on November 30, 1981.  For purposes of efficiency we have consolidated these two appeals.  After reviewing the record, we hereby affirm that portion of the district court's July 27, 1981 order adding additional party plaintiffs.  Although no formal order of certification was entered by the district court, this case was in fact a class action, and members of the class may be substituted as named plaintiffs in order to preserve the action after the claims of the original named plaintiffs have become moot.  However, we reverse that portion of the order in which the district court vacated its previous orders allowing the county parents to intervene.  This court further affirms the district court's March 16, 1981 order refusing to amend its original 1968 desegregation order and return county children residing in zone five to Walton County schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suit was filed originally in 1968 as a class action on behalf of all black school children in Walton County, Georgia, to force the desegregation of public schools in the Walton County school system and the Social Circle school system.  The district judge hearing the case at that time treated the case as a class action, although there is nothing in the record that would indicate the case was ever certified as such.  On July 30, 1968, the district court entered a judgment desegregating the two school systems.  The provisions of the judgment relevant to this appeal pertain to an order of the court establishing attendance zone five in Walton County.  County children residing in zone five were to attend school in the adjacent, independent school district in the city of Social Circle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 8, 1971, appellant Walton County Board of Education moved the district court to amend its 1968 decree and to return county students residing in zone five to Walton County schools.  The district court denied this request.  Apparently, the attendance zone system operated effectively for many years, until the last few years when it was alleged that approximately one-hundred county children residing in zone five were attending Walton County schools.  In November 1979, the appellee Social Circle Board of Education moved the district court for an order enforcing the court's original 1968 decree.  At that point, a group of predominantly white parents, known as the Concerned Citizens of Walton County, moved the district court for permission to intervene in the case.  That motion was granted.  The appellants-intervenors immediately filed a motion to vacate the 1968 decree and dismiss the action for mootness, asserting that the graduation, or departure, from school of the original named plaintiffs and the failure of the district court to certify the case as a class action mooted the action.  In order to quell the mootness claim, a motion was filed to add two black children enrolled at Social Circle High School as plaintiffs in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 26, 1980, the district court entered an order amending its original 1968 decree by establishing new guidelines for the transfer of students; but, the order retained the provision requiring county children living in zone five to attend school in Social Circle.  The intervenors-appellants appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This court on March 13, 1981, in an unpublished opinion, remanded the case to the district court.  We found the record inadequate for appellate review inasmuch as the district court had before it several motions, based upon many of the same issues raised on appeal, upon which it had not ruled.  On July 27, 1981, the district court entered its \"Order Disposing of All Pending Motions\" adding additional plaintiffs and vacating its previous decision allowing the Walton County Parents to intervene.  The county parents appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 59, appellant Walton County Board of Education moved the district court for an express determination of its request to modify the original 1968 decree and to return zone five county students to Walton County schools.  On March 16, 1981, the district court denied the appellant county board's motion for relief.  The appellant county board appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>ISSUES ON APPEAL</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants-intervenors contend 1) that the lack of class certification of the action and the change in status of the original plaintiffs since the commencement of the suit rendered the action moot, thus depriving the district court of power to add additional plaintiffs under Fed.R.Civ.P. 21; and 2) that the district court in its order of July 27, 1981, improperly vacated its previous orders permitting Walton County parents to intervene in the case.  Appellant Walton County Board of Education asserts on appeal that the district court erred in refusing to amend its original desegregation decree, since changed circumstances justified the elimination of mandatory attendance zones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>RESOLUTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I. Plaintiffs Motion To Add Rule 21 Party Plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants-intervenors seek to set aside the July 27, 1981 order of the district court granting the appellee school board's motion to add plaintiffs under Fed.R.Civ.P. 21.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  The appellants-intervenors assert that the lack of class certification of the action and the graduation, or departure, of the original plaintiffs from the Social Circle school system rendered the action moot, thus depriving the district court of power to grant the subsequent motion to add the proposed party plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that the original plaintiffs in this action no longer have a live stake in its continued litigation; their claims are moot.  Article III of the Constitution imposes a threshold requirement that those who seek to invoke the power of federal courts must allege an actual case or controversy.  As noted by the Supreme Court in its per curiam opinion in DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312, 316, 94 S.Ct. 1704, 1705-1706, 40 L.Ed.2d 164 (1974) (citations omitted):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The starting point for analysis is the familiar proposition that 'federal courts are without power to decide questions that cannot affect the rights of litigants in the case before them' ...  The inability of the federal judiciary 'to review moot cases derives from the requirement of Art.  III of the Constitution under which the exercise of judicial power depends upon the existence of a case or controversy....'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Article III \"case or controversy\" jurisdictional requirement is further explicated by the Court in Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402, 95 S.Ct. 553, 558, 42 L.Ed.2d 532 (1975) (footnotes omitted):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>There must not only be a named plaintiff who has such a case or controversy at the time the complaint is filed, and at the time the class action is certified by the District Court pursuant to Rule 23, but there must be a live controversy at the time this Court reviews the case.  SEC v. Medical Committee for Human Rights (404 U.S. 403, 92 S.Ct. 577, 30 L.Ed.2d 560 (1972) ), supra.  The controversy may exist, however, between a named defendant and a member of the class represented by the named plaintiff, even though the claim of the above plaintiff has become moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although appellants-intervenors admit that the proposed plaintiffs have a live and concrete interest in the continuance of this litigation, they argue that the mootness of the claims of the original plaintiffs ends the case.  Appellants rely primarily on Indianapolis School Commissioners v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 95 S.Ct. 848, 43 L.Ed.2d 74 (1974) and its progeny.  In Jacobs the plaintiff prevailed both in the district court and in the court of appeals as if on a class action, although no order was officially entered certifying it as such.  During oral argument in the Supreme Court, it was revealed that the action was moot as to the individual plaintiff.  The Supreme Court determined that the mootness of the individual claim rendered the suit subject to dismissal, since in the absence of actual certification as a class action, the action remained, in the opinion of the Court, an individual action.  The Supreme Court accordingly vacated the judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants-intervenors cite several post-Jacobs cases holding that a court must dismiss an alleged class action where the individual claim of the purported class representative has become moot, in the absence of a proper certification of the class.  See Deposit Guaranty National Bank v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 100 S.Ct. 1166, 63 L.Ed.2d 427 (1980); Pasadena City Board of Education v. Spangler, 427 U.S. 424, 96 S.Ct. 2697, 49 L.Ed.2d 599 (1976); Sosna v. Iowa; Sannon v. United States, 631 F.2d 1247 (5th Cir. 1980).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not find appellants' reliance upon the Jacobs line of cases persuasive.  It is firmly established that where a class action exists, members of the class may intervene or be substituted as named plaintiffs in order to keep the action alive after the claims of the original named plaintiffs are rendered moot.  See Rogers v. Paul, 382 U.S. 198, 199, 86 S.Ct. 358, 359, 15 L.Ed.2d 265 (1965); Rodriguez v. East Texas Motor Freight, 505 F.2d 40 (5th Cir. 1974), cert. granted, 425 U.S. 990, 96 S.Ct. 2200, 48 L.Ed.2d 814 (1976); Bing v. Roadway Express, Inc., 485 F.2d 441 (5th Cir. 1973).  This procedure is deeply implemented in desegregation cases, where the mootness problem constantly arises because of protracted litigation and the eventual graduation of named plaintiffs.  The court in Kelley v. Metropolitan County Board of Education of Nashville, 463 F.2d 732, 743 (6th Cir. 1972), cert. denied, 409 U.S. 1001, 93 S.Ct. 322, 34 L.Ed.2d 262 (1972), faced with an attack on a desegregation decree that resulted from seventeen years of litigation, aptly noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>(S)uch a class action as this dealing with continuing constitutional violations does not become moot because of years of delay (much of it attributable to appellants) which occasioned the graduation of the named, original student plaintiffs from the school system before final decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants-intervenors argue, however, that this case is not a class action and therefore, as in the Jacobs line of cases, there is no viable action in which the proposed party plaintiffs could be added to, now that the claims of the original plaintiffs have been mooted.  After reviewing the record, we simply cannot accept this contention; we find this case to be a class action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case was filed as a class action and proceeded to trial as a class action.  The description of the class affected by the alleged discrimination in the complaint and the scope of the relief requested clearly indicate that the suit was intended to benefit the entire class.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a>  Although the complaint must have notified the defendant school boards that the original named plaintiffs sought class relief, the responsive pleading filed in this case \"neither admitted nor denied the specific allegations that this case should proceed as a class action....\"  Graves v. Walton County Board of Education, 91 F.R.D. 457, 460 (Dist.M.D.Ga.1981).  We infer from this silence that the defendant school boards knew of the class nature of this action and acquiesced in it.  Bing v. Roadway Express, Inc., 485 F.2d 441, 456 (5th Cir. 1981).  It is clear that throughout its pendency the district court regarded the case as a class action.  On May 14, 1968, the court entered an order which began:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>BOOTLE, District Judge:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs, suing for themselves and two classes, (1) Negro parents and pupils of the public schools of Walton County, Georgia who are similarly affected and injured by the action of the defendants in maintaining and operating a racially segregated school system, and (2) teachers in the public schools of said County similarly affected by alleged actions of the defendants in penalizing and suspending them and threatening so to do because of attempts to petition the defendants about the conditions within their racially segregated school system, bring their complaint against Walton County Board of Education (County Board)....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">300 F.Supp. 188 at 191 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, on July 30, 1968, in its memorandum opinion, the court adopted as its injunctive order a proposed decree prepared and agreed upon by the defendant school boards.  \"The decree as prepared by the (defendant school boards) and adopted by the court provide(d) relief not for the individual plaintiffs but for the entire plaintiff class of (black) parents and students.\"  91 F.R.D. at 464.  Throughout this process there was never a suggestion by anyone that the question of whether the plaintiff class should be certified was an issue to be decided.  The defendant school boards from the outset considered \"that the plaintiffs were entitled to injunctive relief and for their own benefit (consented to such relief and) urged the court to issue its decree.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having examined the record, it is clear that despite the lack of a formal order certifying this case as a class suit, this case was in fact a class action and was specifically described and treated as such by the parties and the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Bing v. Roadway Express, Inc., this court held that the district court's implicit determination of the class action question sufficed in a suit in which all the parties and the court proceeded off the assumption that the action was a class action, despite the fact that there existed no formal order of certification by the district court.  In Gore v. Turner, 563 F.2d 159 (5th Cir. 1977) we summarized our holding in Bing with the statement \"that a class action may be proper even if the trial court never made a formal, explicit determination pursuant to Rule 23(c)(1).\"  Id. at 165-66.  Additionally, in Johnson v. General Motors Corp., 598 F.2d 432 (5th Cir. 1979), this court was faced with an appeal in which a district court had obviously treated the case before it as a class action but had failed to enter a formal order of certification.  This court had to determine the binding effect of such a judgment on the case before us.  We held that \"since (the case) was in fact a class action and was plainly described and treated as such by both courts that considered it, under the authority of Bing the lack of formal certification does not detract from the validity or res judicata effect of the judgment.\"  Id. at 435.  In Sannon v. United States, 631 F.2d 1247 (5th Cir. 1980) this court reaffirmed the principle recognized in Bing.  There, in the face of petitioners' attempt to procure class wide relief despite having failed to move the trial court for a certification order throughout six litigious years, we distinguished the case on the basis that \"(i)n Bing and its progeny we were able to infer that the trial court (had) approved the class action nature, ... (of the lawsuits involved.)\"  Id. at 1251.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principle recognized in Bing is applicable in this instance since the record evinces the class action status of this case; despite the lack of a formal order of class certification, this case was in fact a class action and was specifically described and treated as such by the parties and the trial court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"To state at this late date that this was not a class action, 'would be to ignore the substance of the proceeding below in favor of an excessively formalistic adherence to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.' \"  Senter v. General Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, 522 (5th Cir. 1976) quoting Bing v. Roadway Express, Inc., at 447.  We affirm that portion of the district court's July 27, 1981 order adding additional party plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">II. Intervention by Concerned Citizens of Walton County.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its July 27, 1981 order, the district court vacated its previous decisions allowing the Concerned Citizens of Walton County to intervene.  The Walton County parent group appeal this denial claiming a right to intervene under Fed.R.Civ.P. 24(a)(2).  They also insist that permissive intervention was proper under section (b)(2) of that rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3-1\" id=\"fn3-1_ref\">3</a>  Concluding that the county parents have a right to intervene in this matter, and that the district court abused its discretion by not permitting their appearance, we reverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hines v. Rapides Parish School Board, 479 F.2d 762 (5th Cir. 1973), established guidelines for the application of Rule 24 to school desegregation cases.  There, \"this court explored when and by what means parent groups might present complaints growing out of desegregation litigation.  The proper course indicated was a petition for intervention.\"  Pate v. Dade County School Board, 588 F.2d 501, 503 (5th Cir. 1979).  The petition should \"bring to the attention of the district court the precise issues which the new group sought to represent and the ways in which the goal of a unitary system had allegedly been frustrated.\"  Hines at 765.  The district court could then determine whether these matters had been previously raised and resolved and whether the issues sought to be presented by the new group were currently known to the court and parties in the initial suit.  If the court finds that the issues raised by the movants \"have been previously determined or if it (finds) that the parties in the original action were aware of these issues and completely competent to represent the interests of the new group, it could deny intervention.  If the court felt that the new group had a significant claim which it could best represent, intervention would be allowed.\"  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the claimed right to intervene under subsection (2) of Rule 24(a), the district court, following the dictates of Hines, determined that the primary issue sought to be raised by the parent group-whether zone five county students should be permitted to return to Walton County schools-had been previously decided by the court in 1971.  The district court also concluded \"that the parties to the original lawsuit ... as evidenced by their vigorous representation of their respective, differing views to the court, (were) keenly aware of (the issues raised by the movants,) and completely competent to represent the interests of all parents and students of Walton County, including the intervenor parents and their children.\"  91 F.R.D. at 475.  We disagree with the district court's determinations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1971, the district court did in fact deny the appellant county board's request to modify its original desegregation decree and return zone five county students to Walton County Schools.  However, the Walton County parents' present request for relief from the 1968 desegregation order is not an attempt to relitigate the issues and facts raised in the previous request for relief.  Cisneros v. Corpus Christi Independent School District, 560 F.2d 190, 191 (5th Cir. 1977).  Key developments have taken place since the county board's request for relief in 1971.  As indicated in the record, it has become a long-standing practice for the officials of the appellant Walton County School Board and the appellee Social Circle School Board to routinely consent to the movement of particular students between attendance zones for compelling reasons of a non-racial nature.  (Tr., Nov. 26, 1979, Vol.  I, pg. 192-93).  Also, on August 26, 1980, the district court amended its 1968 decree with a formal order that provided for transfers of students from one zone to another by setting up reliable criteria for transfers due to a \"compelling non-racial reason.\"  (Tr., Aug. 26, 1980, Vol.  III, pg. 667).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The school boards' long-standing practice of permitting student transfers for compelling non-racial reasons appears sound.  The district court's subsequent modification of its 1968 decree ratifying such activity is approved.  However, these developments contradict the district court's conclusion that the movants' petition for intervention raises the same issues that it had previously entertained in 1971.  Over ten years of transfers have intervened.  Housing patterns may have changed.  The intervenors suggest that they are interested in today's problems.  This appears to be facially reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court further concluded that the existing parties in the case were keenly aware of the issues raised by the Walton County parents and could adequately represent their interest.

Appellee Social Circle School Board's motion for enforcement on November 7, 1979 specifically requested the return of all students residing in zone five to Social Circle schools.  Although the request for enforcement was directed to the movants' children and a ruling on such request would have a substantial impact on the lives and education of their children, neither school board has asserted the necessity of the Walton County parents being made a part of this litigation.  This becomes particularly egregious considering the failure of both boards to affirmatively assert what appears to be a tenable position for the movants: that both school boards permitted some student transfers out of zone five for compelling nonracial reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence of record reveals that the school boards' primary motivation for proposing and assisting in the implementation of the 1968 desegregation decree was to prevent the loss of federal aid to their school systems.  91 F.R.D. at 461-62.  It appears that as long as the desegregation order was insuring the continued receipt of federal funds the school boards were content with the directive, and had no motivation to represent the interests of the parent intervenors.  The school boards have expended great effort in litigating over state funds as well.  An interest in operating funds based upon numbers of students, however, does not equate with the criteria used for selecting specific students for particular schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the issues the parent intervenors sought to represent were not previously determined by the district court, and \"the new group had a significant claim which it could best represent, intervention (should have been permitted).\"  Hines at 765.

If successful in their purpose to thereby return all zone 5 outside of Social Circle children to county board schools, Social Circle's schools which are anticipated to have 557 white and 462 black students for the 1981-82 school year would have only 228 white and 367 black students-a change from the present 54% white and 46% black student body to a 38% white and 62% black student body.

Under Rule 24(b), a district court may permit intervention if to do so will not unduly delay or prejudice adjudication of the rights of the original parties.

The district court based its decision on United States v.

The decree ordered the enforcement of the district court's 1968 order as subsequently modified, requiring the desegregation of public schools in Walton County, Georgia and in the City of Social Circle, Georgia.  On March 31, 1981 this court, in an unpublished opinion, remanded the case to the district court so that it could enter appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law relative to the various motions pending in the case.  On July 27, 1981, in response to our remand order, the district court entered its \"Order Disposing of All Pending Motions\".  The district court permitted the substitution of additional plaintiffs for the original named plaintiffs whose claims had become moot.  The district court also vacated its previous decisions allowing the Walton County parents to intervene.  The proposed intervenors filed their notice of appeal on July 31, 1981.  On November 6, 1981, the district court denied the appellant Walton County Board of Education's motion to modify its original desegregation decree.  The appellant county board filed its notice of appeal on November 30, 1981.  For purposes of efficiency we have consolidated these two appeals.  After reviewing the record, we hereby affirm that portion of the district court's July 27, 1981 order adding additional party plaintiffs.  Although no formal order of certification was entered by the district court, this case was in fact a class action, and members of the class may be substituted as named plaintiffs in order to preserve the action after the claims of the original named plaintiffs have become moot.  However, we reverse that portion of the order in which the district court vacated its previous orders allowing the county parents to intervene.  This court further affirms the district court's March 16, 1981 order refusing to amend its original 1968 desegregation order and return county children residing in zone five to Walton County schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suit was filed originally in 1968 as a class action on behalf of all black school children in Walton County, Georgia, to force the desegregation of public schools in the Walton County school system and the Social Circle school system.  The district judge hearing the case at that time treated the case as a class action, although there is nothing in the record that would indicate the case was ever certified as such.  On July 30, 1968, the district court entered a judgment desegregating the two school systems.  The provisions of the judgment relevant to this appeal pertain to an order of the court establishing attendance zone five in Walton County.  County children residing in zone five were to attend school in the adjacent, independent school district in the city of Social Circle.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 8, 1971, appellant Walton County Board of Education moved the district court to amend its 1968 decree and to return county students residing in zone five to Walton County schools.  The district court denied this request.  Apparently, the attendance zone system operated effectively for many years, until the last few years when it was alleged that approximately one-hundred county children residing in zone five were attending Walton County schools.  In November 1979, the appellee Social Circle Board of Education moved the district court for an order enforcing the court's original 1968 decree.  At that point, a group of predominantly white parents, known as the Concerned Citizens of Walton County, moved the district court for permission to intervene in the case.  That motion was granted.  The appellants-intervenors immediately filed a motion to vacate the 1968 decree and dismiss the action for mootness, asserting that the graduation, or departure, from school of the original named plaintiffs and the failure of the district court to certify the case as a class action mooted the action.  In order to quell the mootness claim, a motion was filed to add two black children enrolled at Social Circle High School as plaintiffs in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 26, 1980, the district court entered an order amending its original 1968 decree by establishing new guidelines for the transfer of students; but, the order retained the provision requiring county children living in zone five to attend school in Social Circle.

We found the record inadequate for appellate review inasmuch as the district court had before it several motions, based upon many of the same issues raised on appeal, upon which it had not ruled.  On July 27, 1981, the district court entered its \"Order Disposing of All Pending Motions\" adding additional plaintiffs and vacating its previous decision allowing the Walton County Parents to intervene.

Throughout this process there was never a suggestion by anyone that the question of whether the plaintiff class should be certified was an issue to be decided.

This court had to determine the binding effect of such a judgment on the case before us.  We held that \"since (the case) was in fact a class action and was plainly described and treated as such by both courts that considered it, under the authority of Bing the lack of formal certification does not detract from the validity or res judicata effect of the judgment.\"  Id. at 435.

There, in the face of petitioners' attempt to procure class wide relief despite having failed to move the trial court for a certification order throughout six litigious years, we distinguished the case on the basis that \"(i)n Bing and its progeny we were able to infer that the trial court (had) approved the class action nature, ...

The petition should \"bring to the attention of the district court the precise issues which the new group sought to represent and the ways in which the goal of a unitary system had allegedly been frustrated.\"  Hines at 765.  The district court could then determine whether these matters had been previously raised and resolved and whether the issues sought to be presented by the new group were currently known to the court and parties in the initial suit.  If the court finds that the issues raised by the movants \"have been previously determined or if it (finds) that the parties in the original action were aware of these issues and completely competent to represent the interests of the new group, it could deny intervention.

The district court also concluded \"that the parties to the original lawsuit ... as evidenced by their vigorous representation of their respective, differing views to the court, (were) keenly aware of (the issues raised by the movants,) and completely competent to represent the interests of all parents and students of Walton County, including the intervenor parents and their children.\"  91 F.R.D. at 475.

Key developments have taken place since the county board's request for relief in 1971.  As indicated in the record, it has become a long-standing practice for the officials of the appellant Walton County School Board and the appellee Social Circle School Board to routinely consent to the movement of particular students between attendance zones for compelling reasons of a non-racial nature.

Also, on August 26, 1980, the district court amended its 1968 decree with a formal order that provided for transfers of students from one zone to another by setting up reliable criteria for transfers due to a \"compelling non-racial reason.\"  (Tr., Aug. 26, 1980, Vol.  III, pg. 667).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The school boards' long-standing practice of permitting student transfers for compelling non-racial reasons appears sound.  The district court's subsequent modification of its 1968 decree ratifying such activity is approved.  However, these developments contradict the district court's conclusion that the movants' petition for intervention raises the same issues that it had previously entertained in 1971.  Over ten years of transfers have intervened.  Housing patterns may have changed.  The intervenors suggest that they are interested in today's problems.  This appears to be facially reasonable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4-1\" id=\"fn4-1_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court further concluded that the existing parties in the case were keenly aware of the issues raised by the Walton County parents and could adequately represent their interest.

Appellee Social Circle School Board's motion for enforcement on November 7, 1979 specifically requested the return of all students residing in zone five to Social Circle schools.  Although the request for enforcement was directed to the movants' children and a ruling on such request would have a substantial impact on the lives and education of their children, neither school board has asserted the necessity of the Walton County parents being made a part of this litigation.  This becomes particularly egregious considering the failure of both boards to affirmatively assert what appears to be a tenable position for the movants: that both school boards permitted some student transfers out of zone five for compelling nonracial reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence of record reveals that the school boards' primary motivation for proposing and assisting in the implementation of the 1968 desegregation decree was to prevent the loss of federal aid to their school systems.  91 F.R.D. at 461-62.  It appears that as long as the desegregation order was insuring the continued receipt of federal funds the school boards were content with the directive, and had no motivation to represent the interests of the parent intervenors.  The school boards have expended great effort in litigating over state funds as well.  An interest in operating funds based upon numbers of students, however, does not equate with the criteria used for selecting specific students for particular schools.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the issues the parent intervenors sought to represent were not previously determined by the district court, and \"the new group had a significant claim which it could best represent, intervention (should have been permitted).\"  Hines at 765.
