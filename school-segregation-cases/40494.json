Stat. Ann. § 30-37-3.2(A), which\n\ncriminalizes the dissemination by computer of material that is harmful to minors.\n\nThe district court concluded that plaintiffs, the American Civil Liberties Union\n\n(“ACLU”) and various organizations and entities which communicate on the\n\nInternet, had demonstrated that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their\n\nclaim that section 30-37-3.2(A) violated the First Amendment and the Commerce\n\n\n      *\n       The Honorable Dale A. Kimball, United States District Judge for the\nDistrict of Utah, sitting by designation.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fClause of the United States Constitution, and had met the other requirements for\n\nissuance of a preliminary injunction. We agree, and we therefore AFFIRM the\n\ndistrict court’s grant of injunctive relief.\n\n\n\n                                   BACKGROUND\n\n      In its 1998 session, the New Mexico Legislature enacted section\n\n30-37-3.2(A), which provides as follows:\n\n      30-37-3.2 Dissemination of material that is harmful to a minor by\n      computer\n\n             A. Dissemination of material that is harmful to a minor\n             by computer consists of the use of a computer\n             communications system that allows the input, output,\n             examination or transfer of computer data or computer\n             programs from one computer to another, to knowingly\n             and intentionally initiate or engage in communication\n             with a person under eighteen years of age when such\n             communication in whole or in part depicts actual or\n             simulated nudity, sexual intercourse or any other sexual\n             conduct. Whoever commits dissemination of material\n             that is harmful to a minor by computer is guilty of a\n             misdemeanor.\n\n      The statute provides the following defenses:\n\n      In a prosecution for dissemination of material that is harmful to a\n      minor by computer, it is a defense that the defendant has:\n\n      (1)    in good faith taken reasonable, effective and appropriate\n             actions under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by\n             minors to indecent materials on computer, including any\n             method that is feasible with available technology;\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\f      (2)    restricted access to indecent materials by requiring the use of a\n             verified credit card, debit account, adult access code or adult\n             personal identification number; or\n      (3)    in good faith established a mechanism such as labeling,\n             segregation or other means that enables indecent material to be\n             automatically blocked or screened by software or other\n             capability reasonably available to persons who wish to effect\n             such blocking or screening and the defendant has not otherwise\n             solicited a minor not subject to such screening or blocking\n             capabilities to access the indecent material or to circumvent\n             screening or blocking.\n\nN.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-37-3.2(C). The statute became effective July 1, 1998.   1\n\n\n\n      As the district court found, “[p]laintiffs are various organizations and\n\nindividuals who maintain or use computer systems to provide access to a range of\n\ninformation through a variety of media[,] [which] is accessible by residents of the\n\nState of New Mexico on the Internet.”     ACLU v. Johnson , 4 F. Supp. 2d 1024,\n\n1026 (D.N.M. 1998). Plaintiffs’ speech includes discussions of women’s health\n\nand interests, literary works and fine art, gay and lesbian issues, prison rapes, and\n\ncensorship and civil liberties issues. As the parties stipulated:\n\n      The Internet is a decentralized, global medium of communication that\n      links people, institutions, corporations and governments around the\n      world. It is a giant computer network that interconnects innumerable\n      smaller groups of linked computer networks and individual\n      computers. While estimates are difficult due to its constant and rapid\n      growth, the Internet is currently believed to connect more than 159\n      countries and over 109 million users.\n\n\n      1\n       The New Mexico Legislature also passed a statute criminalizing child\nluring by means of the computer. See N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-37-3.2(B). Plaintiffs\ndo not challenge that statute.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fJ. Stipulation on Facts at ¶ 2, Defendants’ App. at 232. We do not recite here the\n\nspecifics of how the Internet functions; where necessary, we describe any relevant\n\nfeatures of the Internet in our analysis of this case. We note that the general\n\ncontours of the Internet have been described in various other judicial opinions.\n\nSee Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. 844, 849-57 (1997);      Cyberspace, Communications,\n\nInc. v. Engler , 55 F. Supp. 2d 737, 740-44 (E.D. Mich. 1999);    American Libraries\n\nAssoc. v. Pataki , 969 F. Supp. 160, 164-67 (S.D.N.Y. 1997);     Shea v. Reno , 930 F.\n\nSupp. 916, 925-34 (S.D.N.Y. 1996).\n\n      Plaintiffs filed this action on April 22, 1998, over two months prior to the\n\nstatute’s effective date, seeking to have enforcement of section 30-37-3.2(A)\n\nenjoined as facially invalid under the First Amendment, the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment and the Commerce Clause. Defendants filed motions to dismiss,\n\narguing (1) plaintiffs lacked standing and/or the issue was not ripe for decision;\n\n(2) the Eleventh Amendment bars this suit; and (3) the court should abstain until\n\nthe New Mexico Supreme Court has had an opportunity to interpret the language\n\nof section 30-37-3.2(A) so as to resolve the constitutional issues presented.\n\n      The district court held that plaintiffs had standing to bring this action and\n\nthat the matter was ripe for review; that abstention would not be appropriate; and\n\nthat the Eleventh Amendment did not bar this suit seeking prospective injunctive\n\nrelief. See Johnson , 4 F. Supp. 2d at 1026. The court then held a hearing on\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fplaintiffs’ motion for a preliminary injunction, where it heard testimony from five\n\nwitnesses, reviewed affidavits, declarations and the Joint Stipulation on Facts,\n\nand listened to argument from counsel. The court subsequently granted plaintiffs’\n\nmotion for a preliminary injunction.   See Johnson , 4 F. Supp. 2d at 1029.   2\n\n\n\n      Defendants appeal, arguing the district court: (1) erred in refusing to\n\ndismiss this case for lack of standing because section 30-37-3.2(A) has not yet\n\nbeen enforced, nor is there any real and imminent threat of such enforcement;\n\n(2) erroneously interpreted section 30-37-3.2(A) in the course of determining that\n\nplaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to the statute;\n\n\n\n      2\n       Defendants argue that, after granting injunctive relief following the\nhearing, the court asked the ACLU’s attorney to prepare proposed findings of fact\nand conclusions of law, which that attorney did. Defendants assert that:\n\n      [a]part from one dispositional paragraph inserted by the District\n      Court, several non-substantive modifications, and the insertion of\n      citations supporting the Conclusions of Law, the District Court\n      incorporated all of Plaintiffs’ Proposed Findings of Fact and\n      Conclusions of Law into its own Findings of Fact and Conclusions of\n      Law and signed it just four days after receipt [from plaintiffs].\n\nDefendants’ Br. at 5-6. Defendants argue that this circumstance mandates that we\nview the district court’s findings and conclusions with less deference than they\nwould otherwise deserve. We of course review any legal conclusions de novo.\nFurther, “[t]he Supreme Court has held that although a trial judge may be\ncriticized for his wholesale adoption of the prevailing party’s findings of fact,\nnevertheless ‘even when the trial judge adopts proposed findings verbatim, the\nfindings are those of the court and may be reversed only if clearly erroneous.’”\nDowell v. Board of Educ., 8 F.3d 1501, 1509 (10th Cir. 1993) (quoting Anderson\nv. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 572 (1985)).\n\n                                          -6-\n\f(3) erroneously found plaintiffs would suffer irreparable injury unless the\n\ninjunction issues; (4) erred in including New Mexico’s district attorneys in the\n\npreliminary injunction’s coverage; and (5) reached various other erroneous legal\n\nconclusions. At oral argument of this case, defendants also urged us to certify the\n\ninterpretation of section 30-37-3.2(A) to the New Mexico Supreme Court before\n\nresolving any constitutional issues.\n\n\n\n                                        DISCUSSION\n\nI. Standing\n\n       “Standing is a threshold, jurisdictional issue.”      Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1    ,\n\n119 F.3d 1437, 1445 (10th Cir. 1997). To establish standing, plaintiffs “must\n\nhave suffered an ‘injury-in-fact.’”       Clajon Prod. Corp. v. Petera    , 70 F.3d 1566,\n\n1572 (10th Cir. 1995) (quoting        Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife     , 504 U.S. 555, 560\n\n(1992)). To establish an injury-in-fact, plaintiffs must show “an invasion of a\n\nlegally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual\n\nor imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.”        Lujan , 504 U.S. at 560 (citations\n\nand quotations omitted). Defendants argue plaintiffs lack standing because this\n\nsuit was brought before the effective date of section 30-37-3.2(A), and because\n\nplaintiffs have not “received a real and concrete threat of prosecution from law\n\nenforcement authorities,” Defendants’ Br. at 43, nor have they demonstrated that\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\fthey refrained from constitutionally protected conduct or actually violated the\n\nlaw. We disagree.\n\n       In Virginia v. American Booksellers Assoc.      , 484 U.S. 383 (1988), the\n\nSupreme Court held that plaintiffs had standing to challenge a statute prohibiting\n\nthe commercial display of sexual materials harmful to juveniles, even though\n\n“plaintiffs’ challenge was . . . made before the statute became effective.”     Id. at\n\n392. The Court held that the injury-in-fact requirement of standing was met “as\n\nthe law is aimed directly at plaintiffs, who, if their interpretation of the statute is\n\ncorrect, will have to take significant and costly compliance measures or risk\n\ncriminal prosecution.”    Id. The Court further stated:\n\n       We are not troubled by the pre-enforcement nature of this suit. The\n       State has not suggested that the newly enacted law will not be\n       enforced, and we see no reason to assume otherwise. We conclude\n       that plaintiffs have alleged an actual and well-founded fear that the\n       law will be enforced against them. Further, the alleged danger of\n       this statute is, in large measure, one of self-censorship; a harm that\n       can be realized even without an actual prosecution.\n\nId. at 393. We likewise agree with this recent observation by a district court\n\nfacing a similar challenge to a similar statute:\n\n       Under the criteria outlined by the Supreme Court in   Lujan , the\n       plaintiffs have standing, because an alleged injury is “certainly\n       impending,” if the statute takes effect and the material they\n       disseminate is deemed “sexually explicit.” No one should have to go\n       through being arrested for a felony, publically shamed, and pay for a\n       defense only to have a court find that the newly enacted statute is\n       unconstitutional. This can, and should, be determined before such\n       injury occurs.\n\n                                             -8-\n\fCyberspace, Communications, Inc. v. Engler       , 55 F. Supp. 2d 737, 745-46 (E.D.\n\nMich. 1999) (quoting Lujan , 505 U.S. at 564 n.2).    3\n\n\n\n       We also conclude, for substantially the same reasons, that the matter is ripe\n\nfor review. “[I]f a threatened injury is sufficiently ‘imminent’ to establish\n\nstanding, the constitutional requirements of the ripeness doctrine will necessarily\n\nbe satisfied.”   National Treasury Employees Union v. United States      , 101 F.3d\n\n1423, 1428 (D.C. Cir. 1996). Moreover, as we have observed, “customary\n\nripeness analysis . . . is . . . relaxed somewhat . . . where a facial challenge,\n\nimplicating First Amendment values, is brought.”          New Mexicans for Bill\n\nRichardson v. Gonzales , 64 F.3d 1495, 1499 (10th Cir. 1995). In that situation,\n\n“‘[r]easonable predictability of enforcement or threats of enforcement, without\n\n\n\n\n       3\n        Defendants attempt to undermine the nature of the “injury” to plaintiffs by\narguing that plaintiffs have not demonstrated that their Internet communications\nmeet the definition of “material that is harmful to a minor” under section\n30-37-3.2(A). The New Mexico statute defines “harmful to minors” as material\nwhich (1) “predominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of\nminors,’ and (2) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult\ncommunity as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors,’ and\n(3) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.” N.M. Stat. Ann.\n§ 30-37-1(F). Defendants argue that, since plaintiffs assert their Internet\ncommunications have social importance and are protected for adults, they fail to\nmeet the definition of “harmful to a minor.” Defendants overlook the basic point\nthat what may be “patently offensive . . . for minors” or “utterly without\nredeeming social importance for minors” may very well have social importance\nand not be patently offensive for adults.\n\n                                           -9-\n\fmore, have sometimes been enough to ripen a claim.’”          Id. (quoting Martin\n\nTractor Co. v. Federal Election Comm’n       , 627 F.2d 375, 380 (D.C. Cir. 1980)).\n\n       We agree with the district court that plaintiffs have established standing\n\nand ripeness.\n\n\n\nII. Injunctive Relief\n\n       A party seeking a preliminary injunction must show that four conditions are\n\nmet:\n\n       (1) the movant will suffer irreparable harm unless the injunction\n       issues; (2) there is a substantial likelihood the movant ultimately will\n       prevail on the merits; (3) the threatened injury to the movant\n       outweighs any harm the proposed injunction may cause the opposing\n       party; and (4) the injunction would not be contrary to the public\n       interest.\n\nKiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma v. Hoover           , 150 F.3d 1163, 1171 (10th Cir.\n\n1998). We review the grant of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion.\n\nKansas Health Care Assoc., Inc. v. Kansas Dep’t of Social & Rehabilitation\n\nServs. , 31 F.3d 1536, 1543 (10th Cir. 1994). We reverse that grant “only if the\n\ndistrict court ‘abuses its discretion, commits an error of law, or is clearly\n\nerroneous in its preliminary factual findings.’”       Id. (quoting Autoskill Inc. v.\n\nNational Educ. Support Sys., Inc.    , 994 F.2d 1476, 1487 (10th Cir. 1993)).\n\n       The district court found that plaintiffs had satisfied all four conditions for\n\nthe issuance of a preliminary injunction. We agree.\n\n                                            -10-\n\f       A. Likelihood of Success on Merits\n\n              1. First Amendment\n\n       The district court held that section 30-37-3.2(A) violates the First and\n\nFourteenth Amendments “because it effectively bans speech that is\n\nconstitutionally protected for adults;” it does not “directly and materially advance\n\na compelling governmental interest;” it is not “the least restrictive means of\n\nserving its stated interest;” it “interferes with the rights of minors to access and\n\nview material that to them is protected by the First Amendment;” it is\n\n“substantially over-broad;” and it “prevents people from communicating and\n\naccessing information anonymously.”         Johnson , 4 F. Supp. 2d at 1033.\n\nDefendants respond that section 30-37-3.2(A) can and must be read narrowly,\n\nand, so narrowed, it is constitutional under the authority of      Ginsberg v. New\n\nYork , 390 U.S. 629 (1968) (upholding conviction for selling obscene magazine to\n\nminor).\n\n       “Sexual expression which is indecent but is not obscene is protected by the\n\nFirst Amendment.”      Sable Communications, Inc. v. FCC        , 492 U.S. 115, 126\n\n(1989). As the Court has acknowledged, however, the government may “regulate\n\nthe content of constitutionally protected speech in order to promote a compelling\n\ninterest if it chooses the least restrictive means to further the articulated interest.”\n\nId. While there is an indisputably “compelling interest in protecting the physical\n\n\n                                            -11-\n\fand psychological well-being of minors,” nonetheless, the government’s chosen\n\nmeans to achieve that end must be “carefully tailored.”    Id. The Court made clear\n\nin Reno v. ACLU , 521 U.S. at 870, that content-based regulation of Internet\n\nspeech is subject to that same strict scrutiny.     4\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs rely heavily upon    Reno , in which the Supreme Court held that\n\nportions of the Communications Decency Act (“CDA”), 47 U.S.C. § 223(a)(1),\n\n(d), violated the First Amendment. Because the Court’s analysis in      Reno is\n\ncentral to our resolution of this case, we examine that decision in some detail.\n\n\n\n              a. Reno v. ACLU\n\n       The Court in Reno held that two provisions of the CDA were facially\n\noverbroad. The first imposed liability on anyone who:\n\n       (B) by means of a telecommunications device knowingly–\n       (i) makes, creates, or solicits, and\n       (ii) initiates the transmission of,\n       any . . . communication which is obscene or indecent, knowing that\n       the recipient of the communication is under 18 years of age . . . .\n\n\n\n       4\n        The Court has determined which level of scrutiny to apply to particular\ntypes of speech, depending in part on the particular speech medium involved.\nThus, for example, attempts to regulate the print media have been subjected to\nstrict scrutiny, while the broadcast media have been afforded less First\nAmendment protection. After examining the nature of the Internet, and\nconcluding that it is more similar to the telephone as a communication medium\nthan to the broadcast media, the Court in Reno determined that the Internet\ndeserved the highest level of First Amendment protection.\n\n                                             -12-\n\f47 U.S.C. § 223(a). The second imposed liability on anyone who knowingly:\n\n      (A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a specific person\n      or persons under 18 years of age, or\n      (B) uses any interactive computer service to display in a manner\n      available to a person under 18 years of age, any . . . communication\n      that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as\n      measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory\n      activities or organs . . . .\n\n47 U.S.C. § 223(d). The CDA contained two defenses virtually identical to two\n\nof the defenses provided in section 30-37-3.2(A). One defense addressed those\n\nwho take “good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions” to restrict\n\naccess by minors to the prohibited communications. § 223(e)(5)(A). The other\n\ndefense addressed those who restrict access to the prohibited communications “by\n\nrequiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult\n\npersonal identification number.” § 223(e)(5)(B).\n\n      Plaintiffs in Reno challenged the CDA as facially overbroad in violation of\n\nthe First Amendment and vague in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Court\n\nheld the statute was overbroad and vague in violation of the First Amendment\n\nwithout separately reaching Fifth Amendment vagueness. The Court reached that\n\nconclusion by considering both the particular language and structure of the CDA,\n\nas well as the nature and function of the Internet. It held that “the vague contours\n\nof the coverage of the statute” cause it to “unquestionably silence[] some speakers\n\nwhose messages would be entitled to constitutional protection.”    Reno , 521 U.S.\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fat 874. 5 This is particularly troublesome because the CDA is a “content-based\n\nregulation of speech” which imposes criminal liability.    Id. at 871-72.\n\n        Significantly, in rejecting the government’s argument that the CDA does\n\nnot prohibit protected adult communication, the Court rejected the government’s\n\n“incorrect factual premise that prohibiting a transmission whenever it is known\n\nthat one of its recipients is a minor would not interfere with adult-to-adult\n\ncommunication.”     Id. at 876. That factual premise is incorrect when the\n\ncommunication medium is the Internet because “[g]iven the size of the potential\n\naudience for most messages, . . . the sender must be charged with knowing that\n\none or more minors will likely view it.”     Id. Moreover, it would be prohibitively\n\nexpensive to require Internet users, many of whom are non-commercial entities, to\n\nverify the age of those to whom communications are sent.\n\n        Given its vagueness and breadth, the Court concluded that the CDA was not\n\nnarrowly tailored to achieve the goal of protecting minors, in view of the fact\n\nthat:\n\n\n\n\n        The Court noted, as examples, the following ambiguities in the CDA’s\n        5\n\ncoverage: the term “indecent” is nowhere defined; the phrase “in context, depicts\nor describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community\nstandards, sexual or excretory activities or organs” is ambiguous and, as applied\nto the Internet, “means that any communication available to a nation-wide\naudience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be\noffended by the message.” Reno, 521 U.S. at 877-78.\n\n                                           -14-\n\f       possible alternatives [exist] such as requiring that indecent material\n       be ‘tagged’ in a way that facilitates parental control of material\n       coming into their homes, making exceptions for messages with\n       artistic or educational value, providing some tolerance for parental\n       choice, and regulating some portions of the Internet—such as\n       commercial web sites—differently than others, such as chat rooms.\n\nId. at 879.\n\n       The Court also rejected the government’s narrowing interpretation of the\n\nCDA, which attempted to limit the CDA’s scope by focusing on the “plain\n\nmeaning” of the Act’s “knowledge” and “specific person” requirements.        Id. The\n\ngovernment argued that, properly and narrowly construed, the CDA prohibited\n\n“the dissemination of indecent messages only to persons known to be under 18.”\n\nId. at 880. The Court rejected this interpretation, stating that it “ignores the fact\n\nthat most Internet fora—including chat rooms, newsgroups, mail exploders, and\n\nthe Web—are open to all comers. The Government’s assertion that the knowledge\n\nrequirement somehow protects the communications of adults is therefore\n\nuntenable. Even the strongest reading of the ‘specific person’ requirement of\n\n§ 223(d) cannot save the statute.”   Id. 6\n\n\n\n       6\n        The Court also observed that, even if the CDA only prohibited\ncommunications where the sender knew a recipient was under 18, it would still\nchill otherwise permissible speech among adults. This is so because it would\npermit a “‘heckler’s veto’ upon any opponent of indecent speech who might\nsimply log on and inform the would-be discoursers that his 17-year-old child—a\n‘specific person . . . under 18 years of age,’ would be present.” Reno 521 U.S. at\n880 (quoting 47 U.S.C. § 223(d)(1)(A)).\n\n                                             -15-\n\f      Finally, the Court rejected the contention that the CDA’s defenses salvage\n\nthe Act. The Court first held that the defense requiring “good faith, reasonable,\n\neffective, and appropriate actions,” 47 U.S.C. § 223(e)(5), to prevent access by\n\nminors is “illusory” because current technology does not permit     effective\n\nprevention of access. With respect to the defense of requiring use of a verified\n\ncredit card or adult identification number, the Court observed that commercial\n\nproviders of sexually explicit material already employ such techniques, but there\n\nis no proof that they actually work, and it is not economically feasible for non-\n\ncommercial speakers to employ such techniques. Thus, the Government has\n\n“failed to prove that the proffered defense[s] would significantly reduce the heavy\n\nburden on adult speech produced by the prohibition on offensive displays.”      Id. at\n\n882. The Court accordingly concluded that the CDA “threatens to torch a large\n\nsegment of the Internet community.”     Id.\n\n\n\n             b. N.M. Stat. Ann. § 30-37-3.2(A)\n\n      Defendants in this case attempt to distinguish both the language of the\n\nCDA itself, and the Court’s reasoning in finding it unconstitutional, in an effort to\n\nconvince us that we should not reach the same result with respect to\n\nsection 30-37-3.2(A). We conclude, however, that the essence of the Supreme\n\n\n\n\n                                          -16-\n\fCourt’s rationale, and the similarities between the two statutes, do compel the\n\nsame result.\n\n      As did the government in      Reno , defendants here urge us to narrowly read\n\nsection 30-37-3.2(A) to apply only to the following situations:\n\n(1) communications using a computer communications system in which (2) the\n\nsender deliberately (“knowingly and intentionally”) (3) sends a message which is\n\n“harmful to minors” as defined in    section 30-37-3.2(A), which is, in turn, the\n\nsame as that approved in   Ginsberg , 7 (4) to a specific individual recipient who the\n\n\n      7\n       In Ginsberg, the Supreme Court upheld a statute which prohibited the sale\nto minors of materials that were “harmful to minors” even though they were not\nobscene or otherwise prohibited for adults. “Harmful to minors” had a specific\nthree-part definition. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 646. Section 30-37-3.2(A) contains\nthe same definition of “harmful to minors.”\n\n       Defendants argue that “[t]his case is an electronic Ginsberg case, or cyber-\nGinsberg: nothing more, nothing less.” Defendants’ Br. at 7. We disagree. As\nthe Supreme Court noted in Reno, there are significant differences between\nGinsberg, involving face-to-face sales of magazines, and a case such as this one\nand Reno, involving communications on the Internet: (1) the prohibition against\nsales to minors in Ginsberg did not prevent parents from purchasing the\nprohibited magazines for their children, whereas under the CDA, or section\n30-37-3.2(A), “neither the parents’ consent—nor even their participation—in the\ncommunication would avoid the application of the statute,” Reno, 521 U.S. at\n865; (2) the statute in Ginsberg applied only to commercial transactions, whereas\nthe CDA and section 30-37-3.2(A) apply to commercial and non-commercial\ntransactions, the latter of which comprise a measurable proportion of Internet\ncommunications; and (3) the statute in Ginsberg defined minors as those under\n17, whereas the CDA and section 30-37-3.2(A) include an additional year because\nthey define minors as those under 18. See Reno, 521 U.S. at 865-66.\nAdditionally, as the district court noted recently in Cyberspace, Communications:\n                                                                      (continued...)\n\n                                           -17-\n\fsender knows to be a minor (“solely and exclusively an individual minor\n\nrecipient”). They thus argue that section 30-37-3.2(A) “does not apply to group\n\ncommunications which include both adults and minors in the group, or where a\n\nfact situation presents a mere probability that minors may be part of the receiving\n\ngroup.” Aplts.’ Br. at 19.\n\n      We may narrowly construe a statute in certain circumstances:\n\n      It has long been a tenet of First Amendment law that in determining a\n      facial challenge to a statute, if it be readily susceptible to a\n      narrowing construction that would make it constitutional, it will be\n      upheld. The key to application of this principle is that the statute\n      must be readily susceptible to the limitation; we will not rewrite a\n      state law to conform it to constitutional requirements.\n\n\n\n\n      7\n       (...continued)\n      [I]n [Ginsberg], the “materials” referenced were magazines . . . .\n      Magazines . . . can be brown bagged or hidden in the backroom of\n      purveyors. With the Internet, you would have to “close the\n      bookstore” because the disseminator and the recipient are not face to\n      face. A magazine can be regulated or censored by the county in\n      which it is located. A person’s age can be verified because the\n      person is physically there, and the disseminator can logically be held\n      responsible for conveying “sexually explicit matter” to a minor. The\n      Internet does not distinguish between minors and adults in their\n      audience. To comply with the Act, a communicant must speak only\n      in language suitable for children.\n\nCyberspace, Communications, Inc., 55 F. Supp. 2d at 747; see also Reno, 521\nU.S. at 889 (O’Connor, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in\npart) (noting that the “twin characteristics of geography and identity” differentiate\nthe world of Ginsberg from that of the Internet).\n\n                                        -18-\n\fVirginia v. American Booksellers’ Ass’n    , 484 U.S. at 397. As indicated, the\n\nstatute must be readily susceptible to the narrowing construction.   See Reno , 521\n\nU.S. at 884. We agree with plaintiffs that defendants’ proposed narrowing\n\nconstruction really amounts to a wholesale rewriting of the statute. That we\n\ncannot do.\n\n      Defendants argue section 30-37-3.2(A) only applies where the recipient is\n\n“solely and exclusively an individual minor recipient.” Aplts.’ Br. at 21. As\n\nplaintiffs point out, the statute nowhere uses those limiting words, nor is it readily\n\nsusceptible to such a limiting construction. The statute criminalizes “knowingly\n\nand intentionally initiat[ing] or engag[ing] in communication with a [minor].”\n\n§ 30-37-3.2(A). It does not limit such communication to one-on-one situations\n\nwhere the only recipient is a single minor. Indeed, as plaintiffs note, defendants’\n\ninterpretation would lead to the absurd result that no violation of the statute\n\nwould occur if someone sent a message to two minors, or a chat room full of\n\nminors, or a minor and an adult.\n\n      Defendants also argue that the intent clause (“knowingly and intentionally\n\ninitiate or engage in communication with a person under eighteen”) appropriately\n\nnarrows the statute. But the statutory definition of “knowingly” only requires\n\n“having general knowledge of, or reason to know, or a belief or ground for belief\n\nwhich warrants further inspection or inquiry of . . . the age of the minor.” N.M.\n\n\n                                          -19-\n\fStat. Ann. § 30-37-1(G). As the Supreme Court acknowledged in        Reno , “[g]iven\n\nthe size of the potential audience for most messages [on the Internet], in the\n\nabsence of a viable age verification process, the sender must be charged with\n\nknowing that one or more minors will likely view it.”     Reno , 521 U.S. at 876.\n\nThus, virtually all communication on the Internet would meet the statutory\n\ndefinition of “knowingly” and potentially be subject to liability under section\n\n30-37-3.2(A). Indeed, the Supreme Court unequivocally rejected this very\n\nargument in Reno : “[t]he Government’s assertion that the knowledge requirement\n\nsomehow protects the communications of adults is . . . untenable.     Even the\n\nstrongest reading of the ‘specific person’ requirement of § 223(d) cannot save the\n\nstatute .” Id. at 880 (emphasis added).   8\n\n\n\n\n      8\n       Defendants attempt to distinguish Reno on this point, by arguing that the\nCDA was broader than section 30-37-3.2(A). They cite the CDA’s prohibition on\nthe use of a computer to “display in a manner available to a person under 18 years\nof age” certain material. 47 U.S.C. § 223(d)(1)(B). As plaintiffs note, this\nargument ignores the fact that the Supreme Court held other parts of the CDA\nunconstitutionally overbroad and vague, including the knowing initiation of the\ntransmission of certain material to someone “knowing the recipient is under 18\nyears of age” and the knowing sending of material to “a specific person or\npersons under 18 years of age.” 47 U.S.C. § 223(a)(1)(B), (d)(1)(A). Those\nprovisions are virtually identical to the narrowed construction of section\n30-37-3.2(A) that defendants urge us to adopt. The Supreme Court’s rejection of\nthe argument that the “knowledge” and the “specific person” requirements\nsalvaged the overbreadth of the CDA compels the rejection of defendants’ similar\nargument in this case.\n\n                                              -20-\n\f       Finally, as defendants virtually concede in their reply brief, the defenses\n\ncontained in the New Mexico statute are inconsistent with defendants’\n\ninterpretation of the statute. If section 30-37-3.2(A) only applies to a person who\n\nintentionally communicates with a particular individual whom he or she knows to\n\nbe a minor, it would be nonsensical to permit such a person to avoid liability by\n\narguing the good faith defense, or asking for a credit card number or other age\n\nverification or labeling his or her speech. The fact that the defenses are directed\n\nat group communications that have unique dynamics on the Internet certainly\n\nsuggests that the basic prohibition of the statute also includes, and was intended\n\nto include, group communications. This further undermines the viability of\n\ndefendants’ interpretation of section 30-37-3.2(A).\n\n       In sum, the statute as written, like the CDA, unconstitutionally burdens\n\notherwise protected adult communication on the Internet. Further, it is not\n\n“readily susceptible” to the extremely narrow interpretation defendants advance.\n\n\n\n              c. Statutory defenses\n\n       Defendants next suggest that the defenses in the New Mexico statute\n\nprovide “the sort of ‘narrowing tailoring’ that will save an otherwise patently\n\ninvalid unconstitutional provision.”   Reno , 521 U.S. at 882. We disagree. The\n\nSupreme Court in Reno held that a “good faith” defense virtually identical to the\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\fdefense provided in § 30-37-3.2(C)(1) was “illusory.”           Id. at 881. It also held that\n\na defense requiring verification by means of a credit card or adult access or\n\nidentification code was equally ineffective because the government “failed to\n\nprove that the proffered defense would significantly reduce the heavy burden on\n\nadult speech produced by the prohibition on offensive displays.”           Reno , 521 U.S.\n\nat 882. Finally, defendants in this case have not demonstrated, nor do they\n\nseriously argue, that the third defense, exempting those who “in good faith\n\nestablish a mechanism such as labeling, segregation or other means that enables\n\nindecent material to be automatically blocked or screened” will be any more\n\neffective at actually preventing minors from accessing material on the Internet.\n\n       We therefore agree with the district court that, as in      Reno , the defenses to\n\nsection 30-37-3.2(A) do not salvage an otherwise unconstitutionally broad statute.\n\nIn so holding, we note that a district court has recently reached the same\n\nconclusion regarding a similar statute.     See Cyberspace, Communications, Inc.         , 55\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 751 (holding unconstitutional under the First Amendment a statute\n\nprohibiting the “knowing[] disseminat[ion] to a minor [of] sexually explicit visual\n\nor verbal material that is harmful to minors”);     see also Shea v. Reno , 930 F. Supp.\n\n916 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (prior to the Supreme Court’s analysis in           Reno , holding the\n\nCDA unconstitutional under the First Amendment).\n\n\n\n\n                                            -22-\n\f              2. Commerce Clause\n\n       The district court also held that plaintiffs in this case demonstrated a\n\nlikelihood of success on their argument that section 30-37-3.2(A) violated the\n\nCommerce Clause. Although we need not reach this issue, since we have already\n\nheld plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on their First\n\nAmendment argument, we do so, albeit briefly.\n\n       The “dormant implication of the Commerce Clause prohibits state . . .\n\nregulation . . . that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce\n\nand thereby ‘imped[es] free private trade in the national marketplace.’”          General\n\nMotors Corp. v. Tracy , 519 U.S. 278, 287 (1997) (quoting        Reeves, Inc. v. Stake ,\n\n447 U.S. 429, 437 (1980)) (citations omitted). Moreover, the Supreme Court has\n\nlong recognized that certain types of commerce are uniquely suited to national, as\n\nopposed to state, regulation.   See, e.g. , Wabash, St. L. & P.R. Co. v. Illinois    , 118\n\nU.S. 557 (1886) (holding states cannot regulate railroad rates).\n\n       The district court held that section 30-37-3.2(A) violated the Commerce\n\nClause in three ways: (1) it regulates conduct occurring wholly outside of the\n\nstate of New Mexico; (2) it constitutes an unreasonable and undue burden on\n\ninterstate and foreign commerce; and (3) it subjects interstate use of the Internet\n\nto inconsistent state regulation. The court below largely relied upon the detailed\n\nCommerce Clause analysis in      American Libraries Ass’n v. Pataki        , 969 F. Supp.\n\n\n                                           -23-\n\f160, 168-83 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). We agree with that analysis. As the          Pataki court\n\nobserved:\n\n       The unique nature of the Internet highlights the likelihood that a\n       single actor might be subject to haphazard, uncoordinated, and even\n       outright inconsistent regulation by states that the actor never\n       intended to reach and possibly was unaware were being accessed.\n       Typically, states’ jurisdictional limits are related to geography;\n       geography, however, is a virtually meaningless construct on the\n       Internet.\n\nId. at 168-69.\n\n\n\n              a. Regulation of conduct outside New Mexico\n\n       Defendants argue that section 30-37-3.2(A), properly construed, only\n\naddresses intrastate conduct. As the      Pataki court stated in rejecting that same\n\nargument, that analysis “is unsupportable in light of the text of the statute itself\n\n. . . and the reality of Internet communications.”    Pataki , 969 F. Supp. at 169.\n\nSection 30-37-3.2(A) contains no express limitation confining it to\n\ncommunications which occur wholly within its borders. Rather, it “applies to any\n\ncommunication, intrastate or interstate, that fits within the prohibition and over\n\nwhich [New Mexico] has the capacity to exercise criminal jurisdiction.”         Pataki ,\n\n969 F. Supp. at 169-70.\n\n       Moreover, the nature of the Internet forecloses the argument that a statute\n\nsuch as section 30-37-3.2(A) applies only to intrastate communications. Even if it\n\n\n                                            -24-\n\fis limited to one-on-one e-mail communications, as defendants assert section 30-\n\n37-3.2(A) properly is limited, there is no guarantee that a message from one New\n\nMexican to another New Mexican will not travel through other states en route.\n\nSee Pataki , 969 F. Supp. at 171; see also Cyberspace, Communications, Inc.         , 55 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 751 (“virtually all Internet speech is . . . available everywhere”).\n\nThus, section 30-37-3.2(A) “cannot effectively be limited to purely intrastate\n\ncommunications over the Internet because no such communications exist.”\n\nPataki , 969 F. Supp. at 171. We therefore agree with the district court     that\n\nsection 30-37-3.2(A) represents an attempt to regulate interstate conduct\n\noccurring outside New Mexico’s borders, and is accordingly a per se violation of\n\nthe Commerce Clause.    9\n\n\n\n\n              b. Burden on interstate commerce compared to local benefit\n\n       We further agree, for the reasons outlined in     Pataki , that section\n\n30-37-3.2(A) is an invalid indirect regulation of interstate commerce because,\n\nunder the balancing test of   Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.    , 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970),\n\nthe burdens on interstate commerce imposed by section 30-37-3.2(A) exceed any\n\n\n\n       Although defendants initially attempted to argue that the “non-commercial,\n       9\n\nrecreational use” of the Internet is not “commerce” subject to the Commerce\nClause, they wisely appeared to withdraw from that argument and agree that\nInternet communication can affect interstate commerce and, therefore, be subject\nto the Commerce Clause.\n\n                                           -25-\n\flocal benefits conferred by the statute.   See V-1 Oil Co. v. Utah State Dep’t of\n\nPub. Safety , 131 F.3d 1415, 1423-24 (10th Cir. 1997). Defendants’ primary\n\nresponse to this argument is to reiterate the importance of the state’s interest in\n\nprotecting minors from sexually oriented materials which are “harmful to\n\nminors.” We agree that the protection of minors from such materials is an\n\nundeniably compelling governmental interest, but the question in the context of\n\nthe validity of section 30-37-3.2(A) is whether the means chosen to further that\n\ninterest (§ 30-37-3.2(A)) excessively burden interstate commerce compared to the\n\nlocal benefits the statute actually confers. The local benefits of section\n\n30-37-3.2(A), particularly as narrowly construed by defendants, are not huge. As\n\nthe Pataki court noted with respect to the New York statute challenged in that\n\ncase, section 30-37-3.2(A) “can have no effect on communications originating\n\noutside the United States.”    Pataki , 969 F. Supp. at 178.\n\n       Further, New Mexico’s “prosecution of parties from out of state who have\n\nallegedly violated [section 30-37-3.2(A)], but whose only contact with [New\n\nMexico] occurs via the Internet, is beset with practical difficulties, even if [New\n\nMexico] is able to exercise criminal jurisdiction over such parties.”   Id. Finally,\n\ndefendants’ own interpretation of the statute—that it applies only to one-on-one\n\ncommunications between a sender in New Mexico and a recipient in New Mexico\n\nwhom the sender knows to be a minor—renders it so narrow in scope that the\n\n\n                                            -26-\n\factual benefit conferred is extremely small. As another district court has\n\nobserved with respect to the CDA, which defendants argue is broader in scope\n\nthan section 30-37-3.2(A):\n\n      [The statute] will almost certainly fail to accomplish the\n      Government’s interest in shielding children from pornography on the\n      Internet. Nearly half of Internet communications originate outside\n      the United States, and some percentage of that figure represents\n      pornography. Pornography from, say, Amsterdam will be no less\n      appealing to a child on the Internet than pornography from\n      [Albuquerque], and residents of Amsterdam have little incentive to\n      comply with [the statute].\n\nACLU v. Reno , 929 F. Supp. 824, 882 (E.D. Pa. 1996),      aff’d , 521 U.S. 844\n\n(1997). Balanced against those limited local benefits “is an extreme burden on\n\ninterstate commerce.”    Pataki , 969 F. Supp. at 179. Thus, section 30-37-3.2(A)\n\nconstitutes an invalid indirect regulation of interstate commerce.\n\n\n\n             c. Inconsistent regulation\n\n      The third ground upon which the district court held section 30-37-3.2(A)\n\nviolates the Commerce Clause is that it subjects the use of the Internet to\n\ninconsistent regulations. As we observed,      supra , certain types of commerce have\n\nbeen recognized as requiring national regulation.     See, e.g., Wabash, St. L. & P.\n\nRy. Co. , 118 U.S. at 574-75 (noting that “[c]ommerce with foreign countries and\n\namong the states” requires “only one system of rules, applicable alike to the\n\nwhole country”). The Internet is surely such a medium. We agree with the court\n\n                                            -27-\n\fin Pataki , when it observed, “[t]he Internet, like . . . rail and highway traffic . . .,\n\nrequires a cohesive national scheme of regulation so that users are reasonably able\n\nto determine their obligations.”    Pataki , 969 F. Supp. at 182; see also Kenneth D.\n\nBassinger, Dormant Commerce Clause Limits on State Regulation of the Internet:\n\nThe Transportation Analogy , 32 Ga. L. Rev. 889, 904 (Spring 1998) (“The\n\nstructure of the Internet bears a striking resemblance to a railroad, highway, or\n\nother means of interstate transportation.”).     10\n\n\n\n       Plaintiffs have accordingly met their burden of demonstrating a likelihood\n\nthat they will prevail on their claims that section 30-37-3.2(A) violates both the\n\nFirst Amendment and the Commerce Clause. We turn now to the remaining\n\nrequirements for the issuance of a preliminary injunction.\n\n\n\n       10\n         In their opening appellate brief, defendants asserted that “[c]ertification\nmay be appropriate on remand, [but they] do not request it at this juncture of the\nlitigation.” Defendants’ Br. at 64. In their reply brief, however, they argued that\nour resolution of the scope of section 30-37-3.2(A) would “improperly oust[] the\nrole of state courts in the interpretation of New Mexico’s statutes.” Defendants’\nReply Br. at 18. At oral argument, they asked us to certify to the New Mexico\nSupreme Court the proper interpretation of section 30-37-3.2(A). Or, as they\nargued below, they would have us abstain from considering the constitutionality\nof the statute, pending an interpretation of the statute by the New Mexico courts.\n\n       The Supreme Court has observed that it is “particularly reluctant to abstain\nin cases involving facial challenges based on the First Amendment.” City of\nHouston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 467 (1987). Given the obvious and facial\noverbreadth of the state statute at issue, and the fact that it is not reasonably\nsusceptible to an appropriate limiting construction, abstention or certification are\nunnecessary.\n\n                                               -28-\n\f       B. Irreparable Harm\n\n       The district court held that “[p]laintiffs have made a sufficient showing that\n\nthey will suffer irreparable injury—at a minimum the curtailment of their\n\nconstitutionally protected speech—if the preliminary injunction is not granted.”\n\nJohnson , 4 F. Supp. 2d at 1034. We agree.            See Elrod v. Burns , 427 U.S. 347,\n\n373 (1976); see also Pataki , 969 F. Supp. at 168 (noting that the “[d]eprivation of\n\nthe rights guaranteed under the Commerce Clause constitutes irreparable injury”).\n\n       C. Injury Outweighs Harm\n\n       We further agree with the district court’s conclusion that “the threatened\n\ninjury to Plaintiffs’ constitutionally protected speech outweighs whatever damage\n\nthe preliminary injunction may cause Defendants’ inability to enforce what\n\nappears to be an unconstitutional statute.”          Johnson , 4 F. Supp. 2d at 1034.\n\n\n\n       D. Public Interest\n\n       Finally, we further agree that “the preliminary injunction will not be\n\nadverse to the public interest as it will protect the free expression of the millions\n\nof Internet users both within and outside of the State of New Mexico.”            Id.\n\n\n\nIII. Scope of Injunctive Relief\n\n\n\n\n                                              -29-\n\f       Defendants argue the district court erred in including New Mexico’s district\n\nattorneys within the scope of the injunction. We disagree. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)\n\nprovides that an injunction binds not only the parties but also “their officers,\n\nagents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and . . . those persons in active\n\nconcert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by\n\npersonal service or otherwise.” This action is a facial challenge to a New Mexico\n\nstatute, brought against the governor and attorney general of New Mexico in their\n\nofficial capacities. Thus, it is an action against the State of New Mexico,    see\n\nMonell v. New York City Dep’t of Social Servs.       , 436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55 (1978)\n\n(observing that “official-capacity suits generally represent only another way of\n\npleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent”), seeking to\n\nenjoin enforcement of section 30-37-3.2(A) by the State. Defendants argue the\n\ndistrict attorneys received no notice of, nor have they participated in, this action,\n\nand they argue there is no indication that district attorneys are “persons in active\n\nconcert or participation with” defendants.\n\n       “The district attorney is the law officer of the district [and] is to prosecute\n\ncriminal cases on behalf of the State.”    State v. Session , 574 P.2d 600, 601 (N.M.\n\nCt. App. 1978); see also N.M. Stat. Ann. § 36-1-18 (describing duties of district\n\nattorney). To the extent district attorneys would attempt to enforce section\n\n30-37-3.2(A), an injunction against the governor and attorney general prohibiting\n\n\n                                            -30-\n\fsuch enforcement binds those attorneys. The district court properly included\n\ndistrict attorneys within its grant of injunctive relief.   See Pataki , 969 F. Supp. at\n\n163 (holding that “a preliminary injunction would effectively bar enforcement of\n\nthe Act whether the prosecution happened to be brought directly by the Attorney\n\nGeneral’s office or by one of the individual District Attorneys”).     11\n\n\n\n\n                                       CONCLUSION\n\n       For the forgoing reasons, we AFFIRM the issuance of a preliminary\n\ninjunction against enforcement of section 30-37-3.2(A).\n\n\n\n\n       11\n         Defendants also argue that the district court, rather than enjoining the\nentire statute, should have tailored the injunction to enjoin only the\nunconstitutional aspects of section 30-37-3.2(A). They suggest, and we discern,\nno reasonable way to do so, see Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491,\n504-05 (1985), and neither we, nor the district court, may rewrite the statute to\navoid the constitutional problems we have identified. See United States v.\nNational Treasury Employees Union, 513 U.S. 454, 479 & n.26 (1995).\nDefendants also challenge the district court’s injunction to the extent it prohibits\nthem from “investigating or reviewing any matter based on or premised upon”\nsection 30-37-3.2(A). Order, Appellants’ App. Vol. II at 415. This argument is\nmeritless. If section 30-37-3.2(A) is deemed unconstitutional in its entirety, there\ncould be no investigation or review premised upon it.\n\n                                              -31-\n\f",

The district court concluded that plaintiffs, the American Civil Liberties Union (\"ACLU\") and various organizations and entities which communicate on the Internet, had demonstrated that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that section 30-37-3.2(A) violated the First Amendment and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution, and had met the other requirements for issuance of a preliminary injunction.

Defendants filed motions to dismiss, arguing (1) plaintiffs lacked standing and/or the issue was not ripe for decision; (2) the Eleventh Amendment bars this suit; and (3) the court should abstain until the New Mexico Supreme Court has had an opportunity to interpret the language of section 30-37-3.2(A) so as to resolve the constitutional issues presented.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that plaintiffs had standing to bring this action and that the matter was ripe for review; that abstention would not be appropriate; and that the Eleventh Amendment did not bar this suit seeking prospective injunctive relief.

The court then held a hearing on plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, where it heard testimony from five witnesses, reviewed affidavits, declarations and the Joint Stipulation on Facts, and listened to argument from counsel.

At oral argument of this case, defendants also urged us to certify the interpretation of section 30-37-3.2(A) to the New Mexico Supreme Court before resolving any constitutional issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.

To establish an injury-in-fact, plaintiffs must show \"an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical.\" Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 (citations and quotations omitted). Defendants argue plaintiffs lack standing because this suit was brought before the effective date of section 30-37-3.2(A), and because plaintiffs have not \"received a real and concrete threat of prosecution from law enforcement authorities,\" Defendants' Br. at 43, nor have they demonstrated that they refrained from constitutionally protected conduct or actually violated the law.

The Court held that the injury-in-fact requirement of standing was met \"as the law is aimed directly at plaintiffs, who, if their interpretation of the statute is correct, will have to take significant and costly compliance measures or risk criminal prosecution.\" Id.

The State has not suggested that the newly enacted law will not be enforced, and we see no reason to assume otherwise. We conclude that plaintiffs have alleged an actual and well-founded fear that the law will be enforced against them. Further, the alleged danger of this statute is, in large measure, one of self-censorship; a harm that can be realized even without an actual prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 393.

One defense addressed those who take \"good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions\" to restrict access by minors to the prohibited communications. &#167; 223(e)(5)(A).

The Court held the statute was overbroad and vague in violation of the First Amendment without separately reaching Fifth Amendment vagueness. The Court reached that conclusion by considering both the particular language and structure of the CDA, as well as the nature and function of the Internet. It held that \"the vague contours of the coverage of the statute\" cause it to \"unquestionably silence[] some speakers whose messages would be entitled to constitutional protection.\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 874.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This is particularly troublesome because the CDA is a \"content-based regulation of speech\" which imposes criminal liability.

That factual premise is incorrect when the communication medium is the Internet because \"[g]iven the size of the potential audience for most messages, . . . the sender must be charged with knowing that one or more minors will likely view it.\" Id. Moreover, it would be prohibitively expensive to require Internet users, many of whom are non-commercial entities, to verify the age of those to whom communications are sent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given its vagueness and breadth, the Court concluded that the CDA was not narrowly tailored to achieve the goal of protecting minors, in view of the fact that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">possible alternatives [exist] such as requiring that indecent material be 'tagged' in a way that facilitates parental control of material coming into their homes, making exceptions for messages with artistic or educational value, providing some tolerance for parental choice, and regulating some portions of the Internet--such as commercial web sites--differently than others, such as chat rooms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 879.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court also rejected the government's narrowing interpretation of the CDA, which attempted to limit the CDA's scope by focusing on the \"plain meaning\" of the Act's \"knowledge\" and \"specific person\" requirements. Id. The government argued that, properly and narrowly construed, the CDA prohibited \"the dissemination of indecent messages only to persons known to be under 18.\" Id. at 880. The Court rejected this interpretation, stating that it \"ignores the fact that most Internet fora--including chat rooms, newsgroups, mail exploders, and the Web--are open to all comers. The Government's assertion that the knowledge requirement somehow protects the communications of adults is therefore untenable. Even the strongest reading of the 'specific person' requirement of &#167; 223(d) cannot save the statute.\" Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Court rejected the contention that the CDA's defenses salvage the Act. The Court first held that the defense requiring \"good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions,\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(5), to prevent access by minors is \"illusory\" because current technology does not permit effective prevention of access. With respect to the defense of requiring use of a verified credit card or adult identification number, the Court observed that commercial providers of sexually explicit material already employ such techniques, but there is no proof that they actually work, and it is not economically feasible for non-commercial speakers to employ such techniques. Thus, the Government has \"failed to prove that the proffered defense[s] would significantly reduce the heavy burden on adult speech produced by the prohibition on offensive displays.\" Id. at 882. The Court accordingly concluded that the CDA \"threatens to torch a large segment of the Internet community.\" Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

We conclude, however, that the essence of the Supreme Court's rationale, and the similarities between the two statutes, do compel the same result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As did the government in Reno, defendants here urge us to narrowly read section 30-37-3.2(A) to apply only to the following situations: (1) communications using a computer communications system in which (2) the sender deliberately (\"knowingly and intentionally\") (3) sends a message which is \"harmful to minors\" as defined in section 30-37-3.2(A), which is, in turn, the same as that approved in Ginsberg,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> (4) to a specific individual recipient who the sender knows to be a minor (\"solely and exclusively an individual minor recipient\"). They thus argue that section 30-37-3.2(A) \"does not apply to group communications which include both adults and minors in the group, or where a fact situation presents a mere probability that minors may be part of the receiving group.\" Aplts.'

The key to application of this principle is that the statute must be readily susceptible to the limitation; we will not rewrite a state law to conform it to constitutional requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Virginia v. American Booksellers' Ass'n, 484 U.S. at 397. As indicated, the statute must be readily susceptible to the narrowing construction. See Reno, 521 U.S. at 884. We agree with plaintiffs that defendants' proposed narrowing construction really amounts to a wholesale rewriting of the statute. That we cannot do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue section 30-37-3.2(A) only applies where the recipient is \"solely and exclusively an individual minor recipient.\" Aplts.' Br. at 21. As plaintiffs point out, the statute nowhere uses those limiting words, nor is it readily susceptible to such a limiting construction. The statute criminalizes \"knowingly and intentionally initiat[ing] or engag[ing] in communication with a [minor].\" &#167; 30-37-3.2(A). It does not limit such communication to one-on-one situations where the only recipient is a single minor. Indeed, as plaintiffs note, defendants' interpretation would lead to the absurd result that no violation of the statute would occur if someone sent a message to two minors, or a chat room full of minors, or a minor and an adult.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue that the intent clause (\"knowingly and intentionally initiate or engage in communication with a person under eighteen\") appropriately narrows the statute. But the statutory definition of \"knowingly\" only requires \"having general knowledge of, or reason to know, or a belief or ground for belief which warrants further inspection or inquiry of . . . the age of the minor.\" N.M. Stat. Ann. &#167; 30-37-1(G). As the Supreme Court acknowledged in Reno, \"[g]iven the size of the potential audience for most messages [on the Internet], in the absence of a viable age verification process, the sender must be charged with knowing that one or more minors will likely view it.\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 876. Thus, virtually all communication on the Internet would meet the statutory definition of \"knowingly\" and potentially be subject to liability under section 30-37-3.2(A). Indeed, the Supreme Court unequivocally rejected this very argument in Reno: \"[t]he Government's assertion that the knowledge requirement somehow protects the communications of adults is . . . untenable. Even the strongest reading of the 'specific person' requirement of &#167; 223(d) cannot save the statute.\" Id. at 880 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as defendants virtually concede in their reply brief, the defenses contained in the New Mexico statute are inconsistent with defendants' interpretation of the statute. If section 30-37-3.2(A) only applies to a person who intentionally communicates with a particular individual whom he or she knows to be a minor, it would be nonsensical to permit such a person to avoid liability by arguing the good faith defense, or asking for a credit card number or other age verification or labeling his or her speech. The fact that the defenses are directed at group communications that have unique dynamics on the Internet certainly suggests that the basic prohibition of the statute also includes, and was intended to include, group communications. This further undermines the viability of defendants' interpretation of section 30-37-3.2(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the statute as written, like the CDA, unconstitutionally burdens otherwise protected adult communication on the Internet. Further, it is not \"readily susceptible\" to the extremely narrow interpretation defendants advance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Statutory defenses</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants next suggest that the defenses in the New Mexico statute provide \"the sort of 'narrowing tailoring' that will save an otherwise patently invalid unconstitutional provision.\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 882. We disagree. The Supreme Court in Reno held that a \"good faith\" defense virtually identical to the defense provided in &#167; 30-37-3.2(C)(1) was \"illusory.\" Id. at 881. It also held that a defense requiring verification by means of a credit card or adult access or identification code was equally ineffective because the government \"failed to prove that the proffered defense would significantly reduce the heavy burden on adult speech produced by the prohibition on offensive displays.\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 882. Finally, defendants in this case have not demonstrated, nor do they seriously argue, that the third defense, exempting those who \"in good faith establish a mechanism such as labeling, segregation or other means that enables indecent material to be automatically blocked or screened\" will be any more effective at actually preventing minors from accessing material on the Internet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore agree with the district court that, as in Reno, the defenses to section 30-37-3.2(A) do not salvage an otherwise unconstitutionally broad statute. In so holding, we note that a district court has recently reached the same conclusion regarding a similar statute. See Cyberspace, Communications, Inc., 55 F. Supp. 2d at 751 (holding unconstitutional under the First Amendment a statute prohibiting the \"knowing[] disseminat[ion] to a minor [of] sexually explicit visual or verbal material that is harmful to minors\"); see also Shea v. Reno, 930 F. Supp. 916 (S.D.N.Y. 1996) (prior to the Supreme Court's analysis in Reno, holding the CDA unconstitutional under the First Amendment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. Commerce Clause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also held that plaintiffs in this case demonstrated a likelihood of success on their argument that section 30-37-3.2(A) violated the Commerce Clause. Although we need not reach this issue, since we have already held plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of success on their First Amendment argument, we do so, albeit briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"dormant implication of the Commerce Clause prohibits state . . . regulation . . . that discriminates against or unduly burdens interstate commerce and thereby 'imped[es] free private trade in the national marketplace.'\" General Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 287 (1997) (quoting Reeves, Inc. v. Stake, 447 U.S. 429, 437 (1980)) (citations omitted). Moreover, the Supreme Court has long recognized that certain types of commerce are uniquely suited to national, as opposed to state, regulation. See, e.g., Wabash, St. L. &amp; P.R. Co. v. Illinois, 118 U.S. 557 (1886) (holding states cannot regulate railroad rates).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that section 30-37-3.2(A) violated the Commerce Clause in three ways: (1) it regulates conduct occurring wholly outside of the state of New Mexico; (2) it constitutes an unreasonable and undue burden on interstate and foreign commerce; and (3) it subjects interstate use of the Internet to inconsistent state regulation. The court below largely relied upon the detailed Commerce Clause analysis in American Libraries Ass'n v. Pataki, 969 F. Supp. 160, 168-83 (S.D.N.Y. 1997). We agree with that analysis. As the Pataki court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unique nature of the Internet highlights the likelihood that a single actor might be subject to haphazard, uncoordinated, and even outright inconsistent regulation by states that the actor never intended to reach and possibly was unaware were being accessed. Typically, states' jurisdictional limits are related to geography; geography, however, is a virtually meaningless construct on the Internet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Id. at 168-69.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Regulation of conduct outside New Mexico</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue that section 30-37-3.2(A), properly construed, only addresses intrastate conduct. As the Pataki court stated in rejecting that same argument, that analysis \"is unsupportable in light of the text of the statute itself . . . and the reality of Internet communications.\" Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 169. Section 30-37-3.2(A) contains no express limitation confining it to communications which occur wholly within its borders. Rather, it \"applies to any communication, intrastate or interstate, that fits within the prohibition and over which [New Mexico] has the capacity to exercise criminal jurisdiction.\" Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 169-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the nature of the Internet forecloses the argument that a statute such as section 30-37-3.2(A) applies only to intrastate communications. Even if it is limited to one-on-one e-mail communications, as defendants assert section 30-37-3.2(A) properly is limited, there is no guarantee that a message from one New Mexican to another New Mexican will not travel through other states en route. See Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 171; see also Cyberspace, Communications, Inc., 55 F. Supp. 2d at 751 (\"virtually all Internet speech is . . . available everywhere\"). Thus, section 30-37-3.2(A) \"cannot effectively be limited to purely intrastate communications over the Internet because no such communications exist.\" Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 171. We therefore agree with the district court that section 30-37-3.2(A) represents an attempt to regulate interstate conduct occurring outside New Mexico's borders, and is accordingly a per se violation of the Commerce Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Burden on interstate commerce compared to local benefit</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We further agree, for the reasons outlined in Pataki, that section 30-37-3.2(A) is an invalid indirect regulation of interstate commerce because, under the balancing test of Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137, 142 (1970), the burdens on interstate commerce imposed by section 30-37-3.2(A) exceed any local benefits conferred by the statute. See V-1 Oil Co. v. Utah State Dep't of Pub. Safety, 131 F.3d 1415, 1423-24 (10th Cir. 1997). Defendants' primary response to this argument is to reiterate the importance of the state's interest in protecting minors from sexually oriented materials which are \"harmful to minors.\" We agree that the protection of minors from such materials is an undeniably compelling governmental interest, but the question in the context of the validity of section 30-37-3.2(A) is whether the means chosen to further that interest (&#167; 30-37-3.2(A)) excessively burden interstate commerce compared to the local benefits the statute actually confers. The local benefits of section 30-37-3.2(A), particularly as narrowly construed by defendants, are not huge. As the Pataki court noted with respect to the New York statute challenged in that case, section 30-37-3.2(A) \"can have no effect on communications originating outside the United States.\" Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 178.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, New Mexico's \"prosecution of parties from out of state who have allegedly violated [section 30-37-3.2(A)], but whose only contact with [New Mexico] occurs via the Internet, is beset with practical difficulties, even if [New Mexico] is able to exercise criminal jurisdiction over such parties.\" Id. Finally, defendants' own interpretation of the statute--that it applies only to one-on-one communications between a sender in New Mexico and a recipient in New Mexico whom the sender knows to be a minor--renders it so narrow in scope that the actual benefit conferred is extremely small. As another district court has observed with respect to the CDA, which defendants argue is broader in scope than section 30-37-3.2(A):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The statute] will almost certainly fail to accomplish the Government's interest in shielding children from pornography on the Internet. Nearly half of Internet communications originate outside the United States, and some percentage of that figure represents pornography. Pornography from, say, Amsterdam will be no less appealing to a child on the Internet than pornography from [Albuquerque], and residents of Amsterdam have little incentive to comply with [the statute].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ACLU v. Reno, 929 F. Supp. 824, 882 (E.D. Pa. 1996), aff'd, 521 U.S. 844 (1997). Balanced against those limited local benefits \"is an extreme burden on interstate commerce.\" Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 179. Thus, section 30-37-3.2(A) constitutes an invalid indirect regulation of interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c. Inconsistent regulation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third ground upon which the district court held section 30-37-3.2(A) violates the Commerce Clause is that it subjects the use of the Internet to inconsistent regulations. As we observed, supra, certain types of commerce have been recognized as requiring national regulation. See, e.g., Wabash, St. L. &amp; P. Ry. Co., 118 U.S. at 574-75 (noting that \"[c]ommerce with foreign countries and among the states\" requires \"only one system of rules, applicable alike to the whole country\"). The Internet is surely such a medium.

We disagree. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d) provides that an injunction binds not only the parties but also \"their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys, and . . . those persons in active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the order by personal service or otherwise.\" This action is a facial challenge to a New Mexico statute, brought against the governor and attorney general of New Mexico in their official capacities. Thus, it is an action against the State of New Mexico, see Monell v. New York City Dep't of Social Servs., 436 U.S. 658, 690 n.55 (1978) (observing that \"official-capacity suits generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an entity of which an officer is an agent\"), seeking to enjoin enforcement of section 30-37-3.2(A) by the State. Defendants argue the district attorneys received no notice of, nor have they participated in, this action, and they argue there is no indication that district attorneys are \"persons in active concert or participation with\" defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The district attorney is the law officer of the district [and] is to prosecute criminal cases on behalf of the State.\" State v.

To the extent district attorneys would attempt to enforce section 30-37-3.2(A), an injunction against the governor and attorney general prohibiting such enforcement binds those attorneys. The district court properly included district attorneys within its grant of injunctive relief. See Pataki, 969 F.

Defendants assert that:</p>\n        <p>[a]part from one dispositional paragraph inserted by the District Court, several non-substantive modifications, and the insertion of citations supporting the Conclusions of Law, the District Court incorporated all of Plaintiffs' Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law into its own Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and signed it just four days after receipt [from plaintiffs].</p>\n        <p>Defendants' Br. at 5-6. Defendants argue that this circumstance mandates that we view the district court's findings and conclusions with less deference than they would otherwise deserve. We of course review any legal conclusions de novo. Further, \"[t]he Supreme Court has held that although a trial judge may be criticized for his wholesale adoption of the prevailing party's findings of fact, nevertheless 'even when the trial judge adopts proposed findings verbatim, the findings are those of the court and may be reversed only if clearly erroneous.'\" Dowell v. Board of Educ., 8 F.3d 1501, 1509 (10th Cir. 1993) (quoting Anderson v.

The New Mexico statute defines \"harmful to minors\" as material which (1) \"predominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors,' and (2) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors,' and (3) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\" N.M. Stat. Ann. &#167; 30-37-1(F). Defendants argue that, since plaintiffs assert their Internet communications have social importance and are protected for adults, they fail to meet the definition of \"harmful to a minor.\" Defendants overlook the basic point that what may be \"patently offensive . . . for minors\" or \"utterly without redeeming social importance for minors\" may very well have social importance and not be patently offensive for adults.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Court has determined which level of scrutiny to apply to particular types of speech, depending in part on the particular speech medium involved. Thus, for example, attempts to regulate the print media have been subjected to strict scrutiny, while the broadcast media have been afforded less First Amendment protection. After examining the nature of the Internet, and concluding that it is more similar to the telephone as a communication medium than to the broadcast media, the Court in Reno determined that the Internet deserved the highest level of First Amendment protection.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The Court noted, as examples, the following ambiguities in the CDA's coverage: the term \"indecent\" is nowhere defined; the phrase \"in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs\" is ambiguous and, as applied to the Internet, \"means that any communication available to a nation-wide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message.\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 877-78.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The Court also observed that, even if the CDA only prohibited communications where the sender knew a recipient was under 18, it would still chill otherwise permissible speech among adults. This is so because it would permit a \"'heckler's veto' upon any opponent of indecent speech who might simply log on and inform the would-be discoursers that his 17-year-old child--a 'specific person . . . under 18 years of age,' would be present.\" Reno 521 U.S. at 880 (quoting 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d)(1)(A)).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> In Ginsberg, the Supreme Court upheld a statute which prohibited the sale to minors of materials that were \"harmful to minors\" even though they were not obscene or otherwise prohibited for adults. \"Harmful to minors\" had a specific three-part definition. Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 646. Section 30-37-3.2(A) contains the same definition of \"harmful to minors.\"</p>\n        <p>Defendants argue that \"[t]his case is an electronic Ginsberg case, or cyber-Ginsberg: nothing more, nothing less.\" Defendants' Br. at 7. We disagree. As the Supreme Court noted in Reno, there are significant differences between Ginsberg, involving face-to-face sales of magazines, and a case such as this one and Reno, involving communications on the Internet: (1) the prohibition against sales to minors in Ginsberg did not prevent parents from purchasing the prohibited magazines for their children, whereas under the CDA, or section 30-37-3.2(A), \"neither the parents' consent--nor even their participation--in the communication would avoid the application of the statute,\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 865; (2) the statute in Ginsberg applied only to commercial transactions, whereas the CDA and section 30-37-3.2(A) apply to commercial and non-commercial transactions, the latter of which comprise a measurable proportion of Internet communications; and (3) the statute in Ginsberg defined minors as those under 17, whereas the CDA and section 30-37-3.2(A) include an additional year because they define minors as those under 18. See Reno, 521 U.S. at 865-66. Additionally, as the district court noted recently in Cyberspace, Communications:</p>\n        <p>[I]n [Ginsberg], the \"materials\" referenced were magazines . . . . Magazines . . . can be brown bagged or hidden in the backroom of purveyors. With the Internet, you would have to \"close the bookstore\" because the disseminator and the recipient are not face to face. A magazine can be regulated or censored by the county in which it is located. A person's age can be verified because the person is physically there, and the disseminator can logically be held responsible for conveying \"sexually explicit matter\" to a minor. The Internet does not distinguish between minors and adults in their audience. To comply with the Act, a communicant must speak only in language suitable for children.</p>\n        <p>Cyberspace, Communications, Inc., 55 F. Supp. 2d at 747; see also Reno, 521 U.S. at 889 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the \"twin characteristics of geography and identity\" differentiate the world of Ginsberg from that of the Internet).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Defendants attempt to distinguish Reno on this point, by arguing that the CDA was broader than section 30-37-3.2(A). They cite the CDA's prohibition on the use of a computer to \"display in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age\" certain material. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d)(1)(B). As plaintiffs note, this argument ignores the fact that the Supreme Court held other parts of the CDA unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, including the knowing initiation of the transmission of certain material to someone \"knowing the recipient is under 18 years of age\" and the knowing sending of material to \"a specific person or persons under 18 years of age.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a)(1)(B), (d)(1)(A). Those provisions are virtually identical to the narrowed construction of section 30-37-3.2(A) that defendants urge us to adopt. The Supreme Court's rejection of the argument that the \"knowledge\" and the \"specific person\" requirements salvaged the overbreadth of the CDA compels the rejection of defendants' similar argument in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Although defendants initially attempted to argue that the \"non-commercial, recreational use\" of the Internet is not \"commerce\" subject to the Commerce Clause, they wisely appeared to withdraw from that argument and agree that Internet communication can affect interstate commerce and, therefore, be subject to the Commerce Clause.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In their opening appellate brief, defendants asserted that \"[c]ertification may be appropriate on remand, [but they] do not request it at this juncture of the litigation.\" Defendants' Br. at 64. In their reply brief, however, they argued that our resolution of the scope of section 30-37-3.2(A) would \"improperly oust[] the role of state courts in the interpretation of New Mexico's statutes.\" Defendants' Reply Br. at 18. At oral argument, they asked us to certify to the New Mexico Supreme Court the proper interpretation of section 30-37-3.2(A). Or, as they argued below, they would have us abstain from considering the constitutionality of the statute, pending an interpretation of the statute by the New Mexico courts.</p>\n        <p>The Supreme Court has observed that it is \"particularly reluctant to abstain in cases involving facial challenges based on the First Amendment.\" City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 467 (1987). Given the obvious and facial overbreadth of the state statute at issue, and the fact that it is not reasonably susceptible to an appropriate limiting construction, abstention or certification are unnecessary.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Defendants also argue that the district court, rather than enjoining the entire statute, should have tailored the injunction to enjoin only the unconstitutional aspects of section 30-37-3.2(A). They suggest, and we discern, no reasonable way to do so, see Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 504-05 (1985), and neither we, nor the district court, may rewrite the statute to avoid the constitutional problems we have identified. See United States v. National Treasury Employees Union, 513 U.S. 454, 479 &amp; n.26 (1995). Defendants also challenge the district court's injunction to the extent it prohibits them from \"investigating or reviewing any matter based on or premised upon\" section 30-37-3.2(A). Order, Appellants' App. Vol. II at 415. This argument is meritless. If section 30-37-3.2(A) is deemed unconstitutional in its entirety, there could be no investigation or review premised upon it.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

One defense addressed those who take \"good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions\" to restrict access by minors to the prohibited communications. &#167; 223(e)(5)(A). The other defense addressed those who restrict access to the prohibited communications \"by requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number.\" &#167; 223(e)(5)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs in Reno challenged the CDA as facially overbroad in violation of the First Amendment and vague in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The Court held the statute was overbroad and vague in violation of the First Amendment without separately reaching Fifth Amendment vagueness. The Court reached that conclusion by considering both the particular language and structure of the CDA, as well as the nature and function of the Internet. It held that \"the vague contours of the coverage of the statute\" cause it to \"unquestionably silence[] some speakers whose messages would be entitled to constitutional protection.\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 874.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This is particularly troublesome because the CDA is a \"content-based regulation of speech\" which imposes criminal liability.

That factual premise is incorrect when the communication medium is the Internet because \"[g]iven the size of the potential audience for most messages, . . . the sender must be charged with knowing that one or more minors will likely view it.\" Id.

Id. The government argued that, properly and narrowly construed, the CDA prohibited \"the dissemination of indecent messages only to persons known to be under 18.\" Id. at 880. The Court rejected this interpretation, stating that it \"ignores the fact that most Internet fora--including chat rooms, newsgroups, mail exploders, and the Web--are open to all comers. The Government's assertion that the knowledge requirement somehow protects the communications of adults is therefore untenable. Even the strongest reading of the 'specific person' requirement of &#167; 223(d) cannot save the statute.\" Id.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Court rejected the contention that the CDA's defenses salvage the Act.

With respect to the defense of requiring use of a verified credit card or adult identification number, the Court observed that commercial providers of sexually explicit material already employ such techniques, but there is no proof that they actually work, and it is not economically feasible for non-commercial speakers to employ such techniques. Thus, the Government has \"failed to prove that the proffered defense[s] would significantly reduce the heavy burden on adult speech produced by the prohibition on offensive displays.\" Id. at 882.

They thus argue that section 30-37-3.2(A) \"does not apply to group communications which include both adults and minors in the group, or where a fact situation presents a mere probability that minors may be part of the receiving group.\" Aplts.'

We agree with plaintiffs that defendants' proposed narrowing construction really amounts to a wholesale rewriting of the statute. That we cannot do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants argue section 30-37-3.2(A) only applies where the recipient is \"solely and exclusively an individual minor recipient.\" Aplts.' Br. at 21. As plaintiffs point out, the statute nowhere uses those limiting words, nor is it readily susceptible to such a limiting construction. The statute criminalizes \"knowingly and intentionally initiat[ing] or engag[ing] in communication with a [minor].\" &#167; 30-37-3.2(A). It does not limit such communication to one-on-one situations where the only recipient is a single minor. Indeed, as plaintiffs note, defendants' interpretation would lead to the absurd result that no violation of the statute would occur if someone sent a message to two minors, or a chat room full of minors, or a minor and an adult.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue that the intent clause (\"knowingly and intentionally initiate or engage in communication with a person under eighteen\") appropriately narrows the statute. But the statutory definition of \"knowingly\" only requires \"having general knowledge of, or reason to know, or a belief or ground for belief which warrants further inspection or inquiry of . . . the age of the minor.\" N.M. Stat. Ann. &#167; 30-37-1(G). As the Supreme Court acknowledged in Reno, \"[g]iven the size of the potential audience for most messages [on the Internet], in the absence of a viable age verification process, the sender must be charged with knowing that one or more minors will likely view it.\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 876. Thus, virtually all communication on the Internet would meet the statutory definition of \"knowingly\" and potentially be subject to liability under section 30-37-3.2(A). Indeed, the Supreme Court unequivocally rejected this very argument in Reno: \"[t]he Government's assertion that the knowledge requirement somehow protects the communications of adults is . . . untenable. Even the strongest reading of the 'specific person' requirement of &#167; 223(d) cannot save the statute.\" Id. at 880 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, as defendants virtually concede in their reply brief, the defenses contained in the New Mexico statute are inconsistent with defendants' interpretation of the statute. If section 30-37-3.2(A) only applies to a person who intentionally communicates with a particular individual whom he or she knows to be a minor, it would be nonsensical to permit such a person to avoid liability by arguing the good faith defense, or asking for a credit card number or other age verification or labeling his or her speech. The fact that the defenses are directed at group communications that have unique dynamics on the Internet certainly suggests that the basic prohibition of the statute also includes, and was intended to include, group communications. This further undermines the viability of defendants' interpretation of section 30-37-3.2(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the statute as written, like the CDA, unconstitutionally burdens otherwise protected adult communication on the Internet.

We disagree. The Supreme Court in Reno held that a \"good faith\" defense virtually identical to the defense provided in &#167; 30-37-3.2(C)(1) was \"illusory.\" Id. at 881. It also held that a defense requiring verification by means of a credit card or adult access or identification code was equally ineffective because the government \"failed to prove that the proffered defense would significantly reduce the heavy burden on adult speech produced by the prohibition on offensive displays.\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 882. Finally, defendants in this case have not demonstrated, nor do they seriously argue, that the third defense, exempting those who \"in good faith establish a mechanism such as labeling, segregation or other means that enables indecent material to be automatically blocked or screened\" will be any more effective at actually preventing minors from accessing material on the Internet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore agree with the district court that, as in Reno, the defenses to section 30-37-3.2(A) do not salvage an otherwise unconstitutionally broad statute.

Moreover, the Supreme Court has long recognized that certain types of commerce are uniquely suited to national, as opposed to state, regulation. See, e.g., Wabash, St. L. &amp; P.R. Co. v.

The court below largely relied upon the detailed Commerce Clause analysis in American Libraries Ass'n v. Pataki, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1808497\"><a href=\"/opinion/1808497/american-libraries-assn-v-pataki/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

As the Pataki court observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unique nature of the Internet highlights the likelihood that a single actor might be subject to haphazard, uncoordinated, and even outright inconsistent regulation by states that the actor never intended to reach and possibly was unaware were being accessed.

As the Pataki court stated in rejecting that same argument, that analysis \"is unsupportable in light of the text of the statute itself . . . and the reality of Internet communications.\" Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 169. Section 30-37-3.2(A) contains no express limitation confining it to communications which occur wholly within its borders. Rather, it \"applies to any communication, intrastate or interstate, that fits within the prohibition and over which [New Mexico] has the capacity to exercise criminal jurisdiction.\" Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 169-70.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the nature of the Internet forecloses the argument that a statute such as section 30-37-3.2(A) applies only to intrastate communications. Even if it is limited to one-on-one e-mail communications, as defendants assert section 30-37-3.2(A) properly is limited, there is no guarantee that a message from one New Mexican to another New Mexican will not travel through other states en route. See Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 171; see also Cyberspace, Communications, Inc., 55 F. Supp. 2d at 751 (\"virtually all Internet speech is . . . available everywhere\"). Thus, section 30-37-3.2(A) \"cannot effectively be limited to purely intrastate communications over the Internet because no such communications exist.\" Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 171. We therefore agree with the district court that section 30-37-3.2(A) represents an attempt to regulate interstate conduct occurring outside New Mexico's borders, and is accordingly a per se violation of the Commerce Clause.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Bruce Church, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 142 (1970), the burdens on interstate commerce imposed by section 30-37-3.2(A) exceed any local benefits conferred by the statute. See V-1 Oil Co. v. Utah State Dep't of Pub. Safety, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749433\"><a href=\"/opinion/749433/v-1-oil-company-v-utah-state-department-of-public-safety-d-douglas/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1415</span></a></span>, 1423-24 (10th Cir. 1997). Defendants' primary response to this argument is to reiterate the importance of the state's interest in protecting minors from sexually oriented materials which are \"harmful to minors.\" We agree that the protection of minors from such materials is an undeniably compelling governmental interest, but the question in the context of the validity of section 30-37-3.2(A) is whether the means chosen to further that interest (&#167; 30-37-3.2(A)) excessively burden interstate commerce compared to the local benefits the statute actually confers. The local benefits of section 30-37-3.2(A), particularly as narrowly construed by defendants, are not huge. As the Pataki court noted with respect to the New York statute challenged in that case, section 30-37-3.2(A) \"can have no effect on communications originating outside the United States.\" Pataki, 969 F. Supp. at 178.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, New Mexico's \"prosecution of parties from out of state who have allegedly violated [section 30-37-3.2(A)], but whose only contact with [New Mexico] occurs via the Internet, is beset with practical difficulties, even if [New Mexico] is able to exercise criminal jurisdiction over such parties.\" Id. Finally, defendants' own interpretation of the statute--that it applies only to one-on-one communications between a sender in New Mexico and a recipient in New Mexico whom the sender knows to be a minor--renders it so narrow in scope that the actual benefit conferred is extremely small. As another district court has observed with respect to the CDA, which defendants argue is broader in scope than section 30-37-3.2(A):</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The statute] will almost certainly fail to accomplish the Government's interest in shielding children from pornography on the Internet. Nearly half of Internet communications originate outside the United States, and some percentage of that figure represents pornography.

The Internet is surely such a medium. We agree with the court in Pataki, when it observed, \"[t]he Internet, like . . . rail and highway traffic . . ., requires a cohesive national scheme of regulation so that users are reasonably able to determine their obligations.\" Pataki, 969 F.

Thus, it is an action against the State of New Mexico, see Monell v.

The New Mexico statute defines \"harmful to minors\" as material which (1) \"predominately appeals to the prurient, shameful or morbid interest of minors,' and (2) is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable material for minors,' and (3) is utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.\" N.M. Stat. Ann. &#167; 30-37-1(F). Defendants argue that, since plaintiffs assert their Internet communications have social importance and are protected for adults, they fail to meet the definition of \"harmful to a minor.\" Defendants overlook the basic point that what may be \"patently offensive . . . for minors\" or \"utterly without redeeming social importance for minors\" may very well have social importance and not be patently offensive for adults.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The Court has determined which level of scrutiny to apply to particular types of speech, depending in part on the particular speech medium involved.

Ginsberg, 390 U.S. at 646. Section 30-37-3.2(A) contains the same definition of \"harmful to minors.\"</p>\n        <p>Defendants argue that \"[t]his case is an electronic Ginsberg case, or cyber-Ginsberg: nothing more, nothing less.\" Defendants' Br. at 7. We disagree. As the Supreme Court noted in Reno, there are significant differences between Ginsberg, involving face-to-face sales of magazines, and a case such as this one and Reno, involving communications on the Internet: (1) the prohibition against sales to minors in Ginsberg did not prevent parents from purchasing the prohibited magazines for their children, whereas under the CDA, or section 30-37-3.2(A), \"neither the parents' consent--nor even their participation--in the communication would avoid the application of the statute,\" Reno, 521 U.S. at 865; (2) the statute in Ginsberg applied only to commercial transactions, whereas the CDA and section 30-37-3.2(A) apply to commercial and non-commercial transactions, the latter of which comprise a measurable proportion of Internet communications; and (3) the statute in Ginsberg defined minors as those under 17, whereas the CDA and section 30-37-3.2(A) include an additional year because they define minors as those under 18. See Reno, 521 U.S. at 865-66. Additionally, as the district court noted recently in Cyberspace, Communications:</p>\n        <p>[I]n [Ginsberg], the \"materials\" referenced were magazines . . . . Magazines . . . can be brown bagged or hidden in the backroom of purveyors. With the Internet, you would have to \"close the bookstore\" because the disseminator and the recipient are not face to face. A magazine can be regulated or censored by the county in which it is located. A person's age can be verified because the person is physically there, and the disseminator can logically be held responsible for conveying \"sexually explicit matter\" to a minor. The Internet does not distinguish between minors and adults in their audience. To comply with the Act, a communicant must speak only in language suitable for children.</p>\n        <p>Cyberspace, Communications, Inc., 55 F. Supp. 2d at 747; see also Reno, 521 U.S. at 889 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part) (noting that the \"twin characteristics of geography and identity\" differentiate the world of Ginsberg from that of the Internet).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Defendants attempt to distinguish Reno on this point, by arguing that the CDA was broader than section 30-37-3.2(A). They cite the CDA's prohibition on the use of a computer to \"display in a manner available to a person under 18 years of age\" certain material. 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d)(1)(B). As plaintiffs note, this argument ignores the fact that the Supreme Court held other parts of the CDA unconstitutionally overbroad and vague, including the knowing initiation of the transmission of certain material to someone \"knowing the recipient is under 18 years of age\" and the knowing sending of material to \"a specific person or persons under 18 years of age.\" 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a)(1)(B), (d)(1)(A). Those provisions are virtually identical to the narrowed construction of section 30-37-3.2(A) that defendants urge us to adopt. The Supreme Court's rejection of the argument that the \"knowledge\" and the \"specific person\" requirements salvaged the overbreadth of the CDA compels the rejection of defendants' similar argument in this case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Although defendants initially attempted to argue that the \"non-commercial, recreational use\" of the Internet is not \"commerce\" subject to the Commerce Clause, they wisely appeared to withdraw from that argument and agree that Internet communication can affect interstate commerce and, therefore, be subject to the Commerce Clause.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In their opening appellate brief, defendants asserted that \"[c]ertification may be appropriate on remand, [but they] do not request it at this juncture of the litigation.\" Defendants' Br. at 64. In their reply brief, however, they argued that our resolution of the scope of section 30-37-3.2(A) would \"improperly oust[] the role of state courts in the interpretation of New Mexico's statutes.\" Defendants' Reply Br. at 18. At oral argument, they asked us to certify to the New Mexico Supreme Court the proper interpretation of section 30-37-3.2(A). Or, as they argued below, they would have us abstain from considering the constitutionality of the statute, pending an interpretation of the statute by the New Mexico courts.</p>\n        <p>The Supreme Court has observed that it is \"particularly reluctant to abstain in cases involving facial challenges based on the First Amendment.\" City of Houston v. Hill, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111919\"><a href=\"/opinion/111919/houston-v-hill/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">451</span></a></span>, 467 (1987). Given the obvious and facial overbreadth of the state statute at issue, and the fact that it is not reasonably susceptible to an appropriate limiting construction, abstention or certification are unnecessary.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> Defendants also argue that the district court, rather than enjoining the entire statute, should have tailored the injunction to enjoin only the unconstitutional aspects of section 30-37-3.2(A). They suggest, and we discern, no reasonable way to do so, see Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111480\"><a href=\"/opinion/111480/brockett-v-spokane-arcades-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span>, 504-05 (1985), and neither we, nor the district court, may rewrite the statute to avoid the constitutional problems we have identified. See United States v. National Treasury Employees Union, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117898\"><a href=\"/opinion/117898/united-states-v-national-treasury-employees-union/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">454</span></a></span>, 479 &amp; n.26 (1995). Defendants also challenge the district court's injunction to the extent it prohibits them from \"investigating or reviewing any matter based on or premised upon\" section 30-37-3.2(A). Order, Appellants' App. Vol. II at 415. This argument is meritless. If section 30-37-3.2(A) is deemed unconstitutional in its entirety, there could be no investigation or review premised upon it.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
