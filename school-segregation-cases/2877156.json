INTRODUCTION\n\n        This matter comes on before the court on an appeal by Exel\nTransportation Services, Inc. (“Exel”) from the district court’s order\nentered on July 21, 2004, denying Exel’s claim for payment as\nadministrative expenses from the statutory trust created by the\nPerishable Agricultural Commodities Act (“PACA”), 7 U.S.C. §\n499e(c), for its services in transporting produce for defendant A & B\nProduce, Inc. Exel, a logistics company, arranged and paid for the\ntransportation of produce from sellers and suppliers to A & B\nProduce, Inc., but A & B Produce, Inc. did not pay Exel for its\nservices. At around the same time, various unpaid sellers and\nsuppliers of produce filed complaints against A & B Produce, Inc.\nseeking to recover benefits pursuant to PACA. Even though there\nwere multiple sellers and suppliers of the produce, as a matter of\nconvenience we hereinafter will refer to one of the plaintiffs, Pacific\nInternational Marketing, Inc. (“Pacific”), a seller and provider in the\nsame position in this litigation as all of the plaintiffs, as if it had been\nthe sole seller and provider and as the sole plaintiff. Exel intervened\nseeking to recover its unpaid transportation expenses from the PACA\ntrust funds prior to their distribution to the trust beneficiaries. After\nthe district court denied Exel’s claim, Exel appealed, but we will\naffirm the district court’s order.\n\n\n\n             II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        The parties do not dispute the relevant facts. A & B Produce,\nInc., which now is defunct, formerly was engaged in the business of\nbuying produce from various sellers and suppliers for ultimate resale.\nPursuant to its contract with A & B Produce, Inc., Exel arranged and\npaid for the transportation of produce from sellers and suppliers of\nproduce to A & B Produce, Inc. In doing so, Exel paid certain carriers\nto transport seven shipments of produce from various sellers and\nsuppliers to, or for the benefit of, A & B Produce, Inc. Exel submitted\n\n\n                                     3\n\finvoices to A & B Produce, Inc., which acknowledges that it received\nthe shipments, for the freight charges in the sum of $39,200, but A &\nB Produce, Inc. did not pay Exel for its services.\n\n        On June 10, 2003, Pacific, a produce wholesaler, filed a\ncomplaint, later amended, in the district court against A & B Produce,\nInc. and Anthony Badolato, its president (collectively “A & B\nProduce”), alleging that A & B Produce failed to pay for produce that\nit purchased from Pacific. Pacific claimed that it was the beneficiary\nof a statutory trust under PACA, 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c), from which it\nwas entitled to recover payment for the produce.\n\n         On October 1, 2003, Pacific and A & B Produce entered into a\nstipulation and order, pursuant to which A & B Produce agreed to\nliquidate its assets subject to the PACA trust for the benefit of the\npotential PACA trust beneficiaries. On November 14, 2003, Exel\nfiled a complaint in intervention in Pacific’s action seeking to recover\nthe cost of the transportation services that it provided to A & B\nProduce prior to the distribution of PACA trust funds to the PACA\ntrust beneficiaries. Exel, however, did not claim to be a PACA trust\nbeneficiary; rather, Exel sought payment for its transportation services\nas an administrative expense chargeable to the res of the PACA trust\nprior to any distribution of the PACA trust funds to the beneficiaries.\nPacific opposed Exel’s claim.\n\n        The district court denied Exel’s claim for payment for its\ntransportation services as administrative expenses of the PACA trust\non the ground that allowing Exel payment “ahead of the PACA trust\nbeneficiaries . . . would defeat the purpose of the PACA [trust] to\nplace unpaid sellers in a priority position and expand the term\n‘administrative expense’ too far.” App. at 7. Exel then appealed.\n\n\n\n       III. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(5). See Tanimura & Antle, Inc. v.\nPacked Fresh Produce, Inc., 222 F.3d 132, 138 (3d Cir. 2000)\n(“[D]istrict courts clearly have jurisdiction over actions by private\nparties seeking to enforce payment from the [PACA] trust.”). We\nhave jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 as the district court\ncertified the July 21, 2004 order as final under Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\n\n\n                                    4\n\fSee Gerardi v. Pelullo, 16 F.3d 1363, 1368 (3d Cir. 1994). We review\nthe district court’s interpretation of PACA on a de novo basis.\nIdahoan Fresh v. Advantage Produce, Inc., 157 F.3d 197, 202 (3d Cir.\n1998).\n\n\n\n                          IV. DISCUSSION\n\nA. Background\n\n         We begin with an overview of PACA. In 1930, Congress\nenacted PACA to promote fair trading practices in the produce\nindustry. See 7 U.S.C. §§ 499a-499s; Idahoan Fresh, 157 F.3d at 199.\nSpecifically, “Congress intended PACA to protect small farmers and\ngrowers who were vulnerable to the practices of financially\nirresponsible buyers.” Id. at 199 (footnote omitted). “Under PACA,\nit is unlawful for buyers of produce, inter alia, to fail to make prompt\npayment for a shipment of produce.” Id. (citing 7 U.S.C. § 499b(4)).\nA buyer’s failure to tender prompt payment triggers civil liability and\nthe possible suspension or revocation of the buyer’s PACA license\nthat 7 U.S.C. § 499c requires. See 7 U.S.C. § 499h(a). The PACA\nregulations define the time for prompt payment, which applies unless\nthe parties agree otherwise in writing to different payment provisions\nprior to the transaction. See 7 C.F.R. § 46.2(aa).\n\n        Congress later amended PACA to provide the additional\nremedy of a statutory trust provision for “suppliers, sellers, or agents”\nagainst buyers who fail to make prompt payment. 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c);\nsee also P.L. 98-273; H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 2 (1983), reprinted in\n1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 406. Congress provided this remedy because\n“[p]rior to this amendment, unpaid produce suppliers were unsecured\ncreditors vulnerable to the buyers’ practice of granting other creditors\na security interest in their inventory and accounts receivable.”\nIdahoan Fresh, 157 F.3d at 199. Under the PACA statutory trust\nprovision, a buyer’s produce, products derived from that produce, and\nthe proceeds gained therefrom are held in a non-segregated, floating\ntrust for the benefit of unpaid suppliers, sellers, and agents who meet\nthe applicable statutory requirements to be granted the status of PACA\ntrust fund beneficiaries. See 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c); 7 C.F.R. §§\n46.46(b), (c). Thus, the PACA statutory trust grants certain unpaid\nsuppliers and sellers of produce and their agents an interest in the\nPACA trust assets superior to that of a buyer’s perfected, secured\n\n                                   5\n\fcreditor. Idahoan Fresh, 157 F.3d at 199. The issue presented on this\nappeal is whether Exel, which does not claim to be a PACA\nbeneficiary, is entitled to payment for its transportation services for\nthe shipments of produce to A & B Produce as administrative\nexpenses chargeable against the PACA trust prior to the distribution\nof PACA trust funds to the PACA trust beneficiaries.\n\nB. Common Law Trust Principles\n\n         Although PACA does not include a provision authorizing the\npayment of trust administrative expenses, several courts have relied\non common law trust principles to allow for the payment of certain\nadministrative expenses, such as attorneys’ fees or fees for services\nrendered in collecting receivables for the benefit of the PACA trust, to\nbe paid from the corpus of the PACA trust prior to its distribution to\nthe statutory beneficiaries. See, e.g., In re Milton Poulos, Inc., 947\nF.2d 1351, 1353 (9th Cir. 1991); In re Southland + Keystone, 132\nB.R. 632, 643 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1991); In re United Fruit & Produce\nCo., 119 B.R. 10, 13 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1990) (“[W]ell-settled trust\nlaw furnishes the basis for compensating a trustee, unless [PACA]\notherwise provides.”). These cases generally require the claimant to\ndemonstrate that its efforts and resultant expenses were “directly\nresponsible for the availability of the funds from the [PACA] trust.”\nSee, e.g, Milton Poulos, 947 F.2d at 1353. For example, in Milton\nPoulos the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit awarded attorneys’\nfees to the attorneys for a produce supplier because, “[t]hrough their\nefforts, the bankruptcy court declared the trust valid and enforceable,\nthereby permitting the funds to be [disbursed] among the trust\n[beneficiaries.]” Id. at 1353. The court further explained that “the\nefforts of these attorneys resulted in a common fund for the group.”\nId.\n\n        Similarly, in United Fruit the bankruptcy court relied on\ncommon law trust principles as well as section 506(c) of the\nBankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 506, in compensating a bankruptcy\ntrustee for its “necessary” services from the PACA trust funds prior to\ntheir distribution. 119 B.R. at 13 & n.5. The court explained that\n“[t]he bankruptcy trustee of the debtor’s estate . . . rendered\nsubstantial services in collecting the PACA receivable for the benefit\nof the PACA beneficiaries and in contesting [a seller’s] claim that it is\nentitled to a priority payment from [the PACA trust.]” Id. at 13. The\ncourt further explained that “[t]he non-PACA creditors should not pay\nfor these services and the trustee should not be forced to donate\n\n\n                                   6\n\fthem.” Id. The court in Southland + Keystone, in harmony with the\ncourt in United Fruit, allowed the trustee “to offset [from PACA trust\nfund monies] its collection costs.” 132 B.R. at 643. The court,\nhowever, limited the amount of the offset “to the ‘hard’ costs of\ncollection such as outside attorney’s fees and expenses that were\nnecessary to the collection effort,” and stated that costs such as\n“overhead expenses are not recoverable.” Id.\n\n        Conversely, some courts have declined to allow the payment\nof attorneys’ fees from the PACA trust funds. For example, in C.H.\nRobinson Co. v. Alanco Corp., 239 F.3d 483, 485-88 (2d Cir. 2001),\nthe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dealt with a case in which\nthe attorney for the buyer of produce sought payment of attorneys’\nfees incurred in collecting the buyer’s accounts receivable from which\nthe produce seller recovered a portion of its unpaid receivables. The\ncourt did not allow the payment of the attorneys’ fees and in doing so\nrejected the argument that the fees should be allowed on the theory\nthat the buyer’s accounts constituted assets of the PACA trust. See\nalso Goldman-Hayden Co. v. Fresh Source Produce, Inc., 217 F.3d\n348, 352-53 (5th Cir. 2000) (declining to award attorneys’ fees to\nsellers because “[i]t does not appear that [the sellers] sued to create a\nPACA trust from which all potential PACA creditors could be\ncompensated . . . [and] [b]ecause the litigation did not result in the\nestablishment of a common fund” for the benefit of all unpaid PACA\ncreditors).\n\n        Exel argues that it “has a valid claim for recovery of its freight\ncharges as administrative expenses of the PACA trust because . . . A\n& B Produce incurred those freight charges in its role as the trustee of\nthe PACA trust account.” Appellant’s br. at 21. Exel asserts that,\n“[w]ithout [its] services, there would be substantially less trust assets\nfor distribution.” Id. at 20. But even if we accept the factual basis for\nExel’s argument and adhere to the general view that a non-PACA\ncreditor in some circumstances is entitled to payment of necessary and\nactual charges that it incurred for the benefit of the PACA trust\nbeneficiaries, we are satisfied that the transportation costs that Exel\nseeks to recover do not constitute administrative expenses incurred for\nthe benefit of the PACA trust beneficiaries. Therefore, common law\ntrust principles do not afford Exel the right to payment for its\ntransportation services as administrative expenses of the PACA trust.1\n\n\n       1\n      Exel argues, inter alia, that it is entitled to payment under\ncommon law trust principles because the PACA trust “attached to the\n\n                                    7\n\f        In particular, Exel did not provide the transportation services\nto A & B Produce to increase the value of the trust res for the benefit\nof the PACA trust beneficiaries. In other words, even though the\ntransportation of the produce to A & B Produce ultimately generated a\nportion of the proceeds that came to constitute the res of the PACA\ntrust, Exel’s services were not “directly responsible for the availability\nof the funds,” Milton Poulos, 947 F.2d at 1353, and its services\ncertainly do not qualify as the “hard costs of collection.” Southland +\nKeystone, 132 B.R. at 643 (internal quotation marks omitted). Exel\nperformed these services for A & B Produce during the ordinary\ncourse of A & B Produce’s business operations rather than to augment\nthe corpus of the trust.\n\n         Obviously, when Exel arranged for the transportation of the\nproduce to A & B Produce, Pacific and A & B Produce had not yet\nentered into the October 1, 2003 stipulation and order concerning the\nimposition and administration of the trust. Moreover, Exel provided\nfor the transportation of the produce without any court order\nauthorizing or directing it to do so; rather Exel acted in accordance\nwith its contract with A & B Produce. Indeed, we cannot even\nconceive that if Exel had believed before it arranged for and paid for\nthe transportation of the produce to A & B Produce or for its benefit\nthat it would need to seek payment for its services as an\nadministrative expense from a PACA trust, it would have accepted A\n& B Produce’s business.\n\n         As Pacific correctly notes, if we accepted Exel’s\ncharacterization of its transportation services as being “in furtherance\nof its administration of the trust,” Appellant’s br. at 21, “a multitude\nof general unsecured creditors [of the buyer of the produce] could step\nforward and assert ‘administrative expense’ claims for services\nperformed in the course of produce transactions.” Appellees’ br. at\n28. A partial list of these creditors would include “trucking\ncompanies which transport produce, utility companies, which ensure\n\n\nproduce at the time it was tendered to [the carrier] for carriage.”\nAppellant’s br. at 22. However, the existence of the trust is not\ndispositive inasmuch as we still must consider the central issue in\ndeciding whether to apply common law trust principles, i.e., whether the\nefforts and expenses of an alleged PACA trustee, such as A & B Produce\nin employing Exel to transport the produce, were “directly responsible\nfor the availability of the funds from the [PACA] trust.” See Milton\nPoulos, 947 F.2d at 1353.\n\n                                    8\n\fthat produce companies have electrical power to refrigerate the\nproduce, paper companies, which provide the paper on which invoices\nare printed and employees, who sold the [p]roduce and collected the\nproceeds.” Appellee’s br. at 28. Ultimately characterizing Exel’s\nservices as administrative expenses would enable all sorts of the\nbuyer’s unpaid creditors to assert priority administration expense\nclaims ahead of the claims of the sellers and other entities that\nCongress intended to protect as beneficiaries of the PACA trust. The\nclaims of such creditors, including Exel’s, are simply too tangential to\nthe claims that Congress intended PACA to protect to permit their\npayment as PACA administrative expenses.\n\n         We further emphasize that “[t]rusts created under PACA are\nstatutory trusts, [to which] common law trust principles are not\napplicable if they conflict with the language of [PACA], the clear\nintent of Congress in enacting the statute, or the accompanying\nregulations.” C.H. Robinson, 239 F.3d at 487. Indeed, “[t]he\napplicability of any principle of trust law to a PACA trust must be\ntested against the language and purpose of the statute and the\naccompanying regulations.” Id. PACA expressly protects unpaid\nsellers, suppliers, and agents as trust beneficiaries, see 7 U.S.C. §\n499e(c)(2), and “entitles the trust beneficiary to a sum certain.” C.H.\nRobinson, 239 F.3d at 487. “PACA’s purpose, as Congress has\ncrystallized, is to ensure payment to the unpaid seller in the perishable\nagricultural commodities industry.” Tanimura, 222 F.3d at 138.\nAccordingly, “[i]f PACA’s trust is to have any meaning, and\nCongress’s intent is to be effectuated in any way, trust assets must be\npreserved and not dissipated,” id., and “PACA trust beneficiaries are\nentitled to full payment before trustees may lawfully use trust funds to\npay other creditors.” C.H. Robinson, 239 F.3d at 488.\n\n        Accordingly, we will not apply common law trust principles to\nallow Exel to recover charges that it characterizes as administrative\nexpenses when doing so would conflict with the statutory language\nand Congress’ intent to protect unpaid sellers and suppliers above\nnon-PACA beneficiaries such as Exel. See C.H. Robinson, 239 F.3d\nat 486 (“[C]ases in which there was no clash between the language of\nPACA and common law trust principles do not undermine the most\nfundamental principle of statutory interpretation that the language of\nthe statute must govern.”).\n\nC. Statutory Basis\n\n\n\n                                    9\n\f       Exel also argues that “[a]llowance of payment [in this case] is\nconsistent with the statutory and regulatory treatment of direct costs or\nexpenses incurred by the buyer in connection with its purchases of\nproduce impressed with the PACA trust.” Appellant’s reply br. at 6.\nWe recognize that PACA does not limit the recovery of a seller,\nsupplier, or agent to only the cost of the commodity itself. Indeed,\nCongress “chose to allow ‘full payment of the sums owing in\nconnection with [commodities] transactions,’ [which] unambiguously\nencompasses not only the price of commodities but also related\nexpenses.” Country Best v. Christopher Ranch, LLC, 361 F.3d 629,\n632 (11th Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (emphasis by court) (quoting 7\nU.S.C. § 499e(c)(2)). Thus, a PACA beneficiary also may recover\nexpenses and fees that are due contractually or otherwise “in\nconnection with” the transaction that is the subject of the PACA trust\nclaim. See Middle Mountain Land & Produce, Inc. v. Sound\nCommodities, Inc., 307 F.3d 1220, 1223 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n         For example, in Middle Mountain, 307 F.3d at 1223, the Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit allowed a trust beneficiary to collect\nattorneys’ fees and interest because the invoice for the produce\ncreated a contractual right to such fees, and thus the fees were “within\nthe scope of the statute’s protection of ‘full payment owing in\nconnection with the [PACA] transaction.’” (quoting 7 U.S.C. §\n499e(c)(2)). The court explained that “[i]t is unlikely that Congress,\nin enacting a statute to provide better insolvency remedies to\nperishable agricultural commodities sellers, wanted selectively to\nexclude legitimate portions of a covered contract from the scope of a\nPACA claim.” 307 F.3d at 1224 (emphases added). Similarly, courts\nhave deemed certain “handling, pallet, and freight charges [as] a\nnecessary part of the produce transaction and therefore . . . included\nwithin the phrase ‘sums owing in connection with’ the sale of fresh\nfruit and produce.” Lincoln Diversified, Inc. v. Mangos Plus, Inc.,\nNo. 98 Civ. 5593 (RWS), 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9192, at *5\n(S.D.N.Y. July 5, 2000) (quoting 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2)); accord\nFishgold v. OnBank & Trust Co., 43 F. Supp. 2d 346, 350 (W.D.N.Y.\n1999) (“[H]andling fee . . . was included on an invoice for the\nshipment of produce, and appears to be related to the produce charges\nnoted on the bill. As such, this charge is recoverable from the PACA\ntrust.”); Prestige Produce, Inc. v. Silver Creek, Inc., No. CV 04-491-\nS-EJL, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 13356, at *7 (D. Idaho Mar. 9, 2006).\n\n        In this case, however, there is no statutory basis for allowing\nExel to recover the cost of its transportation services, either prior to or\n\n\n                                    10\n\fas part of the distribution of PACA funds, because the transaction\nbetween A & B Produce and Exel for the transportation of produce\nwas not made “in connection with” any other transaction between A\n& B Produce and Exel for the sale of produce. In this regard, we\nreject Exel’s proposition that it is entitled to recovery of its\ntransportation expenses because “[t]he amount claimable against the\ntrust by a beneficiary or grower will be the net amount due after\nallowable deductions of contemplated expenses . . . made in\nconnection with the transaction by the commission merchant, dealer,\nor broker.” Appellant’s br. at 25 (emphasis added by appellant)\n(quoting 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(e)(4)). In relying on the above cases to\nsupport its position, Exel overlooks their critical distinction from this\ncase in that the claimants in those cases, unlike Exel, were sellers and\nsuppliers who qualified as trust beneficiaries. See, e.g., Country Best,\n361 F.3d at 631 (“We must decide whether sellers who are\nbeneficiaries of a trust established under [PACA] are entitled to\nattorney fees and costs as provided in their contracts.”) (emphasis\nadded). Thus, in each case a PACA beneficiary sought to recover\nadministrative expenses such as attorneys’ fees or freight charges in\naddition to its underlying claims for unpaid produce. See, e.g., id.\n\n         Exel is not, and does not claim to be, a PACA trust beneficiary\nas a “supplier, seller, or agent,” see 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2), and Exel\ndid not seek to recover administrative expenses in addition to unpaid\ncharges for the produce itself. The transaction between A & B\nProduce and Exel for the transportation of produce was not made “in\nconnection with” a commodities transaction, or, so far as we are\naware, any other transaction, between A & B Produce and Exel, and\nthe contract between Exel and A & B Produce is not otherwise\n“covered” by PACA. See Middle Mountain, 307 F.3d at 1224. In\nfact, the transportation services Exel supplied were not a “necessary\npart of the produce transaction” inasmuch as Exel and A & B Produce\ndid not engage in a transaction for the sale and purchase of produce.\nSee Lincoln Diversified, 2000 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9192, at *5.\n\n        The facts are clear. Exel did not sell or supply produce to A &\nB Produce but instead merely was a third party to the underlying\nproduce transactions between A & B Produce and Pacific. As we\nnoted above, Congress intended to protect sellers and suppliers of\nproduce, not third-party service providers whose services are ancillary\nto the sale of produce. Inasmuch as “[s]trict eligibility requirements\naccompany the extraordinary protection afforded by PACA’s trust\nprovision,” Am. Banana Co. v. Republic Nat’l Bank of N.Y., 362 F.3d\n\n\n                                   11\n\f33, 42 (2d Cir. 2004), we cannot circumvent the provisions and intent\nof PACA by allowing Exel to recover its transportation expenses prior\nto the distribution of the trust funds to the qualified beneficiaries.2\n\n\n                         V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons we will affirm the order of July 21,\n2004, denying Exel’s claim for its transportation services as\nadministrative expenses against the PACA trust.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        According to Pacific, the PACA claims against A & B Produce\nfar exceeded the available PACA trust funds, and “each PACA Trust\nBeneficiary recover[ed] only about 12% of the principal amount of its\nclaim against A & B [Produce].” Appellees’ br. at 3. Although these\nfunds already have been distributed to the PACA beneficiaries, at oral\nargument counsel indicated that approximately $25,000 remains in an\nescrow account. We believe that, perhaps subject to trust expenses, the\nremaining $25,000 will be distributed to the PACA trust beneficiaries to\nsupplement the initial 12% distribution when we issue this opinion and\naccompanying judgment affirming the order denying Exel’s claim.\nTherefore, any payment of fees to Exel would impair the ability of the\nPACA beneficiaries to recover the PACA trust funds and thus frustrate\nthe purpose of PACA. See C.H. Robinson, 239 F.3d at 488.\n\n                                  12\n\f",

INTRODUCTION\n\n        This matter comes on before the court on an appeal by Exel\nTransportation Services, Inc. (“Exel”) from the district court’s order\nentered on July 21, 2004, denying Exel’s claim for payment as\nadministrative expenses from the statutory trust created by the\nPerishable Agricultural Commodities Act (“PACA”), 7 U.S.C. §\n499e(c), for its services in transporting produce for defendant A & B\nProduce, Inc. Exel, a logistics company, arranged and paid for the\ntransportation of produce from sellers and suppliers to A & B\nProduce, Inc., but A & B Produce, Inc. did not pay Exel for its\nservices. At around the same time, various unpaid sellers and\nsuppliers of produce filed complaints against A & B Produce, Inc.\nseeking to recover benefits pursuant to PACA. Even though there\nwere multiple sellers and suppliers of the produce, as a matter of\nconvenience we hereinafter will refer to one of the plaintiffs, Pacific\nInternational Marketing, Inc. (“Pacific”), a seller and provider in the\nsame position in this litigation as all of the plaintiffs, as if it had been\nthe sole seller and provider and as the sole plaintiff. Exel intervened\nseeking to recover its unpaid transportation expenses from the PACA\ntrust funds prior to their distribution to the trust beneficiaries. After\nthe district court denied Exel’s claim, Exel appealed, but we will\naffirm the district court’s order.\n\n\n\n             II. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n        The parties do not dispute the relevant facts. A & B Produce,\nInc., which now is defunct, formerly was engaged in the business of\nbuying produce from various sellers and suppliers for ultimate resale.\nPursuant to its contract with A & B Produce, Inc., Exel arranged and\npaid for the transportation of produce from sellers and suppliers of\nproduce to A & B Produce, Inc. In doing so, Exel paid certain carriers\nto transport seven shipments of produce from various sellers and\nsuppliers to, or for the benefit of, A & B Produce, Inc. Exel submitted\n\n\n                                     3\n\finvoices to A & B Produce, Inc., which acknowledges that it received\nthe shipments, for the freight charges in the sum of $39,200, but A &\nB Produce, Inc. did not pay Exel for its services.\n\n        On June 10, 2003, Pacific, a produce wholesaler, filed a\ncomplaint, later amended, in the district court against A & B Produce,\nInc. and Anthony Badolato, its president (collectively “A & B\nProduce”), alleging that A & B Produce failed to pay for produce that\nit purchased from Pacific. Pacific claimed that it was the beneficiary\nof a statutory trust under PACA, 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c), from which it\nwas entitled to recover payment for the produce.\n\n         On October 1, 2003, Pacific and A & B Produce entered into a\nstipulation and order, pursuant to which A & B Produce agreed to\nliquidate its assets subject to the PACA trust for the benefit of the\npotential PACA trust beneficiaries. On November 14, 2003, Exel\nfiled a complaint in intervention in Pacific’s action seeking to recover\nthe cost of the transportation services that it provided to A & B\nProduce prior to the distribution of PACA trust funds to the PACA\ntrust beneficiaries. Exel, however, did not claim to be a PACA trust\nbeneficiary; rather, Exel sought payment for its transportation services\nas an administrative expense chargeable to the res of the PACA trust\nprior to any distribution of the PACA trust funds to the beneficiaries.\nPacific opposed Exel’s claim.\n\n        The district court denied Exel’s claim for payment for its\ntransportation services as administrative expenses of the PACA trust\non the ground that allowing Exel payment “ahead of the PACA trust\nbeneficiaries . . . would defeat the purpose of the PACA [trust] to\nplace unpaid sellers in a priority position and expand the term\n‘administrative expense’ too far.” App. at 7. Exel then appealed.\n\n\n\n       III. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n        The district court had subject matter jurisdiction over this case\npursuant to 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(5).

DISCUSSION\n\nA. Background\n\n         We begin with an overview of PACA. In 1930, Congress\nenacted PACA to promote fair trading practices in the produce\nindustry. See 7 U.S.C. §§ 499a-499s; Idahoan Fresh, 157 F.3d at 199.\nSpecifically, “Congress intended PACA to protect small farmers and\ngrowers who were vulnerable to the practices of financially\nirresponsible buyers.” Id. at 199 (footnote omitted). “Under PACA,\nit is unlawful for buyers of produce, inter alia, to fail to make prompt\npayment for a shipment of produce.” Id. (citing 7 U.S.C. § 499b(4)).\nA buyer’s failure to tender prompt payment triggers civil liability and\nthe possible suspension or revocation of the buyer’s PACA license\nthat 7 U.S.C. § 499c requires. See 7 U.S.C. § 499h(a). The PACA\nregulations define the time for prompt payment, which applies unless\nthe parties agree otherwise in writing to different payment provisions\nprior to the transaction. See 7 C.F.R. § 46.2(aa).\n\n        Congress later amended PACA to provide the additional\nremedy of a statutory trust provision for “suppliers, sellers, or agents”\nagainst buyers who fail to make prompt payment. 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c);\nsee also P.L. 98-273; H.R. Rep. No. 98-543, at 2 (1983), reprinted in\n1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 405, 406. Congress provided this remedy because\n“[p]rior to this amendment, unpaid produce suppliers were unsecured\ncreditors vulnerable to the buyers’ practice of granting other creditors\na security interest in their inventory and accounts receivable.”\nIdahoan Fresh, 157 F.3d at 199. Under the PACA statutory trust\nprovision, a buyer’s produce, products derived from that produce, and\nthe proceeds gained therefrom are held in a non-segregated, floating\ntrust for the benefit of unpaid suppliers, sellers, and agents who meet\nthe applicable statutory requirements to be granted the status of PACA\ntrust fund beneficiaries. See 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c); 7 C.F.R. §§\n46.46(b), (c). Thus, the PACA statutory trust grants certain unpaid\nsuppliers and sellers of produce and their agents an interest in the\nPACA trust assets superior to that of a buyer’s perfected, secured\n\n                                   5\n\fcreditor. Idahoan Fresh, 157 F.3d at 199. The issue presented on this\nappeal is whether Exel, which does not claim to be a PACA\nbeneficiary, is entitled to payment for its transportation services for\nthe shipments of produce to A & B Produce as administrative\nexpenses chargeable against the PACA trust prior to the distribution\nof PACA trust funds to the PACA trust beneficiaries.\n\nB. Common Law Trust Principles\n\n         Although PACA does not include a provision authorizing the\npayment of trust administrative expenses, several courts have relied\non common law trust principles to allow for the payment of certain\nadministrative expenses, such as attorneys’ fees or fees for services\nrendered in collecting receivables for the benefit of the PACA trust, to\nbe paid from the corpus of the PACA trust prior to its distribution to\nthe statutory beneficiaries. See, e.g., In re Milton Poulos, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571107\"><a href=\"/opinion/571107/bankr-l-rep-p-74304-in-re-milton-poulos-inc-debtor-c-e/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1353 (9th Cir. 1991); In re Southland + Keystone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1855552\"><a href=\"/opinion/1855552/in-re-southland-keystone/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 643 (B.A.P. 9th Cir. 1991); In re United Fruit & Produce\nCo., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1526537\"><a href=\"/opinion/1526537/matter-of-united-fruit-and-produce-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (Bankr. D. Conn. 1990) (“[W]ell-settled trust\nlaw furnishes the basis for compensating a trustee, unless [PACA]\notherwise provides.”). These cases generally require the claimant to\ndemonstrate that its efforts and resultant expenses were “directly\nresponsible for the availability of the funds from the [PACA] trust.”\nSee, e.g, Milton Poulos, 947 F.2d at 1353. For example, in Milton\nPoulos the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit awarded attorneys’\nfees to the attorneys for a produce supplier because, “[t]hrough their\nefforts, the bankruptcy court declared the trust valid and enforceable,\nthereby permitting the funds to be [disbursed] among the trust\n[beneficiaries.]” Id. at 1353. The court further explained that “the\nefforts of these attorneys resulted in a common fund for the group.”\nId.\n\n        Similarly, in United Fruit the bankruptcy court relied on\ncommon law trust principles as well as section 506(c) of the\nBankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 506, in compensating a bankruptcy\ntrustee for its “necessary” services from the PACA trust funds prior to\ntheir distribution. 119 B.R. at 13 & n.5. The court explained that\n“[t]he bankruptcy trustee of the debtor’s estate . . . rendered\nsubstantial services in collecting the PACA receivable for the benefit\nof the PACA beneficiaries and in contesting [a seller’s] claim that it is\nentitled to a priority payment from [the PACA trust.]” Id. at 13. The\ncourt further explained that “[t]he non-PACA creditors should not pay\nfor these services and the trustee should not be forced to donate\n\n\n                                   6\n\fthem.” Id. The court in Southland + Keystone, in harmony with the\ncourt in United Fruit, allowed the trustee “to offset [from PACA trust\nfund monies] its collection costs.” 132 B.R. at 643. The court,\nhowever, limited the amount of the offset “to the ‘hard’ costs of\ncollection such as outside attorney’s fees and expenses that were\nnecessary to the collection effort,” and stated that costs such as\n“overhead expenses are not recoverable.” Id.\n\n        Conversely, some courts have declined to allow the payment\nof attorneys’ fees from the PACA trust funds. For example, in C.H.\nRobinson Co. v. Alanco Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485-88 (2d Cir. 2001),\nthe Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit dealt with a case in which\nthe attorney for the buyer of produce sought payment of attorneys’\nfees incurred in collecting the buyer’s accounts receivable from which\nthe produce seller recovered a portion of its unpaid receivables. The\ncourt did not allow the payment of the attorneys’ fees and in doing so\nrejected the argument that the fees should be allowed on the theory\nthat the buyer’s accounts constituted assets of the PACA trust.

[and] [b]ecause the litigation did not result in the\nestablishment of a common fund” for the benefit of all unpaid PACA\ncreditors).\n\n        Exel argues that it “has a valid claim for recovery of its freight\ncharges as administrative expenses of the PACA trust because . . . A\n& B Produce incurred those freight charges in its role as the trustee of\nthe PACA trust account.” Appellant’s br. at 21. Exel asserts that,\n“[w]ithout [its] services, there would be substantially less trust assets\nfor distribution.” Id. at 20. But even if we accept the factual basis for\nExel’s argument and adhere to the general view that a non-PACA\ncreditor in some circumstances is entitled to payment of necessary and\nactual charges that it incurred for the benefit of the PACA trust\nbeneficiaries, we are satisfied that the transportation costs that Exel\nseeks to recover do not constitute administrative expenses incurred for\nthe benefit of the PACA trust beneficiaries. Therefore, common law\ntrust principles do not afford Exel the right to payment for its\ntransportation services as administrative expenses of the PACA trust.1\n\n\n       1\n      Exel argues, inter alia, that it is entitled to payment under\ncommon law trust principles because the PACA trust “attached to the\n\n                                    7\n\f        In particular, Exel did not provide the transportation services\nto A & B Produce to increase the value of the trust res for the benefit\nof the PACA trust beneficiaries. In other words, even though the\ntransportation of the produce to A & B Produce ultimately generated a\nportion of the proceeds that came to constitute the res of the PACA\ntrust, Exel’s services were not “directly responsible for the availability\nof the funds,” Milton Poulos, 947 F.2d at 1353, and its services\ncertainly do not qualify as the “hard costs of collection.” Southland +\nKeystone, 132 B.R. at 643 (internal quotation marks omitted). Exel\nperformed these services for A & B Produce during the ordinary\ncourse of A & B Produce’s business operations rather than to augment\nthe corpus of the trust.\n\n         Obviously, when Exel arranged for the transportation of the\nproduce to A & B Produce, Pacific and A & B Produce had not yet\nentered into the October 1, 2003 stipulation and order concerning the\nimposition and administration of the trust. Moreover, Exel provided\nfor the transportation of the produce without any court order\nauthorizing or directing it to do so; rather Exel acted in accordance\nwith its contract with A & B Produce. Indeed, we cannot even\nconceive that if Exel had believed before it arranged for and paid for\nthe transportation of the produce to A & B Produce or for its benefit\nthat it would need to seek payment for its services as an\nadministrative expense from a PACA trust, it would have accepted A\n& B Produce’s business.\n\n         As Pacific correctly notes, if we accepted Exel’s\ncharacterization of its transportation services as being “in furtherance\nof its administration of the trust,” Appellant’s br. at 21, “a multitude\nof general unsecured creditors [of the buyer of the produce] could step\nforward and assert ‘administrative expense’ claims for services\nperformed in the course of produce transactions.” Appellees’ br. at\n28. A partial list of these creditors would include “trucking\ncompanies which transport produce, utility companies, which ensure\n\n\nproduce at the time it was tendered to [the carrier] for carriage.”\nAppellant’s br. at 22. However, the existence of the trust is not\ndispositive inasmuch as we still must consider the central issue in\ndeciding whether to apply common law trust principles, i.e., whether the\nefforts and expenses of an alleged PACA trustee, such as A & B Produce\nin employing Exel to transport the produce, were “directly responsible\nfor the availability of the funds from the [PACA] trust.” See Milton\nPoulos, 947 F.2d at 1353.\n\n                                    8\n\fthat produce companies have electrical power to refrigerate the\nproduce, paper companies, which provide the paper on which invoices\nare printed and employees, who sold the [p]roduce and collected the\nproceeds.” Appellee’s br. at 28. Ultimately characterizing Exel’s\nservices as administrative expenses would enable all sorts of the\nbuyer’s unpaid creditors to assert priority administration expense\nclaims ahead of the claims of the sellers and other entities that\nCongress intended to protect as beneficiaries of the PACA trust. The\nclaims of such creditors, including Exel’s, are simply too tangential to\nthe claims that Congress intended PACA to protect to permit their\npayment as PACA administrative expenses.\n\n         We further emphasize that “[t]rusts created under PACA are\nstatutory trusts, [to which] common law trust principles are not\napplicable if they conflict with the language of [PACA], the clear\nintent of Congress in enacting the statute, or the accompanying\nregulations.” C.H. Robinson, 239 F.3d at 487. Indeed, “[t]he\napplicability of any principle of trust law to a PACA trust must be\ntested against the language and purpose of the statute and the\naccompanying regulations.” Id. PACA expressly protects unpaid\nsellers, suppliers, and agents as trust beneficiaries, see 7 U.S.C. §\n499e(c)(2), and “entitles the trust beneficiary to a sum certain.” C.H.\nRobinson, 239 F.3d at 487. “PACA’s purpose, as Congress has\ncrystallized, is to ensure payment to the unpaid seller in the perishable\nagricultural commodities industry.” Tanimura, 222 F.3d at 138.\nAccordingly, “[i]f PACA’s trust is to have any meaning, and\nCongress’s intent is to be effectuated in any way, trust assets must be\npreserved and not dissipated,” id., and “PACA trust beneficiaries are\nentitled to full payment before trustees may lawfully use trust funds to\npay other creditors.” C.H. Robinson, 239 F.3d at 488.\n\n        Accordingly, we will not apply common law trust principles to\nallow Exel to recover charges that it characterizes as administrative\nexpenses when doing so would conflict with the statutory language\nand Congress’ intent to protect unpaid sellers and suppliers above\nnon-PACA beneficiaries such as Exel. See C.H. Robinson, 239 F.3d\nat 486 (“[C]ases in which there was no clash between the language of\nPACA and common law trust principles do not undermine the most\nfundamental principle of statutory interpretation that the language of\nthe statute must govern.”).\n\nC. Statutory Basis\n\n\n\n                                    9\n\f       Exel also argues that “[a]llowance of payment [in this case] is\nconsistent with the statutory and regulatory treatment of direct costs or\nexpenses incurred by the buyer in connection with its purchases of\nproduce impressed with the PACA trust.” Appellant’s reply br. at 6.\nWe recognize that PACA does not limit the recovery of a seller,\nsupplier, or agent to only the cost of the commodity itself. Indeed,\nCongress “chose to allow ‘full payment of the sums owing in\nconnection with [commodities] transactions,’ [which] unambiguously\nencompasses not only the price of commodities but also related\nexpenses.” Country Best v.

Thus, a PACA beneficiary also may recover\nexpenses and fees that are due contractually or otherwise “in\nconnection with” the transaction that is the subject of the PACA trust\nclaim. See Middle Mountain Land & Produce, Inc. v. Sound\nCommodities, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779540\"><a href=\"/opinion/779540/middle-mountain-land-and-produce-inc-pleasant-valley-potato-inc-v-sound/\"><span class=\"volume\">307</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1223 (9th Cir. 2002).\n\n         For example, in Middle Mountain, 307 F.3d at 1223, the Court\nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit allowed a trust beneficiary to collect\nattorneys’ fees and interest because the invoice for the produce\ncreated a contractual right to such fees, and thus the fees were “within\nthe scope of the statute’s protection of ‘full payment owing in\nconnection with the [PACA] transaction.’” (quoting 7 U.S.C. §\n499e(c)(2)). The court explained that “[i]t is unlikely that Congress,\nin enacting a statute to provide better insolvency remedies to\nperishable agricultural commodities sellers, wanted selectively to\nexclude legitimate portions of a covered contract from the scope of a\nPACA claim.” 307 F.3d at 1224 (emphases added). Similarly, courts\nhave deemed certain “handling, pallet, and freight charges [as] a\nnecessary part of the produce transaction and therefore . . . included\nwithin the phrase ‘sums owing in connection with’ the sale of fresh\nfruit and produce.” Lincoln Diversified, Inc. v.

As such, this charge is recoverable from the PACA\ntrust.”); Prestige Produce, Inc. v.

LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">13356</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7 (D. Idaho Mar. 9, 2006).\n\n        In this case, however, there is no statutory basis for allowing\nExel to recover the cost of its transportation services, either prior to or\n\n\n                                    10\n\fas part of the distribution of PACA funds, because the transaction\nbetween A & B Produce and Exel for the transportation of produce\nwas not made “in connection with” any other transaction between A\n& B Produce and Exel for the sale of produce. In this regard, we\nreject Exel’s proposition that it is entitled to recovery of its\ntransportation expenses because “[t]he amount claimable against the\ntrust by a beneficiary or grower will be the net amount due after\nallowable deductions of contemplated expenses . . . made in\nconnection with the transaction by the commission merchant, dealer,\nor broker.” Appellant’s br. at 25 (emphasis added by appellant)\n(quoting 7 C.F.R. § 46.46(e)(4)). In relying on the above cases to\nsupport its position, Exel overlooks their critical distinction from this\ncase in that the claimants in those cases, unlike Exel, were sellers and\nsuppliers who qualified as trust beneficiaries. See, e.g., Country Best,\n361 F.3d at 631 (“We must decide whether sellers who are\nbeneficiaries of a trust established under [PACA] are entitled to\nattorney fees and costs as provided in their contracts.”) (emphasis\nadded). Thus, in each case a PACA beneficiary sought to recover\nadministrative expenses such as attorneys’ fees or freight charges in\naddition to its underlying claims for unpaid produce. See, e.g., id.\n\n         Exel is not, and does not claim to be, a PACA trust beneficiary\nas a “supplier, seller, or agent,” see 7 U.S.C. § 499e(c)(2), and Exel\ndid not seek to recover administrative expenses in addition to unpaid\ncharges for the produce itself. The transaction between A & B\nProduce and Exel for the transportation of produce was not made “in\nconnection with” a commodities transaction, or, so far as we are\naware, any other transaction, between A & B Produce and Exel, and\nthe contract between Exel and A & B Produce is not otherwise\n“covered” by PACA. See Middle Mountain, 307 F.3d at 1224. In\nfact, the transportation services Exel supplied were not a “necessary\npart of the produce transaction” inasmuch as Exel and A & B Produce\ndid not engage in a transaction for the sale and purchase of produce.\nSee Lincoln Diversified, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2000</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. Dist. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">9192</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *5.\n\n        The facts are clear. Exel did not sell or supply produce to A &\nB Produce but instead merely was a third party to the underlying\nproduce transactions between A & B Produce and Pacific. As we\nnoted above, Congress intended to protect sellers and suppliers of\nproduce, not third-party service providers whose services are ancillary\nto the sale of produce. Inasmuch as “[s]trict eligibility requirements\naccompany the extraordinary protection afforded by PACA’s trust\nprovision,” Am. Banana Co. v. Republic Nat’l Bank of N.Y., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n\n                                   <span class=\"page\">11</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\f33, 42 (2d Cir. 2004), we cannot circumvent the provisions and intent\nof PACA by allowing Exel to recover its transportation expenses prior\nto the distribution of the trust funds to the qualified beneficiaries.2\n\n\n                         V. CONCLUSION\n\n       For the foregoing reasons we will affirm the order of July 21,\n2004, denying Exel’s claim for its transportation services as\nadministrative expenses against the PACA trust.\n\n\n\n\n       2\n        According to Pacific, the PACA claims against A & B Produce\nfar exceeded the available PACA trust funds, and “each PACA Trust\nBeneficiary recover[ed] only about 12% of the principal amount of its\nclaim against A & B [Produce].” Appellees’ br. at 3. Although these\nfunds already have been distributed to the PACA beneficiaries, at oral\nargument counsel indicated that approximately $25,000 remains in an\nescrow account. We believe that, perhaps subject to trust expenses, the\nremaining $25,000 will be distributed to the PACA trust beneficiaries to\nsupplement the initial 12% distribution when we issue this opinion and\naccompanying judgment affirming the order denying Exel’s claim.\nTherefore, any payment of fees to Exel would impair the ability of the\nPACA beneficiaries to recover the PACA trust funds and thus frustrate\nthe purpose of PACA.
