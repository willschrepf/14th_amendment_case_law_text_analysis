Weis, Jr., Senior U.S. Circuit Judge for\nthe Third Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\fBIRCH, Circuit Judge:\n          This case presents our circuit's first opportunity to reexamine the drawing of voting districts\nfollowing the Supreme Court's decision in Miller v. Johnson, __ U.S. __, 115 S. Ct. 2475, 132 L. Ed. 2d 76\n(1995).       Because the district court did not have the benefit of Miller when it adopted the challenged\nredistricting plan, we remand the case to allow the district court to reevaluate the plan under Miller.\n\n\n\n                                           I.   BACKGROUND\n          Over a decade ago, this case originated as a class-action brought by black citizens of Alabama\n(\"Dillard\") to challenge the at-large voting systems1 used to elect county commissioners in nine Alabama\n\ncounties.2      In 1987, Dillard amended the complaint by adding the City of Greensboro, Alabama\n(\"Greensboro\"),3 among other cities, counties and county school boards, as a defendant and alleging that th\n\nat-large system used to elect the Greensboro city council violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of\n\n1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1994).        Section 2 provides that no state or political subdivision may\n\nimpose or apply a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or any standard, practice, or procedure\nthat \"results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on accou\n\nof race or color.\"      42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).    Dillard claims that, under the at-large system, \"the political\n\nprocesses . . . are not equally open to participation by [blacks] . . . in that [blacks] have less\nopportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.\"      42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n\n\n\n          1\n          At-large voting systems use multimember voting\ndistricts where constituents vote for more than one candidate,\nand all elected candidates represent the same district rather\nthan their individual districts. This system often makes it\ndifficult for minority groups to elect candidates of their choice\nbecause they do not make up a majority of the population. Such a\nprocedure also is known to result in a dilution of voting power.\nSee Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 616-17, 102 S. Ct. 3272, 3275,\n73 L. Ed. 2d 1012 (1982).\n          2\n          For a synopsis of the procedural history of this\naction, see Dillard v. Baldwin County Board of Education, 686 F.\nSupp. 1459 (M.D. Ala. 1988).\n          3\n          Greensboro is located in Hale County in western\nAlabama. According to the 1990 census, Greensboro has a total\npopulation of 3,047. Blacks comprise 62% of the population and\n56% of the voting age population.\n\n                                                   2\n\f       Pursuant to a 1987 consent decree, Greensboro conceded that its at-large system violated section 2\nof the Voting Rights Act.4    To remedy this violation, Greensboro and Dillard submitted competing\nredistricting plans.     R1-1-1; Supp.R1-492.    The district court referred the case to a United States\n\nmagistrate judge to serve as a special master in the case.       Two evidentiary hearings were conducted by the\nmagistrate judge in 1988, but no redistricting plan was adopted.       In May 1992, the parties agreed that the\nplans that had been submitted to the court in 1988 could no longer be used because of demographic changes\n\nidentified in the 1990 census.     Consequently, new plans were submitted by Dillard and Greensboro.       The cou\nadopted Greensboro's single-member districting plan on an interim basis.5\n       Greensboro conducted municipal elections in 1992 pursuant to this interim plan.\n       The 1992 plan had five districts; in three of them, African-Americans were a majority of\n       the voting age population. District 1 contained a black voting age population of 83%;\n       District 2 contained a black voting age population of 58%; and District 3 contained a black\n       voting age population of 75%. Districts 1 and 3 elected black councilmembers in 1992, and\n       District 2 elected a white candidate over a black candidate.\n\nDillard v. City of Greensboro, 865 F. Supp. 773, 774 (M.D. Ala. 1994).       In December 1992, the Attorney\n\nGeneral concluded that the 1992 plan improperly \"fragmented black population concentrations in order to\nlower the black percentage in District 2,\" and refused to preclear the plan.       R2-66-2 (emphasis added).        T\n\nAttorney General pointed to the fact that       \"a black-supported candidate in District 2 was defeated\" as\nevidence of racial gerrymandering.     Id.\n\n       In August 1993, Greensboro submitted a new plan to the Attorney General for preclearance.        The 1993\nplan created three majority-black districts.       District 1 contained a black voting age population of 83%;\n\nDistrict 2 contained a black voting age population of 63%; and District 3 contained a black voting age\npopulation of 73%.     Once again, the Attorney General refused to preclear the plan under section 5.      The\n\nAttorney General found that, although the black voting age population of District 2 had been increased fro\n\n58% to 63%, the 1993 plan still improperly hindered blacks from electing candidates of their choice.          The\n\nAttorney General made the following observations:\n\n       [T]he opportunity for black voters to elect a representative of their choice in [District\n       2] appears to have been constrained deliberately, taking into account the continued\n       fragmentation of black population concentrations, the pattern of racially polarized voting\n\n\n       4\n          The parties in the amended class action agreed for the\ndistrict court to treat 165 out of the 183 jurisdictions\nchallenged as individual lawsuits, with separate files and civil\naction numbers. Greensboro is one of those 165 jurisdictions.\nDillard v. Baldwin County Bd. of Edu., 686 F. Supp. at 1461.\n       5\n          Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires that the\nUnited States Attorney General preclear any plan proposed by a\nState or political subdivision that is subject to 42 U.S.C. §\n1973b. 42 U.S.C. § 1973c. The Code of Federal Regulations,\nhowever, provides that a federal court may authorize the\nemergency interim use of a redistricting plan without first\ngetting approval of the Attorney General. 28 C.F.R. § 51.18(c)\n(1995).\n\n                                                  3\n\f       and the reduced electoral participation by black persons, which is traceable to a history\n       of discrimination.\n              The city has provided no satisfactory explanation for limiting black electoral\n       opportunities in this manner. Indeed, the city was aware of several alternative plans that\n       created three districts in which black voters constituted a greater majority of the voting\n       age population in a third district than in proposed District 2. While the city was not\n       required under the Voting Rights Act to adopt any specific alternative plan, it is not free\n       to adopt a districting plan which, as would appear here, is calculated to limit black\n       voting strength.\n\nR2-90-Attach. at 2.\n\n       In January 1994, Dillard filed a renewed motion for further relief and requested that the magistrat\njudge recommend adopting Dillard's plan, submitted twice previously, in 1991 and 1993.   On October 11, 199\nthe district court approved the magistrate judge's recommendation, adopted the single-member redistricting\n\nplan proposed by Dillard, and ordered immediate new elections.6   The plan adopted by the district court in\n1994 and currently at issue in this appeal has three majority-black districts containing black voting age\n\npopulations in the respective districts of 85%, 80% and 76%.   Greensboro claims that the district court\nerred in adopting Dillard's plan because it allegedly is a race-conscious effort to guarantee direct\n\nproportionality of representation by manipulating district lines.7\n\n\n                                        II.   ANALYSIS\n\n       The issue before this court is whether the redistricting plan proposed by Dillard and approved by\nthe district court in 1994 constitutes a violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or fails to corre\n\nGreensboro's violation of section 2.   We examine the findings of the district court under the \"clearly\n\nerroneous\" standard.   Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. at 627, 102 S. Ct. at 3281; Dillard v. Crenshaw County, 83\n\n\n       6\n          A plan prepared and adopted by a federal court to\nremedy a section 2 violation is not subject to the preclearance\nrequirements of section 5. McDaniel v. Sanchez, 452 U.S. 130,\n138, 101 S. Ct. 2224, 2230, 68 L. Ed. 2d 724 (1981).\n     Greensboro moved for a stay of the district court's order\npending the outcome of this appeal. That stay was denied by the\ndistrict court. Dillard v. City of Greensboro, 870 F. Supp. 1031\n(M.D. Ala. 1994).\n       7\n          Dillard cites United States v. Hayes, __ U.S. __, 115\nS. Ct. 2431, 132 L. Ed. 2d 635 (1995), in support of his\ncontention that Greensboro has no standing to challenge the\ndistrict court's decision. In Hayes, the Court held that\nplaintiffs, who were not residents of the district that was the\nfocus of their racial gerrymandering claim and could not\ndemonstrate that they had been subjected to racial\nclassification, did not have standing to challenge Louisiana's\ncongressional redistricting plan. Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2437.\nHere, Greensboro is a defendant in the action and properly\nappeals the final decision of the district court pursuant to 28\nU.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                              4\n\fF.2d 246, 248 (11th Cir. 1987).     When evaluating whether Dillard's proposed plan provides an adequate reme\nfor the section 2 violation, the district court must determine that the remedy itself satisfies section 2.\n\nDillard v. Crenshaw County, 831 F. 2d at 249 (citing Edge v. Sumter County Sch. Dist., 775 F. 2d 1509, 151\n(11th Cir. 1985) (stating that a \"district court could not validly adopt a reapportionment plan without\n\ndetermining whether the plan complied with Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. §\n1973\")).\n\n\n\nA.   Application of Miller\n        The Supreme Court's decision in Miller governs our analysis of this case.       At the heart of Miller i\nthe Court's determination that, when those drawing voting district lines use race as the \"predominant\"\nfactor or place more value on race than on other traditional considerations, such as compactness and\n\ncontiguity, the voting districts must satisfy strict scrutiny, \"our most rigorous and exactive standard of\n\nconstitutional review.\"      Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2490.    At issue in Miller was Georgia's congressional\n\nredistricting plan; specifically, \"whether Georgia's new Eleventh District gives rise to a valid equal\nprotection claim . . . and, if so, whether it can be sustained nonetheless as narrowly tailored to serve a\n\ncompelling governmental interest.\"     Id. at __,    115 S. Ct. at 2482.   In 1991, the Georgia General Assembly\nsubmitted a congressional redistricting plan to the Attorney General for preclearance as required by secti\n\n5 of the Voting Rights Act.     Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2483.     The plan called for an increase in the number\nof majority-black districts from one to two.     Id.    The Attorney General refused preclearance, however, and\n\n\"noted a concern that Georgia had created only two majority-minority districts, and that the proposed plan\n\ndid not 'recognize' certain minority populations by placing them in a majority-black district.\"       Id. at __\n115 S. Ct. at 2483-84 (citation omitted).     The General Assembly then submitted a second plan to the Attorn\n\nGeneral for preclearance, but the Justice Department, concluding \"that Georgia had 'failed to explain\n\nadequately' its failure to create a third majority-minority district,\" again refused preclearance.        Id. a\n\n__, 115 S. Ct. at 2484 (citation omitted).     For the third time, the General Assembly attempted to create a\nplan that would be acceptable to the Attorney General.        It created three majority-minority districts using\nas a model the \"max-black\" plan proffered by the American Civil Liberties Union.       Id.   This final plan\n\nformed an Eleventh District that was drawn predominantly based on race.       Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2485.\n\n        The Court began its analysis of the Georgia plan by summarizing its holding in a previous\nredistricting case, Shaw v. Reno, __ U.S. __, 113 S. Ct. 2816, 125 L. Ed. 2d 511 (1993).       In Shaw, the Cou\n\napplied the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the voting rights context and held that\n\"redistricting legislation that is so bizarre on its face that it is 'unexplainable on grounds other than\nrace' . . . demands the same close scrutiny that we give other state laws that classify citizens by race.\"\n\nId. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2825 (quoting Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252,\n\n266, 97 S. Ct. 555, 564, 50 L. Ed. 2d 450 (1977)).      In Miller, the Court clarified Shaw:    \"Just as the Sta\n\nmay not, absent extraordinary justification, segregate citizens on the basis of race in its public parks .\n. so did we recognize in Shaw that it may not separate its citizens into different voting districts on the\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fbasis of race.\"     Miller, __ U.S. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2486 (citations omitted).       In Miller, the Court warn\nfederal courts that reviewing redistricting legislation \"represents a serious intrusion on the most vital\nlocal functions.\"      Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2488.       The Court also noted that it is often difficult for a\ncourt to distinguish \"between being aware of racial considerations and being motivated by them.\"          Id.\n\n\n\nB.   District Court's Analysis of the Plan\n        Dillard attempts to distinguish this case from Miller by arguing in his supplemental brief that,\n\nunlike Miller, the Greensboro plan was adopted by a federal district court, not a legislature.          We do not\nfind any merit in this distinction.     Whether a redistricting plan is adopted by a court or a legislature\n\ndoes not affect a party's right to challenge the plan.          Admittedly, we are faced with an unusual factual\nsituation here.     In most voting rights cases, the redistricting plan that is challenged is one developed b\na legislature.     Here, the plan was developed by Dillard, adopted by the district court, and is now\n\nchallenged by Greensboro.     Despite the unusual posture of the case, however, we find that Greensboro has\n\nequal standing with Dillard to challenge the district court's plan.\n        If the district court determines on remand that racial gerrymandering exists, then the redistrictin\n\nplan will be the subject of strict scrutiny.        Under the strict scrutiny test, the plan must be shown to be\n\nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.          This test will be satisfied if evidence of past\ndiscrimination is shown and there is a sufficient evidentiary basis to establish that the plan is narrowly\n\ntailored to remedy that discrimination.       Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2491.\n\n        The Supreme Court requires that district courts evaluate redistricting plans in terms of\n\"traditional race-neutral districting principles, including but not limited to compactness, contiguity,\n\nrespect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests.\"          Id. at __, 115 S.\n\nCt. at 2488.     Our review of the record, particularly the hearings conducted by the magistrate judge in 198\n1992 and 1993, show an overwhelming emphasis on race with little or no examination of race-neutral\n\ndistricting principles.     Particularly disturbing is the testimony regarding the propensity of black voters\n\nallegedly to vote only for black candidates:\n        Q:     Mr. Gray, you are taking it as a given that in a black majority district, the\n        voters, if you endorse a black candidate because of his race, that the voters should\n        likewise favor the black candidate simply because he is black?\n        A:       That's probably a fair assessment.\n                                          .     .       .   .\n\n        Q: [The COURT]: Under your plan [the plan ultimately adopted by the district court],\n        you're guaranteed three black council persons.\n        A: [Jerome GRAY]:    Yes.\nR6-60; R6- 72.\n\n        Q [Def. Counsel]: Well, do you agree or disagree that your plan you favor is certainly a\n        form of gerrymandering, with the view of achieving very high majorities of black voters?\n        A [Singleton, resident of Greensboro]:          I would disagree with you.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\f         Q: Well, isn't that its purpose, to achieve and to obtain very high majorities of black\n         voters, in excess of 80 percent, in at least three of the council districts?\n         A:   Sure, it is.\n         Q:   And to do that, you've drawn very specific lines to achieve that purpose?\n\n         A:   Yes.\n\nR7-36.\n         Q [The Court]: What is it about this plan that the City has proposed that leads you to\n         believe that in District 2, African-Americans would not have an opportunity to elect a\n         candidate of their choice?\n         A [Singleton]: Well, I think that in District 2, that the City has not really looked at\n         the majority voting age in that community, and based on the lives [sic] in which it was\n         drawn, we feel that there was not enough people, African-Americans, in that district based\n         on their lines, to successfully elect an African-American in that district.\n\nR7-48-49.     This testimony reflects precisely the racially pejorative predisposition that the Supreme Court\nsought to eradicate in Miller:\n         When the State assigns voters on the basis of race, it engages in the offensive and\n         demeaning assumption that voters of a particular race, because of their race, \"think alike,\n         share the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls.\" . .\n         . Race-based assignments \"embody stereotypes that treat individuals as the product of their\n         race, evaluating their thoughts and efforts--their very worth as citizens--according to a\n         criterion barred to the Government by history and the Constitution.\nMiller, __ U.S. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2486 (citations omitted).\n\n         The district judge's order adopting Dillard's plan in its entirety also seems to focus on race.       Th\n\njudge reasons as follows:\n\n         Unlike the city's plans, however, the plaintiffs' plan does everything reasonably possible\n         to maximize black voting strength. If the plaintiffs' plan does not conform to § 2 in\n         providing a complete remedy for minority vote dilution and an equal opportunity for\n         minorities to elect candidates of their choice, it is hard to know what would.\n                                         .   .   .   .\n\n         [T]he court notes that it does not base its decision to adopt the plaintiffs' plan on a\n         finding that the Voting Rights Act can only be complied with if black voters choose black\n         candidates. The purpose of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act is not to assure the election of\n         black candidates.\n\nDillard v. Greensboro, 865 F. Supp. at 778.     The judge also expresses a troubling reluctance to draw his o\n\nplan or tailor Dillard's plan at all:     \"Notwithstanding its preference to avoid drawing a new plan, the\ncourt would have to undertake that task if the plan proposed by the plaintiffs was invalid for some reason\nId. at 777.     The court's determination that Dillard's redistricting plan is not invalid is manifestly\nconclusory.\n\n         The judge emphasized that the Attorney General remarked that a \"black-supported candidate,\" not a\n\n\"black candidate,\" was defeated in District 2.      Under Miller, this distinction is not valid   because it\n                                                            8\nassumes that all blacks will support the same candidate.        Neither the magistrate judge's reports and\n\n\n\n         8\n          We acknowledge that the magistrate judge did express\nsome concern over the issue of compactness and respect for\npolitical subdivisions during the 1993 hearing and contiguity was\ndiscussed to some extent in the 1992 hearing. See,e.g., R6-17-\n\n                                                7\n\frecommendations nor the district court's orders reflect an adequate analysis of the testimony or plans wit\nregard to traditional districting principles.       The redistricting plan must be reevaluated by the district\n\ncourt in light of Miller.9\n\n\nC.   Department of Justice Preclearance\n        The Supreme Court in Miller also criticized the Justice Department's preclearance procedures and\n\nfound it \"inappropriate for a court engaged in constitutional scrutiny to accord deference to the Justice\n\nDepartment's interpretation of the Act.\"     Miller, __ U.S. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2491.    The Court found that\nthe Justice Department had been driven by the objectionable policy of maximizing the number of majority\n\nblack districts rather than \"grounding its objections [to proposed plans] on evidence of a discriminatory\npurpose.\"   Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2492.    \"In utilizing § 5 to require States to create majority-minority\ndistricts wherever possible, the Department of Justice expanded its authority under the statute beyond wha\n\nCongress intended and we have upheld.\"     Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2493.\n\n        When a federal court reviews a redistricting plan, it intrudes \"on the most vital of local\nfunctions\" and must accord legislatures the presumption of good faith \"until a claimant makes a showing\n\nsufficient to support [its] allegation\" that the legislature's decisionmaking is race-based.       Id. at __, 1\n\nS. Ct. at 2488.   The district court made every attempt to defer to the legislature when approving the 1992\nand 1993 plans, but the court found itself thwarted at each turn by the Attorney General's rejection of\n\nthose plans.\n\n        Although we acknowledge that the district court in this case must have been frustrated by the\n\nAttorney General's rejection of two plans that the court believed to be adequate remedies, the district\n\ncourt's heavy reliance on finding a plan that will satisfy the concerns of the Attorney General conflicts\nwith the admonition of Miller:\n\n\n\n\n18,46, R7-76. In his final order, the district judge concluded\nthat \"the plaintiffs' plan does not violate constitutional or\nstatutory standards,\" but he did not make satisfactory\nevidentiary findings on this issue. Dillard, 865 F. Supp. at\n777.\n        9\n          While neither the magistrate judge nor the district\ncourt had the benefit of Miller when evaluating the redistricting\nplans, the Supreme Court's decision in Shaw was available and\nshould have guided the court's reasoning.\n     We note that the Supreme Court granted certiorari and heard\noral argument in two cases that also may prove to be relevant in\nthe district court's reevaluation of the plan. Shaw v. Hunt, 861\nF. Supp. 408 (E.D.N.C. 1994), cert. granted, __ U.S. __, 115 S.\nCt. 2639, 132 L. Ed. 2d 878 (1995); Vera v. Richards, 861 F.\nSupp. 1304 (S.D. Tex. 1994), cert. granted sub. nom. Vera v.\nBush, __ U.S. __, 115 S. Ct. 2639, 132 L. Ed. 2d 877 (1995).\n\n                                                8\n\f       [O]rdinarily the court would take seriously concerns about packing minorities into\n       districts. In this situation, however, the Attorney General objected to a district with a\n       black voting age population of 63% because of, among other factors, \"the reduced electoral\n       participation by black persons, which is traceable to a history of discrimination\";\n       therefore, any plan the court adopts to cure that objection will necessarily contain\n       districts with a great many blacks.\n\n\nDillard, 865 F. Supp. at 778.     From the district court's order, it is difficult to infer anything other th\n\nthat the purpose of adopting Dillard's plan was to satisfy the Attorney General.\n\n\n\n                                        III.   CONCLUSION\n       In this appeal, Greensboro challenges the district court's adoption of Dillard's redistricting plan\nwhich it contends is racially configured to guarantee the election of black-supported candidates.     If the\ndistrict court determines that race was the predominant factor in Dillard's redistricting plan, then Mille\nrequires that the plan be subjected to strict scrutiny.     For a redistricting plan to withstand strict\n\nscrutiny under the Voting Rights Act, the racially gerrymandered districts must be found to be narrowly\n\ntailored to achieve a compelling interest.     Miller, __ U.S. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2491.   We emphasize that\n\nare not expressing any opinion as to whether the Dillard plan ultimately will meet the requirements of the\n\nEqual Protection Clause.   Our decision is limited to the conclusion that because neither the magistrate\njudge nor the district court had the benefit of Miller with its reiteration of the importance of examining\n\nprinciples of compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions in analyzing the redistricti\n\nplan, it is necessary to remand the case.\n       We VACATE the decision of the district court and REMAND this case for a reevaluation of the propose\n\nredistricting plans in light of    Miller.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f",

Because the district court did not have the benefit of Miller when it adopted the challenged\nredistricting plan, we remand the case to allow the district court to reevaluate the plan under Miller.\n\n\n\n                                           I.   BACKGROUND\n          Over a decade ago, this case originated as a class-action brought by black citizens of Alabama\n(\"Dillard\") to challenge the at-large voting systems1 used to elect county commissioners in nine Alabama\n\ncounties.2      In 1987, Dillard amended the complaint by adding the City of Greensboro, Alabama\n(\"Greensboro\"),3 among other cities, counties and county school boards, as a defendant and alleging that th\n\nat-large system used to elect the Greensboro city council violated section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of\n\n1965, as amended, 42 U.S.C. § 1973 (1994).        Section 2 provides that no state or political subdivision may\n\nimpose or apply a voting qualification or prerequisite to voting or any standard, practice, or procedure\nthat \"results in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on accou\n\nof race or color.\"      42 U.S.C. § 1973(a).    Dillard claims that, under the at-large system, \"the political\n\nprocesses . . . are not equally open to participation by [blacks] . . . in that [blacks] have less\nopportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect\n\nrepresentatives of their choice.\"      42 U.S.C. § 1973(b).\n\n\n\n\n          1\n          At-large voting systems use multimember voting\ndistricts where constituents vote for more than one candidate,\nand all elected candidates represent the same district rather\nthan their individual districts. This system often makes it\ndifficult for minority groups to elect candidates of their choice\nbecause they do not make up a majority of the population. Such a\nprocedure also is known to result in a dilution of voting power.\nSee Rogers v.

Baldwin County Board of Education, 686 F.\nSupp. 1459 (M.D. Ala. 1988).\n          3\n          Greensboro is located in Hale County in western\nAlabama. According to the 1990 census, Greensboro has a total\npopulation of 3,047. Blacks comprise 62% of the population and\n56% of the voting age population.\n\n                                                   2\n\f       Pursuant to a 1987 consent decree, Greensboro conceded that its at-large system violated section 2\nof the Voting Rights Act.4    To remedy this violation, Greensboro and Dillard submitted competing\nredistricting plans.     R1-1-1; Supp.R1-492.    The district court referred the case to a United States\n\nmagistrate judge to serve as a special master in the case.       Two evidentiary hearings were conducted by the\nmagistrate judge in 1988, but no redistricting plan was adopted.       In May 1992, the parties agreed that the\nplans that had been submitted to the court in 1988 could no longer be used because of demographic changes\n\nidentified in the 1990 census.     Consequently, new plans were submitted by Dillard and Greensboro.       The cou\nadopted Greensboro's single-member districting plan on an interim basis.5\n       Greensboro conducted municipal elections in 1992 pursuant to this interim plan.\n       The 1992 plan had five districts; in three of them, African-Americans were a majority of\n       the voting age population. District 1 contained a black voting age population of 83%;\n       District 2 contained a black voting age population of 58%; and District 3 contained a black\n       voting age population of 75%. Districts 1 and 3 elected black councilmembers in 1992, and\n       District 2 elected a white candidate over a black candidate.\n\nDillard v. City of Greensboro, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">773</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 774 (M.D. Ala. 1994).       In December 1992, the Attorney\n\nGeneral concluded that the 1992 plan improperly \"fragmented black population concentrations in order to\nlower the black percentage in District 2,\" and refused to preclear the plan.       R2-66-2 (emphasis added).        T\n\nAttorney General pointed to the fact that       \"a black-supported candidate in District 2 was defeated\" as\nevidence of racial gerrymandering.     Id.\n\n       In August 1993, Greensboro submitted a new plan to the Attorney General for preclearance.        The 1993\nplan created three majority-black districts.       District 1 contained a black voting age population of 83%;\n\nDistrict 2 contained a black voting age population of 63%; and District 3 contained a black voting age\npopulation of 73%.     Once again, the Attorney General refused to preclear the plan under section 5.      The\n\nAttorney General found that, although the black voting age population of District 2 had been increased fro\n\n58% to 63%, the 1993 plan still improperly hindered blacks from electing candidates of their choice.          The\n\nAttorney General made the following observations:\n\n       [T]he opportunity for black voters to elect a representative of their choice in [District\n       2] appears to have been constrained deliberately, taking into account the continued\n       fragmentation of black population concentrations, the pattern of racially polarized voting\n\n\n       4\n          The parties in the amended class action agreed for the\ndistrict court to treat 165 out of the 183 jurisdictions\nchallenged as individual lawsuits, with separate files and civil\naction numbers. Greensboro is one of those 165 jurisdictions.\nDillard v. Baldwin County Bd. of Edu., 686 F. Supp. at 1461.\n       5\n          Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act requires that the\nUnited States Attorney General preclear any plan proposed by a\nState or political subdivision that is subject to 42 U.S.C. §\n1973b. 42 U.S.C. § 1973c. The Code of Federal Regulations,\nhowever, provides that a federal court may authorize the\nemergency interim use of a redistricting plan without first\ngetting approval of the Attorney General. 28 C.F.R. § 51.18(c)\n(1995).\n\n                                                  3\n\f       and the reduced electoral participation by black persons, which is traceable to a history\n       of discrimination.\n              The city has provided no satisfactory explanation for limiting black electoral\n       opportunities in this manner. Indeed, the city was aware of several alternative plans that\n       created three districts in which black voters constituted a greater majority of the voting\n       age population in a third district than in proposed District 2. While the city was not\n       required under the Voting Rights Act to adopt any specific alternative plan, it is not free\n       to adopt a districting plan which, as would appear here, is calculated to limit black\n       voting strength.\n\nR2-90-Attach. at 2.\n\n       In January 1994, Dillard filed a renewed motion for further relief and requested that the magistrat\njudge recommend adopting Dillard's plan, submitted twice previously, in 1991 and 1993.   On October 11, 199\nthe district court approved the magistrate judge's recommendation, adopted the single-member redistricting\n\nplan proposed by Dillard, and ordered immediate new elections.6   The plan adopted by the district court in\n1994 and currently at issue in this appeal has three majority-black districts containing black voting age\n\npopulations in the respective districts of 85%, 80% and 76%.   Greensboro claims that the district court\nerred in adopting Dillard's plan because it allegedly is a race-conscious effort to guarantee direct\n\nproportionality of representation by manipulating district lines.7\n\n\n                                        II.   ANALYSIS\n\n       The issue before this court is whether the redistricting plan proposed by Dillard and approved by\nthe district court in 1994 constitutes a violation of section 2 of the Voting Rights Act or fails to corre\n\nGreensboro's violation of section 2.   We examine the findings of the district court under the \"clearly\n\nerroneous\" standard.   Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. at 627, 102 S. Ct. at 3281; Dillard v.

Application of Miller\n        The Supreme Court's decision in Miller governs our analysis of this case.       At the heart of Miller i\nthe Court's determination that, when those drawing voting district lines use race as the \"predominant\"\nfactor or place more value on race than on other traditional considerations, such as compactness and\n\ncontiguity, the voting districts must satisfy strict scrutiny, \"our most rigorous and exactive standard of\n\nconstitutional review.\"      Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2490.    At issue in Miller was Georgia's congressional\n\nredistricting plan; specifically, \"whether Georgia's new Eleventh District gives rise to a valid equal\nprotection claim . . . and, if so, whether it can be sustained nonetheless as narrowly tailored to serve a\n\ncompelling governmental interest.\"     Id. at __,    115 S. Ct. at 2482.   In 1991, the Georgia General Assembly\nsubmitted a congressional redistricting plan to the Attorney General for preclearance as required by secti\n\n5 of the Voting Rights Act.     Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2483.     The plan called for an increase in the number\nof majority-black districts from one to two.     Id.    The Attorney General refused preclearance, however, and\n\n\"noted a concern that Georgia had created only two majority-minority districts, and that the proposed plan\n\ndid not 'recognize' certain minority populations by placing them in a majority-black district.\"       Id. at __\n115 S. Ct. at 2483-84 (citation omitted).     The General Assembly then submitted a second plan to the Attorn\n\nGeneral for preclearance, but the Justice Department, concluding \"that Georgia had 'failed to explain\n\nadequately' its failure to create a third majority-minority district,\" again refused preclearance.        Id. a\n\n__, 115 S. Ct. at 2484 (citation omitted).     For the third time, the General Assembly attempted to create a\nplan that would be acceptable to the Attorney General.        It created three majority-minority districts using\nas a model the \"max-black\" plan proffered by the American Civil Liberties Union.       Id.   This final plan\n\nformed an Eleventh District that was drawn predominantly based on race.       Id. at __, 115 S.

In Shaw, the Cou\n\napplied the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment in the voting rights context and held that\n\"redistricting legislation that is so bizarre on its face that it is 'unexplainable on grounds other than\nrace' . . . demands the same close scrutiny that we give other state laws that classify citizens by race.\"\n\nId. at __, 115 S.

In Miller, the Court clarified Shaw:    \"Just as the Sta\n\nmay not, absent extraordinary justification, segregate citizens on the basis of race in its public parks .\n. so did we recognize in Shaw that it may not separate its citizens into different voting districts on the\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fbasis of race.\"     Miller, __ U.S. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2486 (citations omitted).       In Miller, the Court warn\nfederal courts that reviewing redistricting legislation \"represents a serious intrusion on the most vital\nlocal functions.\"      Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2488.       The Court also noted that it is often difficult for a\ncourt to distinguish \"between being aware of racial considerations and being motivated by them.\"          Id.\n\n\n\nB.   District Court's Analysis of the Plan\n        Dillard attempts to distinguish this case from Miller by arguing in his supplemental brief that,\n\nunlike Miller, the Greensboro plan was adopted by a federal district court, not a legislature.          We do not\nfind any merit in this distinction.     Whether a redistricting plan is adopted by a court or a legislature\n\ndoes not affect a party's right to challenge the plan.          Admittedly, we are faced with an unusual factual\nsituation here.     In most voting rights cases, the redistricting plan that is challenged is one developed b\na legislature.     Here, the plan was developed by Dillard, adopted by the district court, and is now\n\nchallenged by Greensboro.     Despite the unusual posture of the case, however, we find that Greensboro has\n\nequal standing with Dillard to challenge the district court's plan.\n        If the district court determines on remand that racial gerrymandering exists, then the redistrictin\n\nplan will be the subject of strict scrutiny.        Under the strict scrutiny test, the plan must be shown to be\n\nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling state interest.          This test will be satisfied if evidence of past\ndiscrimination is shown and there is a sufficient evidentiary basis to establish that the plan is narrowly\n\ntailored to remedy that discrimination.       Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2491.\n\n        The Supreme Court requires that district courts evaluate redistricting plans in terms of\n\"traditional race-neutral districting principles, including but not limited to compactness, contiguity,\n\nrespect for political subdivisions or communities defined by actual shared interests.\"          Id. at __, 115 S.\n\nCt. at 2488.     Our review of the record, particularly the hearings conducted by the magistrate judge in 198\n1992 and 1993, show an overwhelming emphasis on race with little or no examination of race-neutral\n\ndistricting principles.     Particularly disturbing is the testimony regarding the propensity of black voters\n\nallegedly to vote only for black candidates:\n        Q:     Mr. Gray, you are taking it as a given that in a black majority district, the\n        voters, if you endorse a black candidate because of his race, that the voters should\n        likewise favor the black candidate simply because he is black?\n        A:       That's probably a fair assessment.\n                                          .     .       .   .\n\n        Q: [The COURT]: Under your plan [the plan ultimately adopted by the district court],\n        you're guaranteed three black council persons.\n        A: [Jerome GRAY]:    Yes.\nR6-60; R6- 72.\n\n        Q [Def. Counsel]: Well, do you agree or disagree that your plan you favor is certainly a\n        form of gerrymandering, with the view of achieving very high majorities of black voters?\n        A [Singleton, resident of Greensboro]:          I would disagree with you.\n\n\n\n\n                                                    6\n\f         Q: Well, isn't that its purpose, to achieve and to obtain very high majorities of black\n         voters, in excess of 80 percent, in at least three of the council districts?\n         A:   Sure, it is.\n         Q:   And to do that, you've drawn very specific lines to achieve that purpose?\n\n         A:   Yes.\n\nR7-36.\n         Q [The Court]: What is it about this plan that the City has proposed that leads you to\n         believe that in District 2, African-Americans would not have an opportunity to elect a\n         candidate of their choice?\n         A [Singleton]: Well, I think that in District 2, that the City has not really looked at\n         the majority voting age in that community, and based on the lives [sic] in which it was\n         drawn, we feel that there was not enough people, African-Americans, in that district based\n         on their lines, to successfully elect an African-American in that district.\n\nR7-48-49.     This testimony reflects precisely the racially pejorative predisposition that the Supreme Court\nsought to eradicate in Miller:\n         When the State assigns voters on the basis of race, it engages in the offensive and\n         demeaning assumption that voters of a particular race, because of their race, \"think alike,\n         share the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls.\" . .\n         . Race-based assignments \"embody stereotypes that treat individuals as the product of their\n         race, evaluating their thoughts and efforts--their very worth as citizens--according to a\n         criterion barred to the Government by history and the Constitution.\nMiller, __ U.S. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2486 (citations omitted).\n\n         The district judge's order adopting Dillard's plan in its entirety also seems to focus on race.       Th\n\njudge reasons as follows:\n\n         Unlike the city's plans, however, the plaintiffs' plan does everything reasonably possible\n         to maximize black voting strength. If the plaintiffs' plan does not conform to § 2 in\n         providing a complete remedy for minority vote dilution and an equal opportunity for\n         minorities to elect candidates of their choice, it is hard to know what would.\n                                         .   .   .   .\n\n         [T]he court notes that it does not base its decision to adopt the plaintiffs' plan on a\n         finding that the Voting Rights Act can only be complied with if black voters choose black\n         candidates. The purpose of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act is not to assure the election of\n         black candidates.\n\nDillard v. Greensboro, 865 F. Supp. at 778.     The judge also expresses a troubling reluctance to draw his o\n\nplan or tailor Dillard's plan at all:     \"Notwithstanding its preference to avoid drawing a new plan, the\ncourt would have to undertake that task if the plan proposed by the plaintiffs was invalid for some reason\nId. at 777.     The court's determination that Dillard's redistricting plan is not invalid is manifestly\nconclusory.\n\n         The judge emphasized that the Attorney General remarked that a \"black-supported candidate,\" not a\n\n\"black candidate,\" was defeated in District 2.      Under Miller, this distinction is not valid   because it\n                                                            8\nassumes that all blacks will support the same candidate.        Neither the magistrate judge's reports and\n\n\n\n         8\n          We acknowledge that the magistrate judge did express\nsome concern over the issue of compactness and respect for\npolitical subdivisions during the 1993 hearing and contiguity was\ndiscussed to some extent in the 1992 hearing. See,e.g., R6-17-\n\n                                                7\n\frecommendations nor the district court's orders reflect an adequate analysis of the testimony or plans wit\nregard to traditional districting principles.       The redistricting plan must be reevaluated by the district\n\ncourt in light of Miller.9\n\n\nC.   Department of Justice Preclearance\n        The Supreme Court in Miller also criticized the Justice Department's preclearance procedures and\n\nfound it \"inappropriate for a court engaged in constitutional scrutiny to accord deference to the Justice\n\nDepartment's interpretation of the Act.\"     Miller, __ U.S. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2491.    The Court found that\nthe Justice Department had been driven by the objectionable policy of maximizing the number of majority\n\nblack districts rather than \"grounding its objections [to proposed plans] on evidence of a discriminatory\npurpose.\"   Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2492.    \"In utilizing § 5 to require States to create majority-minority\ndistricts wherever possible, the Department of Justice expanded its authority under the statute beyond wha\n\nCongress intended and we have upheld.\"     Id. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2493.\n\n        When a federal court reviews a redistricting plan, it intrudes \"on the most vital of local\nfunctions\" and must accord legislatures the presumption of good faith \"until a claimant makes a showing\n\nsufficient to support [its] allegation\" that the legislature's decisionmaking is race-based.       Id. at __, 1\n\nS. Ct. at 2488.   The district court made every attempt to defer to the legislature when approving the 1992\nand 1993 plans, but the court found itself thwarted at each turn by the Attorney General's rejection of\n\nthose plans.\n\n        Although we acknowledge that the district court in this case must have been frustrated by the\n\nAttorney General's rejection of two plans that the court believed to be adequate remedies, the district\n\ncourt's heavy reliance on finding a plan that will satisfy the concerns of the Attorney General conflicts\nwith the admonition of Miller:\n\n\n\n\n18,46, R7-76. In his final order, the district judge concluded\nthat \"the plaintiffs' plan does not violate constitutional or\nstatutory standards,\" but he did not make satisfactory\nevidentiary findings on this issue. Dillard, 865 F. Supp. at\n777.\n        9\n          While neither the magistrate judge nor the district\ncourt had the benefit of Miller when evaluating the redistricting\nplans, the Supreme Court's decision in Shaw was available and\nshould have guided the court's reasoning.\n     We note that the Supreme Court granted certiorari and heard\noral argument in two cases that also may prove to be relevant in\nthe district court's reevaluation of the plan.

In this situation, however, the Attorney General objected to a district with a\n       black voting age population of 63% because of, among other factors, \"the reduced electoral\n       participation by black persons, which is traceable to a history of discrimination\";\n       therefore, any plan the court adopts to cure that objection will necessarily contain\n       districts with a great many blacks.\n\n\nDillard, 865 F. Supp. at 778.     From the district court's order, it is difficult to infer anything other th\n\nthat the purpose of adopting Dillard's plan was to satisfy the Attorney General.\n\n\n\n                                        III.   CONCLUSION\n       In this appeal, Greensboro challenges the district court's adoption of Dillard's redistricting plan\nwhich it contends is racially configured to guarantee the election of black-supported candidates.     If the\ndistrict court determines that race was the predominant factor in Dillard's redistricting plan, then Mille\nrequires that the plan be subjected to strict scrutiny.     For a redistricting plan to withstand strict\n\nscrutiny under the Voting Rights Act, the racially gerrymandered districts must be found to be narrowly\n\ntailored to achieve a compelling interest.     Miller, __ U.S. at __, 115 S. Ct. at 2491.   We emphasize that\n\nare not expressing any opinion as to whether the Dillard plan ultimately will meet the requirements of the\n\nEqual Protection Clause.   Our decision is limited to the conclusion that because neither the magistrate\njudge nor the district court had the benefit of Miller with its reiteration of the importance of examining\n\nprinciples of compactness, contiguity, and respect for political subdivisions in analyzing the redistricti\n\nplan, it is necessary to remand the case.\n       We VACATE the decision of the district court and REMAND this case for a reevaluation of the propose\n\nredistricting plans in light of    Miller.\n\n\n\n\n                                                9\n\f</pre>",
