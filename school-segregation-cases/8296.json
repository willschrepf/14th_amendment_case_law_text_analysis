(See part II.A, post.)\nJudge Donner made all of the other rulings challenged on appeal.\n\n\n\n                                                             1\n\f       Charity Ogunsanya, who is Black and from Nigeria, was fired from her job with\n\nAbbott Vascular, Inc. (Abbott). In this employment discrimination action, the trial court\n\ngranted Abbott’s motion for summary judgment. It ruled that Abbott had proven, beyond\n\na triable issue of fact, that it fired Ogunsanya for legitimate, neutral, and\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons — primarily that she had threatened to retaliate against\n\nemployees who complained to Human Resources (HR), and she had threatened to\n\nretaliate against a vendor who had hired away one of her subordinates.\n\n       Ogunsanya appeals. Although she raises numerous points, most of them fall under\n\none of two headings. First, she argues that there was evidence that she never made the\n\nsupposed threats, and hence that Abbott’s claimed reasons for firing her were pretextual.\n\nWe will conclude, however, that Abbott had information from multiple sources that she\n\ndid make the threats, and it had no information to the contrary other than her denial.\n\nSecond, she argues that there was evidence that she was fired as the result of a conspiracy\n\nbetween her bosses and her racially prejudiced underlings. We will conclude that, while\n\nthere was some evidence that some of her underlings were racially prejudiced, there was\n\nno evidence of any such conspiracy.\n\n                                               I\n\n                              PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\n       This is a fact-intensive case. Nevertheless, Abbott has been content to submit a\n\ntotally inadequate statement of facts.\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       Abbott cites its own separate statement as the sole support for all but two\n\nsentences of its statement of facts. This is improper: “Assertions of fact on summary\n\njudgment . . . appeals are not supported by appropriate references to the record when the\n\nbrief cites only to a party’s ‘separate statement’ . . . . ‘As to statements of fact, . . . a\n\n[citation] separate statement is not evidence; it refers to evidence submitted in support of\n\nor opposition to a summary judgment motion. In an appellate brief, an assertion of fact\n\nshould be followed by a citation to the page(s) of the record containing the supporting\n\nevidence.’ [Citations.]” (Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs\n\n(The Rutter Group 2012) ¶ 9:39.5, pp. 9-14; State of California ex rel. Standard Elevator\n\nCo., Inc. v. West Bay Builders, Inc. (2011) 197 Cal.App.4th 963, 968, fn. 1; Jackson v.\n\nCounty of Los Angeles (1997) 60 Cal.App.4th 171, 178, fn. 4.) It is particularly shoddy\n\nto cite one’s own separate statement when the other side has listed the cited “fact” as\n\n“disputed.” In that event, the only way this court can determine whether the dispute is\n\ngenuine or not is to look at the supporting evidence.\n\n       As if this were not enough, Abbott then adds gratuitous material that is not even\n\nsupported by its own separate statement. For example, in its brief, it states: “Based on\n\nthese complaints, [Amy] Martin opened a case with Employee Relations, and Abbott\n\nassigned Rosalie Lewis, a female African-American E[mployee] R[elations] investigator\n\nlocated in Chicago, to investigate the allegations.” (Italics added.) The cited portion of\n\nthe separate statement contains no support for the italicized language. We have found, on\n\nour own, some evidence that Lewis was based in Chicago, but no evidence that she was\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fAfrican-American. And, as Abbott knows perfectly well, these supposed facts are\n\nmaterial; on the very first page of its brief, it specifically argues that Lewis’s race and\n\nwork site are proof that she was unbiased. And this is only one instance of several such\n\ngratuitous insertions.2\n\n       We considered striking Abbott’s brief and ordering Abbott to file a new one. (See\n\nCal. Rules of Court, rule 8.204(e)(2)(B).) However, Ogunsanya had already filed her\n\nreply brief, and it would be unfair to put her to the effort and expense of filing another.\n\nAlternatively, we could disregard all of Abbott’s factual statements. (Metis Development\n\nLLC v. Bohacek (2011) 200 Cal.App.4th 679, 683, fn. 1.) This does not help, however,\n\nas we are still put to the trouble of reviewing the record and coming up with our own\n\nstatement of facts.\n\n       Under the circumstances, the only feasible sanction is to take Abbott’s inadequate\n\nstatement of facts into account in awarding costs on appeal. (See part VII, post.)\n\n\n\n\n       2      At oral argument, counsel for Abbott claimed that Ogunsanya had\nconceded, in her appellant’s brief, that Lewis was African-American. Having combed\nthrough Ogunsanya’s brief, we have managed to verify that she briefly mentions this.\nNevertheless, this fact was never before the trial court. Abbott’s brief — by stating it as a\nfact and by citing it solely to the trial court record — misleadingly suggests otherwise.\n\n       Even more to the point, if Abbott actually did have any support for its challenged\nfactual statements, the time to cite that support was in its brief, not at oral argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                              II\n\n       THE PROPRIETY OF CONSIDERING ABBOTT’S REPLY EVIDENCE\n\n       Ogunsanya contends that the trial court erred by overruling her objection to\n\nevidence that Abbott filed along with its reply papers. Thus, before we can provide a\n\nstatement of facts, we must first determine what evidence we can consider.\n\n       A.     Additional Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n       Abbott’s reply papers included about 150 pages of excerpts from some 14\n\ndepositions. Ogunsanya filed an ex parte application to strike Abbott’s reply evidence as\n\n“unauthorized and . . . a deprivation of plaintiff’s due process rights.” The trial court\n\ndenied the application.\n\n       At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, Ogunsanya’s counsel argued,\n\namong other things, that it would be a denial of due process to consider Abbott’s reply\n\nevidence.\n\n       The trial court ultimately ruled that it had the “power to consider” Abbott’s reply\n\nevidence because Ogunsanya was not prejudiced; she had “had the benefit of a lengthy\n\ncontinuance from the date originally set for hearing, June 14, 2011, to the date on which\n\nthe hearing occurred, June 29, 2011.” However, it also stated that, in ruling on the\n\nmotion, “the court has not relied on any evidence introduced for the first time with\n\nAbbott’s reply.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       B.     Analysis.\n\n       Abbott argues that Ogunsanya’s argument is “moot” because the trial court did not\n\nconsider the reply evidence.3 We agree that the error, if any, is harmless. The trial court\n\nruled in Abbott’s favor without even considering the reply evidence. Moreover, as will\n\nbe seen, we can affirm this ruling without the need to consider any of the reply evidence.\n\nAccordingly, our statement of facts is drawn exclusively from the evidence submitted in\n\nthe moving and opposition papers.\n\n                                            III\n\n                              FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       The “dramatis personae” of this case gets rather complicated. In the hope of\n\nassisting the reader, a diagram is included as attachment A.\n\n       A.     Ogunsanya Is Hired.\n\n       In April 2006, Abbott hired Ogunsanya as the manager of its Microbiology\n\nDepartment. She was responsible for supervising approximately 45 employees in four\n\nlocations. All of her performance reviews were favorable.\n\n       B.     Employees Complain About Ogunsanya’s New Hires.\n\n       Ogunsanya is from Nigeria. She hired two new employees who were also\n\nNigerian (Emmanuel “Emmy” Osiegbu and Koyejo “Koye” Obadina) for supervisory\n\npositions. Other employees complained that she was showing favoritism by hiring fellow\n\n       3      In light of Abbott’s position on this issue, we deem it to have forfeited any\nreliance on any of its reply evidence.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fNigerians “rather than recruit[ing] locally or promot[ing] from within.” Some people\n\nreferred to an “African connection” in the Microbiology Department, meaning “that\n\n[they] all knew each other . . . and we’re all from the same country.” The new employees\n\nwere viewed as “Charity’s favorites.”4 There were complaints that they “didn’t meet the\n\nstandards” for their positions.5 There were also complaints that Osiegbu’s accent made\n\nhim hard to understand.6 The employees who complained included Tim Farmer, Sara\n\nPlumley, Danny Sanchez, Matthew Stetson, Donna Horner, Kerry Hart, and Kristin\n\nStiles.\n\n          Abbott investigated these complaints and determined that they were unfounded.\n\n          Employee Relations (ER) notified Ogunsanya of the complaints, which she\n\nunderstood to be that she was hiring too many African-Americans and that African-\n\n\n          4 Zenabu “Zaina” Bawa, who was either hired or, more likely, promoted by\nOgunsanya, was also said to be one of “Charity’s favorites.”\n          5  At the same time, there were also complaints that Ogunsanya had promoted\ncertain non-African-American employees who were supposedly unqualified.\n          6   Ogunsanya asserts: “The racial tension in [the] department became\nimpossible to ignore.” The only evidence on this point, however, was to the contrary.\nBawa testified:\n\n         “Q: Were you aware of racial tensions within the Microbiology Department? [¶]\n. . . [¶]\n\n          “THE WITNESS: Tension, yes; racial, I don’t know. [¶] . . . [¶]\n\n          “Q: Okay. Who was the tension between?\n\n          “A: Almost everyone.”\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fAmericans in general are not qualified to be leaders. She considered these complaints to\n\nbe racist. She notified an executive who was in charge of investigating discrimination\n\ncomplaints. However, no investigation was ever carried out.\n\n      C.     Employees Complain about Ogunsanya.\n\n      Amy Martin was a senior HR manager. In or about July 2008, she received the\n\nfollowing four complaints about Ogunsanya.\n\n             1.     Anonymous e-mail.\n\n      An anonymous e-mail claimed that people who had complained to HR about\n\nOgunsanya’s management had suffered retaliation.\n\n             2.     Plumley complaint.\n\n      Plumley wanted to transfer to a job outside the Microbiology Department.\n\nOgunsanya delayed the transfer and, in Plumley’s view, “g[ave] her a hard time.”\n\nPlumley complained to Martin.\n\n             3.     Hart complaint.\n\n      Hart wanted to apply for a higher-level position.7 Ogunsanya told her not to apply\n\nbecause “it would be too much paperwork to replace [her].” When Hart applied anyway,\n\nthe position was downgraded so that it was no longer a promotion for her.\n\n      Plumley advised Hart to complain, explaining: “[T]his is a good time to complain\n\nbecause they are listening.” Hart then complained to Martin.8\n\n      7       Ogunsanya asserts that, under Abbott’s policies, Hart was not eligible for\nthe position. The cited portions of the record, however, fail to support this.\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f                4.       Farmer complaint.\n\n        On July 7, 2008, Farmer told Ogunsanya that he had resigned to take a job with\n\nLonza. Lonza was one of Abbott’s vendors; thus, Farmer would be servicing Abbott’s\n\nequipment.\n\n        Ogunsanya’s immediate reaction was to wish him good luck. However, “it just\n\ndidn’t seem right” to her that he would be “using the training and proprietary information\n\ngiven to him at Abbott to service Abbott equipment for an outside vendor.” She\n\ntherefore asked Abbott’s legal department whether Farmer would be breaching his or\n\nLonza’s contract with Abbott if he went to work for Lonza.\n\n        On July 8, 2008 — before receiving a response from the legal department —\n\nOgunsanya phoned Jennifer Harrington, a sales representative with Lonza.\n\n        According to Harrington, Ogunsanya was “aggressive” and “unfriendly.” She\n\n“expressed a lot of displeasure with the fact that a vendor would hire from an existing\n\nclient . . . .” She added that Abbott was “a large account” for Lonza, and she threatened\n\nto “take her business elsewhere.”\n\n        According to Ogunsanya, however, she called Harrington just to make sure that\n\nshe was giving the legal department correct information. To be “discreet,” she did not\n\nmention Farmer by name, and she let Harrington bring up the subject of his new job. She\n\n\n\n[footnote continued from previous page]\n         8        Ogunsanya asserts\n                                 that Martin “prompted” Plumley and/or Hart to\ncomplain to her. The cited portions of the record do not support this.\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fdenied “threaten[ing] to pull Abbott’s business from Lonza or indicat[ing] that I was\n\ndispleased with Farmer’s decision.”\n\n        Harrington promptly went to Farmer with her version of the conversation. On\n\nJuly 9, 2008, Farmer complained to Martin.\n\n        On or before July 11, 2008, the legal department advised Ogunsanya that Farmer\n\nwas not breaching his or Lonza’s contract. On July 15, 2008, Ogunsanya met with\n\nFarmer. Despite the advice that she had received from the legal department, she told him\n\nthat he was causing Lonza to be in breach of contract.\n\n        Lonza was not a unique vendor; there were other companies that could provide the\n\nsame services.9 In June, before Ogunsanya knew Farmer was leaving, she had scheduled\n\na meeting with Cape Cod, one of Lonza’s competitors. She wanted to find out if she\n\ncould save money for Abbott by replacing Lonza. That meeting was set for July 18,\n\n2008.\n\n        D.    Lewis Investigates.\n\n        Meanwhile, based on the complaints from Hart, Plumley, Farmer, and the\n\nanonymous e-mail, Martin opened a “case.”\n\n        On July 11, 2008, Rosalie “Rose” Lewis was assigned to investigate. Lewis was\n\nan Abbott ER manager based in Chicago. During her investigation, she never left\n\n\n\n\n        9     Ogunsanya asserts that Abbott was already “consider[ing]” terminating its\nrelationship with Lonza. The cited portion of the record, however, does not support this.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fChicago; she conducted all of her interviews by phone. She interviewed a total of 21\n\npeople, some more than once.\n\n       Fourteen employees told Lewis that Ogunsanya had told them not to take concerns\n\nor complaints to HR and had threatened them with “repercussions” if they did.10 For\n\nexample, Nicholi “Nick” Gomez said she had told employees to “go through her if we\n\nhad problems, because if we didn’t she would find out.”\n\n       Gomez later testified that Ogunsanya told employees: “[If you have] any\n\nproblems, . . . you should go to her first instead of H.R. . . .” She added: “I’m going to\n\nknow if you contact H.R.” He was “scared.”\n\n       Horner testified that Ogunsanya said that an employee with an issue should talk to\n\nher first; then, if the issue was not resolved, the employee could go to HR. However, she\n\nadded that it “comes right back to her.”\n\n       Ogunsanya testified that she did not tell employees not to go to HR or threaten to\n\nretaliate if they did. She stated: “I merely asked them to come to me first if there was a\n\nchance we could solve the department’s problems together without outside intervention.”\n\n\n\n\n       10     Ogunsanya objected to this evidence as hearsay. The trial court overruled\nher objection. She now contends that this was error.\n\n        Certainly the employees’ statements to Lewis were not admissible for their truth.\n(Evid. Code, § 1200, subds. (a), (b).) However, they were admissible for a nonhearsay\npurpose — “to establish that the investigation took place, that it was appropriate under\nthe circumstances and that the termination decision was reasonable based on that\ninformation.” (Silva v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 256, 265.)\n\n\n\n                                             11\n\f       Employees also told Lewis that Ogunsanya had discouraged them from applying\n\nfor new positions. When one employee resigned, Ogunsanya refused to accept her\n\nresignation. The employee felt threatened; she was afraid Ogunsanya would contact her\n\nnew employer. Ogunsanya threatened several employees with layoffs if they took\n\npositions outside her department. She discouraged employees from applying for open\n\npositions within the department, saying “it was too much paperwork.”\n\n       Harrington confirmed to Lewis that Ogunsanya had threatened to “pull [Lonza’s]\n\ncontract” if it hired Farmer.\n\n       E.     Ogunsanya Is Suspended and Then Fired.\n\n       On July 18, 2008, Gomez gave Ogunsanya a list of three employees who had\n\n“gone to HR.” She then went and spoke to each of them “one-on-one.” She asked them\n\nto tell her who had gone to HR; she added that she already had a list, and she just wanted\n\nconfirmation. When one employee denied speaking to HR, Ogunsanya replied: “[G]ood,\n\nit[’]s better if you[’re] not involved, you[’re] one of my good employees.” When another\n\nemployee refused to give her any names, she said: “[O]k[ay,] that means that you called\n\nHR.”\n\n       These employees immediately reported this to Lewis. Ogunsanya later testified,\n\nhowever, that when the employees admitted going to HR, she simply “reaffirmed to them\n\nthat they had an absolute right” to do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f         Later on July 18, 2008, Ogunsanya attended a meeting with Martin. Also at the\n\nmeeting were Barbara Nollau, who was Ogunsanya’s boss, and Steve Wirkus, who was\n\nNollau’s boss. Lewis participated in the meeting by phone.\n\n         During the meeting, Ogunsanya denied contacting Harrington and threatening to\n\n“pull Lonza’s contract.” Nollau asked if Cape Cod was a competitor of Lonza;\n\nOgunsanya lied and said “No.” She also denied telling employees not to go to HR.\n\nAccording to other attendees, Ogunsanya denied questioning employees about whether\n\nthey had gone to HR. According to Ogunsanya, however, she admitted doing so.\n\n         Ogunsanya was asked to wait outside. The others discussed the matter and\n\ndecided to suspend her. They called her back in and told her that she was suspended. At\n\nthe time, she was seven months pregnant. On July 21, 2008, she went out on maternity\n\nleave.\n\n         Meanwhile, in Ogunsanya’s absence, Osiegbu and Jacqueline “Jacque” Lee\n\nattended the meeting with Cape Cod. The Cape Cod representative told them that\n\nOgunsanya had said she was “very angry” with Lonza. They reported this to Lewis.\n\nOgunsanya later testified, however, that she never said this to Cape Cod.\n\n         On July 22, 2008, Lewis drafted a written recommendation that Ogunsanya be\n\nfired. Consistent with the anonymous e-mail, she found that Ogunsanya had instructed\n\nemployees not to go to HR and had threatened to retaliate against them if they did.11\n\n\n         11  Ogunsanya states: “The employees whose complaints allegedly triggered\nLewis’ investigation were . . . Plumley, . . . Farmer and . . . Hart. . . . None of them\n                                                                [footnote continued on next page]\n\n\n                                            13\n\fConsistent with Hart’s complaint, she found that Ogunsanya had discouraged employees\n\nfrom applying for different positions. Consistent with Farmer’s complaint, she found that\n\nOgunsanya had told Lonza that “she would pull Abbott’s contract if [Farmer] came to\n\nwork for them.”12 Lewis concluded that Ogunsanya had violated multiple Abbott\n\npolicies, including those pertaining to “Employee Relations,” “Workplace Harassment,”\n\n“Problem Solving,” “Fair Dealing,” and “Accountability.”\n\n        Nollau, Wirkus, and Susan Slane, who was Wirkus’s boss, all reviewed Lewis’s\n\nrecommendation; they all agreed that Ogunsanya should be fired. Accordingly, on\n\nDecember 4 or 5, 2008, after Ogunsanya had used up her short-term leave, she was fired.\n\nShe responded: “[T]his [i]s racist and [I] want[] to appeal.”\n\n        On December 12, 2008, Ogunsanya lodged a written appeal in which she alleged:\n\n“I was discriminated against because I am an African . . . .”\n\n\n\n\n[footnote continued from previous page]\ncomplained about being threatened with retaliation if they went to Human Resources\nwith a problem. That particular justification . . . was concocted only after it became clear\nthat the complaints of Plumley, Farmer and Hart would not suffice to justify Ogunsanya’s\ntermination.”\n\n        This ignores the anonymous e-mail, which had complained about threats of\nretaliation against employees who went to HR. Martin specifically testified that she\nopened a case based, in part, on the anonymous e-mail.\n        12   Lewis had interviewed Plumley, but her recommendation did not refer to\nPlumley’s complaint. It is inferable that she considered it unfounded. Nollau believed\nthat Plumley herself was to blame for “act[ing] unprofessionally through th[e] transition\n. . . .”\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f        On January 2, 2009, Ogunsanya met with Gomez in the hope of obtaining\n\ninformation to support her appeal. He proceeded to reveal the following.\n\n        He told her that certain employees had made “jungle animal sounds” whenever an\n\nAfrican-American came into a room, “both to mock African-Americans and as a warning\n\nsignal to others so that they would be careful what they said . . . .” Ogunsanya had heard\n\nFarmer, Plumley, and Stetson make such sounds on three occasions. At the time,\n\nhowever, she did not “read any meaning” into the sounds and “thought little of it.”\n\n        He also told her that the employees who made the sounds “planned to get rid of all\n\nthe African-Americans in the department . . . .”\n\n        He told her that Farmer, Stetson, and Sanchez referred to Osiegbu as “Charity’s\n\nboy.”\n\n        He told her that Farmer had induced employees to complain to HR by handing out\n\nHR’s phone number and then nagging them, asking: “[H]ave you called, have you\n\ncalled, have you called[?]”\n\n        He also told her that Sanchez had induced employees to complain to HR by\n\ndialing HR’s number, then holding the phone up to their ear.\n\n        On January 21, 2009, Ogunsanya’s appeal was denied. She was replaced by a\n\nWhite male.\n\n        Additional facts will be discussed below as they become relevant.\n\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\f                                               IV\n\n                                 EVIDENCE OF PRETEXT\n\n       Ogunsanya contends that there were triable issues of fact with respect to whether\n\nAbbott’s stated reasons for firing her were pretextual.\n\n       A.     The Standard of Review.\n\n       “A trial court properly grants summary judgment where no triable issue of\n\nmaterial fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n\n[Citation.]” (Merrill v. Navegar, Inc. (2001) 26 Cal.4th 465, 476.)\n\n       “[I]n moving for summary judgment, a ‘defendant . . . has met’ his ‘burden . . . if’\n\nhe ‘has shown that one or more elements of the cause of action . . . cannot be established,\n\nor that there is a complete defense to that cause of action.

Atlantic Richfield Co. (2001) 25 Cal.4th 826, 849.)\n\n       “In ruling on the motion, the court must ‘consider all of the evidence’ and ‘all’ of\n\nthe ‘inferences’ reasonably drawn therefrom [citation], and must view such evidence\n\n[citations] and such inferences [citations], in the light most favorable to the opposing\n\nparty.” (Aguilar v. Atlantic Richfield Co., supra, 25 Cal.4th at p. 843.)\n\n       The Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) (Gov. Code, §§ 12900-12996)\n\nprohibits discrimination in employment, including discrimination based on race or\n\nnational origin (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (a)). In an employment discrimination case,\n\n\n\n                                               16\n\fon a motion for summary judgment, the employer “ha[s] the initial burden to either (1)\n\nnegate an essential element of [the employee]’s prima facie case [citation] or (2) establish\n\na legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating [the employee] [citation].” (Wills\n\nv.

City\n\nof Loma Linda (2000) 24 Cal.4th 61, 65-66.)\n\n       B.     Threats to Retaliate Against Employees Who Went to HR.\n\n       One of Abbott’s asserted reasons for firing Ogunsanya was that she had threatened\n\nto retaliate against employees who went to HR with concerns or complaints. Ogunsanya\n\ncontends that there was evidence that this reason was pretextual.\n\n       According to Lewis, a total of 14 employees said that Ogunsanya had told them\n\nnot to go to HR and had threatened to retaliate against them if they did. Gomez testified\n\nthat Ogunsanya said, “[If you have] any problems, . . . you should go to her first instead\n\nof H.R.,” and she added, “I’m going to know if you contact H.R.” Similarly, according\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fto Stiles, Ogunsanya had repeatedly told employees not to go to HR and said “she\n\n‘knows’ who you are.”\n\n       This violated Abbott’s written “Employee Problem Solving” policy, which stated:\n\n“It is Abbott’s philosophy to maintain an open and free exchange of information,\n\nproblems and complaints between managers and employees. . . . [¶] . . . If an employee\n\nwants to talk . . . to a representative of Human Resources, the employee should feel free\n\nto do so, and it is Abbott policy to encourage this. [¶] No supervisor or manager should\n\ndiscourage employees in any way from discussing their problems with a higher level of\n\nmanagement . . . .”\n\n       Ogunsanya argues that “[t]here is nothing wrong with asking employees to speak\n\nwith management before bringing concerns to the attention of HR, unaccompanied by\n\nany threats.” (Italics added.) As already discussed, however, the employees told Lewis\n\nthat Ogunsanya did make threats to retaliate.\n\n       Ogunsanya argues that Gomez testified that she made no threat to retaliate.\n\nGomez admitted that she made no explicit threat to retaliate, but he considered her\n\nstatement, “I’m going to know if you contact H.R.,” to be an implicit threat. “[S]he\n\nwould . . . end it like that and walk out of the room.” He was “scared.”\n\n       Ogunsanya also claims that other witnesses contradicted this evidence. Bawa\n\ntestified that Ogunsanya never told her not to go to HR. Lee denied telling Lewis that\n\nshe feared retaliation from Ogunsanya. Lewis, however, never claimed that either Bawa\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\for Lee told her this. The fact that these two particular witnesses did not say this to Lewis\n\nfails to raise any dispute as to whether 14 other witnesses did.\n\n       Ogunsanya relies on one employee’s notes, taken at a “group meeting,” which said\n\nthat employees should “talk to group leader or her first,” but if they “[c]an’t resolve [it,]\n\nthen go to HR. Not trying to restrict us.” However, there was no evidence that the\n\nperson who said this at the meeting was Ogunsanya. And even it was, there was no\n\nevidence that these words were brought to the attention of Lewis or any of the other\n\ndecision makers. “‘It is the employer’s honest belief in the stated reasons for firing an\n\nemployee and not the objective truth or falsity of the underlying facts that is at issue in a\n\ndiscrimination case. [Citation.]” (Johnson v. United Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children’s\n\nFoundation (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 740, 757.)\n\n       Finally, Ogunsanya argues that there was no evidence that she ever retaliated\n\nagainst an employee who went to HR. However, she did obtain a list of people who had\n\ngone to HR, and did contact them “one-on-one” to ask them if they had done so. The\n\nemployees would have viewed this as retaliation. In any event, evidence that she carried\n\nout her threats was not necessary; merely making the threat violated Abbott’s policies.\n\n       C.     Threat to Pull Lonza’s Contract.\n\n       Another one of Abbott’s asserted reasons for firing Ogunsanya was that she had\n\nthreatened to “pull [Lonza’s] contract.” Ogunsanya contends that there was evidence that\n\nthis reason, too, was pretextual.\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f       Ogunsanya argues that she never actually made such a threat. Certainly this was a\n\ndisputed factual issue. Harrington said she did; Ogunsanya said she did not. However,\n\nthis was not a material factual issue. What matters is that Harrington told Lewis that this\n\nhad happened.\n\n       Ogunsanya therefore argues that Abbott should have believed her, not Harrington.\n\nShe argues that Harrington may have been trying to discredit her to prevent her from\n\nmaking Abbott switch to Cape Cod (for Abbott’s own financial benefit). One problem\n\nwith this theory is that, at the July 18 meeting, when Nollau asked if Cape Cod was a\n\ncompetitor of Lonza, Ogunsanya lied and said it was not. Nowhere in the record does\n\nOgunsanya deny this. Thus, the decision makers had every reason to believe Harrington\n\nand disbelieve Ogunsanya.\n\n       Another problem with this theory is that there is absolutely no evidence that\n\nHarrington knew that Ogunsanya was thinking about switching to Cape Cod. A fortiori,\n\nthere is no evidence that Abbott knew or even should have suspected that Harrington\n\nknew this. “[A] party ‘cannot avoid summary judgment by asserting facts based on mere\n\nspeculation and conjecture, but instead must produce admissible evidence raising a\n\ntriable issue of fact. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Dollinger DeAnza Associates v. Chicago\n\nTitle Ins. Co. (2011) 199 Cal.App.4th 1132, 1144-1145.)\n\n       Ogunsanya argues that Harrington was impeached. She claims that, in a\n\nconversation that Harrington had with an Abbott employee (Lee) about the incident,\n\nHarrington never mentioned a threat to pull Lonza’s contract. Actually, Lee merely\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\ftestified that she did not remember much about the conversation: “I really couldn’t\n\nremember what she discussed . . . or mentioned at the time.” This was hardly\n\nimpeaching. More to the point, again, there is no evidence that the decision makers at\n\nAbbott knew about Lee’s supposedly impeaching conversation. It was therefore\n\nirrelevant to whether Abbott could reasonably rely on Harrington.\n\n       Ogunsanya further claims that Lee testified that, at meetings between Ogunsanya\n\nand Farmer, Farmer did not specifically say that Ogunsanya threatened to pull Lonza’s\n\ncontract. However, Farmer did ask “if his employment [with Lonza] will be jeopardized\n\n. . . .” In any event, again, there is no evidence that the decision makers were aware of\n\nthis supposed impeachment.\n\n       Ogunsanya also argues that her conduct with regard to Lonza was not a genuine\n\nground for termination. She claims that “[s]he was simply doing her ‘due diligence’ as a\n\nmanager” by trying to determine whether Farmer had the right to go to work for an\n\nAbbott vendor. She also claims that, even if she did threaten to pull Lonza’s contract,\n\nAbbott had no reason to object, because “[t]here was nothing unique about Lonza.”\n\nFinally, she claims that it was perfectly appropriate for her to meet with Cape Cod,\n\nbecause “she was merely attempting to save money for Abbott.”\n\n       The reason for her termination, however, was not that she tried to find out whether\n\nFarmer had the right to go to work for an Abbott vendor. Rather, it was that she\n\nthreatened to pull Lonza’s contract. She had already asked the legal department whether\n\nFarmer had the right to go to work for Lonza. If her only concern was to protect Abbott,\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fall she needed to do was to wait for a response. Instead, before hearing back, she\n\nproceeded to contact Lonza and (according to Harrington) make the threat.13\n\nAdmittedly, Ogunsanya testified that she was just trying to make sure that she was giving\n\nthe legal department correct information — that Farmer had in fact taken a job with\n\nLonza, and that the job did, in fact, involve servicing Abbott equipment. Her subjective\n\nmotivation, however, is beside the point. We can only repeat that Harrington claimed\n\nthat Ogunsanya made the threat, and the decision makers at Abbott reasonably could and\n\ndid believe Harrington.\n\n       Similarly, Abbott did not terminate Ogunsanya merely because she set up a\n\nmeeting with Cape Cod. The fact that she did so, however, tended to corroborate\n\nHarrington’s claim that she had threatened to pull Lonza’s contract. And the fact that (at\n\nleast according to the information available to the decision makers) she told Cape Cod\n\nthat she was “very angry” with Lonza further tended to corroborate this.\n\n\n\n\n       13     Ogunsanya protests that Harrington had no authority over Farmer or over\nLonza’s relationship with Abbott. Nevertheless, she was a sales representative —\nsomeone likely to be responsive to threats to drop Lonza.\n\n        Ogunsanya also points out that, to be “discreet,” she let Harrington bring up the\nsubject of Farmer’s hiring; she did not even speak Farmer’s name. This is irrelevant,\nhowever, as she admits that she called Harrington to discuss Farmer. It is additionally\nirrelevant as there is no evidence that the decision makers at Abbott knew any of these\ndetails.\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f       Abbott could and did object because this constituted retaliation, in violation of\n\nAbbott’s written policies.14 Even though Lonza could be replaced, if necessary, Abbott\n\ncould reasonably have a problem with a manager hurting its relationship with Lonza by\n\nattempting to control Lonza’s hiring decisions and making threats against Lonza.\n\n       D.     Influence of Racially Prejudiced Subordinates.\n\n       Ogunsanya contends there was a triable issue of fact with respect to whether the\n\ndecision makers conspired with certain racially prejudiced subordinates of hers.\n\n       Certainly there was evidence that Farmer, Plumley, Sanchez, and Stetson were\n\nracially prejudiced. Ogunsanya occasionally heard them making “jungle animal sounds.”\n\nAfter she was fired, Gomez revealed that they made these sounds whenever an African-\n\nAmerican walked into the room, in part to mock African-Americans. Gomez added that\n\nthey referred to Osiegbu as “Charity’s boy,” a racially demeaning term. Gomez also said\n\nthat they were planning to get rid of all the African-Americans in the Microbiology\n\n\n\n       14    Abbott’s “Employee Relations,” “Workplace Harassment,” and “Problem\nSolving” policies are in the record. These would appear to prohibit retaliation against an\nemployee or a vendor only if it was based on a protected status, such as race, sex, or\nreligion.\n\n       Abbott’s “Fair Dealing” and “Accountability” policies are not in the record.\nHowever, Nollau testified that the “Fair Dealing” policy required “fair dealing with all of\nthose entities that you come in contact with as part of your job,” including “both internal\npeople that work there as well as external people . . . .” Such a policy reasonably could\nbe violated by retaliation based on something other than a protected status. Ogunsanya\neven conceded that retaliation or a threat of retaliation violated Abbott’s code of conduct.\nThus, undisputed evidence leads to the conclusion that Ogunsanya’s conduct violated\nAbbott’s policies.\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fDepartment.15 We may assume, without deciding, that their complaints that it was hard\n\nto understand Osiegbu due to his African accent were also evidence of prejudice. (See\n\nZokari v. Gates (10th Cir. 2009) 561 F.3d 1076, 1090 [“[A]n employer’s comments\n\nregarding a plaintiff’s accent may constitute circumstantial evidence of discrimination\n\nbased on national origin.”]; but see Ang v. Procter & Gamble Co. (6th Cir. 1991) 932\n\nF.2d 540, 549 [“Unlawful discrimination does not occur . . . when a plaintiff’s accent\n\naffects his ability to perform the job effectively.”].)\n\n       In addition, there was evidence that these employees made, or induced others to\n\nmake, the complaints that led to Ogunsanya’s termination. Farmer and Plumley, of\n\ncourse, complained directly and on their own behalf. Plumley also advised Hart to\n\ncomplain. Likewise, according to Gomez, Farmer and Sanchez recruited other\n\nemployees to complain; Sanchez went so far as to dial HR’s number and hold the phone\n\nup to the complaining employee’s ear. And we repeat that, at least according to Gomez,\n\nthese employees had a plan to get rid of all of the African-Americans in the Microbiology\n\nDepartment.\n\n       The decision makers, however, were unaware of any of this. As far as Lewis’s\n\ninvestigation revealed, and as far as the decision makers could tell, the employees’\n\ncomplaints were spontaneous, sincere, and untainted by racial prejudice.\n\n\n\n       15     Abbott objected to Gomez’s statements as hearsay, but the trial court\noverruled the objection. Abbott does not contend that this was error. Accordingly, we\nmay consider this evidence.\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\f       Ogunsanya claims, however, that there is evidence that Bawa told Lewis that there\n\nwas a plan to get rid of all the African-Americans in the department. Actually, Bawa\n\ntestified that Gomez told her that there was a plan to get rid of every African-American in\n\nthe department, and he warned her that she would be “next after Charity.” Bawa reported\n\nthis to someone in ER. The ER person was female; Bawa talked to her on the phone.\n\nOgunsanya argues that it is inferable that the person she reported it to was Lewis.\n\n       This incident, however, evidently occurred after Ogunsanya was fired, as shown\n\nby Gomez’s warning that Bawa would be “next.” Lewis did not list Bawa as one of the\n\npeople she interviewed. Bawa testified that Ogunsanya “left when I was gone. I wasn’t\n\nthere. I came back.” We also note that it is wholly speculative that Lewis was the person\n\nBawa spoke to. (See Dollinger DeAnza Associates v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., supra, 199\n\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1144-1145.) Thus, there is no evidence that the decision makers knew\n\nabout the supposed plan.\n\n       Ogunsanya therefore argues that “[b]ias at any stage of the termination process\n\nmay have tainted the ultimate decision.” Her entire argument on this point, however, is\n\ncontained in a single sentence, followed by citations. For example, she cites Reeves v.\n\nSafeway Stores, Inc. (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th 95; Reeves discussed the “cat’s paw” theory\n\nof liability, which can apply “where discriminatory or retaliatory actions by supervisory\n\npersonnel bring about adverse employment actions through the instrumentality or conduit\n\nof other corporate actors who may be entirely innocent of discriminatory or retaliatory\n\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\fanimus.” (Id. at p. 116; see generally id. at pp. 113-116.)16 Elsewhere in her brief,\n\nhowever, she seems to disavow the cat’s paw theory; she concedes that it is not enough to\n\nprove that the “malcontents” who complained about her were racially biased; rather, she\n\nmust also prove that the decision makers “conspir[ed]” with them.\n\n       Ogunsanya’s single sentence is insufficient to require us to consider the cat’s paw\n\ntheory. “‘When an appellant fails to raise a point, or asserts it but fails to support it with\n\nreasoned argument and citations to authority, we treat the point as waived. [Citations.]’\n\n[Citation.]” (Jenkins v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) 216 Cal.App.4th 497, 535.)\n\nIndeed, the argument has been doubly waived, as Ogunsanya never raised it below.\n\n       E.     Evidence Regarding Lewis’s Investigation.\n\n       Ogunsanya argues that there is evidence that Lewis’s investigation was a sham.\n\n       First, she asserts that Lewis was asked to conduct the investigation on June 11,\n\n2008, which would be before the Plumley, Hart, and Farmer complaints. It is true that, in\n\nher deposition, Lewis said that Martin first contacted her on June 11, 2008. However, it\n\nis clear that she misspoke. Abbott’s internal records show that Martin opened the case on\n\nJuly 11, 2008. Martin testified that she opened the case after receiving the Plumley, Hart,\n\nand Farmer complaints. Lewis testified that she was assigned to investigate complaints\n\nby employees, including Farmer. In the trial court, Ogunsanya conceded that Martin\n\n       16    Here, of course, the racially prejudiced actors were subordinates, not\nsupervisory personnel. It is unclear whether the cat’s paw theory can apply under these\ncircumstances. (See Reeves v. Safeway Stores, Inc., supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at p. 109,\nfn. 9.)\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fasked Lewis to investigate the Plumley, Hart, and Farmer complaints. Lewis’s slip of the\n\ntongue fails to create an issue of fact.\n\n       Next, she claims that Lewis falsified evidence. In support, she states that Lewis’s\n\nnotes of her interview with Lee show that Ogunsanya referred to herself as the “the\n\nmafia,” yet Lee denied telling Lewis this. Lewis’s notes, however, are not in evidence.\n\nRather, during her deposition, Lewis was asked a question which assumed that her notes\n\nof the Lee interview included the “mafia” reference. Lewis then contradicted this,\n\nsaying: “Actually, I heard that from someone else . . . .” The mere fact that Lee denied\n\ntelling Lewis this fails to show that Lewis never heard this from anyone. Moreover, even\n\nassuming that Lee could contradict Lewis’s notes on this point, that one isolated\n\ndiscrepancy would fall short of showing that Lewis’s investigation as a whole was one-\n\nsided or biased.\n\n       Ogunsanya also claims that Lewis selectively chose to interview witnesses who\n\nwere biased against her. There is absolutely no evidence of this. Obviously, Lewis had\n\nto interview the employees who were complaining (i.e., “biased”). However, she also\n\ninterviewed witnesses who Ogunsanya does not even claim were biased against her.17\n\nOgunsanya does not name any person who was not interviewed, but who would have\n\ncontradicted the other interviewees’ allegations.\n\n\n\n\n       17   These would include employees Marie Bagulou, Melissa Escobedo, Siena\nGarlejo, Gomez, Kristyn Grimett, Lee, Jesimel Marcelo, and Osiegbu.\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\f       Ogunsanya argues that she was not given an opportunity to respond to the\n\nallegations against her. However, the July 18 meeting was precisely such an opportunity.\n\nRather than explain her actions or try to justify them, she simply denied that they had\n\noccurred. Nevertheless, when both Farmer and Harrington said that she had threatened to\n\nstop doing business with Lonza, the decision makers were entitled to believe them and\n\ndisbelieve her. Likewise, when 14 employees said that she had threatened to retaliate\n\nagainst them if they went to HR, the decision makers were entitled to believe them and\n\ndisbelieve Ogunsanya.\n\n       The record includes notes handwritten by Nollau that say, among other things,\n\n“Rose Lewis,” “18 July 08,” and “Badge + B[lack]Berry.” Nollau explained: “Those\n\nwere the things I was told to get from [Ogunsanya] before she left on her suspension.”\n\nOgunsanya concludes that “[b]efore the meeting, Lewis had already instructed Nollau to\n\nconfiscate [her] employee badge and [B]lackberry.” Or, in other words, the outcome of\n\nthe meeting was preordained.\n\n       There was no evidence, however, that these notes were written before the July 18\n\nmeeting. In her deposition, Nollau initially testified that she wrote them during the\n\nmeeting; later, she was not sure when she wrote them, or even if she wrote them all at the\n\nsame time. The reference to “Badge + B[lack]Berry” was written under a wavy divider\n\nline; also, it was the very last item in the notes. It seems most likely that she wrote this\n\nafter Ogunsanya was asked to step outside. In any event, absent any evidence that Nollau\n\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\fin fact wrote it before the meeting, it fails to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to\n\npretext.\n\n       Ogunsanya also seizes on various discrepancies among the recollections of the\n\ndecision makers and argues that these are evidence of pretext.\n\n       First, Ogunsanya claims there were discrepancies about who made the termination\n\ndecision. Not so. Wirkus testified: “[Ogunsanya] reported directly to [Nollau], so it was\n\n[Nollau]’s decision, but we were all aligned.” Nollau testified similarly that “[Martin]\n\nhad come with the recommendation and . . . we all talked about it after that and agreed to\n\nsupport the recommendation and go forward.” Martin did not contradict this; she merely\n\ntestified that it was Lewis who made the “initial determination” to prepare a termination\n\nreview worksheet.\n\n       Next, Ogunsanya claims that Nollau had no idea what company policies were\n\nviolated and had never seen those policies until she was given them in preparation for her\n\ndeposition. Actually, Nollau testified that Ogunsanya had violated the “Employee\n\nRelations,” “Problem Solving,” and “Fair Dealing” policies, as well as other policies that\n\nshe did not remember. She further testified that all employees were trained on these\n\npolicies during orientation; they merely were not given a hard copy.\n\n       Ogunsanya claims — correctly — that Wirkus misremembered what Ogunsanya\n\nsupposedly said to Lonza. As he recalled, she tried to keep Lonza from hiring Farmer by\n\nsaying “negative things” about Farmer. However, the mere fact that, two and a half years\n\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\flater, Wirkus could no longer recall this kind of detail falls far short of showing that he\n\nactually had some other agenda.\n\n       Ogunsanya also points out that Slane could not remember the names of any\n\nemployees who had complained. Once again, this is not evidence of pretext.\n\n       Finally, Ogunsanya complains about the way her suspension and termination were\n\nhandled: She was escorted out of the building in full view of others; she was told not to\n\ncontact Abbott employees, and they were told not to contact her; the lock on her office\n\ndoor was changed; an employee who was seen going into her office was questioned; and\n\nAbbott refused to give her a written statement of the reasons for her termination.\n\nUnpleasant and even humiliating as these actions may have been, they are not atypical of\n\nthe way large employers handle terminations these days. Certainly Ogunsanya\n\nintroduced no evidence that Abbott handled her termination any differently than the\n\ntermination of any other employee. Thus, yet again, this evidence fails to raise a triable\n\nissue of fact with regard to pretext.\n\n                                              V\n\n                     EVIDENCE OF FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE\n\n       According to Ogunsanya, Abbott also violated its duty under FEHA “to take all\n\nreasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring”\n\n(Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (k)) by failing to investigate four separate reports of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\f       “An actionable claim under [Government Code] section 12940, subdivision (k) is\n\ndependent on a claim of actual discrimination: ‘Employers should not be held liable to\n\nemployees for failure to take necessary steps to prevent such conduct, except where the\n\nactions took place and were not prevented.’ [Citation.]” (Scotch v. Art Institute of\n\nCalifornia (2009) 173 Cal.App.4th 986, 1021.)\n\n       Two of the cited reports were by Bawa; they were both made after Ogunsanya had\n\nalready been suspended or terminated. As mentioned (see part IV.C, ante), Bawa told\n\nsomeone from ER that there was a plan to get rid of her and all the other African-\n\nAmericans in the department. Bawa also told Nollau that she felt that people did not trust\n\nher and viewed her as one of “Charity’s favorites.”\n\n       There is no evidence that Abbott failed to investigate Bawa’s reports. Even\n\nassuming that it had the burden to prove that it did investigate, Nollau testified that she\n\n“followed up” on Bawa’s report by talking to two group leaders and to Martin; she also\n\nadvised Bawa to talk to Martin. Even more important, Abbott’s alleged failure to\n\ninvestigate Bawa’s reports did not result in any further harassment or discrimination\n\nagainst either Bawa or Ogunsanya (who was already gone). Bawa testified that Abbott\n\nhad “treated [her] well”; “I don’t have any problem with the company.” Finally,\n\nOgunsanya lacks standing to sue for alleged discrimination against Bawa. (Gov. Code,\n\n§ 12965, subd. (b) [“aggrieved person” has private right of action].)\n\n       The other two reports were by Ogunsanya herself. First, in 2007, she told Pat\n\nLavey, “who was responsible for investigating discrimination complaints,” that some\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\femployees felt that she was hiring too many African-Americans and that those hires were\n\nunqualified. Ogunsanya also told Lavey that she “considered th[o]se complaints to be\n\nracist.”18 There was never any investigation of her complaint. The failure to investigate,\n\nhowever, did not result in any harassment or discrimination against Ogunsanya.\n\nUltimately, she was terminated for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons.19\n\n       Next, after she was terminated, she filed an internal appeal in which she alleged:\n\n“I was discriminated against because I am an African . . . .” Her appeal was denied\n\n“based on the findings of [Lewis’s] investigation.” Thus, there was no separate\n\ninvestigation of her allegations of racism. Once again, however, Ogunsanya had been\n\nterminated for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. An investigation might have\n\nrevealed that some of the people who complained about her were racially prejudiced, or\n\neven that they had a plan to get rid of all the African-Americans in the department, but\n\nfor the reasons already discussed (see part IV, ante), it would not have undermined the\n\n       18      In a declaration, Ogunsanya claimed that she also complained to Lavey\nabout people referring to Osiegbu as “Charity’s boy.” In her deposition, however, she\nadmitted that she did not know that people referred to Osiegbu as “Charity’s boy” until\nJanuary 2009, when Gomez told her. In her reply brief, she concedes that she “did not\nlearn [that] Osiegbu was often referred to as ‘Charity’s boy’ until after she was\nterminated . . . .”\n       19      Ogunsanya argues that she raised a triable issue of fact with regard to\nretaliation (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (h)), citing her complaint to Lavey. Her\nretaliation claim, however, much like her discrimination claim, must fail, because Abbott\nproved that it had legitimate, nonretaliatory reasons for the termination decision. It also\nfails because it does not appear that any of the decision makers were aware of her\ncomplaint to Lavey. (Haberman v. Cengage Learning, Inc. (2009) 180 Cal.App.4th 365,\n387.)\n\n\n\n                                            32\n\fultimate decision to fire her. Thus, the failure to investigate did not result in any\n\nharassment or discrimination against her.\n\n                                              VI\n\n  THE STANDARD FOR AN AWARD OF COSTS AGAINST A FEHA PLAINTIFF\n\n       Ogunsanya contends that the trial court erred by awarding costs against her,\n\nbecause her claims were not frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\n\n       A.     Additional Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n       Abbott filed a memorandum of costs, seeking $48,369.78. Ogunsanya responded\n\nwith a motion to tax costs, arguing (among other things) that under FEHA, costs could\n\nnot be awarded against a plaintiff unless the plaintiff’s claims were frivolous,\n\nunreasonable, or groundless.\n\n       The trial court ruled: “I do not believe that there is a requirement that there be a\n\nfinding that the plaintiff’s claim was frivolous.” After taxing certain items, it awarded\n\nAbbott $26,311.21 in costs.\n\n       B.     Analysis.\n\n       Ogunsanya argues, as she did in the trial court, that under FEHA, costs cannot be\n\nawarded against the plaintiff in the absence of a finding that his or her claims were\n\nfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\n\n       That is not the law.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33\n\f       Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b) provides that, in an action under\n\nFEHA, “the court, in its discretion, may award to the prevailing party . . . reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees and costs . . . .”\n\n       42 United States Code section 2000e-5(k) similarly provides that, in an action\n\nunder Title VII, “the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a\n\nreasonable attorney’s fee . . . as part of the costs . . . .”\n\n       In Christiansburg Garment Co. v. E.E.O.C. (1978) 434 U.S. 412 , the United\n\nStates Supreme Court held that, in an action under Title VII, “a plaintiff should not be\n\nassessed his opponent’s attorney’s fees unless a court finds that his claim was frivolous,\n\nunreasonable, or groundless . . . .” (Id. at p. 422.) It explained: “[T]here are at least two\n\nstrong equitable considerations counseling an attorney’s fee award to a prevailing Title\n\nVII plaintiff that are wholly absent in the case of a prevailing Title VII defendant. [¶]\n\nFirst, . . . the plaintiff is the chosen instrument of Congress to vindicate ‘a policy that\n\nCongress considered of the highest priority.’ [Citation.] Second, when a district court\n\nawards counsel fees to a prevailing plaintiff, it is awarding them against a violator of\n\nfederal law. . . . ‘[T]hese policy considerations which support the award of fees to a\n\nprevailing plaintiff are not present in the case of a prevailing defendant.’ [Citation.]” (Id.\n\nat pp. 418-419.) It also relied on legislative history indicating “that while Congress\n\nwanted to clear the way for suits to be brought under the Act, it also wanted to protect\n\ndefendants from burdensome litigation having no legal or factual basis.” (Id. at p. 420.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\f       Cummings v. Benco Building Services (1992) 11 Cal.App.4th 1383 [Second Dist.,\n\nDiv. Seven] held that under FEHA, an award of attorney fees and costs against a plaintiff\n\nrequires a finding that the action was frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless. (Cummings,\n\nsupra, at pp. 1388-1390.) It explained: “The standard a trial court must use in exercising\n\nits discretion in awarding fees and costs to a prevailing defendant was set forth in the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Christiansburg . . . .” (Id. at p. 1387.) It therefore reversed\n\nthe award of fees and costs (id. at pp. 1388, 1391) and remanded with directions to deny\n\nfees and costs. (Id. at p. 1391.)\n\n       Perez v. County of Santa Clara (2003) 111 Cal.App.4th 671 [Sixth Dist.] refused\n\nto follow Cummings with respect to costs. It stated: “[T]he issue in Christiansburg was\n\nlimited to the recovery of attorney fees. Costs outside of those fees were not at issue. In\n\nCummings, the court did not segregate the two parts of the award in applying\n\nChristiansburg, but overturned them together. Indeed, the court even represented the\n\nChristiansburg holding as pertaining to both attorney fees and costs. [Citation.]\n\n       “We find this blending of fees and costs to be unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nSeveral federal courts themselves have refused to apply the Christiansburg test for\n\nrecovery of defense attorney fees to ordinary litigation expenses. [Citations.] ‘The\n\nrationale for this distinction is clear. Whereas the magnitude and unpredictability of\n\nattorney’s fees would deter parties with meritorious claims from litigation, the costs of\n\nsuit in the traditional sense are predictable, and, compared to the costs of attorneys’ fees,\n\nsmall.’ [Citation.] . . .\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\f       “By parity of reasoning, we believe that ordinary litigation costs are recoverable\n\nby a prevailing FEHA defendant even if the lawsuit was not frivolous, groundless, or\n\nunreasonable.” (Perez v. County of Santa Clara, supra, 111 Cal.App.4th at pp. 680-681,\n\nfns. omitted.)\n\n       Every subsequent case regarding the standard for a costs award against a plaintiff\n\nunder FEHA has rejected Cummings and followed Perez. (Hatai v. Department of\n\nTransportation (2013) 214 Cal.App.4th 1287, 1299 [Second Dist., Div. Three]; Knight v.\n\nHayward Unified School Dist. (2005) 132 Cal.App.4th 121, 135-136 [First Dist., Div.\n\nTwo].) In our view, then, it is established law that such an award does not require a\n\nfinding that the plaintiffs’ claims were frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless. There is\n\nno genuine split of authority, because the parties in Cummings apparently never raised\n\nthe issue of the standard for an award of costs. “‘“It is axiomatic that cases are not\n\nauthority for propositions not considered.”’ [Citation.]” (McWilliams v. City of Long\n\nBeach (2013) 56 Cal.4th 613, 626.)\n\n       We conclude that the trial court properly awarded costs against Ogunsanya.\n\n\n\n\n                                             36\n\f                                            VII\n\n                                      DISPOSITION\n\n       The judgment is affirmed.

(Abbott). In this employment discrimination action, the trial court\n\ngranted Abbott’s motion for summary judgment. It ruled that Abbott had proven, beyond\n\na triable issue of fact, that it fired Ogunsanya for legitimate, neutral, and\n\nnondiscriminatory reasons — primarily that she had threatened to retaliate against\n\nemployees who complained to Human Resources (HR), and she had threatened to\n\nretaliate against a vendor who had hired away one of her subordinates.\n\n       Ogunsanya appeals. Although she raises numerous points, most of them fall under\n\none of two headings. First, she argues that there was evidence that she never made the\n\nsupposed threats, and hence that Abbott’s claimed reasons for firing her were pretextual.\n\nWe will conclude, however, that Abbott had information from multiple sources that she\n\ndid make the threats, and it had no information to the contrary other than her denial.\n\nSecond, she argues that there was evidence that she was fired as the result of a conspiracy\n\nbetween her bosses and her racially prejudiced underlings. We will conclude that, while\n\nthere was some evidence that some of her underlings were racially prejudiced, there was\n\nno evidence of any such conspiracy.\n\n                                               I\n\n                              PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n\n       This is a fact-intensive case. Nevertheless, Abbott has been content to submit a\n\ntotally inadequate statement of facts.\n\n\n\n\n                                               2\n\f       Abbott cites its own separate statement as the sole support for all but two\n\nsentences of its statement of facts. This is improper: “Assertions of fact on summary\n\njudgment . . . appeals are not supported by appropriate references to the record when the\n\nbrief cites only to a party’s ‘separate statement’ . . . . ‘As to statements of fact, . . . a\n\n[citation] separate statement is not evidence; it refers to evidence submitted in support of\n\nor opposition to a summary judgment motion. In an appellate brief, an assertion of fact\n\nshould be followed by a citation to the page(s) of the record containing the supporting\n\nevidence.’ [Citations.]” (Eisenberg et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Civil Appeals and Writs\n\n(The Rutter Group 2012) ¶ 9:39.5, pp. 9-14; State of California ex rel. Standard Elevator\n\nCo., Inc. v. West Bay Builders, Inc.

It is particularly shoddy\n\nto cite one’s own separate statement when the other side has listed the cited “fact” as\n\n“disputed.” In that event, the only way this court can determine whether the dispute is\n\ngenuine or not is to look at the supporting evidence.\n\n       As if this were not enough, Abbott then adds gratuitous material that is not even\n\nsupported by its own separate statement. For example, in its brief, it states: “Based on\n\nthese complaints, [Amy] Martin opened a case with Employee Relations, and Abbott\n\nassigned Rosalie Lewis, a female African-American E[mployee] R[elations] investigator\n\nlocated in Chicago, to investigate the allegations.” (Italics added.) The cited portion of\n\nthe separate statement contains no support for the italicized language. We have found, on\n\nour own, some evidence that Lewis was based in Chicago, but no evidence that she was\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fAfrican-American. And, as Abbott knows perfectly well, these supposed facts are\n\nmaterial; on the very first page of its brief, it specifically argues that Lewis’s race and\n\nwork site are proof that she was unbiased. And this is only one instance of several such\n\ngratuitous insertions.2\n\n       We considered striking Abbott’s brief and ordering Abbott to file a new one. (See\n\nCal. Rules of Court, rule 8.204(e)(2)(B).) However, Ogunsanya had already filed her\n\nreply brief, and it would be unfair to put her to the effort and expense of filing another.\n\nAlternatively, we could disregard all of Abbott’s factual statements. (Metis Development\n\nLLC v. Bohacek (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">679</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 683, fn. 1.) This does not help, however,\n\nas we are still put to the trouble of reviewing the record and coming up with our own\n\nstatement of facts.\n\n       Under the circumstances, the only feasible sanction is to take Abbott’s inadequate\n\nstatement of facts into account in awarding costs on appeal. (See part VII, post.)\n\n\n\n\n       2      At oral argument, counsel for Abbott claimed that Ogunsanya had\nconceded, in her appellant’s brief, that Lewis was African-American. Having combed\nthrough Ogunsanya’s brief, we have managed to verify that she briefly mentions this.\nNevertheless, this fact was never before the trial court. Abbott’s brief — by stating it as a\nfact and by citing it solely to the trial court record — misleadingly suggests otherwise.\n\n       Even more to the point, if Abbott actually did have any support for its challenged\nfactual statements, the time to cite that support was in its brief, not at oral argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                               4\n\f                                              II\n\n       THE PROPRIETY OF CONSIDERING ABBOTT’S REPLY EVIDENCE\n\n       Ogunsanya contends that the trial court erred by overruling her objection to\n\nevidence that Abbott filed along with its reply papers. Thus, before we can provide a\n\nstatement of facts, we must first determine what evidence we can consider.\n\n       A.     Additional Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n       Abbott’s reply papers included about 150 pages of excerpts from some 14\n\ndepositions. Ogunsanya filed an ex parte application to strike Abbott’s reply evidence as\n\n“unauthorized and . . . a deprivation of plaintiff’s due process rights.” The trial court\n\ndenied the application.\n\n       At the hearing on the motion for summary judgment, Ogunsanya’s counsel argued,\n\namong other things, that it would be a denial of due process to consider Abbott’s reply\n\nevidence.\n\n       The trial court ultimately ruled that it had the “power to consider” Abbott’s reply\n\nevidence because Ogunsanya was not prejudiced; she had “had the benefit of a lengthy\n\ncontinuance from the date originally set for hearing, June 14, 2011, to the date on which\n\nthe hearing occurred, June 29, 2011.” However, it also stated that, in ruling on the\n\nmotion, “the court has not relied on any evidence introduced for the first time with\n\nAbbott’s reply.”\n\n\n\n\n                                              5\n\f       B.     Analysis.\n\n       Abbott argues that Ogunsanya’s argument is “moot” because the trial court did not\n\nconsider the reply evidence.3 We agree that the error, if any, is harmless. The trial court\n\nruled in Abbott’s favor without even considering the reply evidence. Moreover, as will\n\nbe seen, we can affirm this ruling without the need to consider any of the reply evidence.\n\nAccordingly, our statement of facts is drawn exclusively from the evidence submitted in\n\nthe moving and opposition papers.\n\n                                            III\n\n                              FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n       The “dramatis personae” of this case gets rather complicated. In the hope of\n\nassisting the reader, a diagram is included as attachment A.\n\n       A.     Ogunsanya Is Hired.\n\n       In April 2006, Abbott hired Ogunsanya as the manager of its Microbiology\n\nDepartment. She was responsible for supervising approximately 45 employees in four\n\nlocations. All of her performance reviews were favorable.\n\n       B.     Employees Complain About Ogunsanya’s New Hires.\n\n       Ogunsanya is from Nigeria. She hired two new employees who were also\n\nNigerian (Emmanuel “Emmy” Osiegbu and Koyejo “Koye” Obadina) for supervisory\n\npositions. Other employees complained that she was showing favoritism by hiring fellow\n\n       3      In light of Abbott’s position on this issue, we deem it to have forfeited any\nreliance on any of its reply evidence.\n\n\n\n                                             6\n\fNigerians “rather than recruit[ing] locally or promot[ing] from within.” Some people\n\nreferred to an “African connection” in the Microbiology Department, meaning “that\n\n[they] all knew each other . . . and we’re all from the same country.” The new employees\n\nwere viewed as “Charity’s favorites.”4 There were complaints that they “didn’t meet the\n\nstandards” for their positions.5 There were also complaints that Osiegbu’s accent made\n\nhim hard to understand.6 The employees who complained included Tim Farmer, Sara\n\nPlumley, Danny Sanchez, Matthew Stetson, Donna Horner, Kerry Hart, and Kristin\n\nStiles.\n\n          Abbott investigated these complaints and determined that they were unfounded.\n\n          Employee Relations (ER) notified Ogunsanya of the complaints, which she\n\nunderstood to be that she was hiring too many African-Americans and that African-\n\n\n          4 Zenabu “Zaina” Bawa, who was either hired or, more likely, promoted by\nOgunsanya, was also said to be one of “Charity’s favorites.”\n          5  At the same time, there were also complaints that Ogunsanya had promoted\ncertain non-African-American employees who were supposedly unqualified.\n          6   Ogunsanya asserts: “The racial tension in [the] department became\nimpossible to ignore.” The only evidence on this point, however, was to the contrary.\nBawa testified:\n\n         “Q: Were you aware of racial tensions within the Microbiology Department? [¶]\n. . . [¶]\n\n          “THE WITNESS: Tension, yes; racial, I don’t know. [¶] . . . [¶]\n\n          “Q: Okay. Who was the tension between?\n\n          “A: Almost everyone.”\n\n\n\n                                              7\n\fAmericans in general are not qualified to be leaders. She considered these complaints to\n\nbe racist. She notified an executive who was in charge of investigating discrimination\n\ncomplaints. However, no investigation was ever carried out.\n\n      C.     Employees Complain about Ogunsanya.\n\n      Amy Martin was a senior HR manager. In or about July 2008, she received the\n\nfollowing four complaints about Ogunsanya.\n\n             1.     Anonymous e-mail.\n\n      An anonymous e-mail claimed that people who had complained to HR about\n\nOgunsanya’s management had suffered retaliation.\n\n             2.     Plumley complaint.\n\n      Plumley wanted to transfer to a job outside the Microbiology Department.\n\nOgunsanya delayed the transfer and, in Plumley’s view, “g[ave] her a hard time.”\n\nPlumley complained to Martin.\n\n             3.     Hart complaint.\n\n      Hart wanted to apply for a higher-level position.7 Ogunsanya told her not to apply\n\nbecause “it would be too much paperwork to replace [her].” When Hart applied anyway,\n\nthe position was downgraded so that it was no longer a promotion for her.\n\n      Plumley advised Hart to complain, explaining: “[T]his is a good time to complain\n\nbecause they are listening.” Hart then complained to Martin.8\n\n      7       Ogunsanya asserts that, under Abbott’s policies, Hart was not eligible for\nthe position. The cited portions of the record, however, fail to support this.\n\n\n\n                                            8\n\f                4.       Farmer complaint.\n\n        On July 7, 2008, Farmer told Ogunsanya that he had resigned to take a job with\n\nLonza. Lonza was one of Abbott’s vendors; thus, Farmer would be servicing Abbott’s\n\nequipment.\n\n        Ogunsanya’s immediate reaction was to wish him good luck. However, “it just\n\ndidn’t seem right” to her that he would be “using the training and proprietary information\n\ngiven to him at Abbott to service Abbott equipment for an outside vendor.” She\n\ntherefore asked Abbott’s legal department whether Farmer would be breaching his or\n\nLonza’s contract with Abbott if he went to work for Lonza.\n\n        On July 8, 2008 — before receiving a response from the legal department —\n\nOgunsanya phoned Jennifer Harrington, a sales representative with Lonza.\n\n        According to Harrington, Ogunsanya was “aggressive” and “unfriendly.” She\n\n“expressed a lot of displeasure with the fact that a vendor would hire from an existing\n\nclient . . . .” She added that Abbott was “a large account” for Lonza, and she threatened\n\nto “take her business elsewhere.”\n\n        According to Ogunsanya, however, she called Harrington just to make sure that\n\nshe was giving the legal department correct information. To be “discreet,” she did not\n\nmention Farmer by name, and she let Harrington bring up the subject of his new job. She\n\n\n\n[footnote continued from previous page]\n         8        Ogunsanya asserts\n                                 that Martin “prompted” Plumley and/or Hart to\ncomplain to her. The cited portions of the record do not support this.\n\n\n\n                                             9\n\fdenied “threaten[ing] to pull Abbott’s business from Lonza or indicat[ing] that I was\n\ndispleased with Farmer’s decision.”\n\n        Harrington promptly went to Farmer with her version of the conversation. On\n\nJuly 9, 2008, Farmer complained to Martin.\n\n        On or before July 11, 2008, the legal department advised Ogunsanya that Farmer\n\nwas not breaching his or Lonza’s contract. On July 15, 2008, Ogunsanya met with\n\nFarmer. Despite the advice that she had received from the legal department, she told him\n\nthat he was causing Lonza to be in breach of contract.\n\n        Lonza was not a unique vendor; there were other companies that could provide the\n\nsame services.9 In June, before Ogunsanya knew Farmer was leaving, she had scheduled\n\na meeting with Cape Cod, one of Lonza’s competitors. She wanted to find out if she\n\ncould save money for Abbott by replacing Lonza. That meeting was set for July 18,\n\n2008.\n\n        D.    Lewis Investigates.\n\n        Meanwhile, based on the complaints from Hart, Plumley, Farmer, and the\n\nanonymous e-mail, Martin opened a “case.”\n\n        On July 11, 2008, Rosalie “Rose” Lewis was assigned to investigate. Lewis was\n\nan Abbott ER manager based in Chicago. During her investigation, she never left\n\n\n\n\n        9     Ogunsanya asserts that Abbott was already “consider[ing]” terminating its\nrelationship with Lonza. The cited portion of the record, however, does not support this.\n\n\n\n                                             10\n\fChicago; she conducted all of her interviews by phone. She interviewed a total of 21\n\npeople, some more than once.\n\n       Fourteen employees told Lewis that Ogunsanya had told them not to take concerns\n\nor complaints to HR and had threatened them with “repercussions” if they did.10 For\n\nexample, Nicholi “Nick” Gomez said she had told employees to “go through her if we\n\nhad problems, because if we didn’t she would find out.”\n\n       Gomez later testified that Ogunsanya told employees: “[If you have] any\n\nproblems, . . . you should go to her first instead of H.R. . . .” She added: “I’m going to\n\nknow if you contact H.R.” He was “scared.”\n\n       Horner testified that Ogunsanya said that an employee with an issue should talk to\n\nher first; then, if the issue was not resolved, the employee could go to HR. However, she\n\nadded that it “comes right back to her.”\n\n       Ogunsanya testified that she did not tell employees not to go to HR or threaten to\n\nretaliate if they did. She stated: “I merely asked them to come to me first if there was a\n\nchance we could solve the department’s problems together without outside intervention.”\n\n\n\n\n       10     Ogunsanya objected to this evidence as hearsay. The trial court overruled\nher objection. She now contends that this was error.\n\n        Certainly the employees’ statements to Lewis were not admissible for their truth.\n(Evid. Code, § 1200, subds. (a), (b).) However, they were admissible for a nonhearsay\npurpose — “to establish that the investigation took place, that it was appropriate under\nthe circumstances and that the termination decision was reasonable based on that\ninformation.” (Silva v. Lucky Stores, Inc. (1998) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2249168\"><a href=\"/opinion/2249168/silva-v-lucky-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">65</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

When one employee resigned, Ogunsanya refused to accept her\n\nresignation. The employee felt threatened; she was afraid Ogunsanya would contact her\n\nnew employer. Ogunsanya threatened several employees with layoffs if they took\n\npositions outside her department. She discouraged employees from applying for open\n\npositions within the department, saying “it was too much paperwork.”\n\n       Harrington confirmed to Lewis that Ogunsanya had threatened to “pull [Lonza’s]\n\ncontract” if it hired Farmer.\n\n       E.     Ogunsanya Is Suspended and Then Fired.\n\n       On July 18, 2008, Gomez gave Ogunsanya a list of three employees who had\n\n“gone to HR.” She then went and spoke to each of them “one-on-one.” She asked them\n\nto tell her who had gone to HR; she added that she already had a list, and she just wanted\n\nconfirmation. When one employee denied speaking to HR, Ogunsanya replied: “[G]ood,\n\nit[’]s better if you[’re] not involved, you[’re] one of my good employees.” When another\n\nemployee refused to give her any names, she said: “[O]k[ay,] that means that you called\n\nHR.”\n\n       These employees immediately reported this to Lewis. Ogunsanya later testified,\n\nhowever, that when the employees admitted going to HR, she simply “reaffirmed to them\n\nthat they had an absolute right” to do so.\n\n\n\n\n                                             12\n\f         Later on July 18, 2008, Ogunsanya attended a meeting with Martin. Also at the\n\nmeeting were Barbara Nollau, who was Ogunsanya’s boss, and Steve Wirkus, who was\n\nNollau’s boss. Lewis participated in the meeting by phone.\n\n         During the meeting, Ogunsanya denied contacting Harrington and threatening to\n\n“pull Lonza’s contract.” Nollau asked if Cape Cod was a competitor of Lonza;\n\nOgunsanya lied and said “No.” She also denied telling employees not to go to HR.\n\nAccording to other attendees, Ogunsanya denied questioning employees about whether\n\nthey had gone to HR. According to Ogunsanya, however, she admitted doing so.\n\n         Ogunsanya was asked to wait outside. The others discussed the matter and\n\ndecided to suspend her. They called her back in and told her that she was suspended. At\n\nthe time, she was seven months pregnant. On July 21, 2008, she went out on maternity\n\nleave.\n\n         Meanwhile, in Ogunsanya’s absence, Osiegbu and Jacqueline “Jacque” Lee\n\nattended the meeting with Cape Cod. The Cape Cod representative told them that\n\nOgunsanya had said she was “very angry” with Lonza. They reported this to Lewis.\n\nOgunsanya later testified, however, that she never said this to Cape Cod.\n\n         On July 22, 2008, Lewis drafted a written recommendation that Ogunsanya be\n\nfired. Consistent with the anonymous e-mail, she found that Ogunsanya had instructed\n\nemployees not to go to HR and had threatened to retaliate against them if they did.11\n\n\n         11  Ogunsanya states: “The employees whose complaints allegedly triggered\nLewis’ investigation were . . . Plumley, . . . Farmer and . . . Hart. . . . None of them\n                                                                [footnote continued on next page]\n\n\n                                            13\n\fConsistent with Hart’s complaint, she found that Ogunsanya had discouraged employees\n\nfrom applying for different positions. Consistent with Farmer’s complaint, she found that\n\nOgunsanya had told Lonza that “she would pull Abbott’s contract if [Farmer] came to\n\nwork for them.”12 Lewis concluded that Ogunsanya had violated multiple Abbott\n\npolicies, including those pertaining to “Employee Relations,” “Workplace Harassment,”\n\n“Problem Solving,” “Fair Dealing,” and “Accountability.”\n\n        Nollau, Wirkus, and Susan Slane, who was Wirkus’s boss, all reviewed Lewis’s\n\nrecommendation; they all agreed that Ogunsanya should be fired. Accordingly, on\n\nDecember 4 or 5, 2008, after Ogunsanya had used up her short-term leave, she was fired.\n\nShe responded: “[T]his [i]s racist and [I] want[] to appeal.”\n\n        On December 12, 2008, Ogunsanya lodged a written appeal in which she alleged:\n\n“I was discriminated against because I am an African . . . .”\n\n\n\n\n[footnote continued from previous page]\ncomplained about being threatened with retaliation if they went to Human Resources\nwith a problem. That particular justification . . . was concocted only after it became clear\nthat the complaints of Plumley, Farmer and Hart would not suffice to justify Ogunsanya’s\ntermination.”\n\n        This ignores the anonymous e-mail, which had complained about threats of\nretaliation against employees who went to HR. Martin specifically testified that she\nopened a case based, in part, on the anonymous e-mail.\n        12   Lewis had interviewed Plumley, but her recommendation did not refer to\nPlumley’s complaint. It is inferable that she considered it unfounded. Nollau believed\nthat Plumley herself was to blame for “act[ing] unprofessionally through th[e] transition\n. . . .”\n\n\n\n                                            14\n\f        On January 2, 2009, Ogunsanya met with Gomez in the hope of obtaining\n\ninformation to support her appeal. He proceeded to reveal the following.\n\n        He told her that certain employees had made “jungle animal sounds” whenever an\n\nAfrican-American came into a room, “both to mock African-Americans and as a warning\n\nsignal to others so that they would be careful what they said . . . .” Ogunsanya had heard\n\nFarmer, Plumley, and Stetson make such sounds on three occasions. At the time,\n\nhowever, she did not “read any meaning” into the sounds and “thought little of it.”\n\n        He also told her that the employees who made the sounds “planned to get rid of all\n\nthe African-Americans in the department . . . .”\n\n        He told her that Farmer, Stetson, and Sanchez referred to Osiegbu as “Charity’s\n\nboy.”\n\n        He told her that Farmer had induced employees to complain to HR by handing out\n\nHR’s phone number and then nagging them, asking: “[H]ave you called, have you\n\ncalled, have you called[?]”\n\n        He also told her that Sanchez had induced employees to complain to HR by\n\ndialing HR’s number, then holding the phone up to their ear.\n\n        On January 21, 2009, Ogunsanya’s appeal was denied. She was replaced by a\n\nWhite male.\n\n        Additional facts will be discussed below as they become relevant.\n\n\n\n\n                                            15\n\f                                               IV\n\n                                 EVIDENCE OF PRETEXT\n\n       Ogunsanya contends that there were triable issues of fact with respect to whether\n\nAbbott’s stated reasons for firing her were pretextual.\n\n       A.

Threats to Retaliate Against Employees Who Went to HR.\n\n       One of Abbott’s asserted reasons for firing Ogunsanya was that she had threatened\n\nto retaliate against employees who went to HR with concerns or complaints. Ogunsanya\n\ncontends that there was evidence that this reason was pretextual.\n\n       According to Lewis, a total of 14 employees said that Ogunsanya had told them\n\nnot to go to HR and had threatened to retaliate against them if they did. Gomez testified\n\nthat Ogunsanya said, “[If you have] any problems, . . . you should go to her first instead\n\nof H.R.,” and she added, “I’m going to know if you contact H.R.” Similarly, according\n\n\n\n\n                                             17\n\fto Stiles, Ogunsanya had repeatedly told employees not to go to HR and said “she\n\n‘knows’ who you are.”\n\n       This violated Abbott’s written “Employee Problem Solving” policy, which stated:\n\n“It is Abbott’s philosophy to maintain an open and free exchange of information,\n\nproblems and complaints between managers and employees. . . . [¶] . . . If an employee\n\nwants to talk . . . to a representative of Human Resources, the employee should feel free\n\nto do so, and it is Abbott policy to encourage this. [¶] No supervisor or manager should\n\ndiscourage employees in any way from discussing their problems with a higher level of\n\nmanagement . . . .”\n\n       Ogunsanya argues that “[t]here is nothing wrong with asking employees to speak\n\nwith management before bringing concerns to the attention of HR, unaccompanied by\n\nany threats.” (Italics added.) As already discussed, however, the employees told Lewis\n\nthat Ogunsanya did make threats to retaliate.\n\n       Ogunsanya argues that Gomez testified that she made no threat to retaliate.\n\nGomez admitted that she made no explicit threat to retaliate, but he considered her\n\nstatement, “I’m going to know if you contact H.R.,” to be an implicit threat. “[S]he\n\nwould . . . end it like that and walk out of the room.” He was “scared.”\n\n       Ogunsanya also claims that other witnesses contradicted this evidence. Bawa\n\ntestified that Ogunsanya never told her not to go to HR. Lee denied telling Lewis that\n\nshe feared retaliation from Ogunsanya. Lewis, however, never claimed that either Bawa\n\n\n\n\n                                            18\n\for Lee told her this. The fact that these two particular witnesses did not say this to Lewis\n\nfails to raise any dispute as to whether 14 other witnesses did.\n\n       Ogunsanya relies on one employee’s notes, taken at a “group meeting,” which said\n\nthat employees should “talk to group leader or her first,” but if they “[c]an’t resolve [it,]\n\nthen go to HR. Not trying to restrict us.” However, there was no evidence that the\n\nperson who said this at the meeting was Ogunsanya. And even it was, there was no\n\nevidence that these words were brought to the attention of Lewis or any of the other\n\ndecision makers. “‘It is the employer’s honest belief in the stated reasons for firing an\n\nemployee and not the objective truth or falsity of the underlying facts that is at issue in a\n\ndiscrimination case. [Citation.]” (Johnson v. United Cerebral Palsy/Spastic Children’s\n\nFoundation (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 757.)\n\n       Finally, Ogunsanya argues that there was no evidence that she ever retaliated\n\nagainst an employee who went to HR. However, she did obtain a list of people who had\n\ngone to HR, and did contact them “one-on-one” to ask them if they had done so. The\n\nemployees would have viewed this as retaliation. In any event, evidence that she carried\n\nout her threats was not necessary; merely making the threat violated Abbott’s policies.\n\n       C.     Threat to Pull Lonza’s Contract.\n\n       Another one of Abbott’s asserted reasons for firing Ogunsanya was that she had\n\nthreatened to “pull [Lonza’s] contract.” Ogunsanya contends that there was evidence that\n\nthis reason, too, was pretextual.\n\n\n\n\n                                              19\n\f       Ogunsanya argues that she never actually made such a threat. Certainly this was a\n\ndisputed factual issue. Harrington said she did; Ogunsanya said she did not. However,\n\nthis was not a material factual issue. What matters is that Harrington told Lewis that this\n\nhad happened.\n\n       Ogunsanya therefore argues that Abbott should have believed her, not Harrington.\n\nShe argues that Harrington may have been trying to discredit her to prevent her from\n\nmaking Abbott switch to Cape Cod (for Abbott’s own financial benefit). One problem\n\nwith this theory is that, at the July 18 meeting, when Nollau asked if Cape Cod was a\n\ncompetitor of Lonza, Ogunsanya lied and said it was not. Nowhere in the record does\n\nOgunsanya deny this. Thus, the decision makers had every reason to believe Harrington\n\nand disbelieve Ogunsanya.\n\n       Another problem with this theory is that there is absolutely no evidence that\n\nHarrington knew that Ogunsanya was thinking about switching to Cape Cod. A fortiori,\n\nthere is no evidence that Abbott knew or even should have suspected that Harrington\n\nknew this. “[A] party ‘cannot avoid summary judgment by asserting facts based on mere\n\nspeculation and conjecture, but instead must produce admissible evidence raising a\n\ntriable issue of fact. [Citation.]’ [Citation.]” (Dollinger DeAnza Associates v. Chicago\n\nTitle Ins. Co. (2011) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">199</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1144-1145.)\n\n       Ogunsanya argues that Harrington was impeached. She claims that, in a\n\nconversation that Harrington had with an Abbott employee (Lee) about the incident,\n\nHarrington never mentioned a threat to pull Lonza’s contract. Actually, Lee merely\n\n\n\n                                            20\n\ftestified that she did not remember much about the conversation: “I really couldn’t\n\nremember what she discussed . . . or mentioned at the time.” This was hardly\n\nimpeaching. More to the point, again, there is no evidence that the decision makers at\n\nAbbott knew about Lee’s supposedly impeaching conversation. It was therefore\n\nirrelevant to whether Abbott could reasonably rely on Harrington.\n\n       Ogunsanya further claims that Lee testified that, at meetings between Ogunsanya\n\nand Farmer, Farmer did not specifically say that Ogunsanya threatened to pull Lonza’s\n\ncontract. However, Farmer did ask “if his employment [with Lonza] will be jeopardized\n\n. . . .” In any event, again, there is no evidence that the decision makers were aware of\n\nthis supposed impeachment.\n\n       Ogunsanya also argues that her conduct with regard to Lonza was not a genuine\n\nground for termination. She claims that “[s]he was simply doing her ‘due diligence’ as a\n\nmanager” by trying to determine whether Farmer had the right to go to work for an\n\nAbbott vendor. She also claims that, even if she did threaten to pull Lonza’s contract,\n\nAbbott had no reason to object, because “[t]here was nothing unique about Lonza.”\n\nFinally, she claims that it was perfectly appropriate for her to meet with Cape Cod,\n\nbecause “she was merely attempting to save money for Abbott.”\n\n       The reason for her termination, however, was not that she tried to find out whether\n\nFarmer had the right to go to work for an Abbott vendor. Rather, it was that she\n\nthreatened to pull Lonza’s contract. She had already asked the legal department whether\n\nFarmer had the right to go to work for Lonza. If her only concern was to protect Abbott,\n\n\n\n                                            21\n\fall she needed to do was to wait for a response. Instead, before hearing back, she\n\nproceeded to contact Lonza and (according to Harrington) make the threat.13\n\nAdmittedly, Ogunsanya testified that she was just trying to make sure that she was giving\n\nthe legal department correct information — that Farmer had in fact taken a job with\n\nLonza, and that the job did, in fact, involve servicing Abbott equipment. Her subjective\n\nmotivation, however, is beside the point. We can only repeat that Harrington claimed\n\nthat Ogunsanya made the threat, and the decision makers at Abbott reasonably could and\n\ndid believe Harrington.\n\n       Similarly, Abbott did not terminate Ogunsanya merely because she set up a\n\nmeeting with Cape Cod. The fact that she did so, however, tended to corroborate\n\nHarrington’s claim that she had threatened to pull Lonza’s contract. And the fact that (at\n\nleast according to the information available to the decision makers) she told Cape Cod\n\nthat she was “very angry” with Lonza further tended to corroborate this.\n\n\n\n\n       13     Ogunsanya protests that Harrington had no authority over Farmer or over\nLonza’s relationship with Abbott. Nevertheless, she was a sales representative —\nsomeone likely to be responsive to threats to drop Lonza.\n\n        Ogunsanya also points out that, to be “discreet,” she let Harrington bring up the\nsubject of Farmer’s hiring; she did not even speak Farmer’s name. This is irrelevant,\nhowever, as she admits that she called Harrington to discuss Farmer. It is additionally\nirrelevant as there is no evidence that the decision makers at Abbott knew any of these\ndetails.\n\n\n\n                                            22\n\f       Abbott could and did object because this constituted retaliation, in violation of\n\nAbbott’s written policies.14 Even though Lonza could be replaced, if necessary, Abbott\n\ncould reasonably have a problem with a manager hurting its relationship with Lonza by\n\nattempting to control Lonza’s hiring decisions and making threats against Lonza.\n\n       D.     Influence of Racially Prejudiced Subordinates.\n\n       Ogunsanya contends there was a triable issue of fact with respect to whether the\n\ndecision makers conspired with certain racially prejudiced subordinates of hers.\n\n       Certainly there was evidence that Farmer, Plumley, Sanchez, and Stetson were\n\nracially prejudiced. Ogunsanya occasionally heard them making “jungle animal sounds.”\n\nAfter she was fired, Gomez revealed that they made these sounds whenever an African-\n\nAmerican walked into the room, in part to mock African-Americans. Gomez added that\n\nthey referred to Osiegbu as “Charity’s boy,” a racially demeaning term. Gomez also said\n\nthat they were planning to get rid of all the African-Americans in the Microbiology\n\n\n\n       14    Abbott’s “Employee Relations,” “Workplace Harassment,” and “Problem\nSolving” policies are in the record. These would appear to prohibit retaliation against an\nemployee or a vendor only if it was based on a protected status, such as race, sex, or\nreligion.\n\n       Abbott’s “Fair Dealing” and “Accountability” policies are not in the record.\nHowever, Nollau testified that the “Fair Dealing” policy required “fair dealing with all of\nthose entities that you come in contact with as part of your job,” including “both internal\npeople that work there as well as external people . . . .” Such a policy reasonably could\nbe violated by retaliation based on something other than a protected status. Ogunsanya\neven conceded that retaliation or a threat of retaliation violated Abbott’s code of conduct.\nThus, undisputed evidence leads to the conclusion that Ogunsanya’s conduct violated\nAbbott’s policies.\n\n\n\n                                            23\n\fDepartment.15 We may assume, without deciding, that their complaints that it was hard\n\nto understand Osiegbu due to his African accent were also evidence of prejudice. (See\n\nZokari v.

Farmer and Plumley, of\n\ncourse, complained directly and on their own behalf. Plumley also advised Hart to\n\ncomplain. Likewise, according to Gomez, Farmer and Sanchez recruited other\n\nemployees to complain; Sanchez went so far as to dial HR’s number and hold the phone\n\nup to the complaining employee’s ear. And we repeat that, at least according to Gomez,\n\nthese employees had a plan to get rid of all of the African-Americans in the Microbiology\n\nDepartment.\n\n       The decision makers, however, were unaware of any of this. As far as Lewis’s\n\ninvestigation revealed, and as far as the decision makers could tell, the employees’\n\ncomplaints were spontaneous, sincere, and untainted by racial prejudice.\n\n\n\n       15     Abbott objected to Gomez’s statements as hearsay, but the trial court\noverruled the objection. Abbott does not contend that this was error. Accordingly, we\nmay consider this evidence.\n\n\n\n                                              24\n\f       Ogunsanya claims, however, that there is evidence that Bawa told Lewis that there\n\nwas a plan to get rid of all the African-Americans in the department. Actually, Bawa\n\ntestified that Gomez told her that there was a plan to get rid of every African-American in\n\nthe department, and he warned her that she would be “next after Charity.” Bawa reported\n\nthis to someone in ER. The ER person was female; Bawa talked to her on the phone.\n\nOgunsanya argues that it is inferable that the person she reported it to was Lewis.\n\n       This incident, however, evidently occurred after Ogunsanya was fired, as shown\n\nby Gomez’s warning that Bawa would be “next.” Lewis did not list Bawa as one of the\n\npeople she interviewed. Bawa testified that Ogunsanya “left when I was gone. I wasn’t\n\nthere. I came back.” We also note that it is wholly speculative that Lewis was the person\n\nBawa spoke to. (See Dollinger DeAnza Associates v. Chicago Title Ins. Co., supra, 199\n\nCal.App.4th at pp. 1144-1145.) Thus, there is no evidence that the decision makers knew\n\nabout the supposed plan.\n\n       Ogunsanya therefore argues that “[b]ias at any stage of the termination process\n\nmay have tainted the ultimate decision.” Her entire argument on this point, however, is\n\ncontained in a single sentence, followed by citations. For example, she cites Reeves v.\n\nSafeway Stores, Inc. (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2259739\"><a href=\"/opinion/2259739/reeves-v-safeway-stores-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Reeves discussed the “cat’s paw” theory\n\nof liability, which can apply “where discriminatory or retaliatory actions by supervisory\n\npersonnel bring about adverse employment actions through the instrumentality or conduit\n\nof other corporate actors who may be entirely innocent of discriminatory or retaliatory\n\n\n\n\n                                            25\n\fanimus.” (Id. at p. 116; see generally id. at pp. 113-116.)16 Elsewhere in her brief,\n\nhowever, she seems to disavow the cat’s paw theory; she concedes that it is not enough to\n\nprove that the “malcontents” who complained about her were racially biased; rather, she\n\nmust also prove that the decision makers “conspir[ed]” with them.\n\n       Ogunsanya’s single sentence is insufficient to require us to consider the cat’s paw\n\ntheory. “‘When an appellant fails to raise a point, or asserts it but fails to support it with\n\nreasoned argument and citations to authority, we treat the point as waived. [Citations.]’\n\n[Citation.]” (Jenkins v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (2013) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">216</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">497</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 535.)\n\nIndeed, the argument has been doubly waived, as Ogunsanya never raised it below.\n\n       E.     Evidence Regarding Lewis’s Investigation.\n\n       Ogunsanya argues that there is evidence that Lewis’s investigation was a sham.\n\n       First, she asserts that Lewis was asked to conduct the investigation on June 11,\n\n2008, which would be before the Plumley, Hart, and Farmer complaints. It is true that, in\n\nher deposition, Lewis said that Martin first contacted her on June 11, 2008. However, it\n\nis clear that she misspoke. Abbott’s internal records show that Martin opened the case on\n\nJuly 11, 2008. Martin testified that she opened the case after receiving the Plumley, Hart,\n\nand Farmer complaints. Lewis testified that she was assigned to investigate complaints\n\nby employees, including Farmer. In the trial court, Ogunsanya conceded that Martin\n\n       16    Here, of course, the racially prejudiced actors were subordinates, not\nsupervisory personnel. It is unclear whether the cat’s paw theory can apply under these\ncircumstances. (See Reeves v. Safeway Stores, Inc., supra, 121 Cal.App.4th at p. 109,\nfn. 9.)\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\fasked Lewis to investigate the Plumley, Hart, and Farmer complaints. Lewis’s slip of the\n\ntongue fails to create an issue of fact.\n\n       Next, she claims that Lewis falsified evidence. In support, she states that Lewis’s\n\nnotes of her interview with Lee show that Ogunsanya referred to herself as the “the\n\nmafia,” yet Lee denied telling Lewis this. Lewis’s notes, however, are not in evidence.\n\nRather, during her deposition, Lewis was asked a question which assumed that her notes\n\nof the Lee interview included the “mafia” reference. Lewis then contradicted this,\n\nsaying: “Actually, I heard that from someone else . . . .” The mere fact that Lee denied\n\ntelling Lewis this fails to show that Lewis never heard this from anyone. Moreover, even\n\nassuming that Lee could contradict Lewis’s notes on this point, that one isolated\n\ndiscrepancy would fall short of showing that Lewis’s investigation as a whole was one-\n\nsided or biased.\n\n       Ogunsanya also claims that Lewis selectively chose to interview witnesses who\n\nwere biased against her. There is absolutely no evidence of this. Obviously, Lewis had\n\nto interview the employees who were complaining (i.e., “biased”). However, she also\n\ninterviewed witnesses who Ogunsanya does not even claim were biased against her.17\n\nOgunsanya does not name any person who was not interviewed, but who would have\n\ncontradicted the other interviewees’ allegations.\n\n\n\n\n       17   These would include employees Marie Bagulou, Melissa Escobedo, Siena\nGarlejo, Gomez, Kristyn Grimett, Lee, Jesimel Marcelo, and Osiegbu.\n\n\n\n                                            27\n\f       Ogunsanya argues that she was not given an opportunity to respond to the\n\nallegations against her. However, the July 18 meeting was precisely such an opportunity.\n\nRather than explain her actions or try to justify them, she simply denied that they had\n\noccurred. Nevertheless, when both Farmer and Harrington said that she had threatened to\n\nstop doing business with Lonza, the decision makers were entitled to believe them and\n\ndisbelieve her. Likewise, when 14 employees said that she had threatened to retaliate\n\nagainst them if they went to HR, the decision makers were entitled to believe them and\n\ndisbelieve Ogunsanya.\n\n       The record includes notes handwritten by Nollau that say, among other things,\n\n“Rose Lewis,” “18 July 08,” and “Badge + B[lack]Berry.” Nollau explained: “Those\n\nwere the things I was told to get from [Ogunsanya] before she left on her suspension.”\n\nOgunsanya concludes that “[b]efore the meeting, Lewis had already instructed Nollau to\n\nconfiscate [her] employee badge and [B]lackberry.” Or, in other words, the outcome of\n\nthe meeting was preordained.\n\n       There was no evidence, however, that these notes were written before the July 18\n\nmeeting. In her deposition, Nollau initially testified that she wrote them during the\n\nmeeting; later, she was not sure when she wrote them, or even if she wrote them all at the\n\nsame time. The reference to “Badge + B[lack]Berry” was written under a wavy divider\n\nline; also, it was the very last item in the notes. It seems most likely that she wrote this\n\nafter Ogunsanya was asked to step outside. In any event, absent any evidence that Nollau\n\n\n\n\n                                              28\n\fin fact wrote it before the meeting, it fails to raise a triable issue of fact with respect to\n\npretext.\n\n       Ogunsanya also seizes on various discrepancies among the recollections of the\n\ndecision makers and argues that these are evidence of pretext.\n\n       First, Ogunsanya claims there were discrepancies about who made the termination\n\ndecision. Not so. Wirkus testified: “[Ogunsanya] reported directly to [Nollau], so it was\n\n[Nollau]’s decision, but we were all aligned.” Nollau testified similarly that “[Martin]\n\nhad come with the recommendation and . . . we all talked about it after that and agreed to\n\nsupport the recommendation and go forward.” Martin did not contradict this; she merely\n\ntestified that it was Lewis who made the “initial determination” to prepare a termination\n\nreview worksheet.\n\n       Next, Ogunsanya claims that Nollau had no idea what company policies were\n\nviolated and had never seen those policies until she was given them in preparation for her\n\ndeposition. Actually, Nollau testified that Ogunsanya had violated the “Employee\n\nRelations,” “Problem Solving,” and “Fair Dealing” policies, as well as other policies that\n\nshe did not remember. She further testified that all employees were trained on these\n\npolicies during orientation; they merely were not given a hard copy.\n\n       Ogunsanya claims — correctly — that Wirkus misremembered what Ogunsanya\n\nsupposedly said to Lonza. As he recalled, she tried to keep Lonza from hiring Farmer by\n\nsaying “negative things” about Farmer. However, the mere fact that, two and a half years\n\n\n\n\n                                               29\n\flater, Wirkus could no longer recall this kind of detail falls far short of showing that he\n\nactually had some other agenda.\n\n       Ogunsanya also points out that Slane could not remember the names of any\n\nemployees who had complained. Once again, this is not evidence of pretext.\n\n       Finally, Ogunsanya complains about the way her suspension and termination were\n\nhandled: She was escorted out of the building in full view of others; she was told not to\n\ncontact Abbott employees, and they were told not to contact her; the lock on her office\n\ndoor was changed; an employee who was seen going into her office was questioned; and\n\nAbbott refused to give her a written statement of the reasons for her termination.\n\nUnpleasant and even humiliating as these actions may have been, they are not atypical of\n\nthe way large employers handle terminations these days. Certainly Ogunsanya\n\nintroduced no evidence that Abbott handled her termination any differently than the\n\ntermination of any other employee. Thus, yet again, this evidence fails to raise a triable\n\nissue of fact with regard to pretext.\n\n                                              V\n\n                     EVIDENCE OF FAILURE TO INVESTIGATE\n\n       According to Ogunsanya, Abbott also violated its duty under FEHA “to take all\n\nreasonable steps necessary to prevent discrimination and harassment from occurring”\n\n(Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (k)) by failing to investigate four separate reports of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n\n\n\n                                             30\n\f       “An actionable claim under [Government Code] section 12940, subdivision (k) is\n\ndependent on a claim of actual discrimination: ‘Employers should not be held liable to\n\nemployees for failure to take necessary steps to prevent such conduct, except where the\n\nactions took place and were not prevented.’ [Citation.]” (Scotch v. Art Institute of\n\nCalifornia (2009) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">986</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1021.)\n\n       Two of the cited reports were by Bawa; they were both made after Ogunsanya had\n\nalready been suspended or terminated. As mentioned (see part IV.C, ante), Bawa told\n\nsomeone from ER that there was a plan to get rid of her and all the other African-\n\nAmericans in the department. Bawa also told Nollau that she felt that people did not trust\n\nher and viewed her as one of “Charity’s favorites.”\n\n       There is no evidence that Abbott failed to investigate Bawa’s reports. Even\n\nassuming that it had the burden to prove that it did investigate, Nollau testified that she\n\n“followed up” on Bawa’s report by talking to two group leaders and to Martin; she also\n\nadvised Bawa to talk to Martin. Even more important, Abbott’s alleged failure to\n\ninvestigate Bawa’s reports did not result in any further harassment or discrimination\n\nagainst either Bawa or Ogunsanya (who was already gone). Bawa testified that Abbott\n\nhad “treated [her] well”; “I don’t have any problem with the company.” Finally,\n\nOgunsanya lacks standing to sue for alleged discrimination against Bawa. (Gov. Code,\n\n§ 12965, subd. (b) [“aggrieved person” has private right of action].)\n\n       The other two reports were by Ogunsanya herself. First, in 2007, she told Pat\n\nLavey, “who was responsible for investigating discrimination complaints,” that some\n\n\n\n                                             31\n\femployees felt that she was hiring too many African-Americans and that those hires were\n\nunqualified. Ogunsanya also told Lavey that she “considered th[o]se complaints to be\n\nracist.”18 There was never any investigation of her complaint. The failure to investigate,\n\nhowever, did not result in any harassment or discrimination against Ogunsanya.\n\nUltimately, she was terminated for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons.19\n\n       Next, after she was terminated, she filed an internal appeal in which she alleged:\n\n“I was discriminated against because I am an African . . . .” Her appeal was denied\n\n“based on the findings of [Lewis’s] investigation.” Thus, there was no separate\n\ninvestigation of her allegations of racism. Once again, however, Ogunsanya had been\n\nterminated for legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons. An investigation might have\n\nrevealed that some of the people who complained about her were racially prejudiced, or\n\neven that they had a plan to get rid of all the African-Americans in the department, but\n\nfor the reasons already discussed (see part IV, ante), it would not have undermined the\n\n       18      In a declaration, Ogunsanya claimed that she also complained to Lavey\nabout people referring to Osiegbu as “Charity’s boy.” In her deposition, however, she\nadmitted that she did not know that people referred to Osiegbu as “Charity’s boy” until\nJanuary 2009, when Gomez told her. In her reply brief, she concedes that she “did not\nlearn [that] Osiegbu was often referred to as ‘Charity’s boy’ until after she was\nterminated . . . .”\n       19      Ogunsanya argues that she raised a triable issue of fact with regard to\nretaliation (Gov. Code, § 12940, subd. (h)), citing her complaint to Lavey. Her\nretaliation claim, however, much like her discrimination claim, must fail, because Abbott\nproved that it had legitimate, nonretaliatory reasons for the termination decision.

Additional Factual and Procedural Background.\n\n       Abbott filed a memorandum of costs, seeking $48,369.78. Ogunsanya responded\n\nwith a motion to tax costs, arguing (among other things) that under FEHA, costs could\n\nnot be awarded against a plaintiff unless the plaintiff’s claims were frivolous,\n\nunreasonable, or groundless.\n\n       The trial court ruled: “I do not believe that there is a requirement that there be a\n\nfinding that the plaintiff’s claim was frivolous.” After taxing certain items, it awarded\n\nAbbott $26,311.21 in costs.\n\n       B.     Analysis.\n\n       Ogunsanya argues, as she did in the trial court, that under FEHA, costs cannot be\n\nawarded against the plaintiff in the absence of a finding that his or her claims were\n\nfrivolous, unreasonable, or groundless.\n\n       That is not the law.\n\n\n\n\n                                              33\n\f       Government Code section 12965, subdivision (b) provides that, in an action under\n\nFEHA, “the court, in its discretion, may award to the prevailing party . . . reasonable\n\nattorney’s fees and costs . . . .”\n\n       42 United States Code section 2000e-5(k) similarly provides that, in an action\n\nunder Title VII, “the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a\n\nreasonable attorney’s fee . . . as part of the costs . . . .”\n\n       In Christiansburg Garment Co. v.

It explained: “[T]here are at least two\n\nstrong equitable considerations counseling an attorney’s fee award to a prevailing Title\n\nVII plaintiff that are wholly absent in the case of a prevailing Title VII defendant. [¶]\n\nFirst, . . . the plaintiff is the chosen instrument of Congress to vindicate ‘a policy that\n\nCongress considered of the highest priority.’ [Citation.] Second, when a district court\n\nawards counsel fees to a prevailing plaintiff, it is awarding them against a violator of\n\nfederal law. . . . ‘[T]hese policy considerations which support the award of fees to a\n\nprevailing plaintiff are not present in the case of a prevailing defendant.’ [Citation.]” (Id.\n\nat pp. 418-419.) It also relied on legislative history indicating “that while Congress\n\nwanted to clear the way for suits to be brought under the Act, it also wanted to protect\n\ndefendants from burdensome litigation having no legal or factual basis.” (Id. at p. 420.)\n\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\f       Cummings v.

It explained: “The standard a trial court must use in exercising\n\nits discretion in awarding fees and costs to a prevailing defendant was set forth in the\n\nSupreme Court’s decision in Christiansburg . . . .” (Id. at p. 1387.)

It stated: “[T]he issue in Christiansburg was\n\nlimited to the recovery of attorney fees. Costs outside of those fees were not at issue. In\n\nCummings, the court did not segregate the two parts of the award in applying\n\nChristiansburg, but overturned them together. Indeed, the court even represented the\n\nChristiansburg holding as pertaining to both attorney fees and costs. [Citation.]\n\n       “We find this blending of fees and costs to be unnecessary and inappropriate.\n\nSeveral federal courts themselves have refused to apply the Christiansburg test for\n\nrecovery of defense attorney fees to ordinary litigation expenses. [Citations.] ‘The\n\nrationale for this distinction is clear. Whereas the magnitude and unpredictability of\n\nattorney’s fees would deter parties with meritorious claims from litigation, the costs of\n\nsuit in the traditional sense are predictable, and, compared to the costs of attorneys’ fees,\n\nsmall.’ [Citation.] . . .\n\n\n\n                                             35\n\f       “By parity of reasoning, we believe that ordinary litigation costs are recoverable\n\nby a prevailing FEHA defendant even if the lawsuit was not frivolous, groundless, or\n\nunreasonable.” (Perez v.

In our view, then, it is established law that such an award does not require a\n\nfinding that the plaintiffs’ claims were frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless. There is\n\nno genuine split of authority, because the parties in Cummings apparently never raised\n\nthe issue of the standard for an award of costs. “‘“It is axiomatic that cases are not\n\nauthority for propositions not considered.”’ [Citation.]” (McWilliams v.
