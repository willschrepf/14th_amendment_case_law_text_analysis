While appellant cites authorities to the effect that automobiles are not <em>per se</em>\ndangerous, when in use, by reason of the human element involved in their operation they are potentially homicidal as recognized by the decisions, 42 C. J. 615, and proved by the facts. The Traveler's Insurance Company of Hartford Connecticut shows the increase in deaths from automobile accidents during the last five years to be: Deaths in 1932, 29,196; 1933, 31,078; 1934, 35,769; 1935, 36,100; with 864,800 accidents in 1936, 36,800 killed, and 967,840 people injured, in 1936. (1937 The World Almanac, page 322.)</p>\n<p>\"The ever-increasing use of the highways by those operating motor vehicles is attended by serious dangers of bodily harm and death. In an effort to minimize this menace to public safety, a state as an exercise of the police power may prescribe uniform regulation covering the ownership and operation of these vehicles. (cases) One of the common requirements is that of registration of motor vehicles, and there cannot be the slightest doubt of the validity of this requirement. <em>Hendrick v. Maryland, supra.</em> So too as to the requirement of a license for chauffeurs and operators. . . . .\" (<em>Munz v. Harnett</em>, 6 Fed. Supp. 158, at 159-160.)</p>\n<p>(<em>In re Opinion of the Justices</em>, <cross_reference>251 Mass. 569</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>147 N.E. 681</cross_reference>;<em>Rutherford v.

Hoffman, supra.</em>)</p>\n<p>Appellant's first ground of attack is that under section 30 (a) 2, <em>supra</em>, a driver's license may be suspended when he is involved in an accident regardless of whether he was at fault or to blame, hence penalized because of an innocent act, because the legislature left out of our statute the words \"by reckless or unlawful operation and caused or contributed to an accident\" contained in the Uniform Act from which our statute was apparently taken. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 502</span> </p>\n<p>The majority, without defining or analyzing the word \"involved,\" or what the legislature intended thereby, predicates its holding of unconstitutionality on appellant's bare and unsupported contention.</p>\n<p>While the court may not amend a statute or supply words, it will if possible give a meaning to words used by the legislature which will not lead to a ridiculous or absurd result, or contrary to the evident intention and purpose of the legislature, and if words are capable of being defined so as to accomplish the evident legislative purpose, the court will do so.

Co.</em><em>v. Egbert</em>, <cross_reference>52 Idaho 402</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>16 P.2d 390</cross_reference>.) The cardinal principle of statutory construction is to save and not to destroy. (<em>National Labor Rel. Board v. Jones  Laughlin S.</em><em>Corp.</em>, <cross_reference>301 U.S. 1</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>57 Sup. Ct. 615</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>81 L. ed. 893</cross_reference>, 108 A.L.R. 1352.)</p>\n<p>The words \"involve\" and \"involved\" have been defined as follows: \"To envelop; surround; to draw into an entanglement or complication; to include or contain; implicate.\" (Webster's New International Dictionary.) \"Involve,\" \"To envelop or (in later use, more usually) entangle (a person) in trouble, difficulties, perplexity etc., to embarass; to engage in circumstances from which it is difficult to withdraw; to implicate in a charge or crime; to cause or prove a person to be concerned in it. \"Involved\": \"of persons, their actions etc. not straightforward and open, underhand, covert, crooked.\" (The New English Dictionary, Oxford, pages 465, 466) \"Involve is a stronger word than implicate, denoting more complete entanglement.\" (Standard dictionary).</p>\n<p>From these definitions it is clearly evident the legislature intended the word \"involved\" to carry with it the meaning and element of causative action and at least, though slight, wrongdoing or negligence. The legislature had the right to go further than the Uniform Law and grades of negligence are recognized, for instance liability to a guest rests on gross negligence, I. C. A., sec. <cross_reference>48-901</cross_reference>; there is ordinary negligence, and criminal negligence, I. C.

We find support for this thought in <em>Butler v.

True that point, as such, is not before us for consideration but it shows what the courts have considered as having a bearing on what regulations may have a compelling influence on persons to drive carefully and their reasoning <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 505</span> \nis pertinent herein; <em>In re Opinion of the Justices, supra; Munz</em><em>v. Harnett, supra; Commonwealth v. Funk, supra; Garford</em><em>Trucking v. Hoffman, supra; Watson v. State Division of Motor</em><em>Vehicles, supra; State v. Price, supra. Ex parte Lindley</em>,<cross_reference>108 Cal.App. 258</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>291 P. 638</cross_reference>, cited by appellant as <em>contra</em> has been impliedly overruled in <em>Watson v.

Division of Motor Vehicles</em>, <cross_reference>140 Cal.App. 200</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>35 P.2d 359</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>The legislature had the right to consider and exert the coercive curbing influence on a driver in declaring that if he were involved in a negligent or reckless manner in the slightest degree in an automobile accident causing death or serious injury to persons or property, his license would be suspended. One of the curses of regulatory safety measures has been loophole evasion and procrastination which the legislature in this act attempted to abate.</p>\n<p>Appellant however asserts the statute allows and the commissioner has exercised arbitrary discrimination under an unlawful delegation of judicial authority. If a license is to be revoked for any cause, initially someone must act. This is an executive or administrative act not judicial in the true sense and similar delegations have been sustained on this theory, not only in this state but quite universally. (<em>State v. Johnson</em>, <cross_reference>50 Idaho 363</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>296 P. 588</cross_reference>; <em>Chambers v.</em><em>McCollum, supra; Idaho Power  Light Co. v.

Hoffman, supra</em>, at 888:</p>\n<p>\". . . . The granting or revocation of a license by a state board similar to the one here in question was held by this court in <em>People v. Apfelbaum, supra</em> (<cross_reference>251 Ill. 18</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>95 N.E. 995</cross_reference>), not to be the exercise of judicial power, as that term is understood in reference to the distribution of the powers of government. . . . . <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 506</span> </p>\n<p>\"Nor does the fact that the granting or revocation of a license, under the act, is committed to an administrative officer, who may be authorized to exercise his discretion in so doing, violate any constitutional guaranty. If for good cause the administrative official is satisfied that the license should be revoked, he may, upon proper proofs so do. . . . .\"</p>\n<p>Appellant contends the commissioner has not suspended the license of others when he should have and therefore it was erroneous for him to suspend appellant's license. This reasoning is <em>a non sequitur:</em> First, the facts are not shown to be the same; indeed the record shows they were substantially different. The courts have repeatedly exposed the fallacy of this proposition; because one jury acquits a person who should be convicted is no reason to discharge another who under similar or even identical circumstances in another action has been convicted. Verdicts acquitting one and convicting another where both are jointly charged, with the same evidence introduced as to both, have been sustained, <em>State v. Jackett</em>,<cross_reference>45 Idaho 720</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>264 P. 875</cross_reference>; 15 C. J. 1104, sec. 2591, as is likewise true in civil cases. (<em>Strickfaden v. Greencreek</em><em>Highway Dist.</em>, <cross_reference>42 Idaho 738</cross_reference>, at 767, <cross_reference>248 P. 456</cross_reference>, 49 A.L.R. 1057; <em>Gunnell v.

Co.</em>, <cross_reference>55 Idaho 461</cross_reference>, at 478,<cross_reference>44 P.2d 291</cross_reference>.) Secondly, that the commissioner should have proceeded against others, but has not done so, does not exculpate appellant. (<em>Kootenai County v. Seven-Seven Co.</em>,<cross_reference>32 Idaho 301</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>182 P. 529</cross_reference>.)</p>\n<p>While the suspension of a license is not a criminal proceeding, appellant asserts it is penal in nature and certainly a rule applicable in criminal proceedings is applicable herein. (<em>Glass v. State Board of Public Roads</em>,<cross_reference>44 R.I. 54</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>115 Atl. 244</cross_reference>, at 245, 246; <em>Klein v. City of</em><em>Cincinnati, supra; Capitol Taxicab Co. v. Cermak, supra; People</em><em>v. Harnett, supra; Watson v. State Division of Motor Vehicles,</em><em>supra.</em>)</p>\n<p>The commissioner testified suspension followed an adverse verdict of the coroner's jury. This does not make such action arbitrary or discriminatory; the essential question being of course, not whether the verdict of the coroner's jury was properly found or conclusive, but whether in the particular <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 507</span> \ncase and on review before the commissioner, to which everyone upon application is entitled, the showing of negligence, though slight, was sufficient to justify the suspension.</p>\n<p>Aside from appellant's contention that the acquittal of the manslaughter charge absolved him from all blame, hereafter disposed of, and that the commissioner arbitrarily discriminated against him and in favor of others, untenable as shown above, he does not question the sufficiency of the showing before the commissioner authorizing his original order of suspension, hence it is unnecessary to further consider it.</p>\n<p><em>Thompson v. Smith</em>, <cross_reference>155 Va. 367</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>154 S.E. 579</cross_reference>, 71 A.L.R. 604, largely relied upon by appellant has been followed as to what he contends are its pertinent points only in the dissent in <em>In re Probasco, supra</em>, at page 864, and the annotations in 71 A.L.R. 616, 108 A.L.R. 1162, show that it has not otherwise been followed.</p>\n<p>Appellant also contends the acquittal in the manslaughter proceeding was an absolute and complete finding that he was not guilty of any wrongdoing, the basis of the proceeding herein. The majority rule is directly contrary as shown by the following authorities: <em>Steele v. State Road Com.</em>, <cross_reference>116 W. Va. 227</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>179 S.E. 810</cross_reference>; <em>Commonwealth v.

Under the provisions of the acts here involved, the committee appointed to investigate can merely report its findings to the board, whereupon a trial committee may be appointed. Before both committees a full and complete hearing may be had, said committees acting in capacities similar to referees, reporting their findings and conclusions to the board, before which latter body a full and complete review is provided for, with a right of review of its findings, conclusions and recommendations in the supreme court, where a still further hearing is provided for.\" (<em>In re Edwards</em>, <cross_reference>45 Idaho 676</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>266 Pac. 665</cross_reference>, at 689, 690.)</p>\n<p>Since the Abrams case, <em>supra</em>, this court has approved a situation similar with the case at bar in <em>Chambers v.

          "html_columbia": "<p>On February 16, 1936, appellant and one Francis Blake were involved in a collision resulting in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 496</span> \nunfortunate death of one Bernice Thomas. Subsequently a coroner's jury was duly impaneled and returned a verdict finding, in effect, that Bernice Thomas met her death as a result of an accident which occurred February 16, 1936, on the Lewis and Clark highway, due to the criminal negligence of appellant while driving his car at an excessive rate of speed, and the contributory negligence of Francis Blake, the driver of a sled, due to not having his vehicle equipped with the necessary lights while operating the same on the state highway. The verdict of the coroner's jury, accompanied by a report of a traffic officer, covering the details of the accident, was furnished to the Commissioner of Law Enforcement. Upon this information the commissioner suspended appellant's driver's license on March 19, 1936, for a period of one year. Thereafter appellant was duly informed against and charged with the crime of involuntary manslaughter, the charging part of the information being as follows:</p>\n<p>\". . . . the said defendant, Kenneth Kouni, then and there being, did then and there while engaged and occupied in operating a motor vehicle on the public highway of the state of Idaho . . . . did run and operate said vehicle so negligently and carelessly, and without due caution, by then and there driving at a high rate of speed and in a manner to endanger the lives and limbs of persons upon said highway, and on the left side of said highway (his left). And did drive the said motor vehicle into and upon a sleigh in which one Bernice Thomas, a human being, was riding; and injured the said Bernice Thomas so that she died from said injuries on or about the 17th day of February, 1936.\"</p>\n<p>Appellant, on April 30, 1936, was duly and regularly acquitted of said charge by a jury. Thereafter appellant made application to the commissioner for the reinstatement of his driver's license under the provisions of section 30, subdivision (b), chapter 88, 1935 Session Laws. A hearing before the commissioner was thereafter had, appellant reserving and not waiving the question of the jurisdiction of the commissioner to hear and determine the question of the suspension, revocation or reinstatement of his driver's license, and in support of his contention relied upon the unconstitutionality of section <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 497</span> \n30, subdivision (a) (2), and subdivision (b), chapter 88,<em>supra.</em> Subsequent to the hearing had before the commissioner pursuant to subdivision (b), section 30, chapter 88, <em>supra</em>, the commissioner, on June 10, 1936, denied appellant's application for reinstatement of his driver's license and continued the suspension thereof until March 19, 1937.</p>\n<p>Appellant by occupation is an automobile salesman, and as such made his livelihood. His work required the driving of automobiles for demonstration purposes. Subsequent to the action of the commissioner, denying appellant's application for restoration of his driver's license, appellant was duly charged by information, as follows:</p>\n<p>\". . . . on or about the 10th day of July, 1936, the defendant Kenneth Kouni, did then and there being, willfully, intentionally, knowingly and unlawfully, drive a motor vehicle upon the highways of the state of Idaho . . . . while his Motor Vehicle Operator's License was so suspended. . . . .\"</p>\n<p>This cause was tried to the court, a jury having been expressly waived, and on December 2, 1936, appellant was adjudged guilty as charged and judgment was thereupon entered, from which this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p>One of the main questions raised in this case is the validity of the commissioner's order of suspension of March 19, 1936, and the constitutionality of the law under which the order of suspension was entered. Section 30, subdivision (a), chapter 88, 1935 Session Laws, provides:</p>\n<p>\"The department is hereby authorized to suspend the license of an operator or chauffeur without preliminary hearing upon a showing by its records or other sufficient evidence that the licensee:</p>\n<p>\". . . .</p>\n<p>\"2. Has been involved as a driver in any accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another or serious property damage;\"</p>\n<p>Under the foregoing provision the commissioner may arbitrarily or capriciously summarily suspend or revoke a driver's license upon the sole and only ground that the licensee has been involved as a driver in any accident resulting in the death or personal injury of another or serious property damage, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 498</span> \nalthough the license may have been absolutely free from negligence, and in no way responsible for the death or personal injury of another or serious property damage. The provision, heretofore quoted, is an abridgment of section 19, Uniform Motor Vehicle Operator's and Chauffeur's License Act, volume 9, Uniform Laws, section 19, page 330, which provides:</p>\n<p>\"The Department may immediately suspend the license of any person without hearing and without receiving a record of conviction of such person of crime whenever the Department has reason to believe:</p>\n<p>\". . . .</p>\n<p>\"2. That such person has, <em>by reckless or unlawful operation</em><em>of a motor vehicle, caused or contributed to an accident</em>\nresulting in death or injury to any other person or serious property damage.\"</p>\n<p>It will be observed that subdivision 2 of section 30 (a),<em>supra</em>, entirely omits the following words:</p>\n<p>\"by reckless or unlawful operation of a motor vehicle, caused or contributed to\"</p>\n<p>Under subdivision 2, of section 30 (a), <em>supra</em>, in the absence of reckless or unlawful operation of a motor vehicle, the licensee's driver's license may be revoked or suspended by the commissioner, and under a state of facts that would show that the licensee was not reckless, that he did not unlawfully operate the motor vehicle, that he in no way contributed by his negligence to the accident, and that he was entirely free from any blame, responsibility or liability for the accident or the result of the accident, resulting in the death or personal injury of another or serious property damage. The commissioner is authorized under the above provision to suspend or revoke the license of the party involved in the accident, innocently and without negligence, and who has not caused or contributed to the accident, as well as to suspend or revoke the license of the party who by reckless or unlawful operation of his motor vehicle, caused or contributed to the accident.</p>\n<p>There is no provision in the act for notice or hearing before a court of competent jurisdiction in which the commissioner's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 499</span> \naction may be fairly and impartially reviewed. The action of the commissioner may deny to the owner or operator of the motor vehicle the right to the use, in a lawful manner, of his property. Subdivision 1 of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States provides:</p>\n<p>\"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty or property without due process of law, nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\"</p>\n<p>Article 1, section 13 of the Idaho constitution provides:</p>\n<p>\". . . . No person shall . . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property without the due process of law.\"</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons we hold that subdivision 2 of section 30 (a), chapter 88, 1935 Session Laws, is in conflict with the constitution of the United States and the constitution of Idaho.</p>\n<p>The judgment in this case is reversed.</p>\n<p>Holden, C.J., and Ailshie, J., concur.</p>",

      "attorneys": "Paul W. Hyatt, for Appellant.\n\nThe statute in question providing for suspension of the license where driver is involved in an accident resulting in death or personal injury of another or serious property damage is not a reasonable exercise of the police power of the state because suspension may be had where a driver is entirely innocent of any fault or negligence, as in the instant case.\n\nAn automobile is not  per se  a dangerous instrumentality, and the rules governing instrumentalities dangerous  per se  do not apply. ( Cohen v. Meador ,  119 Va. 429 ,  89 S.E. 876  &#8212;\n878;  McNeal v. McKain ,  33 Okl. 449 ,  126 P. 742 ,  743 , 41 L.R.A., N.S., 775;  Thompson v. Smith ,  155 Va. 367 ,  154 S.E. 579 , 71 A.L.R. 604, 610; 42 C. J., pp. 614, 615;  Quackenbush v.  Ford Motor Co. ,  167 App. Div. 433 , 153 N.Y. Supp. 131-133.)\n\nThe mere restriction of liberty cannot of itself be denominated public welfare and treated as a legitimate object of the police power. There must be a clear, real and substantial connection between purpose and provisions of the law. (12 C. J., pp. 929-933;  Mugler v. Kansas ,  123 U.S. 623 , 8 Sup. Ct. 273 ,  31 L. ed. 205 ,  210 .)\n\nDepriving a person of the use of his motor vehicle unnecessarily is not a reasonable police regulation. ( Ex parte  Lindley ,  108 Cal.App. 258 ,  291 P. 638 .)\n\nRegulation of use of an automobile under police power cannot be accomplished by permitting it to some and refusing it to others of like qualifications under like circumstances and conditions. ( Thompson v. Smith ,  155 Va. 367 ,  154 S.E. 579 , 71 A.L.R. 604, 610;  Watson v. State Division of Motor Vehicles , 212 Cal. 279 ,  298 P. 481 , at p. 483.)\n\nThe statute involved in this case violates the due process clauses of the state and federal constitutions, in that a party may be subjected to the suspension of his driver's license when he is involved in an accident, regardless of whether or not he is at fault, or to blame, and is therefore highly penal and he is subjected to a penalty because of an innocent act.\n\nA statute which makes a crime of a perfectly innocent act, or inflicts a penalty for an innocent act, is void. ( State v.  Burns ,  53 Idaho 418 ,  23 P.2d 731 ;  Ex parte Bales , 42 Okl. Crim. 28, 274 P. 485.)\n\nA statute creating an offense is void for want of due process of law which fails to prescribe with reasonable certainty the elements of the offense or which arbitrarily and unreasonably prescribes that certain acts innocent in themselves shall constitute criminal offenses. (12 C. J. 1203.)\n\nThe statute in question denies to the appellant the protection of the due process clause of the constitution in that the license may be suspended without notice, and without a hearing before an unbiased tribunal.\n\nWhere the state confers a license upon an individual to practice a trade, profession or occupation, such license becomes a valuable personal right which cannot be denied or abridged in any manner except after due notice and a fair and impartial hearing before an unbiased tribunal. ( Abrams v.  Jones ,  35 Idaho 532 ,  533 ,  207 P. 724 .)\n\nJ.W. Taylor, Attorney General, and Ariel L. Crowley, Assistant Attorney General, for Respondent.\n\nThe legislature may properly delegate to an executive officer the power to inquire into and ascertain facts and to act upon the facts so ascertained; and this rule has been expressly applied in drivers' license cases. ( Chambers v. McCollum , 47 Idaho 74 ,  272 P. 707 ;  Idaho Power  Light Co. v. Blomquist , 26 Idaho 222 ,  141 P. 1083 , Ann. Cas. 1916E, 282, 284;  Speer v.  Stephenson ,  16 Idaho 707 ,  102 P. 365 ;  Boise Irr.  L. Co. v.  Stewart ,  10 Idaho 38 ,  77 P. 25 ,  321 .)\n\nIt is the established law of this state that the legislature may confer judicial functions as distinguished from judicial powers upon executive tribunals in the exercise of the police power. ( In re Hinkle ,  33 Idaho 605 ,  613 ,  196 P. 1035 ;  Lyon v.  City of Payette ,  38 Idaho 705 ,  224 P. 793 ;  Humbird Lumber Co.  v. Public Utilities Com. ,  39 Idaho 505 ,  228 P. 271 ;  Natatorium  Co. v. Erb ,  34 Idaho 209 ,  215 ,  200 P. 348 .)\n\nOperator's license confers no vested right, only a mere privilege subject to revocation for the reasons and in the manner provided by law. ( Sleeper v. Woodmansee , 11 Cal.App. (2d) 595,  54 P.2d 519 ;  Commonwealth v. Funk ,  323 Pa. 390 , 186 Atl. 65 ; 5 Am. Jur. 593, sec. 157;  Ex parte Von Perhacs , 190 Cal. 364 ,  212 P. 689 ; 1-2 Huddy Cyc. Auto. Law 481.)\n\nRegulations by law for suspension of drivers' licenses are an exercise of the police power and are uniformly sustained as necessary to public safety. (1-2 Huddy Ency. Auto. Law 481, sec. 248 and cases cited;  Opinion of Justices ,  251 Mass. 617 , 147 N.E. 680 ;  Cusack v. William Laube  Co. ,  104 Conn. 487 , 133 Atl. 584 .)",
