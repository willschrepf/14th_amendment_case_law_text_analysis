Atty.\nGeneral, Sacramento, California, for defendants-appellants.\n\n\n                          OPINION\n\nBENNETT, District Judge:\n\n     A state prisoner asserts that denials by prison officials of\nhis request for a conjugal visit with his wife violated the\nReligious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act\n(RLUIPA) and the First Amendment to the United States\nConstitution by interfering with his practice of a tenet of his\nIslamic faith requiring him to marry, consummate his\nmarriage, and father children. The immediate question,\nhowever, is not the merits of his claims, but when the\nlimitations period began to run on them. Was it in 2008,\nwhen the prisoner’s request for a conjugal visit with his\nsecond wife was denied pursuant to a prison regulation that\nhad been in force, essentially unchanged, since 1996, or in\n2002, when the prisoner’s request for a conjugal visit with his\nfirst wife was denied pursuant to that regulation? The answer\nturns not only on the precise nature of the prisoner’s claims,\nbut on which of two apparently conflicting lines of authority\nis controlling on the accrual date of the prisoner’s claims.\nIndeed, this appears to be the kind of case, forecast by the\nUnited States Supreme Court, “where it will be difficult to\ndetermine when the [limitations] time period should begin to\nrun.” Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101,\n115 n.7 (2002). It is symptomatic of the difficulty of the\nquestion that two district judges in the Eastern District of\nCalifornia reached contrary results on it, in two very similar\ncases, within the space of a few months. The appellant prison\nofficial contends that one of the district judges, the one in this\n\f4                       POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\ncase, got it wrong, when he denied the prison official’s\nmotion to dismiss the prisoner’s claims as untimely. We\naffirm.\n\n                        1. BACKGROUND\n\n                     a. Factual Background\n\n    Plaintiff-appellee Madero L. Pouncil is a California state\nprisoner serving a sentence of life imprisonment without\nparole (LWOP) at Mule Creek State Prison (MCSP). He\nalleges in his pro se Complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nthat he is a Muslim, that marriage is one of the most\nimportant institutions in Islam and is incumbent on every\nMuslim, and that the main duties of a Muslim to his or her\nspouse are to consummate their marriage to solidify the\nvalidity of the marriage and to have sexual relations as a form\nof worship.\n\n    Pouncil married his first wife in 1999 while Pouncil was\nalready in prison.1 In 2002, Pouncil requested a conjugal visit\nwith his wife, but that request was denied. On March 26,\n2002, Pouncil filed a grievance stating, in part, “I’m told, ‘I\ncan’t apply for a Family visit, cause of the time I’m serving,\nand nature of the crime committed,’” but that the denial of a\n\n\n  1\n    Although this matter is before the court on an appeal from the denial\nof a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, which ordinarily would limit this court to consideration\nof allegations in the Complaint, see, e.g., Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire &\nMarine Ins. Co., 519 F.3d 1025, 1030 (9th Cir. 2008), at the defendant’s\nrequest, the magistrate judge to whom the defendant’s motion to dismiss\nwas referred took judicial notice of marriage certificates indicating that\nPouncil was married on September 16, 1999, and remarried on July 14,\n2007.\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                       5\n\nconjugal visit restricted him from complying with a duty of\nhis religion. His grievance was denied as was his “Second\nLevel” appeal, because a prison regulation, CAL. CODE REGS.\ntit. 15, § 3174, did not permit LWOP prisoners to have\nconjugal visits.\n\n    The parties agree that Pouncil was subsequently divorced\nfrom his first wife. The parties also agree that Pouncil\nremarried on July 14, 2007, and that, on or about July 21,\n2008, Pouncil submitted another request for conjugal visits.\nThat request was denied on August 1, 2008, by a counselor,\nwho stated, “Per CCR 3177(b)(2) LWOP inmates are not\npermitted family visits.” The regulation on which the\ncounselor relied is essentially the same one cited in the denial\nof Pouncil’s request for a conjugal visit in 2002, which had\nbeen recodified in 2006 as § 3177. Pouncil’s administrative\nappeals were denied at the “Informal Level,” on August 7,\n2008; in a “Second Level Appeal Response,” dated\nSeptember 3, 2008; and in a “Director’s Level Decision,”\ndated December 9, 2008. The “Director’s Level Decision”\nexpressly stated that it “exhaust[ed] the administrative\nremedy available to the appellant within CDCR.”\n\n                 b. Procedural Background\n\n    On April 27, 2009, Pouncil signed, and on April 29, 2009,\nthe Clerk of Court for the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of California filed, Pouncil’s pro se\nComplaint pursuant to the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. The Complaint named as defendants James Tilton,\nidentified as the Director of the California Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR); D. Foston, identified\nas Facility Captain; and M. Martel, identified as the Warden\nor Acting Warden at MCSP. In his Complaint, Pouncil stated\n\f6                    POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\nthat he had brought the lawsuit against the CDCR “for\nimplementing a rule to the California Code of Regulation\n(3177(b)(2)) that violates Petitioner[’s] Constitutional right\nto practice his religion and be married as a Muslim under the\nRLUIPA act. . . . Petitioner all so [sic] claims a violation of\nhis 14th. and 8th. amendment rights.” Complaint at 4.\nPouncil also alleged that “[t]his rule dose [sic] not provide\nintimate time (family visiting) for Muslim Inmates serving a\nlife without parole term, wherefore making it impossible for\nPetitioner to consummate his marriage/have sexual relations\nwith his wife and practice his religion and perform his duties\nto his wife as commanded by (ALLAH) and affirmed in the\nteaching of prophet Muhammad. [A]nd by denying Petitioner\nthe right to perform his religious duties to his wife or\npotential wife is to deny him his right to be married as a\nMuslim.” Complaint at 5. Pouncil sought the following\nrelief: “Reinstate Family Visits for Lifers, and Life without\nthe possibility of parole Inmate so I can fulfill my duties\nreligiously to my wife, and guide my children in my family\nwith direct understanding of my faith.” Complaint at 2.\n\n    Pouncil’s Complaint makes no express mention of his\napplications for conjugal visits in either 2002 or 2008 or\ndenials of those applications. It does, however, aver that\nPouncil completed the administrative review process for his\nclaims, explaining what happened at each level of\nadministrative review. The administrative exhaustion that\nPouncil cites relates entirely to his 2008 application for a\nconjugal visit.\n\n   The docket below reflects that Tilton and Foston filed\nwaivers of service of the Complaint, but that Martel was\nnever served with the Complaint. Tilton and Foston filed a\nmotion to dismiss arguing, among other things, that Pouncil’s\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                      7\n\nComplaint is time-barred. The defendants argued that\nPouncil’s claims accrued in 2002 when he first filed an\ninmate grievance concerning conjugal family visitation, so\nthat the statute of limitations had run by 2009, when Pouncil\nfiled suit. Pouncil argued that his claims accrued only after\nhe remarried in 2007, and that his action relates only to\nmatters addressed in his 2008 inmate grievance, so that his\nlawsuit is timely.\n\n    On February 19, 2010, a magistrate judge filed Findings\nand Recommendations concerning the defendants’ motion to\ndismiss. The magistrate judge found that the applicable\nstatute of limitations for a § 1983 claim, using California’s\nstatute of limitations for personal injury actions, was two\nyears, and that the statute of limitations was tolled while the\nprisoner exhausted administrative remedies. The magistrate\njudge dismissed any contention that an amendment of the\npertinent prison regulation in 2007 affected the accrual\nanalysis, because the portion of the regulation preventing\nPouncil from having conjugal visits had been in place\nunchanged since 1996. The magistrate judge construed\nPouncil’s claims as, in essence, a constitutional challenge to\nthe prison regulation prohibiting LWOP inmates from having\nconjugal family visits and concluded that this regulation\nremained the same and was applicable to Pouncil without\nregard to whom he was married at the time. In other words,\nthe magistrate judge concluded, Pouncil’s claims were not\ntied to a particular spouse. Thus, the magistrate judge\nconcluded that Pouncil knew from his experience in 2002 that\nhe would not be allowed conjugal visitation with any wife so\nlong as he remained an LWOP inmate. The magistrate judge\nalso dismissed application of a continuing violation theory,\nbecause the denial of Pouncil’s request for a conjugal visit in\n2008 was simply an effect of the regulation that Pouncil had\n\f8                     POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\noriginally challenged in 2002. Therefore, the magistrate\njudge recommended that the defendants’ motion to dismiss be\ngranted.\n\n    Pouncil filed objections to the magistrate judge’s Findings\nand Recommendations on March 12, 2010, and,\nconsequently, on March 31, 2010, a district judge2 conducted\na de novo review of the case. The district judge declined to\nadopt the magistrate judge’s Findings and Recommendations.\nIn the district judge’s view, Pouncil’s complaint did not\nallege an injury from the denial of his request for conjugal\nvisits with his ex-wife in 2002, but an injury from the denial\nof his request for conjugal visits with his current wife on\nAugust 1, 2008. The district judge also concluded that the\n2008 denial constituted an individual, actionable injury upon\nwhich Pouncil had standing to bring suit, so that his action\ndid not accrue until his request was denied on August 1,\n2008.\n\n    The district judge found that the two-year statute of\nlimitations for a § 1983 claim would not run until August of\n2010, and that the four-year statute of limitations for a\nRLUIPA claim would not run until August of 2012. Thus, he\nfound that Pouncil’s claims, filed in 2009, were timely. The\ndistrict judge cited, without comment, Henderson v.\nHubbard, 2010 WL 599886 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 18, 2010), in\nwhich another district judge in the same district adopted a\ndifferent magistrate judge’s findings and recommendation to\ndismiss a similar claim on timeliness grounds. The district\ncourt did, however, grant the motion to dismiss as to\ndefendant Foston, because defendant Foston was not in any\n\n  2\n     The Honorable Lawrence K. K arlton, District Judge for the U.S.\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of California.\n\f                          POUNCIL V . TILTON                               9\n\nposition to implement the injunctive relief that Pouncil was\nrequesting, and substituted the current Secretary of the\nCDCR, Matthew Cate, for defendant Tilton, who had retired.3\n\n     On June 10, 2010, on defendant Tilton’s motion, the\ndistrict judge certified for interlocutory appeal the question of\nwhether Pouncil’s claims are barred by the statute of\nlimitations.4 This case was stayed in the district court until a\nmandate issues from this court. This court granted Tilton’s\nsubsequent petition for permission to appeal the certified\nquestion of whether Pouncil’s claims are barred by the statute\nof limitations and directed appointment of pro bono counsel\nto represent Pouncil on appeal.\n\n                       2. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n                      a. Applicable Standards\n\n    Pouncil asserts claims pursuant to the RLUIPA and the\nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution.5 The\nRLUIPA provides, in relevant part, that “[n]o government\nshall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of\n\n\n 3\n   Like the parties, for the sake of simplicity, we will continue to identify\nthe defendant-appellant as Tilton, rather than Cate.\n\n     4\n    The district judge declined Tilton’s request that he also certify for\ninterlocutory appeal the scope of the lawsuit and who is a party.\n\n     5\n    Tilton argues that the only claim on which Pouncil was allowed to\nproceed, after initial review, was his RLUIPA claim. However, the\ndistrict judge treated both Pouncil’s RLUIPA claim and his First\nAmendment claim as viable for purposes of the statute of limitations\nanalysis, and we will do the same, taking no position on whether Pouncil’s\nFirst Amendment claim is also properly before the court.\n\f10                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\na person residing in or confined to an institution . . . even if\nthe burden results from a rule of general applicability,” unless\nthe government demonstrates that the burden is “in\nfurtherance of a compelling governmental interest” and is\n“the least restrictive means of furthering that . . . interest.”\n42 U.S.C. § 2000cc-1(a). The First Amendment of the United\nStates Constitution prohibits government restrictions on the\nfundamental right to freely exercise one’s religious beliefs.\nSee U.S. CONST . amend. I. Section 1983 of title 42 of the\nUnited States Code provides a cause of action against any\nperson who, acting under the color of state law, abridges\nrights created by the laws of the United States. “[F]ederal\ncourts must take cognizance of the valid constitutional claims\nof prison inmates.” Turner v. Safley, 482 U.S. 78, 84 (1987).\n\n    The parties agree that, because there is no specified\nstatute of limitations for an action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nthe federal courts look to the law of the state in which the\ncause of action arose and apply the state law of limitations\ngoverning an analogous cause of action. See Wallace v. Kato,\n549 U.S. 384, 387 (2007). The parties also agree that the\nanalogous cause of action in this case is California’s personal\ninjury action, which has a two-year statute of limitations. See\nMaldonado v. Harris, 370 F.3d 945, 954-955 (9th Cir. 2004).\nSimilarly, they agree that the RLUIPA does not contain its\nown statute of limitations period, but that civil claims, such\nas RLUIPA claims, “arising under an Act of Congress\nenacted after [December 1, 1990],” have a four-year period\nof limitations. See Jones v. R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co.,\n541 U.S. 369, 382 (2004).\n\n    What the parties do dispute is when the statutes of\nlimitations on Pouncil’s claims began to run. A statute of\nlimitations begins to run on the date on which the plaintiff’s\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                       11\n\nclaim “accrues.” Lukovsky v. City and County of San\nFrancisco, 535 F.3d 1044, 1048 (9th Cir. 2008). Federal law\ndetermines when a cause of action for a Section 1983 claim\naccrues and, hence, when the statute of limitations begins to\nrun. See Wallace, 549 U.S. at 388. Under federal law,\naccrual occurs when the plaintiff has a complete and present\ncause of action and may file a suit to obtain relief. Id.; see\nalso Kimes v. Stone, 84 F.3d 1121, 1128 (9th Cir. 1996)\n(“Under federal law, ‘the limitations period accrues when a\nparty knows or has reason to know of the injury’ which is the\nbasis of the cause of action.” (quoting Golden Gate Hotel\nAss’n v. San Francisco, 18 F.3d 1482, 1486 (9th Cir. 1994))).\nAn action ordinarily accrues on the date of the injury. Ward\nv. Westinghouse Canada, Inc., 32 F.3d 1405, 1407 (9th Cir.\n1994). A federal claim accrues when the plaintiff knows or\nhas reason to know of the injury that is the basis of the action.\nBagley v. CMC Real Estate Corp., 923 F.2d 758, 760 (9th\nCir. 1991) (quoting Trotter v. Int’l Longshoreman’s and\nWarehouseman’s Union, 704 F.2d 1141, 1143 (9th Cir.\n1983)).\n\n     When the statute of limitations begins to run for an action\nat law is reviewed de novo. See Oja v. U.S. Army Corps. of\nEngineers, 440 F.3d 1122, 1127 (9th Cir. 2006); see also Orr\nv. Bank of Am., NT & SA, 285 F.3d 764, 780 (9th Cir. 2002).\nWhether a claim is barred by the statute of limitations is also\nreviewed de novo. Orr, 285 F.3d at 780. However, “[t]he\nquestion of when a claim accrues is a fact intensive inquiry,\nand we have held that a district court’s factual finding\nconcerning when a claim accrues is entitled to deferential\nreview.” Hells Canyon Pres. Council v. U.S. Forest Serv.,\n403 F.3d 683, 691 (9th Cir. 2005).\n\f12                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\n               b. Arguments Of The Parties\n\n    Tilton asserts that Pouncil is now challenging a regulation\nthat he originally challenged in 2002, when he was married\nto his first wife, so that his claims accrued in May 2002, when\nthe warden of the MCSP notified him that, in accordance with\nprovisions of the California Code of Regulations, he would\nnot be permitted to have conjugal visitation with any spouse\nbecause of his life sentence. Tilton relies on Knox v. Davis,\n260 F.3d 1009, 1014 (9th Cir. 2001), for the proposition that\n“[a]ll of the allegations in the complaint regarding Pouncil’s\ninability to have sex with his second wife are merely the\ndelayed, but inevitable, consequence of the original decision\nthat he is subject to regulations preventing LWOP inmates\nfrom participating in conjugal visits.” Appellant’s Brief at\n16.\n\n    In contrast, Pouncil argues that he is challenging the\ndenial of his 2008 application for a conjugal visit with his\nsecond wife. Pouncil relies on National Railroad Passenger\nCorp. v. Morgan, 536 U.S. 101, 113 (2002), to contend that\nthe August 2008 denial of his request for a conjugal visit with\nhis second wife was a discrete act that started a new clock\nrunning for the filing of his claims.\n\n    In reply, Tilton argues that Pouncil’s argument relies on\na transformation of his claims from challenges to the\nregulation into challenges to the denial of a specific request\nfor a conjugal visit. Tilton points out that Pouncil’s\nComplaint never even mentions that he had been denied a\nconjugal visit in 2008.            Instead, it challenges\n“implementation” of a regulation preventing inmates serving\nLWOP from participating in conjugal visits.\n\f                      POUNCIL V . TILTON                       13\n\n   We conclude that when Pouncil’s claims accrued\ndepends, in part, on what those claims are.\n\n            c. The Nature Of Pouncil’s Claims\n\n    Pouncil filed this action pro se. We have repeatedly\nstated that “[w]e construe pro se complaints liberally.” Silva\nv. Di Vittorio, 658 F.3d 1090, 1101 (9th Cir. 2011); Hamilton\nv. Brown, 630 F.3d 889, 893 (9th Cir. 2011). This rule\nprotects the rights of pro se litigants to self-representation and\nmeaningful access to the courts, Rand v. Rowland, 154 F.3d\n952, 957 (9th Cir. 1998), and we have recognized that it is\n“‘particularly important in civil rights cases.’” Johnson v.\nState of California, 207 F.3d 650, 653 (9th Cir. 2000)\n(quoting Ferdik v. Bonzelet, 963 F.2d 1258, 1261 (9th Cir.\n1992)).\n\n     Tilton is correct that Pouncil nowhere mentions the 2008\ndenial of his application for a conjugal visit in his pro se\nComplaint. On the other hand, neither does Pouncil mention\nthe 2002 denial of his application for a conjugal visit with his\nfirst wife. The question is whether his failure to identify the\n2008 denial as the specific basis for his claims is dispositive\nof the nature of his claims. We think it is not, giving\nPouncil’s pro se Complaint the liberal construction to which\nit is entitled. See Silva, 658 F.3d at 1101; Johnson, 207 F.3d\nat 653.\n\n    First, Tilton is correct that Pouncil stated in his Complaint\nthat he had brought the lawsuit against the CDCR “for\nimplementing a rule to the California Code of Regulation\n(3177(b)(2)) that violates Petitioner[’s] Constitutional right\nto practice his religion and be married as a Muslim under the\nRLUIPA act.”           Complaint at 4 (emphasis added).\n\f14                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\nNevertheless, we do not agree with Tilton’s argument that\nclaims based on “implementing” a rule equate with claims\nbased on “enacting” or “adopting” the rule. Appellant’s\nReply at 2l-23. A liberal construction of Pouncil’s Complaint\nwould just as reasonably read “implementing” the rule to\nmean “applying” the rule to him. See, e.g., MERRIAM\nWEBSTER ’S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 583 (10th ed. 1995)\n(defining “implement,” inter alia, as “CARRY OUT ,\nACCOMPLISH ; esp. to give practical effect to and ensure of\nactual fulfillment by concrete measures”); ROGET ’S II: THE\nN E W T H E S A U R U S , www.educat i o n . ya h o o . c o m /\nreference/thesaurus/?=implement (last accessed May 15,\n2012) (identifying “implement” and “apply” as synonyms of\n“use” and identifying “implement” as a synonym of “apply”).\nSecond, in his Complaint, Pouncil explains that he has\nexhausted administrative remedies by citing the levels of\nreview and summarizing the results of those reviews in a\nmanner that plainly matches the administrative steps of his\n2008 grievance, the only grievance involving a third level of\nadministrative review. See Complaint at 2. Third, Pouncil\ncites only the version of the rule as it was recodified in 2006\nas § 3177, not as it existed in 2002, when it was codified as\n§ 3174. Liberally construed, Pouncil’s Complaint suggests\nthat the focus of Pouncil’s challenges is the application of the\nrule to him in 2008.\n\n    Tilton argues that, by suing the Secretary of the CDCR\nfor injunctive relief, Pouncil has also necessarily challenged\nthe regulation itself, not the denial of his request for a\nconjugal visit in 2008. Tilton points out that he was not\npersonally involved in the specific denial of Pouncil’s\nrequest. This argument is too clever by half, in the context of\npro se pleadings, because it relies on precisely the kind of\ntechnical requirements that liberal construction of pro se\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                      15\n\npleadings is intended to mitigate. See Wyatt v. Terhune,\n315 F.3d 1108, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n     It also is not entirely clear whether the injunctive relief\nthat Pouncil seeks is limited to relief for him from the\nchallenged regulation, or relief for all LWOP prisoners. In\nhis Complaint, Pouncil sought the following relief:\n“Reinstate Family Visits for Lifers, and Life without the\npossibility of parole Inmate [sic] so I can fulfill my duties\nreligiously to my wife, and guide my children in my family\nwith direct understanding of my faith.” Complaint at 2\n(emphasis added). This statement ambiguously refers to all\n“Lifers,” but only to one LWOP “Inmate,” and to relief\nallowing Pouncil to fulfill his religious duties. When read in\nthe context of Pouncil’s requests for relief in the\nadministrative proceedings, however, it appears that Pouncil\nseeks relief from application of the regulation to him. In his\nAugust 4, 2008, Appeal Form, Pouncil requested the\nfollowing action as relief: “I would like my family visiting\nprevilleges [sic] be reinstated and to stay as such, until I’m\nset free where I can continue to practice my Religious beliefs,\nand be an upstanding citizen.” In a “Second Level Appeal\nResponse,” the warden of the MCSP characterized Pouncil’s\nrequest for relief to be “to have his right to Family Visiting\nrestored to him.” The “Director’s Level Response” also\ncharacterized Pouncil’s request for relief to be “that his\nfamily visiting privileges be reinstated and to stay as such\nuntil the appellant is released.” Thus, the relief that Pouncil\nrequests does not necessarily demonstrate that he has asserted\nchallenges to the regulation itself, rather than claims based on\ndenial of his request for a conjugal visit in 2008.\n\n  Moreover, Tilton (or his successor), as Secretary of the\nCDCR, is the proper defendant on a claim for prospective\n\f16                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\ninjunctive relief from a prison regulation, because he would\nbe responsible for ensuring that injunctive relief was carried\nout, even if he was not personally involved in the decision\ngiving rise to Pouncil’s claims. See, e.g., Gonzalez v.\nFeinerman, 663 F.3d 311, 315 (7th Cir. 2011) (the prison\nwarden was the proper defendant for a claim of injunctive\nrelief, notwithstanding his lack of personal involvement in the\nchallenged conduct, because he would be responsible for\nensuring that the injunctive relief was carried out). Tilton\ncannot raise qualified immunity to such a claim. See Vance\nv. Barrett, 345 F.3d 1083, 1091 n.10 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting,\n“[A] defense of qualified immunity is not available for\nprospective injunctive relief.” (citing Presbyterian Church\n(U.S.A.) v. United States, 870 F.2d 518, 527 (9th Cir. 1989)).\nThus, Pouncil’s prayer for injunctive relief in no way\ndemonstrates conclusively that his claims are not premised on\ndenial of his application for a conjugal visit in 2008, nor does\nit demonstrate that Pouncil’s appellate counsel has\nreconfigured his claims to attempt to evade the time-bar that\nTilton asserts. Rather, liberally construed, we read Pouncil’s\nclaims to be challenges to the denial of his 2008 request for\na conjugal visit.\n\n      d. Discrete Act Versus Inevitable Consequence\n\n    Once Pouncil’s claims are understood as arising from the\n2008 denial of his application for a conjugal visit, the\nquestion is, when did such claims accrue? What makes this\nquestion particularly daunting here is that two different lines\nof authority appear to lead to different conclusions. Tilton\nrelies on one line of authority to argue that, even if Pouncil is\nchallenging the 2008 denial of his request for a conjugal visit,\nthat denial is simply the inevitable consequence of the 2002\ndenial of his first request for a conjugal visit pursuant to the\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                      17\n\nsame regulation. Relying on a different line of authority,\nPouncil contends that the 2008 denial was a discrete act,\nnotwithstanding a prior denial pursuant to the same\nregulation.\n\n   i. The Ricks/Knox line\n\n    Appellants rely on Knox, 260 F.3d at 1014, for the\nproposition that “all of the allegations in the complaint\nregarding Pouncil’s inability to have sex with his second wife\nare merely the delayed, but inevitable, consequence of the\noriginal decision that he is subject to regulations preventing\nLWOP inmates from participating in conjugal visits.”\nAppellant’s Brief at 16. Tilton argues that Pouncil’s cause of\naction, therefore, accrued on the date that he received the\ndenial of his first request for conjugal visits, in May of 2002.\nAppellant’s Brief at 13.\n\n    Knox involved an attorney who, after receiving a letter on\nJanuary 20, 1996, revoking all of her legal mail and visitation\nrights to all inmates at all penal institutions in California,\ncontinued to receive denials of these rights between January\n20, 1996, and July 21, 1997, when she filed suit. Knox,\n260 F.3d at 1011-1012. The denials subsequent to the\nJanuary 20, 1996, letter, relied on the suspension\nimplemented in that letter as the basis for denying Knox\neither legal visitation or correspondence privileges with\ninmates. Id. at 1012. Knox conceded that her § 1983 claim\naccrued on January 20, 1996. Id. at 1013. She argued,\nhowever, “that each time that she was denied access to one of\nher clients housed in a CDCR facility, a new cause of action\nar[ose] under the continuing violation theory.” Id.\n\f18                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\n    This court explained that, since Knox had not alleged a\nsystem or practice of discrimination, the only way that she\ncould hope to show a continuing violation was to “‘state facts\nsufficient . . . [to] support[ ] a determination that the alleged\ndiscriminatory acts related closely enough to constitute a\ncontinuing violation, and that one or more of the acts falls\nwithin the limitations period.’” Id. (quoting DeGrassi v. City\nof Glendora, 207 F.3d 636, 645 (9th Cir. 2000)). This court\nrejected Knox’s continuing violation argument, however,\nbecause this court had “repeatedly held that a mere\ncontinuing impact from past violations is not actionable.” Id.\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis in\nthe original). This court held,\n\n        Knox’s cause of action accrued when she\n        received Tristan’s permanent and complete\n        suspension letter on January 20, 1996. The\n        continuing violation doctrine is inapplicable\n        because Knox has failed to establish that a\n        new violation occurs each time she is denied\n        her visitation or mail privileges. Rather, the\n        CDC’s subsequent and repeated denials of\n        Knox’s privileges with her clients is merely\n        the continuing effect of the original\n        suspension.\n\nKnox, 260 F.3d at 1013.\n\n   This court concluded that the outcome in Knox was\ncompelled by the United States Supreme Court’s decision in\nDelaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250 (1980). See\nKnox, 260 F.3d at 1013-14. In Ricks, the Supreme Court\nconsidered whether a college professor had timely\ncomplained under Title VII that he had been denied academic\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                       19\n\ntenure because of his national origin. 449 U.S. at 252. Ricks\nhad received a letter on June 26, 1974, informing him of the\ndenial of tenure, but renewing his contract until the end of the\n1974-75 school year. Id. at 253-54. The district court had\nheld that the statute of limitations began to run on Ricks’s\nclaim on the date he had been notified that he would be\noffered a 1-year “terminal” contract, but the Third Circuit\nCourt of Appeals reversed, concluding that the statute of\nlimitations did not begin to run until Ricks’s “terminal”\ncontract expired on June 30, 1975. Id. at 255.\n\n    The Supreme Court found that Ricks had not alleged any\ndiscriminatory acts that continued until, or that occurred at\nthe time of, the actual termination of his contract. Id. at 257.\nTo the contrary, the Court concluded, the “termination of\nemployment at Delaware State [wa]s a delayed, but\ninevitable, consequence of the denial of tenure.” Id. at 257-\n58. In short, “the only alleged discrimination occurred—and\nthe filing limitations period therefore commenced—at the\ntime the tenure decision was made and communicated to\nRicks.” Id. at 258. This was so, “even though one of the\neffects of the denial of tenure—the eventual loss of a teaching\nposition—did not occur until later.” Id. (emphasis in the\noriginal). The emphasis in the statute of limitations analysis,\nthe Court concluded, is not on effects, but “is [upon] whether\nany present violation exists.’” Id. (quoting United Air Lines,\nInc. v. Evans, 431 U.S. 553, 558 (1977), with emphasis in the\noriginal).\n\n    This court explained that the attorney plaintiff in Knox,\nlike the college professor plaintiff in Ricks, “had notice of all\nthe wrongful acts she wished to challenge at the time of the\nsuspension letter because the letter informed her that she was\npermanently denied all visitation or mail privileges.” Knox,\n\f20                  POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\n260 F.3d at 1014. Similarly, Tilton argues—not without\nsome appeal—that Pouncil also had notice of all the wrongful\nacts that he wished to challenge at the time that he received\nthe 2002 notice of denial of his request for a conjugal visit\nbecause that denial informed him that he was permanently\nbarred from conjugal visits as an inmate serving LWOP.\n\n     ii. The Morgan/Cherosky line\n\n    There is, however, another line of authority that appears\nto lead to a conflicting result—i.e., to the conclusion that\nPouncil’s claims arising from the denial of his request for\nconjugal visits in 2008 are timely, notwithstanding the prior\ndenial of a request for conjugal visits in 2002.\n\n     Subsequent to Knox, the United States Supreme Court\ndecided Morgan, 536 U.S. 101. In Morgan, which, like\nRicks, was an employment discrimination case, the plaintiff\nfiled a charge of discrimination and retaliation against his\nemployer. 536 U.S. at 105. Some of the allegedly\ndiscriminatory acts about which Morgan complained occurred\nwithin 300 days of the time that he filed his charge with the\nEEOC—that is, within the 300-day limitations period for\nfiling such a charge—but many took place prior to that time\nperiod. Id. at 106. Morgan argued that the various acts,\nincluding those that occurred prior to the 300-day time\nperiod, were part of “an unlawful employment practice” that\nconstituted an ongoing violation. Id. at 110. What is\ninstructive here, however, is not the Morgan Court’s analysis\nof the continuing violation doctrine, but its explanation of\nwhat constitutes a “discrete act” that starts the running of a\nlimitations period.\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                       21\n\n    The Court derived several principles from its prior cases,\nincluding Ricks, Evans, Electrical Workers v. Robbins &\nMyers, Inc., 429 U.S. 229 (1976), and Bazemore v. Friday,\n478 U.S. 385 (1986) (per curiam):\n\n        First, discrete discriminatory acts are not\n        actionable if time barred, even when they are\n        related to acts alleged in timely filed charges.\n        Each discrete discriminatory act starts a new\n        clock for filing charges alleging that act. The\n        charge, therefore, must be filed within the\n        180- or 300-day time period after the discrete\n        discriminatory act occurred. The existence of\n        past acts and the employee’s prior knowledge\n        of their occurrence, however, does not bar\n        employees from filing charges about related\n        discrete acts so long as the acts are\n        independently discriminatory and charges\n        addressing those acts are themselves timely\n        filed. Nor does the statute bar an employee\n        from using the prior acts as background\n        evidence in support of a timely claim.\n\nMorgan, 536 U.S. at 113. Thus, Morgan instructs that a court\nmust determine whether a claim is based on an independently\nwrongful, discrete act, and if it is, then the claim accrues, and\nthe statute of limitations begins to run, from the date of that\ndiscrete act, even if there was a prior, related past act.\n\n    In Cherosky v. Henderson, 330 F.3d 1243 (9th Cir. 2003),\nthis Court discussed the application of Morgan to claims by\nemployees of the United States Postal Service that the Postal\nService had violated their rights pursuant to the\nRehabilitation Act by denying their requests for respirators.\n\f22                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\nIn order to bring a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, a\nfederal employee was required to consult with an EEOC\ncounselor within 45 days of the effective date of the action.\nSee Cherosky, 330 F.3d at 1245. Failure to comply with the\n45-day consultation requirement was fatal to a federal\nemployee’s claim. Id. The employees in Cherosky did not\ninitiate contact with an EEOC officer within 45 days of the\ndenial of their requests to wear respirators and could not point\nto any discrete, discriminatory act that occurred within the\n45-day period. Id. at 1245-46. The employees argued,\nhowever, that their claims were timely under the continuing\nviolations doctrine. Id. at 1246.\n\n    In Cherosky, this court, relying on Morgan, determined\nthat discrete acts, such as the denials of the employees’\nrequests for respirators, are only timely where such acts\noccurred within the limitations period, but that the postal\nemployees had not alleged that any discriminatory acts had\noccurred after the initial denials, which were outside of the\nlimitations period. See id. This court quoted with approval\nthe district court’s observation that the “‘heart of plaintiffs’\ncomplaint does not stem from the policy regarding the use of\nrespirators, but rather from the individualized decisions that\nresulted from implementation of a policy originating from\nOSHA.’” Id. at 1247. The court concluded that “these\nindividualized decisions are best characterized as discrete\nacts, rather than as a pattern or practice of discrimination.”\nId.\n\n    The Cherosky court compared the “wrong” alleged by the\npostal employees, the denial of each application for a\nrespirator, to the “wrong” in Bazemore, 478 U.S. at 395, the\nreceipt of a periodic paycheck pursuant to a discriminatory\nsalary policy. The Cherosky court explained, “Just as the\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                     23\n\nwrong in Bazemore accrued each time the salary policy was\nimplemented, the alleged wrong here occurred and accrued\nwhen the policy was invoked to deny an individual\nemployee’s request.” Cherosky, 330 F.3d at 1247.\n\n    Thus, Cherosky and Morgan suggest that each time a\npolicy is invoked to deny an individual plaintiff’s request, an\nindependently wrongful, discrete act occurs, a claim accrues,\nand the limitations period begins to run. Pouncil argues that\nthis is precisely what occurred in 2008: The 2008 denial of\nhis individual request for a conjugal visit was independently\nwrongful, and his claims accrued at that time, even though the\nsame regulation invoked to deny the 2008 request had been\ninvoked to deny his 2002 request for a conjugal visit.\n\n   iii. Reconciling the lines of authority\n\n    In Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., Inc.,\n550 U.S. 618 (2007), superseded by statute, Lilly Ledbetter\nFair Pay Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-2, 123 Stat 5., another\nemployment discrimination case, the Supreme Court clarified\nhow the “discrete acts” language of Morgan could be\nreconciled with its prior case law, including Ricks and Evans.\nThe Court explained,\n\n           The instruction provided by Evans, Ricks,\n       Lorance [v. AT & T Tech., Inc., 490 U.S. 900\n       (1989)], and Morgan is clear. The EEOC\n       charging period is triggered when a discrete\n       unlawful practice takes place.          A new\n       violation does not occur, and a new charging\n       period does not commence, upon the\n       occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory\n       acts that entail adverse effects resulting from\n\f24                  POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\n       the past discrimination. But of course, if an\n       employer engages in a series of acts each of\n       which is intentionally discriminatory, then a\n       fresh violation takes place when each act is\n       committed. See Morgan, supra, at 113, 122\n       S. Ct. 2061.\n\nLedbetter, 550 U.S. at 628. Although the Supreme Court’s\ndecision in Ledbetter was later superseded by statute, that\ndecision nevertheless clarified the distinction between\nLedbetter’s paycheck case and Bazemore’s paycheck case, on\nthe ground that, in order to state a “present violation,”\nLedbetter would have to allege a current intentionally\ndiscriminatory decision that accompanied a current action,\nwhich she had failed to do. See Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 633-37\n(citing Bazemore, 478 U.S. at 396-97).\n\n    This court has applied the “discrete act” language of\nMorgan, as explained in Ledbetter, in a prisoner rights case\nbrought pursuant to § 1983. See Ngo v. Woodford, 539 F.3d\n1108, 1109-10 (9th Cir. 2008). In Ngo, a prison inmate\nserving a life sentence was informed, on December 22, 2000,\nafter an administrative hearing, that he would be released\nfrom administrative segregation, but that he could not\nparticipate in “special programs.” 539 F.3d at 1109. Three\nmonths later, Ngo asked the deputy warden if he could play\non the prison’s baseball team and whether he “was entitled to\nparticipate in any and all special programs.” Id. The deputy\nwarden informed Ngo that he could participate in “any\nrecreational programs” and that the prison’s community\nresources manager was authorized “to review [Ngo’s] request\nto participate in any other program.” Id. Pursuant to a prison\nregulation, prisoners were required to “appeal within 15\nworking days of the event or decision being appealed.” Id.\n\f                    POUNCIL V . TILTON                     25\n\nNgo did not submit a formal appeal to the prison’s Appeal\nCoordinator until approximately six months after the hearing\ndecision and approximately three months after he received the\nresponse to his second request. See id.\n\n    This court rejected Ngo’s argument that the December 22,\n2000, order resulted in a continuing denial of his\nconstitutional rights, so that the 15-day limitations period\nrestarted each day that he was unable to participate in prison\nspecial programs:\n\n       We rejected this argument in Knox v. Davis,\n       260 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir. 2001). Knox held that\n       a limitations period began running on the date\n       of a prison board’s initial determination, when\n       a prisoner “had notice of all of the wrongful\n       acts she wished to challenge at the time of the\n       [initial determination].”        Id. at 1014.\n       Rejecting a continuing violation theory, we\n       explained that any continuing effects are\n       “nothing more than the delayed, but\n       inevitable, consequence of the [initial\n       determination].” Id. And in the context of\n       employment discrimination, the Supreme\n       Court recently emphasized that limitations\n       periods begin to run when the “discrete act”\n       adverse to the plaintiff occurs—“not from the\n       date when the effects of [that act] were felt.”\n       Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co.,\n       550 U.S. 618, 127 S. Ct. 2162, 2168, 167 L.\n       Ed. 2d 982 (2007). Here, the December 22\n       determination is the discrete act adverse to\n       Ngo, so the 15-working-day limitations period\n       began running against him on that date rather\n\f26                    POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\n        than on the date he actually felt the effects of\n        the order.\n\nNgo, 539 F.3d at 1109-10 (also concluding that the December\n22 order gave the prisoner “ample notice” that he would be\nbarred from special programs and that the partial withdrawal\nof that restriction by the deputy warden allowing the prisoner\nto participate in recreation activities did not change that fact).\n\n    Thus, the apparent conflict between the Ricks/Knox line\nof authority and the Morgan/Cherosky line of authority is not\na conflict at all; rather, the two lines of authority identify\ndifferent circumstances that lead to different accrual dates for\nclaims. The proper question, therefore, is whether, factually,\nthis is a Ricks/Knox case or a Morgan/Cherosky case. Put\nanother way, does this case involve the delayed, but\ninevitable, consequence of the original 2002 decision, making\nPouncil’s claims arising from the 2008 decision time-barred,\nor an independently wrongful, discrete act in 2008, which\nbegan the running of the statute of limitations anew,\nnotwithstanding the prior denial pursuant to essentially the\nsame regulation in 2002? As this is a factual question, the\ndistrict court’s resolution is entitled to deferential review.\nSee Hells Canyon Pres. Council, 403 F.3d at 691.\n\n                        e. Application\n\n    We affirm the district judge’s finding that the denial of\nPouncil’s request for a conjugal visit in 2008 is a separate,\ndiscrete act, rather than a mere effect of the 2002 denial. This\nis so, because Pouncil alleges, and the record supports, that\nthe second denial is a stand-alone violation of Pouncil’s First\nAmendment and RLUIPA rights from which the statute of\nlimitations runs anew. See Morgan, 536 U.S. at 113. The\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                       27\n\n2008 denial is an independently wrongful “present violation,”\nbecause Pouncil’s claims do not rely on any acts that occurred\nbefore the statute of limitations period to establish a violation\nof his right to free exercise of religion or his rights under\nRLUIPA. See Bazemore, 478 U.S. at 396-97, n.6 (Brennan,\nconcurring in part) (citing Evans, 431 U.S. at 558, for the\nproposition that the “critical question” is whether any\n“present violation” exists, and evaluating whether the\nplaintiff’s claims of wrongfulness were “present violations”\nby considering whether they relied on prior acts). Unlike\nLedbetter, who was unable to point to a later act that fully\nestablished the alleged violation, Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 629,\nPouncil does point to a later act, the 2008 denial, that fully\nestablishes a First Amendment and RLUIPA violation,\nwithout reaching back to the 2002 denial to establish a\nnecessary element of his claims. To put it another way, the\n2008 denial relied on a new application of the regulation to a\nnew request for a conjugal visit, it did not rely on the 2002\ndenial as barring all subsequent requests for conjugal visits.\n\n     In contrast, the cases on which Tilton relies each lacked\nany allegation or showing of a subsequent and separately\nwrongful act. For example, in Ricks, the college professor\nfailed to allege or show a subsequent and separately wrongful\nact after notice of the denial of tenure. See Ricks, 449 U.S. at\n257-58 (determining that the only wrongful decision alleged\nwas a wrongful denial of tenure and not an additional\nwrongful discharge one year later). While the Supreme Court\nin Ricks noted that the “proper focus is upon the time of the\ndiscriminatory acts, not upon the time at which the\nconsequences of the acts became most painful,” it did so\nbased upon the finding that Ricks had pleaded only one\ndiscrete wrongful act, the denial of tenure. See id. at 258\n(citing Abramson v. University of Hawaii, 594 F.2d 202, 209\n\f28                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\n(9th Cir. 1979)) (emphasis added). In contrast, Pouncil has\nalleged a second, discrete wrongful act—the 2008 denial.\n\n    The failure to allege a subsequent, independently\nwrongful act also explains the holdings in Knox, Cherosky,\nand Ngo. In Knox, each of the denials subsequent to the\nJanuary 20, 1996, letter advising Knox that her legal mail and\nvisitation rights had been revoked relied on that letter as the\nbasis for denying Knox either legal visitation or\ncorrespondence privileges with inmates. Knox, 260 F.3d at\n1012. Moreover, Knox acknowledged that her claim had\naccrued upon receipt of the letter suspending her visitation\nand correspondence rights. See id. at 1013. Thus, the court\nin Knox was simply never asked to consider whether each\nsubsequent denial was a separate violation of her rights, only\nwhether each subsequent denial was part of a continuing\nviolation. Id. Here, in contrast, Pouncil specifically asserts\nthat the 2008 denial of his request for a conjugal visit was a\ndiscrete act, and the 2008 denial relied on a new application\nof the regulation to a new request for a conjugal visit, rather\nthan on the 2002 denial as barring all subsequent requests for\nconjugal visits.\n\n    In Cherosky, the employees did not point to any discrete,\ndiscriminatory act that occurred within the period of\nlimitations. See Cherosky, 330 F.3d at 1245. The court in\nCherosky concluded, however, that if an employee’s new\nrequest for a respirator were denied pursuant to the same\npolicy, the time period would begin to run anew, despite an\nearlier denial. See id. at 1248. The situation contemplated in\nCherosky is exactly the situation here: Pouncil’s request for\na conjugal visit with his wife in 2008 was denied pursuant to\nthe same policy as the denial in 2002, so that the time period\nshould be found to run anew from the later denial, despite an\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                       29\n\nearlier denial. In other words, the “heart” of Pouncil’s\nclaims, like the “heart” of the plaintiffs’ complaint in\nCherosky, “does not stem from the policy regarding the\n[denial of conjugal visits to LWOP prisoners], but rather from\nthe individualized decisions that resulted from\nimplementation of a policy originating from [the CDCR].”\nCf. id. at 1247. As in Cherosky, “these individualized\ndecisions are best characterized as discrete acts, rather than as\na pattern or practice of discrimination.” Id. The difference\nbetween Pouncil’s claim and the plaintiffs’ claims in\nCherosky is that his individualized decision in 2008 fell\nwithin the limitations period.\n\n    Again, in Ngo, the plaintiff did not allege a second\nadverse decision. Instead, Ngo alleged one decision\nannounced at the conclusion of a hearing, that he would be\nunable to participate in “special programs.” That decision\nwas followed by Ngo’s request to participate in baseball,\nwhich was granted.         Ngo’s additional query about\nparticipation in other “special programs” was deferred until\na further request was actually made. See Ngo, 539 F.3d at\n1109. Thus, Ngo involved one adverse decision followed by\none positive decision and a statement that no decision would\nbe made regarding other matters until a specific request was\nmade. Id.\n\n     In contrast to the plaintiffs in Rick, Knox, Cherosky, and\nNgo, the district judge found that Pouncil has alleged a\nsecond adverse decision that is independently wrongful\nwithin the limitations period. In addition to showing proper\ndeference to the district court’s factual finding that Pouncil\nhad alleged a current violation and injury, see Hells Canyon\nPres. Council, 403 F.3d at 691, our determination that the\n2008 denial of Pouncil’s request for conjugal visits was a\n\f30                        POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\nseparate, discrete, and independently wrongful act is\nconsistent with prior cases analyzing the application of\nMorgan’s “discrete act” language. See, e.g., Cherosky, 330\nF.3d at 1245-47; Ngo, 539 F.3d at 1109-1110. Those cases\nlead to the conclusion that each wrongful act starts a new\nclock for filing a claim alleging that act. Such a\ndetermination also fits with Morgan’s rule that the existence\nof past acts and the claimant’s prior knowledge of their\noccurrence does not bar a claimant from filing claims about\nrelated discrete acts, so long as the subsequent acts are\nindependently wrongful and claims alleging those acts are\nthemselves timely filed. Morgan, 536 U.S. at 113.6\n\n    While Knox may, at first blush, appear to support a\nfinding that the second denial was merely a consequence of\nthe first denial, upon a closer reading, it does not support or\nrequire such a finding, because it is distinguishable for the\nreasons stated above. Furthermore, Knox does not require the\nconclusion that multiple denials of rights pursuant to the same\nprison policy are necessarily just effects of the original\ndiscriminatory act, because Knox was decided before the\nSupreme Court’s development of the discrete act analysis in\nMorgan, and also prior to this court’s application of the\ndiscrete act analysis to a prisoner’s § 1983 case in Ngo.\n\n   Finally, the district court’s decision in the similar case of\nHenderson v. Hubbard, 2010 WL 599886 (E.D. Cal. Feb. 18,\n2010) (slip op.) (findings and recommendations of magistrate\njudge), is neither binding nor persuasive. In Henderson, the\n\n\n  6\n    Further, although we need not decide the issue, in those cases where\nthe filing period is not jurisdictional, the doctrines of estoppel, waiver, and\nlaches may still operate to ameliorate the specter of any excesses that may\nbe raised by this opinion. See Morgan, 536 U.S. at 121.\n\f                       POUNCIL V . TILTON                           31\n\nplaintiff was a prisoner who complained in 2006 about the\nsame regulation at issue here, which prohibited conjugal\nvisits for him, because he was serving life sentences on which\nno parole date had been set by the Board of Prison Terms.\nHenderson, 2010 WL 599886 at *1 n.2. The district court\nconcluded that the prisoner had been aware of the policy in\nJune of 1998, when he was denied overnight visits with his\nwife, and that the statute of limitations began to run “when he\nbecame aware of the reason his conjugal visits were denied.”\nId. at *2. However, unlike the district court in Pouncil’s case,\nthe district court in Henderson did not apply or discuss\nMorgan, Cherosky, or Ngo, all of which, for reasons\ndiscussed above, suggest a different outcome—that is, that a\nlater denial pursuant to the same policy is an independently\nwrongful “discrete act” that starts the statute of limitations\nrunning, notwithstanding a prior denial.7\n\n                        3. CONCLUSION\n\n     Because Pouncil’s claims are based on an independently\nwrongful, discrete act in 2008, the denial of his request for\nconjugal visits with his second wife, Pouncil’s claims are not\ntime-barred, notwithstanding the denial, pursuant to the same\nregulation, of his prior request for conjugal visits with his\nfirst wife in 2002.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n  7\n    Also, unlike Pouncil, the plaintiff in Henderson did not oppose the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss. Henderson, 2010 W L 599886 at *1. Thus,\nalthough Henderson presented the same issues as this case, those issues\nwere never considered in Henderson in a contested proceeding.\n\f",

The immediate question,\nhowever, is not the merits of his claims, but when the\nlimitations period began to run on them. Was it in 2008,\nwhen the prisoner’s request for a conjugal visit with his\nsecond wife was denied pursuant to a prison regulation that\nhad been in force, essentially unchanged, since 1996, or in\n2002, when the prisoner’s request for a conjugal visit with his\nfirst wife was denied pursuant to that regulation? The answer\nturns not only on the precise nature of the prisoner’s claims,\nbut on which of two apparently conflicting lines of authority\nis controlling on the accrual date of the prisoner’s claims.\nIndeed, this appears to be the kind of case, forecast by the\nUnited States Supreme Court, “where it will be difficult to\ndetermine when the [limitations] time period should begin to\nrun.” Nat’l R.R.

BACKGROUND\n\n                     a. Factual Background\n\n    Plaintiff-appellee Madero L. Pouncil is a California state\nprisoner serving a sentence of life imprisonment without\nparole (LWOP) at Mule Creek State Prison (MCSP). He\nalleges in his pro se Complaint, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\nthat he is a Muslim, that marriage is one of the most\nimportant institutions in Islam and is incumbent on every\nMuslim, and that the main duties of a Muslim to his or her\nspouse are to consummate their marriage to solidify the\nvalidity of the marriage and to have sexual relations as a form\nof worship.\n\n    Pouncil married his first wife in 1999 while Pouncil was\nalready in prison.1 In 2002, Pouncil requested a conjugal visit\nwith his wife, but that request was denied. On March 26,\n2002, Pouncil filed a grievance stating, in part, “I’m told, ‘I\ncan’t apply for a Family visit, cause of the time I’m serving,\nand nature of the crime committed,’” but that the denial of a\n\n\n  1\n    Although this matter is before the court on an appeal from the denial\nof a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of\nCivil Procedure, which ordinarily would limit this court to consideration\nof allegations in the Complaint, see, e.g., Manzarek v. St. Paul Fire &\nMarine Ins. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1194077\"><a href=\"/opinion/1194077/manzarek-v-st-paul-fire-marine-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">519</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1030 (9th Cir. 2008), at the defendant’s\nrequest, the magistrate judge to whom the defendant’s motion to dismiss\nwas referred took judicial notice of marriage certificates indicating that\nPouncil was married on September 16, 1999, and remarried on July 14,\n2007.\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                       5\n\nconjugal visit restricted him from complying with a duty of\nhis religion. His grievance was denied as was his “Second\nLevel” appeal, because a prison regulation, CAL. CODE REGS.\ntit. 15, § 3174, did not permit LWOP prisoners to have\nconjugal visits.\n\n    The parties agree that Pouncil was subsequently divorced\nfrom his first wife. The parties also agree that Pouncil\nremarried on July 14, 2007, and that, on or about July 21,\n2008, Pouncil submitted another request for conjugal visits.\nThat request was denied on August 1, 2008, by a counselor,\nwho stated, “Per CCR 3177(b)(2) LWOP inmates are not\npermitted family visits.” The regulation on which the\ncounselor relied is essentially the same one cited in the denial\nof Pouncil’s request for a conjugal visit in 2002, which had\nbeen recodified in 2006 as § 3177. Pouncil’s administrative\nappeals were denied at the “Informal Level,” on August 7,\n2008; in a “Second Level Appeal Response,” dated\nSeptember 3, 2008; and in a “Director’s Level Decision,”\ndated December 9, 2008. The “Director’s Level Decision”\nexpressly stated that it “exhaust[ed] the administrative\nremedy available to the appellant within CDCR.”\n\n                 b. Procedural Background\n\n    On April 27, 2009, Pouncil signed, and on April 29, 2009,\nthe Clerk of Court for the United States District Court for the\nEastern District of California filed, Pouncil’s pro se\nComplaint pursuant to the Civil Rights Act, 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. The Complaint named as defendants James Tilton,\nidentified as the Director of the California Department of\nCorrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR); D. Foston, identified\nas Facility Captain; and M. Martel, identified as the Warden\nor Acting Warden at MCSP. In his Complaint, Pouncil stated\n\f6                    POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\nthat he had brought the lawsuit against the CDCR “for\nimplementing a rule to the California Code of Regulation\n(3177(b)(2)) that violates Petitioner[’s] Constitutional right\nto practice his religion and be married as a Muslim under the\nRLUIPA act. . . . Petitioner all so [sic] claims a violation of\nhis 14th. and 8th. amendment rights.” Complaint at 4.\nPouncil also alleged that “[t]his rule dose [sic] not provide\nintimate time (family visiting) for Muslim Inmates serving a\nlife without parole term, wherefore making it impossible for\nPetitioner to consummate his marriage/have sexual relations\nwith his wife and practice his religion and perform his duties\nto his wife as commanded by (ALLAH) and affirmed in the\nteaching of prophet Muhammad. [A]nd by denying Petitioner\nthe right to perform his religious duties to his wife or\npotential wife is to deny him his right to be married as a\nMuslim.” Complaint at 5. Pouncil sought the following\nrelief: “Reinstate Family Visits for Lifers, and Life without\nthe possibility of parole Inmate so I can fulfill my duties\nreligiously to my wife, and guide my children in my family\nwith direct understanding of my faith.” Complaint at 2.\n\n    Pouncil’s Complaint makes no express mention of his\napplications for conjugal visits in either 2002 or 2008 or\ndenials of those applications. It does, however, aver that\nPouncil completed the administrative review process for his\nclaims, explaining what happened at each level of\nadministrative review. The administrative exhaustion that\nPouncil cites relates entirely to his 2008 application for a\nconjugal visit.\n\n   The docket below reflects that Tilton and Foston filed\nwaivers of service of the Complaint, but that Martel was\nnever served with the Complaint. Tilton and Foston filed a\nmotion to dismiss arguing, among other things, that Pouncil’s\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                      7\n\nComplaint is time-barred. The defendants argued that\nPouncil’s claims accrued in 2002 when he first filed an\ninmate grievance concerning conjugal family visitation, so\nthat the statute of limitations had run by 2009, when Pouncil\nfiled suit. Pouncil argued that his claims accrued only after\nhe remarried in 2007, and that his action relates only to\nmatters addressed in his 2008 inmate grievance, so that his\nlawsuit is timely.\n\n    On February 19, 2010, a magistrate judge filed Findings\nand Recommendations concerning the defendants’ motion to\ndismiss. The magistrate judge found that the applicable\nstatute of limitations for a § 1983 claim, using California’s\nstatute of limitations for personal injury actions, was two\nyears, and that the statute of limitations was tolled while the\nprisoner exhausted administrative remedies. The magistrate\njudge dismissed any contention that an amendment of the\npertinent prison regulation in 2007 affected the accrual\nanalysis, because the portion of the regulation preventing\nPouncil from having conjugal visits had been in place\nunchanged since 1996. The magistrate judge construed\nPouncil’s claims as, in essence, a constitutional challenge to\nthe prison regulation prohibiting LWOP inmates from having\nconjugal family visits and concluded that this regulation\nremained the same and was applicable to Pouncil without\nregard to whom he was married at the time. In other words,\nthe magistrate judge concluded, Pouncil’s claims were not\ntied to a particular spouse. Thus, the magistrate judge\nconcluded that Pouncil knew from his experience in 2002 that\nhe would not be allowed conjugal visitation with any wife so\nlong as he remained an LWOP inmate. The magistrate judge\nalso dismissed application of a continuing violation theory,\nbecause the denial of Pouncil’s request for a conjugal visit in\n2008 was simply an effect of the regulation that Pouncil had\n\f8                     POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\noriginally challenged in 2002. Therefore, the magistrate\njudge recommended that the defendants’ motion to dismiss be\ngranted.\n\n    Pouncil filed objections to the magistrate judge’s Findings\nand Recommendations on March 12, 2010, and,\nconsequently, on March 31, 2010, a district judge2 conducted\na de novo review of the case. The district judge declined to\nadopt the magistrate judge’s Findings and Recommendations.\nIn the district judge’s view, Pouncil’s complaint did not\nallege an injury from the denial of his request for conjugal\nvisits with his ex-wife in 2002, but an injury from the denial\nof his request for conjugal visits with his current wife on\nAugust 1, 2008. The district judge also concluded that the\n2008 denial constituted an individual, actionable injury upon\nwhich Pouncil had standing to bring suit, so that his action\ndid not accrue until his request was denied on August 1,\n2008.\n\n    The district judge found that the two-year statute of\nlimitations for a § 1983 claim would not run until August of\n2010, and that the four-year statute of limitations for a\nRLUIPA claim would not run until August of 2012. Thus, he\nfound that Pouncil’s claims, filed in 2009, were timely.

This court granted Tilton’s\nsubsequent petition for permission to appeal the certified\nquestion of whether Pouncil’s claims are barred by the statute\nof limitations and directed appointment of pro bono counsel\nto represent Pouncil on appeal.\n\n                       2. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\n                      a. Applicable Standards\n\n    Pouncil asserts claims pursuant to the RLUIPA and the\nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution.5 The\nRLUIPA provides, in relevant part, that “[n]o government\nshall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of\n\n\n 3\n   Like the parties, for the sake of simplicity, we will continue to identify\nthe defendant-appellant as Tilton, rather than Cate.\n\n     4\n    The district judge declined Tilton’s request that he also certify for\ninterlocutory appeal the scope of the lawsuit and who is a party.\n\n     5\n    Tilton argues that the only claim on which Pouncil was allowed to\nproceed, after initial review, was his RLUIPA claim. However, the\ndistrict judge treated both Pouncil’s RLUIPA claim and his First\nAmendment claim as viable for purposes of the statute of limitations\nanalysis, and we will do the same, taking no position on whether Pouncil’s\nFirst Amendment claim is also properly before the court.\n\f10                   POUNCIL V .

Arguments Of The Parties\n\n    Tilton asserts that Pouncil is now challenging a regulation\nthat he originally challenged in 2002, when he was married\nto his first wife, so that his claims accrued in May 2002, when\nthe warden of the MCSP notified him that, in accordance with\nprovisions of the California Code of Regulations, he would\nnot be permitted to have conjugal visitation with any spouse\nbecause of his life sentence. Tilton relies on Knox v.

Pouncil relies on National Railroad Passenger\nCorp. v. Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121149\"><a href=\"/opinion/121149/national-railroad-passenger-corporation-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 113 (2002), to contend that\nthe August 2008 denial of his request for a conjugal visit with\nhis second wife was a discrete act that started a new clock\nrunning for the filing of his claims.\n\n    In reply, Tilton argues that Pouncil’s argument relies on\na transformation of his claims from challenges to the\nregulation into challenges to the denial of a specific request\nfor a conjugal visit. Tilton points out that Pouncil’s\nComplaint never even mentions that he had been denied a\nconjugal visit in 2008.            Instead, it challenges\n“implementation” of a regulation preventing inmates serving\nLWOP from participating in conjugal visits.\n\f                      POUNCIL V .

On the other hand, neither does Pouncil mention\nthe 2002 denial of his application for a conjugal visit with his\nfirst wife. The question is whether his failure to identify the\n2008 denial as the specific basis for his claims is dispositive\nof the nature of his claims. We think it is not, giving\nPouncil’s pro se Complaint the liberal construction to which\nit is entitled. See Silva, 658 F.3d at 1101; Johnson, 207 F.3d\nat 653.\n\n    First, Tilton is correct that Pouncil stated in his Complaint\nthat he had brought the lawsuit against the CDCR “for\nimplementing a rule to the California Code of Regulation\n(3177(b)(2)) that violates Petitioner[’s] Constitutional right\nto practice his religion and be married as a Muslim under the\nRLUIPA act.”           Complaint at 4 (emphasis added).\n\f14                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\nNevertheless, we do not agree with Tilton’s argument that\nclaims based on “implementing” a rule equate with claims\nbased on “enacting” or “adopting” the rule. Appellant’s\nReply at 2l-23. A liberal construction of Pouncil’s Complaint\nwould just as reasonably read “implementing” the rule to\nmean “applying” the rule to him. See, e.g., MERRIAM\nWEBSTER ’S COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 583 (10th ed. 1995)\n(defining “implement,” inter alia, as “CARRY OUT ,\nACCOMPLISH ; esp. to give practical effect to and ensure of\nactual fulfillment by concrete measures”); ROGET ’S II: THE\nN E W T H E S A U R U S , www.educat i o n . ya h o o . c o m /\nreference/thesaurus/?=implement (last accessed May 15,\n2012) (identifying “implement” and “apply” as synonyms of\n“use” and identifying “implement” as a synonym of “apply”).\nSecond, in his Complaint, Pouncil explains that he has\nexhausted administrative remedies by citing the levels of\nreview and summarizing the results of those reviews in a\nmanner that plainly matches the administrative steps of his\n2008 grievance, the only grievance involving a third level of\nadministrative review. See Complaint at 2. Third, Pouncil\ncites only the version of the rule as it was recodified in 2006\nas § 3177, not as it existed in 2002, when it was codified as\n§ 3174. Liberally construed, Pouncil’s Complaint suggests\nthat the focus of Pouncil’s challenges is the application of the\nrule to him in 2008.\n\n    Tilton argues that, by suing the Secretary of the CDCR\nfor injunctive relief, Pouncil has also necessarily challenged\nthe regulation itself, not the denial of his request for a\nconjugal visit in 2008. Tilton points out that he was not\npersonally involved in the specific denial of Pouncil’s\nrequest. This argument is too clever by half, in the context of\npro se pleadings, because it relies on precisely the kind of\ntechnical requirements that liberal construction of pro se\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                      15\n\npleadings is intended to mitigate. See Wyatt v. Terhune,\n</pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1108</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1119 (9th Cir. 2003).\n\n     It also is not entirely clear whether the injunctive relief\nthat Pouncil seeks is limited to relief for him from the\nchallenged regulation, or relief for all LWOP prisoners. In\nhis Complaint, Pouncil sought the following relief:\n“Reinstate Family Visits for Lifers, and Life without the\npossibility of parole Inmate [sic] so I can fulfill my duties\nreligiously to my wife, and guide my children in my family\nwith direct understanding of my faith.” Complaint at 2\n(emphasis added). This statement ambiguously refers to all\n“Lifers,” but only to one LWOP “Inmate,” and to relief\nallowing Pouncil to fulfill his religious duties. When read in\nthe context of Pouncil’s requests for relief in the\nadministrative proceedings, however, it appears that Pouncil\nseeks relief from application of the regulation to him. In his\nAugust 4, 2008, Appeal Form, Pouncil requested the\nfollowing action as relief: “I would like my family visiting\nprevilleges [sic] be reinstated and to stay as such, until I’m\nset free where I can continue to practice my Religious beliefs,\nand be an upstanding citizen.” In a “Second Level Appeal\nResponse,” the warden of the MCSP characterized Pouncil’s\nrequest for relief to be “to have his right to Family Visiting\nrestored to him.” The “Director’s Level Response” also\ncharacterized Pouncil’s request for relief to be “that his\nfamily visiting privileges be reinstated and to stay as such\nuntil the appellant is released.” Thus, the relief that Pouncil\nrequests does not necessarily demonstrate that he has asserted\nchallenges to the regulation itself, rather than claims based on\ndenial of his request for a conjugal visit in 2008.\n\n  Moreover, Tilton (or his successor), as Secretary of the\nCDCR, is the proper defendant on a claim for prospective\n\f16                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\ninjunctive relief from a prison regulation, because he would\nbe responsible for ensuring that injunctive relief was carried\nout, even if he was not personally involved in the decision\ngiving rise to Pouncil’s claims. See, e.g., Gonzalez v.\nFeinerman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"618199\"><a href=\"/opinion/618199/gonzalez-v-feinerman/\"><span class=\"volume\">663</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">311</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315 (7th Cir. 2011) (the prison\nwarden was the proper defendant for a claim of injunctive\nrelief, notwithstanding his lack of personal involvement in the\nchallenged conduct, because he would be responsible for\nensuring that the injunctive relief was carried out). Tilton\ncannot raise qualified immunity to such a claim. See Vance\nv. Barrett, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783789\"><a href=\"/opinion/783789/daniel-vance-v-jay-barrett-ek-mcdaniel-becky-messick-robert-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1083</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1091 n.10 (9th Cir. 2003) (noting,\n“[A] defense of qualified immunity is not available for\nprospective injunctive relief.” (citing Presbyterian Church\n(U.S.A.) v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520037\"><a href=\"/opinion/520037/the-presbyterian-church-usa-v-the-united-states-of-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">518</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 527 (9th Cir. 1989)).\nThus, Pouncil’s prayer for injunctive relief in no way\ndemonstrates conclusively that his claims are not premised on\ndenial of his application for a conjugal visit in 2008, nor does\nit demonstrate that Pouncil’s appellate counsel has\nreconfigured his claims to attempt to evade the time-bar that\nTilton asserts. Rather, liberally construed, we read Pouncil’s\nclaims to be challenges to the denial of his 2008 request for\na conjugal visit.\n\n      d. Discrete Act Versus Inevitable Consequence\n\n    Once Pouncil’s claims are understood as arising from the\n2008 denial of his application for a conjugal visit, the\nquestion is, when did such claims accrue? What makes this\nquestion particularly daunting here is that two different lines\nof authority appear to lead to different conclusions. Tilton\nrelies on one line of authority to argue that, even if Pouncil is\nchallenging the 2008 denial of his request for a conjugal visit,\nthat denial is simply the inevitable consequence of the 2002\ndenial of his first request for a conjugal visit pursuant to the\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                      17\n\nsame regulation. Relying on a different line of authority,\nPouncil contends that the 2008 denial was a discrete act,\nnotwithstanding a prior denial pursuant to the same\nregulation.\n\n   i. The Ricks/Knox line\n\n    Appellants rely on Knox, 260 F.3d at 1014, for the\nproposition that “all of the allegations in the complaint\nregarding Pouncil’s inability to have sex with his second wife\nare merely the delayed, but inevitable, consequence of the\noriginal decision that he is subject to regulations preventing\nLWOP inmates from participating in conjugal visits.”\nAppellant’s Brief at 16. Tilton argues that Pouncil’s cause of\naction, therefore, accrued on the date that he received the\ndenial of his first request for conjugal visits, in May of 2002.\nAppellant’s Brief at 13.\n\n    Knox involved an attorney who, after receiving a letter on\nJanuary 20, 1996, revoking all of her legal mail and visitation\nrights to all inmates at all penal institutions in California,\ncontinued to receive denials of these rights between January\n20, 1996, and July 21, 1997, when she filed suit. Knox,\n260 F.3d at 1011-1012. The denials subsequent to the\nJanuary 20, 1996, letter, relied on the suspension\nimplemented in that letter as the basis for denying Knox\neither legal visitation or correspondence privileges with\ninmates. Id. at 1012. Knox conceded that her § 1983 claim\naccrued on January 20, 1996. Id. at 1013. She argued,\nhowever, “that each time that she was denied access to one of\nher clients housed in a CDCR facility, a new cause of action\nar[ose] under the continuing violation theory.” Id.\n\f18                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\n    This court explained that, since Knox had not alleged a\nsystem or practice of discrimination, the only way that she\ncould hope to show a continuing violation was to “‘state facts\nsufficient . . . [to] support[ ] a determination that the alleged\ndiscriminatory acts related closely enough to constitute a\ncontinuing violation, and that one or more of the acts falls\nwithin the limitations period.’” Id. (quoting DeGrassi v. City\nof Glendora, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768122\"><a href=\"/opinion/768122/christine-degrassiplaintiff-appellant-v-city-of-glendora-a-municipal/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 645 (9th Cir. 2000)). This court\nrejected Knox’s continuing violation argument, however,\nbecause this court had “repeatedly held that a mere\ncontinuing impact from past violations is not actionable.” Id.\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (emphasis in\nthe original). This court held,\n\n        Knox’s cause of action accrued when she\n        received Tristan’s permanent and complete\n        suspension letter on January 20, 1996. The\n        continuing violation doctrine is inapplicable\n        because Knox has failed to establish that a\n        new violation occurs each time she is denied\n        her visitation or mail privileges. Rather, the\n        CDC’s subsequent and repeated denials of\n        Knox’s privileges with her clients is merely\n        the continuing effect of the original\n        suspension.\n\nKnox, 260 F.3d at 1013.\n\n   This court concluded that the outcome in Knox was\ncompelled by the United States Supreme Court’s decision in\nDelaware State College v. Ricks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110367\"><a href=\"/opinion/110367/delaware-state-college-v-ricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1980). See\nKnox, 260 F.3d at 1013-14. In Ricks, the Supreme Court\nconsidered whether a college professor had timely\ncomplained under Title VII that he had been denied academic\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                       19\n\ntenure because of his national origin. 449 U.S. at 252. Ricks\nhad received a letter on June 26, 1974, informing him of the\ndenial of tenure, but renewing his contract until the end of the\n1974-75 school year. Id. at 253-54. The district court had\nheld that the statute of limitations began to run on Ricks’s\nclaim on the date he had been notified that he would be\noffered a 1-year “terminal” contract, but the Third Circuit\nCourt of Appeals reversed, concluding that the statute of\nlimitations did not begin to run until Ricks’s “terminal”\ncontract expired on June 30, 1975. Id. at 255.\n\n    The Supreme Court found that Ricks had not alleged any\ndiscriminatory acts that continued until, or that occurred at\nthe time of, the actual termination of his contract. Id. at 257.\nTo the contrary, the Court concluded, the “termination of\nemployment at Delaware State [wa]s a delayed, but\ninevitable, consequence of the denial of tenure.” Id. at 257-\n58. In short, “the only alleged discrimination occurred—and\nthe filing limitations period therefore commenced—at the\ntime the tenure decision was made and communicated to\nRicks.” Id. at 258. This was so, “even though one of the\neffects of the denial of tenure—the eventual loss of a teaching\nposition—did not occur until later.” Id. (emphasis in the\noriginal). The emphasis in the statute of limitations analysis,\nthe Court concluded, is not on effects, but “is [upon] whether\nany present violation exists.’” Id. (quoting United Air Lines,\nInc. v.

The Morgan/Cherosky line\n\n    There is, however, another line of authority that appears\nto lead to a conflicting result—i.e., to the conclusion that\nPouncil’s claims arising from the denial of his request for\nconjugal visits in 2008 are timely, notwithstanding the prior\ndenial of a request for conjugal visits in 2002.\n\n     Subsequent to Knox, the United States Supreme Court\ndecided Morgan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121149\"><a href=\"/opinion/121149/national-railroad-passenger-corporation-v-morgan/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">101</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. In Morgan, which, like\nRicks, was an employment discrimination case, the plaintiff\nfiled a charge of discrimination and retaliation against his\nemployer. 536 U.S. at 105. Some of the allegedly\ndiscriminatory acts about which Morgan complained occurred\nwithin 300 days of the time that he filed his charge with the\nEEOC—that is, within the 300-day limitations period for\nfiling such a charge—but many took place prior to that time\nperiod. Id. at 106. Morgan argued that the various acts,\nincluding those that occurred prior to the 300-day time\nperiod, were part of “an unlawful employment practice” that\nconstituted an ongoing violation. Id. at 110. What is\ninstructive here, however, is not the Morgan Court’s analysis\nof the continuing violation doctrine, but its explanation of\nwhat constitutes a “discrete act” that starts the running of a\nlimitations period.\n\f                     POUNCIL V .

The\n        charge, therefore, must be filed within the\n        180- or 300-day time period after the discrete\n        discriminatory act occurred. The existence of\n        past acts and the employee’s prior knowledge\n        of their occurrence, however, does not bar\n        employees from filing charges about related\n        discrete acts so long as the acts are\n        independently discriminatory and charges\n        addressing those acts are themselves timely\n        filed. Nor does the statute bar an employee\n        from using the prior acts as background\n        evidence in support of a timely claim.\n\nMorgan, 536 U.S. at 113. Thus, Morgan instructs that a court\nmust determine whether a claim is based on an independently\nwrongful, discrete act, and if it is, then the claim accrues, and\nthe statute of limitations begins to run, from the date of that\ndiscrete act, even if there was a prior, related past act.\n\n    In Cherosky v. Henderson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782186\"><a href=\"/opinion/782186/larry-cherosky-thomas-jennings-anthony-clemons-vincent-faini-v-william-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1243</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 2003),\nthis Court discussed the application of Morgan to claims by\nemployees of the United States Postal Service that the Postal\nService had violated their rights pursuant to the\nRehabilitation Act by denying their requests for respirators.\n\f22                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\nIn order to bring a claim under the Rehabilitation Act, a\nfederal employee was required to consult with an EEOC\ncounselor within 45 days of the effective date of the action.\nSee Cherosky, 330 F.3d at 1245. Failure to comply with the\n45-day consultation requirement was fatal to a federal\nemployee’s claim. Id. The employees in Cherosky did not\ninitiate contact with an EEOC officer within 45 days of the\ndenial of their requests to wear respirators and could not point\nto any discrete, discriminatory act that occurred within the\n45-day period. Id. at 1245-46. The employees argued,\nhowever, that their claims were timely under the continuing\nviolations doctrine. Id. at 1246.\n\n    In Cherosky, this court, relying on Morgan, determined\nthat discrete acts, such as the denials of the employees’\nrequests for respirators, are only timely where such acts\noccurred within the limitations period, but that the postal\nemployees had not alleged that any discriminatory acts had\noccurred after the initial denials, which were outside of the\nlimitations period. See id. This court quoted with approval\nthe district court’s observation that the “‘heart of plaintiffs’\ncomplaint does not stem from the policy regarding the use of\nrespirators, but rather from the individualized decisions that\nresulted from implementation of a policy originating from\nOSHA.’” Id. at 1247. The court concluded that “these\nindividualized decisions are best characterized as discrete\nacts, rather than as a pattern or practice of discrimination.”\nId.\n\n    The Cherosky court compared the “wrong” alleged by the\npostal employees, the denial of each application for a\nrespirator, to the “wrong” in Bazemore, 478 U.S. at 395, the\nreceipt of a periodic paycheck pursuant to a discriminatory\nsalary policy. The Cherosky court explained, “Just as the\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                     23\n\nwrong in Bazemore accrued each time the salary policy was\nimplemented, the alleged wrong here occurred and accrued\nwhen the policy was invoked to deny an individual\nemployee’s request.” Cherosky, 330 F.3d at 1247.\n\n    Thus, Cherosky and Morgan suggest that each time a\npolicy is invoked to deny an individual plaintiff’s request, an\nindependently wrongful, discrete act occurs, a claim accrues,\nand the limitations period begins to run. Pouncil argues that\nthis is precisely what occurred in 2008: The 2008 denial of\nhis individual request for a conjugal visit was independently\nwrongful, and his claims accrued at that time, even though the\nsame regulation invoked to deny the 2008 request had been\ninvoked to deny his 2002 request for a conjugal visit.\n\n   iii.

See Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 633-37\n(citing Bazemore, 478 U.S. at 396-97).\n\n    This court has applied the “discrete act” language of\nMorgan, as explained in Ledbetter, in a prisoner rights case\nbrought pursuant to § 1983.

Here, the December 22\n       determination is the discrete act adverse to\n       Ngo, so the 15-working-day limitations period\n       began running against him on that date rather\n\f26                    POUNCIL V .

The proper question, therefore, is whether, factually,\nthis is a Ricks/Knox case or a Morgan/Cherosky case. Put\nanother way, does this case involve the delayed, but\ninevitable, consequence of the original 2002 decision, making\nPouncil’s claims arising from the 2008 decision time-barred,\nor an independently wrongful, discrete act in 2008, which\nbegan the running of the statute of limitations anew,\nnotwithstanding the prior denial pursuant to essentially the\nsame regulation in 2002? As this is a factual question, the\ndistrict court’s resolution is entitled to deferential review.\nSee Hells Canyon Pres. Council, 403 F.3d at 691.\n\n                        e. Application\n\n    We affirm the district judge’s finding that the denial of\nPouncil’s request for a conjugal visit in 2008 is a separate,\ndiscrete act, rather than a mere effect of the 2002 denial. This\nis so, because Pouncil alleges, and the record supports, that\nthe second denial is a stand-alone violation of Pouncil’s First\nAmendment and RLUIPA rights from which the statute of\nlimitations runs anew. See Morgan, 536 U.S. at 113. The\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                       27\n\n2008 denial is an independently wrongful “present violation,”\nbecause Pouncil’s claims do not rely on any acts that occurred\nbefore the statute of limitations period to establish a violation\nof his right to free exercise of religion or his rights under\nRLUIPA. See Bazemore, 478 U.S. at 396-97, n.6 (Brennan,\nconcurring in part) (citing Evans, 431 U.S. at 558, for the\nproposition that the “critical question” is whether any\n“present violation” exists, and evaluating whether the\nplaintiff’s claims of wrongfulness were “present violations”\nby considering whether they relied on prior acts). Unlike\nLedbetter, who was unable to point to a later act that fully\nestablished the alleged violation, Ledbetter, 550 U.S. at 629,\nPouncil does point to a later act, the 2008 denial, that fully\nestablishes a First Amendment and RLUIPA violation,\nwithout reaching back to the 2002 denial to establish a\nnecessary element of his claims. To put it another way, the\n2008 denial relied on a new application of the regulation to a\nnew request for a conjugal visit, it did not rely on the 2002\ndenial as barring all subsequent requests for conjugal visits.\n\n     In contrast, the cases on which Tilton relies each lacked\nany allegation or showing of a subsequent and separately\nwrongful act. For example, in Ricks, the college professor\nfailed to allege or show a subsequent and separately wrongful\nact after notice of the denial of tenure. See Ricks, 449 U.S. at\n257-58 (determining that the only wrongful decision alleged\nwas a wrongful denial of tenure and not an additional\nwrongful discharge one year later). While the Supreme Court\nin Ricks noted that the “proper focus is upon the time of the\ndiscriminatory acts, not upon the time at which the\nconsequences of the acts became most painful,” it did so\nbased upon the finding that Ricks had pleaded only one\ndiscrete wrongful act, the denial of tenure. See id. at 258\n(citing Abramson v. University of Hawaii, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"364071\"><a href=\"/opinion/364071/19-fair-emplpraccas-439-19-empl-prac-dec-p-9136-joan-abramson-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">594</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 209\n\f28                   POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\n(9th Cir. 1979)) (emphasis added). In contrast, Pouncil has\nalleged a second, discrete wrongful act—the 2008 denial.\n\n    The failure to allege a subsequent, independently\nwrongful act also explains the holdings in Knox, Cherosky,\nand Ngo. In Knox, each of the denials subsequent to the\nJanuary 20, 1996, letter advising Knox that her legal mail and\nvisitation rights had been revoked relied on that letter as the\nbasis for denying Knox either legal visitation or\ncorrespondence privileges with inmates. Knox, 260 F.3d at\n1012. Moreover, Knox acknowledged that her claim had\naccrued upon receipt of the letter suspending her visitation\nand correspondence rights. See id. at 1013. Thus, the court\nin Knox was simply never asked to consider whether each\nsubsequent denial was a separate violation of her rights, only\nwhether each subsequent denial was part of a continuing\nviolation. Id. Here, in contrast, Pouncil specifically asserts\nthat the 2008 denial of his request for a conjugal visit was a\ndiscrete act, and the 2008 denial relied on a new application\nof the regulation to a new request for a conjugal visit, rather\nthan on the 2002 denial as barring all subsequent requests for\nconjugal visits.\n\n    In Cherosky, the employees did not point to any discrete,\ndiscriminatory act that occurred within the period of\nlimitations. See Cherosky, 330 F.3d at 1245. The court in\nCherosky concluded, however, that if an employee’s new\nrequest for a respirator were denied pursuant to the same\npolicy, the time period would begin to run anew, despite an\nearlier denial. See id. at 1248. The situation contemplated in\nCherosky is exactly the situation here: Pouncil’s request for\na conjugal visit with his wife in 2008 was denied pursuant to\nthe same policy as the denial in 2002, so that the time period\nshould be found to run anew from the later denial, despite an\n\f                     POUNCIL V . TILTON                       29\n\nearlier denial. In other words, the “heart” of Pouncil’s\nclaims, like the “heart” of the plaintiffs’ complaint in\nCherosky, “does not stem from the policy regarding the\n[denial of conjugal visits to LWOP prisoners], but rather from\nthe individualized decisions that resulted from\nimplementation of a policy originating from [the CDCR].”\nCf. id. at 1247. As in Cherosky, “these individualized\ndecisions are best characterized as discrete acts, rather than as\na pattern or practice of discrimination.” Id. The difference\nbetween Pouncil’s claim and the plaintiffs’ claims in\nCherosky is that his individualized decision in 2008 fell\nwithin the limitations period.\n\n    Again, in Ngo, the plaintiff did not allege a second\nadverse decision. Instead, Ngo alleged one decision\nannounced at the conclusion of a hearing, that he would be\nunable to participate in “special programs.” That decision\nwas followed by Ngo’s request to participate in baseball,\nwhich was granted.         Ngo’s additional query about\nparticipation in other “special programs” was deferred until\na further request was actually made. See Ngo, 539 F.3d at\n1109. Thus, Ngo involved one adverse decision followed by\none positive decision and a statement that no decision would\nbe made regarding other matters until a specific request was\nmade. Id.\n\n     In contrast to the plaintiffs in Rick, Knox, Cherosky, and\nNgo, the district judge found that Pouncil has alleged a\nsecond adverse decision that is independently wrongful\nwithin the limitations period. In addition to showing proper\ndeference to the district court’s factual finding that Pouncil\nhad alleged a current violation and injury, see Hells Canyon\nPres. Council, 403 F.3d at 691, our determination that the\n2008 denial of Pouncil’s request for conjugal visits was a\n\f30                        POUNCIL V . TILTON\n\nseparate, discrete, and independently wrongful act is\nconsistent with prior cases analyzing the application of\nMorgan’s “discrete act” language. See, e.g., Cherosky, 330\nF.3d at 1245-47; Ngo, 539 F.3d at 1109-1110. Those cases\nlead to the conclusion that each wrongful act starts a new\nclock for filing a claim alleging that act. Such a\ndetermination also fits with Morgan’s rule that the existence\nof past acts and the claimant’s prior knowledge of their\noccurrence does not bar a claimant from filing claims about\nrelated discrete acts, so long as the subsequent acts are\nindependently wrongful and claims alleging those acts are\nthemselves timely filed. Morgan, 536 U.S. at 113.6\n\n    While Knox may, at first blush, appear to support a\nfinding that the second denial was merely a consequence of\nthe first denial, upon a closer reading, it does not support or\nrequire such a finding, because it is distinguishable for the\nreasons stated above. Furthermore, Knox does not require the\nconclusion that multiple denials of rights pursuant to the same\nprison policy are necessarily just effects of the original\ndiscriminatory act, because Knox was decided before the\nSupreme Court’s development of the discrete act analysis in\nMorgan, and also prior to this court’s application of the\ndiscrete act analysis to a prisoner’s § 1983 case in Ngo.\n\n   Finally, the district court’s decision in the similar case of\nHenderson v. Hubbard, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">599886</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (E.D. Cal.

In Henderson, the\n\n\n  6\n    Further, although we need not decide the issue, in those cases where\nthe filing period is not jurisdictional, the doctrines of estoppel, waiver, and\nlaches may still operate to ameliorate the specter of any excesses that may\nbe raised by this opinion. See Morgan, 536 U.S. at 121.\n\f                       POUNCIL V . TILTON                           31\n\nplaintiff was a prisoner who complained in 2006 about the\nsame regulation at issue here, which prohibited conjugal\nvisits for him, because he was serving life sentences on which\nno parole date had been set by the Board of Prison Terms.\nHenderson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">599886</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *1 n.2. The district court\nconcluded that the prisoner had been aware of the policy in\nJune of 1998, when he was denied overnight visits with his\nwife, and that the statute of limitations began to run “when he\nbecame aware of the reason his conjugal visits were denied.”\nId. at *2. However, unlike the district court in Pouncil’s case,\nthe district court in Henderson did not apply or discuss\nMorgan, Cherosky, or Ngo, all of which, for reasons\ndiscussed above, suggest a different outcome—that is, that a\nlater denial pursuant to the same policy is an independently\nwrongful “discrete act” that starts the statute of limitations\nrunning, notwithstanding a prior denial.7\n\n                        3. CONCLUSION\n\n     Because Pouncil’s claims are based on an independently\nwrongful, discrete act in 2008, the denial of his request for\nconjugal visits with his second wife, Pouncil’s claims are not\ntime-barred, notwithstanding the denial, pursuant to the same\nregulation, of his prior request for conjugal visits with his\nfirst wife in 2002.\n\n      AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n  7\n    Also, unlike Pouncil, the plaintiff in Henderson did not oppose the\ndefendants’ motion to dismiss. Henderson, 2010 W L 599886 at *1. Thus,\nalthough Henderson presented the same issues as this case, those issues\nwere never considered in Henderson in a contested proceeding.\n\f</pre>",
