PINHOLSTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–1088. Argued November 9, 2010—Decided April 4, 2011\nA California jury convicted respondent Pinholster on two counts of first\n  degree murder. At the penalty phase before the same jury, the prose\n  cution produced eight witnesses, who testified about Pinholster’s his\n  tory of threatening and violent behavior. Pinholster’s trial counsel,\n  who unsuccessfully sought to exclude the aggravating evidence on the\n  ground that the prosecution had not given Pinholster proper notice\n  under California law, called only Pinholster’s mother. Counsel did\n  not call a psychiatrist, though they had consulted with Dr. Stalberg,\n  who had diagnosed Pinholster with antisocial personality disorder.\n  The jury recommended the death penalty, and Pinholster was sen\n  tenced to death. Pinholster twice sought habeas relief in the Califor\n  nia Supreme Court, alleging, inter alia, that his trial counsel had\n  failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence dur\n  ing the penalty phase. He introduced additional evidence to support\n  his claim: school, medical, and legal records; and declarations from\n  family members, one of his trial attorneys, and Dr. Woods, a psychia\n  trist who diagnosed him with bipolar mood disorder and seizure dis\n  orders, and who criticized Dr. Stalberg’s report. Each time, the State\n  Supreme Court unanimously and summarily denied the claim on the\n  merits. Subsequently, a Federal District Court held an evidentiary\n  hearing and granted Pinholster federal habeas relief under 28\n  U. S. C. §2254. Affirming, the en banc Ninth Circuit considered the\n  new evidence adduced in the District Court hearing and held that the\n  State Supreme Court’s decision “involved an unreasonable applica\n  tion of . . . clearly established Federal law,” §2254(d)(1).\nHeld:\n    1. Review under §2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before\n the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits. Pp. 8–14.\n\f2                       CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n          (a) As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen\n    alty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), §2254 sets several limits on a federal\n    court’s power to grant habeas relief to a state prisoner. As relevant\n    here, a claim that has been “adjudicated on the merits in State court\n    proceedings,” “shall not be granted . . . unless the adjudication” “(1)\n    resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreason\n    able application of, clearly established Federal law,” or “(2) resulted\n    in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the\n    facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”\n    §2254(d). This “difficult to meet,” Harrington v. Richter, 562 U. S.\n    ___, ___, and “ ‘highly deferential standard’ . . . demands that state\n    court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt,” Woodford v. Vis\n    ciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24. Section 2254(d)(1)’s backward-looking lan\n    guage—“resulted in” and “involved”—requires an examination of the\n    state-court decision at the time it was made. It follows that the re\n    cord under review is also limited to the record in existence at that\n    same time—i.e., the state-court record. This understanding is com\n    pelled by “the broader context of the statute as a whole,” which dem\n    onstrates Congress’ intent to channel prisoners’ claims first to state\n    courts. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341. It is also con\n    sistent with this Court’s precedents, which emphasize that\n    §2254(d)(1) review focuses on what a state court knew and did. See,\n    e.g., Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71–72. Moreover, it is consis\n    tent with Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 474, which explained\n    that a federal habeas court is “not required to hold an evidentiary\n    hearing” when the state-court record “precludes habeas relief” under\n    §2254(d)’s limitations. The Ninth Circuit wrongly interpreted Wil\n    liams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 420, and Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649,\n    as supporting the contrary view. Pp. 8–12.\n          (b) This holding does not render superfluous §2254(e)(2)—which\n    limits the federal habeas courts’ discretion to take new evidence in an\n    evidentiary hearing. At a minimum, §2254(e)(2) still restricts their\n    discretion in claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state\n    court. Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence\n    in federal court, AEDPA’s statutory scheme is designed to strongly\n    discourage them from doing so. Pp. 13–14.\n          (c) Remand for a properly limited review is inappropriate here,\n    because the Ninth Circuit ruled, in the alternative, that Pinholster\n    merited habeas relief on the state-court record alone. P. 14.\n       2. On the record before the state court, Pinholster was not entitled\n    to federal habeas relief. Pp. 14‘–31.\n          (a) To satisfy §2254(d)(1)’s “unreasonable application” prong, he\n    must show that “there was no reasonable basis” for the State Su\n    preme Court’s summary decision. Richter, supra, at ___. Pp. 15–16.\n\f                   Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                     3\n\n                              Syllabus\n\n     (b) Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668, provides the clearly\nestablished federal law here. To overcome the strong presumption\nthat counsel has acted competently, id., at 690, a defendant must\nshow that counsel failed to act “reasonabl[y] considering all the cir\ncumstances,” id., at 688, and must prove the “reasonable probability\nthat, but for counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceed\ning would have been different,” id., at 694. Review here is thus “dou\nbly deferential,” Knowles v. Mirzayance, 556 U. S. ___, ___, requiring\na “highly deferential” look at counsel’s performance, Strickland, su\npra, at 689, through §2254(d)’s “deferential lens,” Mirzayance, supra,\nat ___, n. 2. Pp. 16–18.\n     (c) Pinholster has not shown that the State Supreme Court’s de\ncision that he could not demonstrate deficient performance by his\ntrial counsel necessarily involved an unreasonable application of fed\neral law. Pp. 18–26.\n        (1) The state-court record supports the idea that his counsel\nacted strategically to get the prosecution’s aggravation witnesses ex\ncluded for lack of notice, and if that failed, to put on his mother as a\nmitigation witness. Billing records show that they spent time inves\ntigating mitigating evidence. The record also shows that they had an\nunsympathetic client who had boasted about his criminal history dur\ning the guilt phase, leaving them with limited mitigation strategies.\nIn addition, when Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster had no sig\nnificant mental disorder or defect, he was aware of Pinholster’s medi\ncal and social history. Given these impediments, it would have been\na reasonable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy for\nPinholster’s mother. Pinholster has responded with only a handful of\npost-hoc nondenials by one of his lawyers. Pp. 18–23.\n        (2) The Ninth Circuit misapplied Strickland when it drew from\nthis Court’s recent cases a “constitutional duty to investigate” and a\nprinciple that it was prima facie ineffective for counsel to abandon an\ninvestigation based on rudimentary knowledge of Pinholster’s back\nground. Beyond the general requirement of reasonableness, “specific\nguidelines are not appropriate” under Strickland. 466 U. S., at 688.\nNor did the Ninth Circuit properly apply the strong presumption of\ncompetence mandated by Strickland. Pp. 23–26.\n     (d) Even if his trial counsel had performed deficiently, Pinholster\nalso has failed to show that the State Supreme Court must have un\nreasonably concluded that he was not prejudiced. Pp. 26–31.\n        (1) To determine “whether there is a reasonable probability\nthat, absent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded that”\ndeath was not warranted, Strickland, supra, at 695, the aggravating\nevidence is reweighed “against the totality of available mitigating\nevidence,” Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 534. Here, the State pre\n\f4                       CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    sented extensive aggravating evidence at both the guilt and penalty\n    phases. The mitigating evidence consisted primarily of the penalty\n    phase testimony of Pinholster’s mother and guilt-phase testimony\n    given by his brother. After considering the evidence, the jury re\n    turned a sentence of death, which the state trial court found sup\n    ported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence. Pp. 26–29.\n           (2) There is no reasonable probability that the additional evi\n    dence presented at Pinholster’s state proceedings would have\n    changed the verdict. The “new” evidence largely duplicated the miti\n    gation evidence of his mother and brother at trial. To the extent that\n    there were new factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of ques\n    tionable mitigating value. Dr. Woods’ testimony would have opened\n    the door to rebuttal by a state expert; and new evidence relating to\n    Pinholster’s substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal problems\n    could lead a jury to conclude that he was beyond rehabilitation. The\n    remaining new material in the state habeas record is sparse. Given\n    what little additional mitigating evidence Pinholster presented in\n    state habeas, the Court cannot say that the State Supreme Court’s\n    determination was unreasonable. Pp. 29–30.\n           (3) Because this Court did not apply AEDPA deference to the\n    question of prejudice in Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362, and Rom\n    pilla v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374, those cases lack the important “doubly\n    deferential” standard of Strickland and AEDPA, and thus offer no\n    guidance with respect to whether a state court has unreasonably de\n    termined that prejudice is lacking.

On the way, they\nstopped at Lisa Tapar’s house, where Pinholster put his\nbuck knife through her front door and scratched a swas­\ntika into her car after she refused to talk to him. The\nthree men, who were all armed with buck knives, found no\none at Kumar’s house, broke in, and began ransacking the\nhome. They came across only a small amount of mari­\njuana before Kumar’s friends, Thomas Johnson and\nRobert Beckett, arrived and shouted that they were calling\nthe police.\n  Pinholster and his accomplices tried to escape through\nthe rear door, but Johnson blocked their path. Pinholster\nbacked Johnson onto the patio, demanding drugs and\nmoney and repeatedly striking him in the chest. Johnson\ndropped his wallet on the ground and stopped resisting.\nBeckett then came around the corner, and Pinholster\nattacked him, too, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest.\nPinholster forced Beckett to the ground, took both men’s\nwallets, and began kicking Beckett in the head. Mean­\nwhile, Brown stabbed Johnson in the chest, “ ‘bury[ing] his\nknife to the hilt.’ ” 35 Reporter’s Tr. 4947 (hereinafter Tr.).\nJohnson and Beckett died of their wounds.\n  Corona drove the three men to Pinholster’s apartment.\nWhile in the car, Pinholster and Brown exulted, “ ‘We got\n’em, man, we got ’em good.’ ” Ibid. At the apartment,\nPinholster washed his knife, and the three split the pro­\nceeds of the robbery: $23 and one quarter-ounce of mari­\njuana. Although Pinholster instructed Corona to “lay\nlow,” Corona turned himself in to the police two weeks\nlater. Id., at 4955. Pinholster was arrested shortly there­\nafter and threatened to kill Corona if he did not keep quiet\nabout the burglary and murders. Corona later became the\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nState’s primary witness. The prosecution brought numer­\nous charges against Pinholster, including two counts of\nfirst-degree murder.\n                             B\n  The California trial court appointed Harry Brainard and\nWilbur Dettmar to defend Pinholster on charges of first­\ndegree murder, robbery, and burglary. Before their ap­\npointment, Pinholster had rejected other attorneys and\ninsisted on representing himself. During that time, the\nState had mailed Pinholster a letter in jail informing him\nthat the prosecution planned to offer aggravating evidence\nduring the penalty phase of trial to support a sentence of\ndeath.\n  The guilt phase of the trial began on February 28, 1984.\nPinholster testified on his own behalf and presented an\nalibi defense. He claimed that he had broken into\nKumar’s house alone at around 8 p.m. on January 8, 1982,\nand had stolen marijuana but denied killing anyone.\nPinholster asserted that later that night around 1 a.m.,\nwhile he was elsewhere, Corona went to Kumar’s house to\nsteal more drugs and did not return for three hours.\nPinholster told the jury that he was a “professional rob­\nber,” not a murderer. 43 id., at 6204. He boasted of com­\nmitting hundreds of robberies over the previous six years\nbut insisted that he always used a gun, never a knife. The\njury convicted Pinholster on both counts of first-degree\nmurder.\n  Before the penalty phase, Brainard and Dettmar moved\nto exclude any aggravating evidence on the ground that\nthe prosecution had failed to provide notice of the evidence\nto be introduced, as required by Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§190.3 (West 2008). At a hearing on April 24, Dettmar\nargued that, in reliance on the lack of notice, he was “not\npresently prepared to offer anything by way of mitigation.”\n52 Tr. 7250. He acknowledged, however, that the prosecu­\n\f4                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\ntor “possibly ha[d] met the [notice] requirement.” Ibid.\nThe trial court asked whether a continuance might be\nhelpful, but Dettmar declined, explaining that he could\nnot think of a mitigation witness other than Pinholster’s\nmother and that additional time would not “make a great\ndeal of difference.” Id., at 7257–7258. Three days later,\nafter hearing testimony, the court found that Pinholster\nhad received notice while representing himself and denied\nthe motion to exclude.\n  The penalty phase was held before the same jury that\nhad convicted Pinholster. The prosecution produced eight\nwitnesses, who testified about Pinholster’s history of\nthreatening and violent behavior, including resisting\narrest and assaulting police officers, involvement with\njuvenile gangs, and a substantial prison disciplinary\nrecord. Defense counsel called only Pinholster’s mother,\nBurnice Brashear. She gave an account of Pinholster’s\ntroubled childhood and adolescent years, discussed Pin­\nholster’s siblings, and described Pinholster as “a perfect\ngentleman at home.” Id., at 7405. Defense counsel did not\ncall a psychiatrist, though they had consulted Dr. John\nStalberg at least six weeks earlier. Dr. Stalberg noted\nPinholster’s “psychopathic personality traits,” diagnosed\nhim with antisocial personality disorder, and concluded\nthat he “was not under the influence of extreme mental or\nemotional disturbance” at the time of the murders. App.\n131.\n  After 2½ days of deliberation, the jury unanimously\nvoted for death on each of the two murder counts. On\nmandatory appeal, the California Supreme Court affirmed\nthe judgment. People v. Pinholster, 1 Cal. 4th 865, 824\nP. 2d 571 (1992).\n                           C\n  In August 1993, Pinholster filed his first state habeas\npetition. Represented by new counsel, Pinholster alleged,\n\f                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  5\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\ninter alia, ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty\nphase of his trial. He alleged that Brainard and Dettmar\nhad failed to adequately investigate and present mitigat­\ning evidence, including evidence of mental disorders.\nPinholster supported this claim with school, medical, and\nlegal records, as well as declarations from family mem­\nbers, Brainard, and Dr. George Woods, a psychiatrist who\ndiagnosed Pinholster with bipolar mood disorder and\nseizure disorders. Dr. Woods criticized Dr. Stalberg’s\nreport as incompetent, unreliable, and inaccurate. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court unanimously and summarily1\ndenied Pinholster’s penalty-phase ineffective-assistance\nclaim “on the substantive ground that it is without merit.”\nApp. to Pet. for Cert. 302.\n  Pinholster filed a federal habeas petition in April 1997.\nHe reiterated his previous allegations about penalty-phase\nineffective assistance and also added new allegations that\nhis trial counsel had failed to furnish Dr. Stalberg with\nadequate background materials. In support of the new\nallegations, Dr. Stalberg provided a declaration stating\nthat in 1984, Pinholster’s trial counsel had provided him\nwith only some police reports and a 1978 probation report.\nDr. Stalberg explained that, had he known about the\nmaterial that had since been gathered by Pinholster’s\nhabeas counsel, he would have conducted “further inquiry”\nbefore concluding that Pinholster suffered only from a\npersonality disorder. App. to Brief in Opposition 219. He\nnoted that Pinholster’s school records showed evidence of\n“some degree of brain damage.” Ibid. Dr. Stalberg did\nnot, however, retract his earlier diagnosis. The parties\nstipulated that this declaration had never been submitted\nto the California Supreme Court, and the federal petition\n——————\n  1 Although the California Supreme Court initially issued an order\n\nasking the State to respond, it ultimately withdrew that order as “im-\nprovidently issued.” App. to Pet. for Cert. 302.\n\f6                     CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\nwas held in abeyance to allow Pinholster to go back to\nstate court.\n   In August 1997, Pinholster filed his second state habeas\npetition, this time including Dr. Stalberg’s declaration and\nrequesting judicial notice of the documents previously\nsubmitted in support of his first state habeas petition. His\nallegations of penalty-phase ineffective assistance of coun­\nsel mirrored those in his federal habeas petition. The\nCalifornia Supreme Court again unanimously and sum­\nmarily denied the petition “on the substantive ground that\nit is without merit.”2 App. to Pet. for Cert. 300.\n   Having presented Dr. Stalberg’s declaration to the state\ncourt, Pinholster returned to the District Court. In No­\nvember 1997, he filed an amended petition for a writ of\nhabeas corpus. His allegations of penalty-phase ineffec­\ntive assistance of counsel were identical to those in his\nsecond state habeas petition. Both parties moved for\nsummary judgment and Pinholster also moved, in the\nalternative, for an evidentiary hearing.\n   The District Court concluded that the Antiterrorism and\nEffective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat.\n1214, did not apply and granted an evidentiary hearing.\nBefore the hearing, the State deposed Dr. Stalberg, who\nstated that none of the new material he reviewed altered\nhis original diagnosis. Dr. Stalberg disagreed with Dr.\nWoods’ conclusion that Pinholster suffers from bipolar\ndisorder. Pinholster did not call Dr. Stalberg to testify at\nthe hearing. He presented two new medical experts: Dr.\nSophia Vinogradov, a psychiatrist who diagnosed Pinhol­\nster with organic personality syndrome and ruled out\nantisocial personality disorder, and Dr. Donald Olson, a\n——————\n  2 A majority also “[s]eparately and independently” denied several\n\nclaims, including penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel, as\nuntimely, successive, and barred by res judicata.

Applying pre-\nAEDPA standards, the court granted the habeas petition\n“for inadequacy of counsel by failure to investigate and\npresent mitigation evidence at the penalty hearing.” App.\nto Pet. for Cert. 262. After Woodford v. Garceau, 538 U. S.\n202 (2003), clarified that AEDPA applies to cases like\nPinholster’s, the court amended its order but did not alter\nits conclusion. Over a dissent, a panel of the Court of\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed. Pinholster v.\nAyers, 525 F. 3d 742 (2008).\n   On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals vacated the\npanel opinion and affirmed the District Court’s grant of\nhabeas relief. The en banc court held that the District\nCourt’s evidentiary hearing was not barred by 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(e)(2). The court then determined that new evidence\nfrom the hearing could be considered in assessing whether\nthe California Supreme Court’s decision “was contrary to,\nor involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab­\nlished Federal law” under §2254(d)(1). See 590 F. 3d, at\n666 (“Congress did not intend to restrict the inquiry under\n§2254(d)(1) only to the evidence introduced in the state\nhabeas court”). Taking the District Court evidence into\naccount, the en banc court determined that the California\nSupreme Court unreasonably applied Strickland v. Wash\nington, 466 U. S. 668 (1984), in denying Pinholster’s claim\nof penalty-phase ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   Three judges dissented and rejected the majority’s\nconclusion that the District Court hearing was not barred\nby §2254(e)(2). 590 F. 3d, at 689 (opinion of Kozinski,\n\f8                 CULLEN v.

Limiting its review to the state-court\nrecord, the dissent concluded that the California Supreme\nCourt did not unreasonably apply Strickland. 590 F. 3d,\nat 691–723.\n   We granted certiorari to resolve two questions. 560\nU. S. ___ (2010). First, whether review under §2254(d)(1)\npermits consideration of evidence introduced in an eviden­\ntiary hearing before the federal habeas court. Second,\nwhether the Court of Appeals properly granted Pinholster\nhabeas relief on his claim of penalty-phase ineffective\nassistance of counsel.\n                            II\n  We first consider the scope of the record for a\n§2254(d)(1) inquiry. The State argues that review is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits. Pinholster contends\nthat evidence presented to the federal habeas court may\nalso be considered. We agree with the State.\n                              A\n   As amended by AEDPA, 28 U. S. C. §2254 sets several\nlimits on the power of a federal court to grant an applica­\ntion for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a state pris­\noner. Section 2254(a) permits a federal court to entertain\nonly those applications alleging that a person is in state\ncustody “in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties\nof the United States.” Sections 2254(b) and (c) provide\nthat a federal court may not grant such applications\nunless, with certain exceptions, the applicant has ex­\nhausted state remedies.\n   If an application includes a claim that has been “adjudi­\ncated on the merits in State court proceedings,” §2254(d),\nan additional restriction applies. Under §2254(d), that\napplication “shall not be granted with respect to [such a]\n\f                  Cite as: 563 U.

Richter, 562\nU. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12), and “highly deferen­\ntial standard for evaluating state-court rulings, which\ndemands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of\nthe doubt,” Woodford v. Visciotti, 537 U. S. 19, 24 (2002)\n(per curiam) (citation and internal quotation marks omit­\nted). The petitioner carries the burden of proof. Id., at 25.\n   We now hold that review under §2254(d)(1) is limited to\nthe record that was before the state court that adjudicated\nthe claim on the merits. Section 2254(d)(1) refers, in the\npast tense, to a state-court adjudication that “resulted in”\na decision that was contrary to, or “involved” an unrea­\nsonable application of, established law. This backward­\nlooking language requires an examination of the state­\ncourt decision at the time it was made. It follows that the\nrecord under review is limited to the record in existence at\nthat same time⎯i.e., the record before the state court.\n   This understanding of the text is compelled by “the\nbroader context of the statute as a whole,” which demon­\nstrates Congress’ intent to channel prisoners’ claims first\nto the state courts. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S.\n337, 341 (1997). “The federal habeas scheme leaves pri­\nmary responsibility with the state courts . . . .” Visciotti,\nsupra, at 27. Section 2254(b) requires that prisoners must\nordinarily exhaust state remedies before filing for federal\nhabeas relief. It would be contrary to that purpose to\nallow a petitioner to overcome an adverse state-court\n\f10                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\ndecision with new evidence introduced in a federal habeas\ncourt and reviewed by that court in the first instance\neffectively de novo.\n  Limiting §2254(d)(1) review to the state-court record is\nconsistent with our precedents interpreting that statu­\ntory provision. Our cases emphasize that review under\n§2254(d)(1) focuses on what a state court knew and did.\nState-court decisions are measured against this Court’s\nprecedents as of “the time the state court renders its deci­\nsion.” Lockyer v. Andrade, 538 U. S. 63, 71–72 (2003). To\ndetermine whether a particular decision is “contrary to”\nthen-established law, a federal court must consider\nwhether the decision “applies a rule that contradicts\n[such] law” and how the decision “confronts [the] set of\nfacts” that were before the state court. Williams v. Taylor,\n529 U. S. 362, 405, 406 (2000) (Terry Williams). If the\nstate-court decision “identifies the correct governing legal\nprinciple” in existence at the time, a federal court must\nassess whether the decision “unreasonably applies that\nprinciple to the facts of the prisoner’s case.” Id., at 413. It\nwould be strange to ask federal courts to analyze whether\na state court’s adjudication resulted in a decision that\nunreasonably applied federal law to facts not before the\nstate court.3\n——————\n  3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR argues that there is nothing strange about al­\n\nlowing consideration of new evidence under §2254(d)(1) because, in her\nview, it would not be “so different” from some other tasks that courts\nundertake. Post, at 13 (dissenting opinion). What makes the consid­\neration of new evidence strange is not how “different” the task would\nbe, but rather the notion that a state court can be deemed to have\nunreasonably applied federal law to evidence it did not even know\nexisted. We cannot comprehend how exactly a state court would have\nany control over its application of law to matters beyond its knowledge.\nAdopting JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s approach would not take seriously\nAEDPA’s requirement that federal courts defer to state-court decisions\nand would effectively treat the statute as no more than a “ ‘mood’ that\nthe Federal Judiciary must respect,” Terry Williams, 529 U. S., at 386\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  11\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   Our recent decision in Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S.\n465 (2007), is consistent as well with our holding here. We\nexplained that “[b]ecause the deferential standards pre­\nscribed by §2254 control whether to grant habeas relief, a\nfederal court must take into account those standards in\ndeciding whether an evidentiary hearing is appropriate.”\nId., at 474. In practical effect, we went on to note, this\nmeans that when the state-court record “precludes habeas\nrelief” under the limitations of §2254(d), a district court is\n“not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.” Id., at 474\n(citing with approval the Ninth Circuit’s recognition that\n“an evidentiary hearing is not required on issues that can\nbe resolved by reference to the state court record” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n   The Court of Appeals wrongly interpreted Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 420 (2000) (Michael Williams), as sup­\nporting the contrary view.        The question there was\nwhether the lower court had correctly determined that\n§2254(e)(2) barred the petitioner’s request for a federal\nevidentiary hearing.4 Michael Williams did not concern\nwhether evidence introduced in such a hearing could be\nconsidered under §2254(d)(1). In fact, only one claim at\nissue in that case was even subject to §2254(d); the rest\nhad not been adjudicated on the merits in state-court\nproceedings. See id., at 429 (“Petitioner did not develop,\nor raise, his claims . . . until he filed his federal habeas\npetition”).5\n——————\n(opinion of Stevens, J.).\n  4 If a prisoner has “failed to develop the factual basis of a claim in\n\nState court proceedings,” §2254(e)(2) bars a federal court from holding\nan evidentiary hearing, unless the applicant meets certain statutory\nrequirements.\n  5 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s suggestion that Michael Williams “rejected”\n\nthe conclusion here, see post, at 15, is thus quite puzzling. In the\npassage that she quotes, see ibid., the Court merely explains that\n§2254(e)(2) should be interpreted in a way that does not preclude a\nstate prisoner, who was diligent in state habeas court and who can\n\f12                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                         Opinion of the Court\n\n   If anything, the decision in Michael Williams supports\nour holding. The lower court in that case had determined\nthat the one claim subject to §2254(d)(1) did not satisfy\nthat statutory requirement. In light of that ruling, this\nCourt concluded that it was “unnecessary to reach the\nquestion whether §2254(e)(2) would permit a [federal]\nhearing on th[at] claim.” Id., at 444. That conclusion is\nfully consistent with our holding that evidence later intro­\nduced in federal court is irrelevant to §2254(d)(1) review.\n   The Court of Appeals’ reliance on Holland v. Jackson,\n542 U. S. 649 (2004) (per curiam), was also mistaken. In\nHolland, we initially stated that “whether a state court’s\ndecision was unreasonable [under §2254(d)(1)] must be\nassessed in light of the record the court had before it.” Id.,\nat 652. We then went on to assume for the sake of argu­\nment what some Courts of Appeals had held⎯that\n§2254(d)(1), despite its mandatory language, simply does\nnot apply when a federal habeas court has admitted new\nevidence that supports a claim previously adjudicated in\nstate court.6 Id., at 653. There was no reason to decide\nthat question because regardless, the hearing should have\nbeen barred by §2254(e)(2). Today, we reject that assump­\ntion and hold that evidence introduced in federal court\nhas no bearing on §2254(d)(1) review. If a claim has\nbeen adjudicated on the merits by a state court, a fed­\neral habeas petitioner must overcome the limitation of\n§2254(d)(1) on the record that was before that state court.7\n——————\nsatisfy §2254(d), from receiving an evidentiary hearing.\n  6 In Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U. S. 74 (2005) (per curiam), on which\n\nthe Court of Appeals also relied, we made the same assumption. Id., at\n79–80 (discussing the State’s “Holland argument”).\n  7 Pinholster and JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR place great weight on the fact\n\nthat §2254(d)(2) includes the language “in light of the evidence pre­\nsented in the State court proceeding,” whereas §2254(d)(1) does not.\nSee post, at 6–7. The additional clarity of §2254(d)(2) on this point,\nhowever, does not detract from our view that §2254(d)(1) also is plainly\nlimited to the state-court record. The omission of clarifying language\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U.

Section 2254(e)(2)\nimposes a limitation on the discretion of federal habeas\ncourts to take new evidence in an evidentiary hearing.\nSee Landrigan, supra, at 473 (noting that district courts,\nunder AEDPA, generally retain the discretion to grant an\nevidentiary hearing). Like §2254(d)(1), it carries out\n“AEDPA’s goal of promoting comity, finality, and federal­\nism by giving state courts the first opportunity to review\n[a] claim, and to correct any constitutional violation in the\nfirst instance.” Jimenez v. Quarterman, 555 U. S. 113, ___\n(2009) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).8\n   Section 2254(e)(2) continues to have force where\n§2254(d)(1) does not bar federal habeas relief. For exam­\nple, not all federal habeas claims by state prisoners fall\nwithin the scope of §2254(d), which applies only to claims\n“adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.” At\na minimum, therefore, §2254(e)(2) still restricts the discre­\ntion of federal habeas courts to consider new evidence\nwhen deciding claims that were not adjudicated on the\nmerits in state court. See, e.g., Michael Williams, 529\nU. S., at 427–429.9\n   Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new\n——————\nfrom §2254(d)(1) just as likely reflects Congress’ belief that such lan­\nguage was unnecessary as it does anything else.\n  8 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s argument that §2254(d)(1) must be read in a\n\nway that “accommodates” §2254(e)(2), see post, at 9, rests on a funda­\nmental misunderstanding of §2254(e)(2). The focus of that section is\nnot on “preserving the opportunity” for hearings, post, at 9, but rather\non limiting the discretion of federal district courts in holding hearings.\nWe see no need in this case to address the proper application of\n§2254(e)(2). See n. 20, infra. But see post, at 12 (suggesting that we\nhave given §2254(e)(2) “an unnaturally cramped reading”).\n  9 In all events, of course, the requirements of §§2254(a) through (c)\n\nremain significant limitations on the power of a federal court to grant\nhabeas relief.\n\f14                   CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                        Opinion of the Court\n\nevidence in federal court, AEDPA’s statutory scheme is\ndesigned to strongly discourage them from doing so.\nProvisions like §§2254(d)(1) and (e)(2) ensure that\n“[f]ederal courts sitting in habeas are not an alternative\nforum for trying facts and issues which a prisoner made\ninsufficient effort to pursue in state proceedings.” Id., at\n437; see also Richter, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13)\n(“Section 2254(d) is part of the basic structure of federal\nhabeas jurisdiction, designed to confirm that state courts\nare the principal forum for asserting constitutional chal­\nlenges to state convictions”); Wainwright v.

Under California law, the California Supreme Court’s sum­\nmary denial of a habeas petition on the merits reflects that court’s\ndetermination that “the claims made in th[e] petition do not state a\nprima facie case entitling the petitioner to relief.” In re Clark, 5\nCal. 4th 750, 770, 855 P. 2d 729, 741–742 (1993). It appears that the\ncourt generally assumes the allegations in the petition to be true, but\ndoes not accept wholly conclusory allegations, People v. Duvall, 9\nCal. 4th 464, 474, 886 P. 2d 1252, 1258 (1995), and will also “review the\nrecord of the trial . . . to assess the merits of the petitioner’s claims,”\nClark, supra, at 770, 855 P. 2d, at 742.\n   The specific contents of the state-court record depend on which of the\ntwo state habeas proceedings is at issue. One amicus curiae suggests\nthat both are at issue⎯that is, Pinholster must prove that both Cali­\nfornia Supreme Court proceedings involved an unreasonable applica­\ntion of law under §2254(d)(1). See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal\nFoundation 26. By contrast, the most favorable approach for Pinholster\nwould be review of only the second state habeas proceeding, the record\nof which includes all of the evidence that Pinholster ever submitted in\nstate habeas. We have not previously ruled on how to proceed in these\ncircumstances, and we need not do so here. Even taking the approach\nmost favorable to Pinholster, and reviewing only whether the California\nSupreme Court was objectively unreasonable in the second state\nhabeas proceeding, we find that Pinholster has failed to satisfy\n§2254(d)(1).\n\f                  Cite as: 563 U.

Pinholster must demonstrate that it was necessarily\nunreasonable for the California Supreme Court to con­\nclude: (1) that he had not overcome the strong presump­\ntion of competence; and (2) that he had failed to under­\nmine confidence in the jury’s sentence of death.\n                              C\n                              1\n   Pinholster has not shown that the California Supreme\nCourt’s decision that he could not demonstrate deficient\nperformance by his trial counsel necessarily involved an\nunreasonable application of federal law. In arguing to the\nstate court that his counsel performed deficiently, Pinhol­\nster contended that they should have pursued and pre­\nsented additional evidence about: his family members and\ntheir criminal, mental, and substance abuse problems; his\nschooling; and his medical and mental health history,\nincluding his epileptic disorder. To support his allegation\nthat his trial counsel had “no reasonable tactical basis” for\nthe approach they took, Pinholster relied on statements\nhis counsel made at trial. App. to Brief in Opposition 143.\nWhen arguing the motion to exclude the State’s aggravat­\ning evidence at the penalty phase for failure to comply\nwith Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3, Dettmar, one of Pinhol­\nster’s counsel, contended that because the State did not\nprovide notice, he “[was] not presently prepared to offer\nanything by way of mitigation,” 52 Tr. 7250. In response\nto the trial court’s inquiry as to whether a continuance\nmight be helpful, Dettmar noted that the only mitigation\nwitness he could think of was Pinholster’s mother. Addi­\ntional time, Dettmar stated, would not “make a great deal\nof difference.” Id., at 7257–7258.\n   We begin with the premise that “under the circum­\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          19\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nstances, the challenged action[s] might be considered\nsound trial strategy. ” Strickland, supra, at 689 (internal\nquotation marks omitted). The Court of Appeals dissent\ndescribed one possible strategy:\n    “[Pinholster’s attorneys] were fully aware that they\n    would have to deal with mitigation sometime during\n    the course of the trial, did spend considerable time\n    and effort investigating avenues for mitigation[,] and\n    made a reasoned professional judgment that the best\n    way to serve their client would be to rely on the fact\n    that they never got [the required §190.3] notice and\n    hope the judge would bar the state from putting on\n    their aggravation witnesses.” 590 F. 3d, at 701–702\n    (opinion of Kozinski, C. J.).\nFurther, if their motion was denied, counsel were pre­\npared to present only Pinholster’s mother in the penalty\nphase to create sympathy not for Pinholster, but for his\nmother. After all, the “ ‘family sympathy’ ” mitigation\ndefense was known to the defense bar in California at the\ntime and had been used by other attorneys. Id., at 707.\nRather than displaying neglect, we presume that Dett­\nmar’s arguments were part of this trial strategy. See\nGentry, supra, at 8 (“[T]here is a strong presumption that\n[counsel took certain actions] for tactical reasons rather\nthan through sheer neglect” (citing Strickland, supra, at\n690)).\n  The state-court record supports the idea that Pinhol­\nster’s counsel acted strategically to get the prosecution’s\naggravation witnesses excluded for lack of notice, and if\nthat failed, to put on Pinholster’s mother. Other state­\nments made during the argument regarding the motion to\nexclude suggest that defense counsel were trying to take\nadvantage of a legal technicality and were not truly sur­\nprised. Brainard and Dettmar acknowledged that the\nprosecutor had invited them on numerous occasions to\n\f20                     CULLEN v.

Dettmar admitted that the prosecu­\ntor, “being as thorough as she is, possibly ha[d] met the\nrequirement.” Id., at 7250. But if so, he wanted her “to\nmake that representation to the court.”13 Ibid.\n   Timesheets indicate that Pinholster’s trial counsel\ninvestigated mitigating evidence.14 Long before the guilty\nverdict, Dettmar talked with Pinholster’s mother and\ncontacted a psychiatrist.15 On February 26, two months\nbefore the penalty phase started, he billed six hours\nfor “[p]reparation argument, death penalty phase.” See\nClerk’s Tr. 864. Brainard, who merely assisted Dettmar\nfor the penalty phase, researched epilepsy and also inter­\nviewed Pinholster’s mother.16 We know that Brainard\nlikely spent additional time, not reflected in these entries,\npreparing Pinholster’s brother, Terry, who provided some\nmitigation testimony about Pinholster’s background dur­\n\n——————\n  13 Counsel’s argument was persuasive enough to cause the trial court\n\nto hold a hearing and take testimony before denying the motion to\nexclude.\n  14 Both parties agree that these billing records were before the Cali­\n\nfornia Supreme Court.

Infra, at 28.\n   The record also shows that Pinholster’s counsel con­\nfronted a challenging penalty phase with an unsympa­\nthetic client, which limited their feasible mitigation\nstrategies. By the end of the guilt phase, the jury had\nobserved Pinholster “glor[y]” in “his criminal disposition”\nand “hundreds of robberies.” Pinholster, 1 Cal. 4th, at\n945, 907, 824 P. 2d, at 611, 584. During his cross­\nexamination, Pinholster laughed or smirked when he told\nthe jury that his “occupation” was “a crook,” when he was\nasked whether he had threatened a potential witness, and\nwhen he described thwarting police efforts to recover a\ngun he had once used. 44 Tr. 6225. He bragged about\nbeing a “professional robber.” 43 id., at 6204. To sup-\nport his defense, Pinholster claimed that he used only\nguns⎯not knives⎯to commit his crimes. But during\ncross-examination, Pinholster admitted that he had previ­\nously been convicted of using a knife in a kidnaping.\nPinholster also said he was a white supremacist and that\nhe frequently carved swastikas into other people’s prop­\nerty as “a sideline to robbery.” 44 id., at 6246.\n   Trial counsel’s psychiatric expert, Dr. Stalberg, had\nconcluded that Pinholster showed no significant signs or\nsymptoms of mental disorder or defect other than his\n“psychopathic personality traits.” App. 131. Dr. Stalberg\nwas aware of Pinholster’s hyperactivity as a youngster,\nhospitalization at age 14 for incorrigibility, alleged epilep­\ntic disorder, and history of drug dependency. Neverthe­\nless, Dr. Stalberg told counsel that Pinholster did not\nappear to suffer from brain damage, was not significantly\nintoxicated or impaired on the night in question, and did\nnot have an impaired ability to appreciate the criminality\nof his conduct.\n   Given these impediments, it would have been a reason­\nable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy\nfor Pinholster’s mother. In fact, such a family sympathy\n\f22                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\ndefense is precisely how the State understood defense\ncounsel’s strategy. The prosecutor carefully opened her\ncross-examination of Pinholster’s mother with, “I hope you\nunderstand I don’t enjoy cross-examining a mother of\nanybody.” 52 Tr. 7407. And in her closing argument, the\nprosecutor attempted to undercut defense counsel’s strat­\negy by pointing out, “Even the most heinous person born,\neven Adolph Hitler[,] probably had a mother who loved\nhim.” 53 id., at 7452.\n   Pinholster’s only response to this evidence is a series of\ndeclarations from Brainard submitted with Pinholster’s\nfirst state habeas petition, seven years after the trial.\nBrainard declares that he has “no recollection” of inter­\nviewing any family members (other than Pinholster’s\nmother) regarding penalty-phase testimony, of attempting\nto secure Pinholster’s school or medical records, or of\ninterviewing any former teachers or counselors. Pet. for\nWrit of Habeas Corpus in No. S004616 (Cal.), Exh. 3.\nBrainard also declares that Dettmar was primarily re­\nsponsible for mental health issues in the case, but he has\n“no recollection” of Dettmar ever having secured Pinhol­\nster’s medical records. Id., Exh. 2. Dettmar neither con­\nfirmed nor denied Brainard’s statements, as he had died\nby the time of the first state habeas petition. 590 F. 3d, at\n700 (Kozinski, C. J., dissenting).\n   In sum, Brainard and Dettmar made statements sug­\ngesting that they were not surprised that the State in­\ntended to put on aggravating evidence, billing records\nshow that they spent time investigating mitigating evi­\ndence, and the record demonstrates that they represented\na psychotic client whose performance at trial hardly en­\ndeared him to the jury. Pinholster has responded to this\nevidence with only a handful of post-hoc nondenials by one\nof his lawyers. The California Supreme Court could have\nreasonably concluded that Pinholster had failed to rebut\nthe presumption of competence mandated by Strickland—\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U.

Smith, 539 U. S.\n510 (2003)], and Rompilla [v. Beard, 545 U. S. 374 (2005)],\nwhere in each case the Supreme Court upheld the peti­\ntioner’s ineffective assistance claim.” 590 F. 3d, at 671.\nThe court drew from those cases a “constitutional duty to\ninvestigate,” id., at 674, and the principle that “[i]t is\nprima facie ineffective assistance for counsel to ‘abandon[ ]\ntheir investigation of [the] petitioner’s background after\nhaving acquired only rudimentary knowledge of his his­\ntory from a narrow set of sources,’ ” ibid. (quoting Wiggins\nv. Smith, 539 U. S. 510, 524–525 (2003)). The court ex­\nplained that it could not “lightly disregard” a failure to\nintroduce evidence of “excruciating life history” or “night­\nmarish childhood.” 590 F. 3d, at 684 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted).\n   The Court of Appeals misapplied Strickland and over­\nlooked “the constitutionally protected independence of\ncounsel and . . . the wide latitude counsel must have in\nmaking tactical decisions.” 466 U. S., at 689. Beyond the\ngeneral requirement of reasonableness, “specific guide­\nlines are not appropriate.” Id., at 688. “No particular set\nof detailed rules for counsel’s conduct can satisfactorily\ntake account of the variety of circumstances faced by\ndefense counsel or the range of legitimate decisions . . . .”\nId., at 688–689. Strickland itself rejected the notion that\nthe same investigation will be required in every case.

The Court of Appeals erred\nin attributing strict rules to this Court’s recent case law.17\n   Nor did the Court of Appeals properly apply the strong\npresumption of competence that Strickland mandates.\nThe court dismissed the dissent’s application of the pre­\nsumption as “fabricat[ing] an excuse that the attorneys\nthemselves could not conjure up.” 590 F. 3d, at 673. But\nStrickland specifically commands that a court “must\nindulge [the] strong presumption” that counsel “made all\nsignificant decisions in the exercise of reasonable profes­\nsional judgment.” 466 U. S., at 689–690. The Court of\nAppeals was required not simply to “give [the] attorneys\nthe benefit of the doubt,” 590 F. 3d, at 673, but to affirma­\ntively entertain the range of possible “reasons Pinholster’s\ncounsel may have had for proceeding as they did,” id., at\n692 (Kozinski, C. J., dissenting). See also Richter, supra,\nat ___ (slip op., at 20) (“Strickland . . . calls for an inquiry\ninto the objective reasonableness of counsel’s performance,\nnot counsel’s subjective state of mind”).\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR questions whether it would have\nbeen a reasonable professional judgment for Pinholster’s\ntrial counsel to adopt a family-sympathy mitigation de­\nfense. Post, at 27. She cites no evidence, however, that\nsuch an approach would have been inconsistent with the\nstandard of professional competence in capital cases that\nprevailed in Los Angeles in 1984. Indeed, she does not\ncontest that, at the time, the defense bar in California had\nbeen using that strategy. See supra, at 19; post, at 28,\nn. 21.

According to JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR,\nthat Pinholster was an unsympathetic client “com­\npound[ed], rather than excuse[d], counsel’s deficiency” in\npursuing further evidence “that could explain why Pinhol­\nster was the way he was.” Post, at 30. But it certainly can\nbe reasonable for attorneys to conclude that creating\nsympathy for the defendant’s family is a better idea be­\ncause the defendant himself is simply unsympathetic.\n   JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s approach is flatly inconsistent\nwith Strickland’s recognition that “[t]here are countless\nways to provide effective assistance in any given case.”\n466 U. S., at 689. There comes a point where a defense\nattorney will reasonably decide that another strategy is in\norder, thus “mak[ing] particular investigations unneces­\nsary.” Id., at 691; cf. 590 F. 3d, at 692 (Kozinski, C. J.,\ndissenting) (“The current infatuation with ‘humanizing’\nthe defendant as the be-all and end-all of mitigation disre­\ngards the possibility that this may be the wrong tactic in\nsome cases because experienced lawyers conclude that the\njury simply won’t buy it”). Those decisions are due “a\nheavy measure of deference.” Strickland, supra, at 691.\nThe California Supreme Court could have reasonably\nconcluded that Pinholster’s counsel made such a reasoned\ndecision in this case.\n   We have recently reiterated that “ ‘[s]urmounting Strick\nland’s high bar is never an easy task.’ ” Richter, supra, at\n___ (slip op., at 15) (quoting Padilla v.

We therefore “reweigh\nthe evidence in aggravation against the totality of avail­\nable mitigating evidence.” Wiggins, supra, at 534.\n                             1\n  We turn first to the aggravating and mitigating evi­\ndence that the sentencing jury considered. See Strickland,\nsupra, at 695 (“[A] court hearing an ineffectiveness claim\nmust consider the totality of the evidence before the judge\nor jury”). Here, the same jury heard both the guilt and\npenalty phases and was instructed to consider all the\nevidence presented. Cf. Visciotti, 537 U. S., at 25 (noting\nthat the state habeas court had correctly considered miti­\ngating evidence introduced during the guilt phase).\n  The State presented extensive aggravating evidence. As\nwe have already discussed, the jury watched Pinholster\nrevel in his extensive criminal history. Supra, at 21.\nThen, during the penalty phase, the State presented evi­\ndence that Pinholster had threatened to kill the State’s\nlead witness, assaulted a man with a straight razor, and\nkidnaped another person with a knife.

The jury also heard about Pinholster’s involve­\nment in juvenile gangs and his substantial disciplinary\nrecord in both county and state jails, where he had threat­\nened, assaulted, and thrown urine at guards, and fought\nwith other inmates. While in jail, Pinholster had been\nsegregated for a time due to his propensity for violence\nand placed on a “special disciplinary diet” reserved only\nfor the most disruptive inmates. 52 Tr. 7305.\n   The mitigating evidence consisted primarily of the\npenalty-phase testimony of Pinholster’s mother, Brashear,\nwho gave a detailed account of Pinholster’s troubled child­\nhood and adolescence. Early childhood was quite difficult.\nThe family “didn’t have lots of money.” Id., at 7404.\nWhen he was very young, Pinholster suffered two serious\nhead injuries, first at age 2 or 3 when he was run over by a\ncar, and again at age 4 or 5 when he went through the\nwindshield during a car accident. When he was 5, Pinhol­\nster’s stepfather moved in and was abusive, or nearly so.\n   Pinholster always struggled in school. He was disrup­\ntive in kindergarten and was failing by first grade. He got\nin fights and would run out of the classroom. In third\ngrade, Pinholster’s teacher suggested that he was more\nthan just a “ ‘disruptive child.’ ” Id., at 7394. Following\ntests at a clinic, Pinholster was sent to a school for educa­\ntionally handicapped children where his performance\nimproved.\n   At age 10, psychiatrists recommended that Pinholster\nbe sent to a mental institution, although he did not go.\nPinholster had continued to initiate fights with his broth­\ners and to act like “Robin Hood” around the neighborhood,\n——————\n  18 Pinholster’s wife waived her spousal privilege to testify to this fact.\n\nShe acknowledged that her testimony would be used to argue that her\nhusband should be executed.\n\f28                   CULLEN v.

Brashear had thought then that “[s]omething was\nnot working right.” Id., at 7396.\n   By age 10 or 11, Pinholster was living in boy’s homes\nand juvenile halls. He spent six months when he was 12\nin a state mental institution for emotionally handicapped\nchildren. By the time he was 18, Pinholster was in county\njail, where he was beaten badly. Brashear suspected that\nthe beating caused Pinholster’s epilepsy, for which he has\nbeen prescribed medication. After a stint in state prison,\nPinholster returned home but acted “unusual” and had\ntrouble readjusting to life. Id., at 7405.\n   Pinholster’s siblings were “basically very good children,”\nalthough they would get into trouble. Id., at 7401. His\nbrother, Terry, had been arrested for drunk driving and\nhis sister, Tammy, for public intoxication. Tammy also\nwas arrested for drug possession and was self-destructive\nand “wild.” Ibid. Pinholster’s eldest brother, Alvin, died a\nfugitive from California authorities.19\n   In addition to Brashear’s penalty-phase testimony,\nPinholster had previously presented mitigating evidence\nduring the guilt phase from his brother, Terry. Terry\ntestified that Pinholster was “more or less in institutions\nall his life,” suffered from epilepsy, and was “more or less”\ndrunk on the night of the murders. 42 id., at 6015, 6036.\n   After considering this aggravating and mitigating evi­\ndence, the jury returned a sentence of death. The state\n\n——————\n  19 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR criticizes Brashear’s testimony as “self­\n\ninterested,” post, at 31, but the whole premise of the family-sympathy\ndefense is the family’s interest. She similarly makes much of the fact\nthat the prosecutor “belittle[d]” Brashear’s testimony in closing argu­\nment. Post, at 33. We fail to see the point. Any diligent prosecutor\nwould have challenged whatever mitigating evidence the defense had\nput on. And, we would certainly not expect the prosecutor’s closing\nargument to have described the evidence in the light most favorable to\nPinholster. But see ibid., n. 26.\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U.

The “new”\nevidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence at\ntrial. School and medical records basically substantiate\nthe testimony of Pinholster’s mother and brother. Decla­\nrations from Pinholster’s siblings support his mother’s\ntestimony that his stepfather was abusive and explain\nthat Pinholster was beaten with fists, belts, and even\nwooden boards.\n   To the extent the state habeas record includes new\nfactual allegations or evidence, much of it is of question­\nable mitigating value. If Pinholster had called Dr. Woods\nto testify consistently with his psychiatric report, Pinhol­\nster would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state\nexpert. See, e.g., Wong v. Belmontes, 558 U. S. ___, ___\n(2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 10–12) (taking into account\nthat certain mitigating evidence would have exposed the\npetitioner to further aggravating evidence). The new\nevidence relating to Pinholster’s family⎯their more seri­\nous substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal prob­\nlems, see post, at 22⎯is also by no means clearly mitigat­\ning, as the jury might have concluded that Pinholster was\nsimply beyond rehabilitation. Cf. Atkins v. Virginia, 536\nU. S. 304, 321 (2002) (recognizing that mitigating evidence\ncan be a “two-edged sword” that juries might find to show\nfuture dangerousness).\n   The remaining new material in the state habeas record\nis sparse.

Pinholster apparently\nlooked like his biological father, whom his grandparents\n“loathed.” Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. S004616\n(Cal.), Exh. 98, p. 1. Accordingly, whenever his grandpar­\nents “spanked or disciplined” the kids, Pinholster “always\ngot the worst of it.” Ibid. Pinholster was mostly unsuper­\nvised and “didn’t get much love,” because his mother and\nstepfather were always working and “were more concerned\nwith their own lives than the welfare of their kids.” Id., at\n2. Neither parent seemed concerned about Pinholster’s\nschooling. Finally, Pinholster’s aunt once saw the children\nmixing flour and water to make something to eat, al­\nthough “[m]ost meals consisted of canned spaghetti and\nfoods of that ilk.” Id., at 1.\n   Given what little additional mitigating evidence Pinhol­\nster presented in state habeas, we cannot say that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s determination was unreason­\nable. Having already heard much of what is included in\nthe state habeas record, the jury returned a sentence of\ndeath. Moreover, some of the new testimony would likely\nhave undercut the mitigating value of the testimony by\nPinholster’s mother. The new material is thus not so\nsignificant that, even assuming Pinholster’s trial counsel\nperformed deficiently, it was necessarily unreasonable for\nthe California Supreme Court to conclude that Pinholster\nhad failed to show a “substantial” likelihood of a different\nsentence.

But this Court did not apply AEDPA deference to the\nquestion of prejudice in those cases; each of them lack the\nimportant “doubly deferential” standard of Strickland and\nAEDPA.

S. C. §2254(d)(1) must\ntake into account the evidence admitted at that hearing.\nAs the dissent points out, refusing to consider the evidence\nreceived in the hearing in federal court gives §2254(e)(2)\nan implausibly narrow scope and will lead either to results\nthat Congress surely did not intend or to the distortion of\nother provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death\nPenalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and the law\non “cause and prejudice.” See post, at 9–12 (opinion of\nSOTOMAYOR, J.).\n  Under AEDPA evidentiary hearings in federal court\nshould be rare. The petitioner generally must have made\na diligent effort to produce in state court the new evidence\non which he seeks to rely. See §2254(e)(2); Williams v.\nTaylor, 529 U. S. 420, 433–434 (2000). If that requirement\nis not satisfied, the petitioner may establish the factual\npredicate for a claim in a federal-court hearing only if,\namong other things, “the facts underlying the claim would\nbe sufficient to establish by clear and convincing evidence\nthat but for constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder\n\f2                 CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      Opinion of ALITO, J.\n\nwould have found the applicant guilty of the underlying\noffense.” §2254(e)(2)(B).\n   Even when the petitioner does satisfy the diligence\nstandard adopted in Williams v. Taylor, supra, a hearing\nshould not be held in federal court unless the new evi\ndence that the petitioner seeks to introduce was not and\ncould not have been offered in the state-court proceeding.\nSection 2254(e)(2) bars a hearing in certain situations, but\nit does not mean that a hearing is allowed in all other\nsituations. See Schriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 473–\n474 (2007). The whole thrust of AEDPA is essentially to\nreserve federal habeas relief for those cases in which the\nstate courts acted unreasonably. See §§2254(d)(1), (2),\n(e)(1). Permitting a petitioner to obtain federal habeas\nrelief on the basis of evidence that could have been but\nwas not offered in state court would upset this scheme.\n   In this case, for essentially the reasons set out in the\ndissent from the Court of Appeals’ en banc decision, see\nPinholster v. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651, 688–691 (CA9 2009)\n(opinion of Kozinski, J.), I would hold that the federal\ncourt hearing should not have been held because respon\ndent did not diligently present his new evidence to the\nCalifornia courts.

Compare\nante, at 14–31 (majority opinion), with post, at 17–42\n(SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting).\n   Like the Court, I believe that its understanding of\n28 U. S. C. §2254(d)(1) does not leave AEDPA’s hearing\nsection, §2254(e), without work to do. An offender who\nbelieves he is entitled to habeas relief must first present a\nclaim (including his evidence) to the state courts. If the\nstate courts reject the claim, then a federal habeas court\nmay review that rejection on the basis of the materials\nconsidered by the state court. If the federal habeas court\nfinds that the state-court decision fails (d)’s test (or if (d)\ndoes not apply), then an (e) hearing may be needed.\n   For example, if the state-court rejection assumed the\nhabeas petitioner’s facts (deciding that, even if those facts\nwere true, federal law was not violated), then (after find\ning the state court wrong on a (d) ground) an (e) hearing\nmight be needed to determine whether the facts alleged\nwere indeed true. Or if the state-court rejection rested on\na state ground, which a federal habeas court found inade\n\f2                  CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nquate, then an (e) hearing might be needed to consider the\npetitioner’s (now unblocked) substantive federal claim. Or\nif the state-court rejection rested on only one of several\nrelated federal grounds (e.g., that counsel’s assistance was\nnot “inadequate”), then, if the federal court found that the\nstate court’s decision in respect to the ground it decided\nviolated (d), an (e) hearing might be needed to consider\nother related parts of the whole constitutional claim (e.g.,\nwhether the counsel’s “inadequate” assistance was also\nprejudicial). There may be other situations in which an (e)\nhearing is needed as well.\n   In this case, however, we cannot say whether an (e)\nhearing is needed until we know whether the state court,\nin rejecting Pinholster’s claim on the basis presented to\nthat state court, violated (d). (In my view, the lower\ncourts’ analysis in respect to this matter is inadequate.)\n   There is no role in (d) analysis for a habeas petitioner to\nintroduce evidence that was not first presented to the\nstate courts. But that does not mean that Pinholster is\nwithout recourse to present new evidence. He can always\nreturn to state court presenting new evidence not previ\nously presented. If the state court again denies relief, he\nmight be able to return to federal court to make claims\nrelated to the latest rejection, subject to AEDPA’s limita\ntions on successive petitions. See §2244.\n   I am not trying to predict the future course of these\nproceedings. I point out only that, in my view, AEDPA is\nnot designed to take necessary remedies from a habeas\npetitioner but to give the State a first opportunity to con\nsider most matters and to insist that federal courts prop\nerly respect state-court determinations.\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U.

Congress recognized as much when it en\nacted the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of\n1996 (AEDPA), 110 Stat. 1214, and permitted therein the\nintroduction of new evidence in federal habeas proceed\nings in certain limited circumstances. See 28 U. S. C.\n§2254(e)(2). Under the Court’s novel interpretation of\n§2254(d)(1), however, federal courts must turn a blind eye\nto new evidence in deciding whether a petitioner has\nsatisfied §2254(d)(1)’s threshold obstacle to federal habeas\nrelief—even when it is clear that the petitioner would be\nentitled to relief in light of that evidence. In reading\nthe statute to “compe[l]” this harsh result, ante, at 9,\nthe Court ignores a key textual difference between\n§§2254(d)(1) and 2254(d)(2) and discards the previous\nunderstanding in our precedents that new evidence can, in\nfact, inform the §2254(d)(1) inquiry. I therefore dissent\nfrom the Court’s first holding.\n   I also disagree with the Court that, even if the\n§2254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state-court record,\nrespondent Scott Pinholster failed to demonstrate that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s decision denying his ineffec\n\f2                 CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ntive-assistance-of-counsel claim was an unreasonable\napplication of Strickland v. Washington, 466 U. S. 668\n(1984). There is no reason for the majority to decide\nwhether the §2254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state\ncourt record because Pinholster satisfied §2254(d)(1) on\neither the state- or federal-court record.\n                             I\n  The Court first holds that, in determining whether a\nstate-court decision is an unreasonable application of\nSupreme Court precedent under §2254(d)(1), “review . . . is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.” Ante, at 9. New\nevidence adduced at a federal evidentiary hearing is\nnow irrelevant to determining whether a petitioner has\nsatisfied §2254(d)(1). This holding is unnecessary to pro\nmote AEDPA’s purposes, and it is inconsistent with the\nprovision’s text, the structure of the statute, and our\nprecedents.\n                              A\n   To understand the significance of the majority’s holding,\nit is important to view the issue in context. AEDPA’s\nentire structure—which gives state courts the opportunity\nto decide factual and legal questions in the first instance—\nensures that evidentiary hearings in federal habeas pro\nceedings are very rare. See N. King, F. Cheesman, & B.\nOstrom, Final Technical Report: Habeas Litigation in\nU. S. District Courts 35–36 (2007) (evidentiary hearings\nunder AEDPA occur in 0.4 percent of noncapital cases and\n9.5 percent of capital cases). Even absent the new restric\ntion created by today’s holding, AEDPA erects multiple\nhurdles to a state prisoner’s ability to introduce new evi\ndence in a federal habeas proceeding.\n   First, “[u]nder the exhaustion requirement, a habeas\npetitioner challenging a state conviction must first at\n\f                    Cite as: 563 U.

S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13); see also\n§2254(b)(1)(A). With certain narrow exceptions, federal\ncourts cannot consider a claim at all, let alone accept new\nevidence relevant to the claim, if it has not been exhausted\nin state court.1 The exhaustion requirement thus reserves\nto state courts the first opportunity to resolve factual\ndisputes relevant to a state prisoner’s claim.            See\nO’Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U. S. 838, 845 (1999).\n  Second, the exhaustion requirement is “complement[ed]”\nby the standards set forth in §2254(d). Harrington, 562\nU. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14). Under this provision, a fed\neral court may not grant habeas relief on any “claim that\nwas adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings”\nunless the adjudication\n        “(1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n     involved an unreasonable application of, clearly estab\n     lished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n     Court of the United States; or\n        “(2) resulted in a decision that was based on an un\n     reasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n     evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”\nThese standards “control whether to grant habeas relief.”\nSchriro v. Landrigan, 550 U. S. 465, 474 (2007). Accord\ningly, we have said, if the factual allegations a petitioner\nseeks to prove at an evidentiary hearing would not satisfy\nthese standards, there is no reason for a hearing. See id.,\nat 481. In such a case, the district court may exercise its\n“discretion to deny an evidentiary hearing.” Ibid.; see also\ninfra, at 13–14.

Taylor, 529 U. S.\n420, 435 (2000) (Michael Williams). Thus, §2254(e)(2)\nprovides:\n     “If the applicant has failed to develop the factual basis\n     of a claim in State court proceedings, the court shall\n     not hold an evidentiary hearing on the claim unless\n     the applicant shows that—\n        “(A) the claim relies on—\n        “(i) a new rule of constitutional law, made retroac\n     tive to cases on collateral review by the Supreme\n     Court, that was previously unavailable; or\n        “(ii) a factual predicate that could not have been\n     previously discovered through the exercise of due dili\n     gence; and\n        “(B) the facts underlying the claim would be suffi\n     cient to establish by clear and convincing evidence\n     that but for constitutional error, no reasonable fact\n     finder would have found the applicant guilty of the\n     underlying offense.”\nIn Michael Williams, we construed the opening clause of\nthis provision—which triggers the bar on evidentiary\nhearings—to apply when “there is lack of diligence, or\nsome greater fault, attributable to the prisoner or the\nprisoner’s counsel.”2 Id., at 432. AEDPA thus bars an\n——————\n  2 Section 2254(e)(2) also governs an attempt to obtain relief “based on\n\nnew evidence without an evidentiary hearing.” Holland v. Jackson, 542\nU.

Section 2254(e)(2) in this way incen\ntivizes state petitioners to develop the factual basis of\ntheir claims in state court.\n   To the limited extent that federal evidentiary hearings\nare available under AEDPA, they ensure that petitioners\nwho diligently developed the factual basis of their claims\nin state court, discovered new evidence after the state\ncourt proceeding, and cannot return to state court retain\nthe ability to access the Great Writ. See ante, at 2 (ALITO,\nJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). “When\nCongress codified new rules governing this previously\njudicially managed area of law, it did so without losing\nsight of the fact that the ‘writ of habeas corpus plays a\nvital role in protecting constitutional rights.’ ” Holland v.\nFlorida, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 16) (quoting\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U. S. 473, 483 (2000)). Allowing a\npetitioner to introduce new evidence at a hearing in the\nlimited circumstance permitted by §2254(e)(2) does not\nupset the balance that Congress struck in AEDPA be\ntween the state and federal courts.           By construing\n§2254(d)(1) to do the work of other provisions in AEDPA,\nthe majority has subverted Congress’ careful balance of\nresponsibilities. It has also created unnecessarily a brand\nnew set of procedural complexities that lower courts will\nhave to confront.3\n                             B\n  The majority’s interpretation of §2254(d)(1) finds no\nsupport in the provision’s text or the statute’s structure as\na whole.\n                          1\n  Section 2254(d)(1) requires district courts to ask\n——————\n 3 See,   e.g., nn. 5, 7, and 13, infra.\n\f6                  CULLEN v.

Ante, at 9. But\nboth §§2254(d)(1) and 2254(d)(2) use “backward-looking\nlanguage,” and §2254(d)(2)—unlike §2254(d)(1)—expressly\ndirects district courts to base their review on “the evidence\npresented in the State court proceeding.” If use of the past\ntense were sufficient to indicate Congress’ intent to re\nstrict analysis to the state-court record, the phrase “in\nlight of the evidence presented in the State court proceed\ning” in §2254(d)(2) would be superfluous. The majority’s\nconstruction of §2254(d)(1) fails to give meaning to Con\ngress’ decision to include language referring to the evi\ndence presented to the state court in §2254(d)(2). Cf.\nBates v. United States, 522 U. S. 23, 29–30 (1997) (“Where\nCongress includes particular language in one section of a\nstatute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it\nis generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally\nand purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion”\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).\n   Ignoring our usual “reluctan[ce] to treat statutory terms\nas surplusage in any setting,” TRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534\nU. S. 19, 31 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted), the\nmajority characterizes the phrase appearing in §2254(d)(2)\nas mere “clarifying language,” ante, at 12, n. 7. It specu\nlates that “[t]he omission of clarifying language from\n§2254(d)(1) just as likely reflects Congress’ belief that such\nlanguage was unnecessary as it does anything else.” Ante,\nat 12–13, n. 7. The argument that this phrase is merely\n“clarifying” might have more force, however, had Congress\nincluded this phrase in §2254(d)(1) but not in §2254(d)(2).\nAs between the two provisions, §2254(d)(2)—which re\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U.

Because this provision needs less clarifi\ncation on this point than §2254(d)(1), it is all the more\ntelling that Congress included this phrase in §2254(d)(2)\nbut elected to exclude it from §2254(d)(1).\n  Unlike my colleagues in the majority, I refuse to assume\nthat Congress simply engaged in sloppy drafting. The\ninclusion of this phrase in §2254(d)(2)—coupled with its\nomission     from     §2254(d)(2)’s   partner    provision,\n§2254(d)(1)—provides strong reason to think that Con\ngress did not intend for the §2254(d)(1) analysis to be\nlimited categorically to “the evidence presented in the\nState court proceeding.”\n                              2\n  The “ ‘broader context of the statute as a whole,’ ” ante,\nat 9 (quoting Robinson v.

In particular, Con\ngress’ decision to include in AEDPA a provision,\n§2254(e)(2), that permits federal evidentiary hearings in\ncertain circumstances provides further evidence that\nCongress did not intend to limit the §2254(d)(1) inquiry to\nthe state-court record in every case.\n  We have long recognized that some diligent habeas\npetitioners are unable to develop all of the facts support\ning their claims in state court.4 As discussed above, in\n——————\n  4 See, e.g., Michael Williams, 529 U. S. 420, 432 (2000) (noting that\n\ndiligent efforts to develop the facts might be “thwarted, for example, by\nthe conduct of another or by happenstance”); id., at 434 (noting that the\nprosecution might have “concealed the facts” supporting “a claim which\nwas pursued with diligence”); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U. S. 293, 313\n(1963) (requiring federal courts to grant evidentiary hearings when,\ninter alia, “the fact-finding procedure employed by the state court was\nnot adequate to afford a full and fair hearing” or “there is a substantial\nallegation of newly discovered evidence”), overruled in part on other\ngrounds by Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 5 (1992).\n\f8                      CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nenacting AEDPA, Congress generally barred evidentiary\nhearings for petitioners who did not “exercise diligence in\npursuing their claims” in state court. Michael Williams,\n529 U. S., at 436; see also §2254(e)(2). Importantly, it did\nnot impose any express limit on evidentiary hearings for\npetitioners who had been diligent in state court. See id.,\nat 436 (“[T]he statute does not equate prisoners who exer\ncise diligence in pursuing their claims with those who do\nnot”). For those petitioners, Congress left the decision to\nhold a hearing “to the sound discretion of district courts.”\nLandrigan, 550 U. S., at 473.\n   Faced with situations in which a diligent petitioner\noffers additional evidence in federal court, the courts of\nappeals have taken two approaches to applying\n§2254(d)(1). Some courts have held that when a federal\ncourt admits new evidence supporting a claim adjudicated\non the merits in state court, §2254(d)(1) does not apply at\nall and the federal court may review the claim de novo.\nSee ante, at 12; Holland v. Jackson, 542 U. S. 649, 653\n(2004) (per curiam); see, e.g., Winston v. Kelly, 592 F. 3d\n535, 555–556 (CA4 2010). I agree with the majority’s\nrejection of this approach. See ante, at 12. It would un\ndermine the comity principles motivating AEDPA to de\ncline to defer to a state-court adjudication of a claim\nbecause the state court, through no fault of its own,\nlacked all the relevant evidence.5\n——————\n    5 Of\n       course, §2254(d)(1) only applies when a state court has adjudi\ncated a claim on the merits. There may be situations in which new\nevidence supporting a claim adjudicated on the merits gives rise to an\naltogether different claim. See, e.g., Reply Brief for Petitioner 10–11\n(evidence withheld by the prosecutor relating to one claim may give rise\nto a separate claim under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83 (1963)). The\nmajority opinion does not foreclose this possibility.\n  I assume that the majority does not intend to suggest that review is\nlimited to the state-court record when a petitioner’s inability to develop\nthe facts supporting his claim was the fault of the state court itself. See\ngenerally Tr. of Oral Arg. in Bell v. Kelly, O. T. 2008, No. 07–1223.\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            9\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  Other courts of appeals, including the court below, have\nstruck a more considered balance. These courts have held\nthat §2254(d)(1) continues to apply but that new evidence\nproperly presented in a federal hearing is relevant to the\nreasonableness of the state-court decision. See Pinholster\nv. Ayers, 590 F. 3d 651, 668 (CA9 2009) (en banc) (“If the\nevidence is admissible under Michael Williams or\n§2254(e)(2), and if it does not render the petitioner’s\nclaims unexhausted . . . , then it is properly considered in\nevaluating whether the legal conclusion reached by the\nstate habeas court was a reasonable application of Su\npreme Court law”); accord, Wilson v. Mazzuca, 570 F. 3d\n490, 500 (CA2 2009); Pecoraro v. Walls, 286 F. 3d 439, 443\n(CA7 2002); Valdez v. Cockrell, 274 F. 3d 941, 952 (CA5\n2001). This approach accommodates the competing goals,\nreflected in §§2254(d) and 2254(e)(2), of according defer\nence to reasonable state-court decisions and preserving\nthe opportunity for diligent petitioners to present evidence\nto the federal court when they were unable to do so in\nstate court.\n  The majority charts a third, novel course that, so far as I\nam aware, no court of appeals has adopted: §2254(d)(1)\ncontinues to apply when a petitioner has additional evi\ndence that he was unable to present to the state court, but\nthe district court cannot consider that evidence in deciding\nwhether the petitioner has satisfied §2254(d)(1). The\nproblem with this approach is its potential to bar federal\nhabeas relief for diligent habeas petitioners who cannot\npresent new evidence to a state court.\n   Consider, for example, a petitioner who diligently at\ntempted in state court to develop the factual basis of a\nclaim that prosecutors withheld exculpatory witness\nstatements in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U. S. 83\n(1963). The state court denied relief on the ground that\nthe withheld evidence then known did not rise to the level\nof materiality required under Brady. Before the time for\n\f10                   CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nfiling a federal habeas petition has expired, however, a\nstate court orders the State to disclose additional docu\nments the petitioner had timely requested under the\nState’s public records Act. The disclosed documents reveal\nthat the State withheld other exculpatory witness state\nments, but state law would not permit the petitioner to\npresent the new evidence in a successive petition.6\n   Under our precedent, if the petitioner had not presented\nhis Brady claim to the state court at all, his claim would\nbe deemed defaulted and the petitioner could attempt to\nshow cause and prejudice to overcome the default. See\nMichael Williams, 529 U. S., at 444; see also n. 1, supra.\nIf, however, the new evidence merely bolsters a Brady\nclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, it\nis unclear how the petitioner can obtain federal habeas\nrelief after today’s holding. What may have been a rea\nsonable decision on the state-court record may no longer\nbe reasonable in light of the new evidence. See Kyles v.\nWhitley, 514 U. S. 419, 436 (1995) (materiality of Brady\nevidence is viewed “collectively, not item by item”). Be\ncause the state court adjudicated the petitioner’s Brady\nclaim on the merits, §2254(d)(1) would still apply. Yet,\nunder the majority’s interpretation of §2254(d)(1), a fed\neral court is now prohibited from considering the new\nevidence in determining the reasonableness of the state\ncourt decision.\n   The majority’s interpretation of §2254(d)(1) thus sug\ngests the anomalous result that petitioners with new\nclaims based on newly obtained evidence can obtain fed\neral habeas relief if they can show cause and prejudice for\ntheir default but petitioners with newly obtained evidence\nsupporting a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court\n——————\n  6 See, e.g., id., at 37–38 (statement by counsel for the respondent\n\nwarden that Virginia law bars all successive habeas applications, even\nin cases where the petitioner has new evidence).\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U.

That the\nmajority’s interpretation leads to this anomaly is good\nreason to conclude that its interpretation is wrong. See\nKeeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U. S. 1, 7–8 (1992) (“[I]t is\n. . . irrational to distinguish between failing to properly\nassert a federal claim in state court and failing in state\ncourt to properly develop such a claim”).\n    The majority responds to this anomaly by suggesting\nthat my hypothetical petitioner “may well [have] a new\nclaim.”7 Ante, at 14, n. 10. This suggestion is puzzling.\nNew evidence does not usually give rise to a new claim; it\nmerely provides additional proof of a claim already adjudi\ncated on the merits.8 The majority presumably means\nto suggest that the petitioner might be able to obtain\nfederal-court review of his new evidence if he can show\ncause and prejudice for his failure to present the “new”\nclaim to a state court. In that scenario, however, the\nfederal court would review the purportedly “new” claim de\nnovo. The majority’s approach thus threatens to replace\ndeferential review of new evidence under §2254(d)(1) with\nde novo review of new evidence in the form of “new”\nclaims.9 Because it is unlikely that Congress intended\nde novo review—the result suggested by the majority’s\nopinion—it must have intended for district courts to\nconsider newly discovered evidence in conducting the\n§2254(d)(1) analysis.\n——————\n  7 The majority declines, however, to provide any guidance to the lower\n\ncourts on how to distinguish claims adjudicated on the merits from new\nclaims.\n  8 Even if it can fairly be argued that my hypothetical petitioner has a\n\nnew claim, the majority fails to explain how a diligent petitioner with\nnew evidence supporting an existing claim can present his new evi\ndence to a federal court.\n  9 In this vein, it is the majority’s approach that “would not take seri\n\nously AEDPA’s requirement that federal courts defer to state-court\ndecisions.” Ante, at 10, n. 3.\n\f12                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  The majority’s reading of §2254(d)(1) appears ultimately\nto rest on its understanding that state courts must have\nthe first opportunity to adjudicate habeas petitioners’\nclaims. See ante, at 9–10 (“It would be contrary to\n[AEDPA’s exhaustion requirement] to allow a petitioner to\novercome an adverse state-court decision with new evi\ndence introduced in a federal habeas court and reviewed\nby that court in the first instance effectively de novo”).10\nJUSTICE BREYER takes the same position. See ante, at 2\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(AEDPA is designed “to give the State a first opportunity\nto consider most matters”). I fully agree that habeas\npetitioners must attempt to present evidence to state\ncourts in the first instance, as does JUSTICE ALITO, see\nante, at 2. Where I disagree with the majority is in my\nunderstanding that §2254(e)(2) already accomplishes this\nresult.    By reading §2254(d)(1) to do the work of\n§2254(e)(2), the majority gives §2254(e)(2) an unnaturally\ncramped reading. As a result, the majority either has\nforeclosed habeas relief for diligent petitioners who,\nthrough no fault of their own, were unable to present\nexculpatory evidence to the state court that adjudicated\ntheir claims or has created a new set of procedural com\nplexities for the lower courts to navigate to ensure the\navailability of the Great Writ for diligent petitioners.\n                             3\n  These considerations lead me to agree with the courts of\nappeals that have concluded that a federal court should\nassess the reasonableness of a state court’s application of\nclearly established federal law under §2254(d)(1) in light\nof evidence properly admitted in a federal evidentiary\nhearing. There is nothing “strange” about this approach.\n——————\n  10 Under my reading of §2254(d)(1), of course, the district court would\n\nreview properly admitted new evidence through the deferential lens of\n§2254(d)(1), not de novo.\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 10. Under §2254(d)(1), federal courts routinely\nengage in analysis that the state court itself might never\nhave conducted or did not conduct. For example, when a\nstate court summarily denies a claim without explanation,\nas the California Supreme Court did here, district courts\nmust deny habeas relief pursuant to §2254(d)(1) so long as\n“there is any reasonable argument” supporting the denial\nof the petitioner’s claim. Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 16). We likewise ask whether a state-court\ndecision unreasonably applied clearly established federal\nlaw when the state court issued a reasoned decision but\nfailed to cite federal law altogether. See Early v. Packer,\n537 U. S. 3, 8 (2002) (per curiam). Determining whether a\nstate court could reasonably have denied a petitioner relief\nin light of newly discovered evidence is not so different\nthan determining whether there is any reasonable basis\nfor a state court’s unreasoned decision.\n   Admittedly, the text of §2254(d)(1), standing alone, does\nnot compel either reading of that provision. But constru\ning §2254(d)(1) to permit consideration of evidence prop\nerly introduced in federal court best accords with the text\nof §2254(d)(2) and AEDPA’s structure as a whole. By\ninterpreting §2254(d)(1) to prevent nondiligent petitioners\nfrom gaming the system—the very purpose of\n§2254(e)(2)—the majority potentially has put habeas relief\nout of reach for diligent petitioners with meritorious\nclaims based on new evidence.\n                            C\n  The majority claims that its holding is “consistent” with\nour case law. Ante, at 10. Quite the opposite is true: Our\ncases reflect our previous understanding that evidence\nproperly admitted pursuant to §2254(e)(2) is relevant to\nthe §2254(d)(1) analysis.\n  In Landrigan, JUSTICE THOMAS, the author of today’s\nopinion, confirmed this understanding of the interplay\n\f14                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nbetween §§2254(d)(1) and 2254(e)(2). As noted above, we\nadmonished district courts to consider whether a peti\ntioner’s allegations, if proved true, would satisfy §2254(d)\nin determining whether to grant a hearing. After high\nlighting the deference owed to state courts under\n§§2254(d) and 2254(e)(1), we stated:\n     “In deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing,\n     a federal court must consider whether such a hearing\n     could enable an applicant to prove the petition’s fac\n     tual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the\n     applicant to federal habeas relief. Because the defer\n     ential standards prescribed by §2254 control whether\n     to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into\n     account those standards in deciding whether an evi\n     dentiary hearing is appropriate.” 550 U. S., at 474 (ci\n     tation omitted).\nBy instructing district courts to consider the §2254(d)\nstandards in deciding whether to grant a hearing, we must\nhave understood that the evidence admitted at a hearing\ncould be considered in the §2254(d)(1) analysis. See Brief\nfor American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 9\n(“The whole point of Landrigan’s admonition that the\ncourt must decide whether to hold a hearing with an eye\non §2254(d)(1) is that some proffers of evidence will not\njustify federal fact-finding in view of §2254(d)(1), but that\nother proffers of proof will”).11\n   In Michael Williams, the warden argued that\n§2254(e)(2) bars an evidentiary hearing whenever a peti\ntioner was unable to develop the factual record in state\ncourt, “whether or not through his own fault or neglect.”\n——————\n  11 The majority overlooks this aspect of Landrigan. It quotes Landri\n\ngan’s observation that “if the record refutes the applicant’s factual\nallegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not\nrequired to hold an evidentiary hearing,” 550 U. S., at 474, but that\nstatement has no bearing on the question decided by the Court today.\n\f                    Cite as: 563 U.

Under the warden’s argument, a peti\ntioner who did not develop the record in state court, what\never the reason, would be barred from presenting evidence\nto the federal court. In rejecting that argument, we\nobserved:\n     “A prisoner who developed his claim in state court and\n     can prove the state court’s decision was ‘contrary to,\n     or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly es\n     tablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n     Court of the United States,’ is not barred from obtain\n     ing relief by §2254(d)(1). If the opening clause of\n     §2254(e)(2) covers a request for an evidentiary hear\n     ing on a claim which was pursued with diligence but\n     remained undeveloped in state court because, for in\n     stance, the prosecution concealed the facts, a prisoner\n     lacking clear and convincing evidence of innocence\n     could be barred from a hearing on the claim even if he\n     could satisfy §2254(d).” Id., at 434 (citation omitted;\n     emphasis added).\nA petitioner in the latter situation would almost certainly\nbe unable to “satisfy §2254(d)” without introducing the\nconcealed facts in federal court. This passage thus reflects\nour understanding that, in some circumstances, a peti\ntioner might need an evidentiary hearing in federal court\nto prove the facts necessary to satisfy §2254(d). To avoid\nforeclosing habeas relief for such petitioners, we concluded\nthat §2254(e)(2) could not bear the warden’s “harsh read\ning,” which essentially would have held petitioners strictly\nat fault for their inability to develop the facts in state\ncourt. Ibid. The majority today gives an equally “harsh\nreading” to §2254(d)(1) to achieve the result we rejected in\nMichael Williams.12\n——————\n  12 The majority claims that Michael Williams supports its reading of\n\n§2254(d)(1). With respect to one claim asserted by the petitioner, we\nobserved that “[t]he Court of Appeals rejected this claim on the merits\n\f16                   CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   None of the other cases cited by the majority supports\nits result. In Williams v. Taylor, 529 U. S. 362 (2000)\n(Terry Williams), we interpreted §2254(d)(1) to ask\nwhether the state-court decision “identifies the correct\ngoverning legal principle from this Court’s decisions but\nunreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the\nprisoner’s case.” Id., at 413. However, we had no reason\nto decide whether the §2254(d)(1) inquiry was limited to\nthe state-court record, as the District Court did not hold\nan evidentiary hearing in that case. See id., at 372.\n   In Holland v. Jackson, we stated that “we have made\nclear that whether a state court’s decision was unreason\nable must be assessed in light of the record the court had\nbefore it.” 542 U. S., at 652. In the next sentence, how\never, we observed that the evidence at issue “could have\nbeen the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the District\nCourt, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing to\ndevelop that evidence in state court.” Id., at 652–653. We\nproceeded to find that the evidence was not properly ad\nmitted under §2254(e)(2) before concluding that the Court\nof Appeals had erred in its §2254(d)(1) analysis. Id., at\n653; see also Bradshaw v. Richey, 546 U. S. 74, 79 (2005)\n(per curiam).\n   In sum, our cases reflect our recognition that it is some\ntimes appropriate to consider new evidence in deciding\nwhether a petitioner can satisfy §2254(d)(1). In reading\nour precedent to require the opposite conclusion, the ma\njority disregards the concerns that motivated our decision\nin Michael Williams: Some petitioners, even if diligent,\n——————\nunder §2254(d)(1), so it is unnecessary to reach the question whether\n§2254(e)(2) would permit a hearing on the claim.” 529 U. S., at 444.\nThat statement merely reflects the fact that the Court of Appeals had\nrejected that claim under §2254(d)(1) without considering whether the\npetitioner was entitled to a hearing because the petitioner had not\nrequested a hearing on that claim. See Williams v. Taylor, 189 F. 3d\n421, 425, 428–429 (CA4 1999).\n\f                      Cite as: 563 U.

We should not interpret\n§2254(d)(1) to foreclose these diligent petitioners from\naccessing the Great Writ when the state court will not\nconsider the new evidence and could not reasonably have\nreached the same conclusion with the new evidence before\nit.\n                          II\n  I also disagree with the Court’s conclusion that the\nCourt of Appeals erred in holding that Pinholster had\nsatisfied §2254(d)(1) on the basis of the state-court\nrecord.13\n                              A\n  The majority omits critical details relating to the per\nformance of Pinholster’s trial counsel, the mitigating\nevidence they failed to discover, and the history of these\nproceedings. I therefore highlight several aspects of the\nfacts and history of this case.\n\n——————\n  13 I agree with the majority that the state-court record in this case\nconsists of “the ‘allegations of [the] habeas corpus petition . . . and . . .\nany matter of record pertaining to the case.’ ” Ante, at 16, n. 12 (quot\ning In re Hochberg, 2 Cal. 3d 870, 874, n. 2, 471 P. 2d 1, 3–4, n. 2\n(1970); some internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The majority does not decide which of the two state-court decisions\nshould be reviewed. See ante, at 15, n. 11. One amicus argues that\nPinholster must prove that both state-court decisions involved an\nunreasonable application of law. See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal\nFoundation as Amicus Curiae 26. This argument is based on amicus’\nunderstanding that the California Supreme Court rejected the second\npetition as successive and, alternatively, on the merits. The State has\nnot argued, however, that the second ruling rests on a procedural\nground. See ante, at 6, n. 2. When a state court denies two petitions on\nthe merits and the difference between the petitions is that the second\npetition contains additional evidence supporting the petitioner’s claim,\nI see no reason why the petitioner must independently show that the\nfirst decision was unreasonable.\n\f18                 CULLEN v.

This prompted discussion at sidebar regarding\nwhether the State had provided notice of its intent to offer\naggravating evidence. Pinholster’s court-appointed attor\nney, Wilbur Dettmar, argued that the State should be\nprecluded from offering aggravating evidence:\n     “I am not presently prepared to offer anything by way\n     of mitigation. If I was going to proceed on mitigation,\n     the people would have the right to rebuttal with or\n     without notice.\n        “I took the position, since the people had not given\n     notice, I had not prepared any evidence by way of miti\n     gation. I would submit it on that basis.” 52 Re\n     porter’s Tr. 7250 (hereinafter Tr.) (emphasis added).\nUndoubtedly anticipating that counsel might need addi\ntional time to prepare an adequate mitigation defense, the\ncourt asked Dettmar whether a continuance would be\nhelpful in the event it ruled against him. He declined the\noffer on the spot, stating: “I think we would probably still\ngo forward on Monday. Clearly the one person that comes\nto mind is the defendant’s mother. How much beyond that\nI don’t know. I don’t think the pa[ss]age of time would\nmake a great deal of difference.” Id., at 7257–7258. After\nhearing testimony, the court denied Pinholster’s motion to\npreclude aggravating evidence.\n   At the penalty phase, defense counsel called only one\nwitness: Pinholster’s mother, Burnice Brashear. Brashear\ntestified that Pinholster “never really wanted for anything\nat home too much” and “had everything normally materi\nalwise that most people have.” Id., at 7395. She said that\nPinholster was “different” from his siblings, whom she\ncharacterized as “basically very good children.” Id., at\n7401–7402.

She\nstated that he started failing school in the first grade and\nthat the school eventually “sent him to [an] educationally\nhandicapped class.” Id., at 7393–7394. When Pinholster\nwas 10, a psychologist recommended placing him in a\nmental institution, but she “didn’t think he was that far\ngone.” Id., at 7395. A few years later, she testified, he\nspent six months in a state hospital for emotionally handi\ncapped children. Id., at 7402.\n   According to Brashear, Pinholster had suffered from\nepilepsy since age 18, when he was beaten in jail. Id.,\nat 7397. She said that her family doctor, Dr. Dubin,\nhad given him medication to treat the epilepsy. Ibid.\nBrashear also suggested that Pinholster did not have long\nto live, stating that he had “a chip in his head floating\naround” and that “they don’t think—he won’t be here very\nmuch longer anyway.”14 Ibid.\n   In closing argument, the prosecutor ridiculed Brashear’s\ntestimony.

Medical records, something”).\nThe prosecutor also highlighted Brashear’s testimony\nabout Pinholster’s stable home environment, arguing, “He\ncame from a good home. You heard that he was not a\ndeprived child. Had many things going for him, probably\nmore than many children.” Id., at 7442.\n  Notwithstanding the meager mitigation case presented\nby Pinholster’s counsel, it took the jury two days to reach a\ndecision to sentence Pinholster to death. His counsel later\nmoved to modify the sentence to life imprisonment. In\ndenying the motion, the trial judge stated, “The evidence\nwhich the defense offered concerning the defendant’s\nextenuation was merely some testimony from his mother\nthat was not persuasive. His mother did not, in the court’s\nopinion, present any evidence which the court would find\nto be a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.\nNo witness supplied such evidence.” 54 id., at 7514.\n                                 2\n  After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on\nappeal, Pinholster filed a habeas petition in the California\nSupreme Court alleging, among other things, that his\ncounsel had “unreasonably failed to investigate, prepare\nand present available mitigating evidence during penalty\nphase.” Record ER–103.\n  Pinholster’s state-court petition included 121 exhibits.\nIn a series of declarations, his trial attorney Harry\nBrainard (who had by then been disbarred) confirmed\nwhat Dettmar had forthrightly told the trial court:\nBrainard and Dettmar neither expected nor prepared to\npresent mitigation evidence.15 See id., at ER–333 (“Mr.\n\n——————\n 15 By the time of Pinholster’s state-court habeas petition, Dettmar\n\nwas deceased.\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U.

We\nfelt there would be no penalty phase hearing inasmuch as\nwe did not receive written notice of evidence in aggrava\ntion pursuant to Penal Code §190.3”). Brainard further\nconfirmed what was apparent from the mitigation case\nthey eventually put on: They conducted virtually no miti\ngation investigation. See id., at ER–182 (“I have no recol\nlection of Mr. Dettmar having secured or reviewed any of\nScott’s medical records, nor did I see any of Scott’s medical\nrecords. So far as I recollect, neither Mr. Dettmar nor\nmyself interviewed any of Scott’s previous medical provid\ners”); id., at ER–183 (“I do not recall interviewing or at\ntempting to interview Scott’s family members or any other\npersons regarding penalty phase testimony, except Mrs.\nBrashears [sic]”); ibid.

(“I have no recollection of interviewing or attempting\nto interview Scott’s former school teachers, counselors, or\njuvenile officers”).16\n   Statements by relatives (none of whom trial counsel had\nattempted to interview regarding Pinholster’s background)\nand documentary evidence revealed that the picture of\nPinholster’s family life painted by his mother at trial was\nfalse. Pinholster was “raised in chaos and poverty.” Id.,\nat ER–312. A relative remembered seeing the children\nmix together flour and water in an attempt to get some\nthing to eat. Pinholster’s stepfather beat him several\ntimes a week, including at least once with a two-by-four\nboard. “There was so much violence in [the] home” that\nPinholster’s brother “dreaded coming home each day.” Id.,\nat ER–313. Pinholster’s half sister was removed from the\nhome as a result of a beating by his stepfather.\n——————\n  16 Counsel’s billing records, which were before the California Supreme\n\nCourt as part of the trial record, confirmed Brainard’s recollection.\n\f22                   CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  Documentary evidence showed, directly contrary to\nBrashear’s trial testimony, that Pinholster’s siblings had\nvery troubled pasts. Pinholster’s elder brother was ar\nrested for armed burglary, robbery, and forcible rape of a\n14-year-old with a deadly weapon. While in custody, he\nwas diagnosed as “catatonic-like” and “acutely psychotic,\nprobably suffering some type of schizophrenia.” Id., at\nER–219, ER–224. He later committed suicide.17 Pinhol\nster’s half sister, a recovering alcoholic, had been made a\nward of the juvenile court for prostitution and forcible\nsexual battery on a 14-year-old.\n  Pinholster’s petition and exhibits described a long his\ntory of emotional disturbance and neurological problems.\nA former schoolteacher stated that, as a child, Pinholster\n“seemed incapable of relating either to his peers or to\nadults,” that “[i]t was even hard to maintain eye contact\nwith him,” and that “[h]is hyperactivity was so extreme\nthat [she] formed the opinion it probably had an organic\nbase.” Id., at ER–231. School records revealed that he\n“talk[ed] to self continuously,” had “many grimaces,”\nfought in his sleep, and could “control self for only 1 hour\nper day.” Id., at ER–230, ER–233. He “show[ed] progres\nsive deterioration each semester since Kindergarten.” Id.,\nat ER–230. School officials recommended placement in a\nschool for emotionally handicapped students and referral\nto a neurologist. At age nine, he had an abnormal EEG,\nrevealing “an organic basis for his behavior.” Id., at ER–\n157, ER–234. Just months before the homicides, a doctor\nrecommended placement in the Hope Psychiatric Insti\ntute, but this did not occur.\n  This and other evidence attached to the petition was\n\n——————\n  17 Accordingto Pinholster’s half sister, “The death of our brother Al\nvin was a severe emotional blow to me and to Scott.

Dr.\nWoods opined that Pinholster “suffer[ed] from severe and\nlong standing seizure disorders,” id., at ER–156, that his\nchildhood head traumas “may have been the precipitating\nfactors for [his] seizure disorder,” id., at ER–157, and that\nhe suffered from bipolar mood disorder. He pointed to\ntrial testimony that immediately before the burglary on\nthe night of the homicides, Pinholster announced that he\n“ ‘ha[d] a message from God’ ”—which Dr. Woods believed\nto reflect “[a]uditory hallucinations” and “severe psycho\nsis.” Id., at ER–169. He concluded that at the time of the\nhomicides Pinholster “was suffering from bipolar mood\ndisorder with psychotic ideation and was suffering a com\nplex partial seizure.” Id., at ER–170. He also observed\nthat Pinholster’s “grossly dysfunctional family, the abuse\nhe received as a child, his history of suffering from sub\nstantial seizure and mood disorders, his frequently un\ntreated psychiatric and psychological disabilities and his\neducational handicaps were relevant circumstances which\nwould extenuate the gravity of the crime.” Id., at ER–171.\n   On the basis of Pinholster’s submission, the California\nSupreme Court denied Pinholster’s ineffective-assistance\nof-counsel claim.\n   Pinholster then filed a habeas petition in Federal Dis\ntrict Court. He included an additional exhibit: a declara\ntion by Dr. John Stalberg, a psychiatrist who had hastily\nexamined Pinholster and produced a two-page report in\nthe middle of the original trial.18 After reviewing the new\nmaterial collected by Pinholster’s habeas counsel, Dr.\nStalberg stated that the available evidence showed a\n——————\n  18 Counsel had arranged for Dr. Stalberg to examine Pinholster in the\n\nmiddle of his original trial. The only documents they provided to him\nwere police reports relating to the case and a 1978 probation report. In\na two-page report that focused primarily on Pinholster’s mental state at\nthe time of the offenses, Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster had\n“psychopathic personality traits.” Id., at ER–187.\n\f24                    CULLEN v.

He also opined\nthat “there [was] voluminous mitigating evidence which\nincludes a childhood of physical abuse, emotional neglect,\nand a family history of mental illness and criminal behav\nior.” Id., at ER–494.\n  The District Court stayed the federal proceedings while\nPinholster sought state-court review of claims the District\nCourt deemed unexhausted. Pinholster’s second habeas\nsubmission to the California Supreme Court included\nStalberg’s declaration. That court summarily denied\nPinholster’s petition on the merits.\n  Pinholster returned to Federal District Court and filed\nan amended petition. After an evidentiary hearing, the\nDistrict Court concluded that Pinholster had demon\nstrated deficient performance and prejudice under Strick\nland.19 The Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, affirmed. 590\nF. 3d 651.\n                             B\n  As the majority notes, Pinholster’s claim arises under\nStrickland v.

To satisfy this benchmark, a defendant must show\nboth that “counsel’s performance was deficient” and that\n“the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.” Id., at\n687.\n   When §2254(d)(1) applies, the question is whether “ ‘fair\nminded jurists could disagree’ on the correctness of the\nstate court’s decision.” Harrington, 562 U.

When the state court rejected a Strickland\nclaim on the pleadings assuming the allegations to be\ntrue, as here, see ante, at 16, n. 12, the federal court must\nask whether “there is any reasonable argument” support\ning the state court’s conclusion that the petitioner’s allega\ntions did not state a claim, Harrington, 562 U.

The majority’s explanation for counsel’s\nconduct contradicts the best available evidence of counsel’s\nactions: Dettmar’s frank, contemporaneous statement to\nthe trial judge that he “had not prepared any evidence by\nway of mitigation.” 52 Tr. 7250. The majority’s conjecture\nthat counsel had in fact prepared a mitigation defense,\nbased primarily on isolated entries in counsel’s billing\nrecords, requires it to assume that Dettmar was lying to\nthe trial judge.20\n   In any event, even if Pinholster’s counsel had a strategic\nreason for their actions, that would not automatically\nrender their actions reasonable. For example, had counsel\ndecided their best option was to move to exclude the ag\ngravating evidence, it would have been unreasonable to\nforgo a mitigation investigation on the hope that the mo\ntion would be granted.

There is no evidence in the records that counsel\nactually planned to present mitigating evidence. Indeed, their complete\nfailure to follow up on any of the information they learned in their\nminimal investigation only confirms that they were not planning to\npresent mitigating evidence.

No rea\nsonable attorney would pursue such a risky strategy. I do\nnot understand the majority to suggest otherwise.\n  Instead, I understand the majority’s conclusion that\ncounsel’s actions were reasonable to rest on its belief that\nthey did have a backup plan: a family-sympathy defense.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the majority commits the\nsame Strickland error that we corrected, applying\n§2254(d)(1), in Wiggins: It holds a purportedly “tactical\njudgment” to be reasonable without assessing “the ade\nquacy of the investigatio[n] supporting [that] judgmen[t],”\n539 U. S., at 521. As we stated in Strickland:\n    “[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation\n    of law and facts relevant to plausible options are vir\n    tually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made af\n    ter less than complete investigation are reasonable\n    precisely to the extent that reasonable professional\n    judgments support the limitations on investigation.\n    In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable\n    investigations or to make a reasonable decision that\n    makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any\n    ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to inves\n    tigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in\n    all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of\n    deference to counsel’s judgments.” 466 U. S., at 690–\n    691.\nWe have repeatedly applied this principle since Strick\nland. See Sears v. Upton, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (per\ncuriam) (slip op., at 9); Porter v. McCollum, 558 U.

(citing 1 ABA Standards for\nCriminal Justice 4–4.1, commentary, p. 4–55 (2d ed. 1980)\n(hereinafter ABA Standards)), or “to make a reasonable\ndecision that makes particular investigations unneces\nsary,” Strickland, 466 U.

S., at 381 (quot\ning Strickland, 466 U. S., at 689, 691; citation omitted). In\nsome cases, “reasonably diligent counsel may draw a line\nwhen they have good reason to think further investigation\nwould be a waste.” Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 383; see, e.g.,\nBobby v.

My point is that even if counsel made a\nstrategic decision to proceed with such a defense, that decision was\nunreasonable because it was based on an unreasonably incomplete\ninvestigation.\n   22 See also 1 ABA Standards 4–4.1, commentary, at 4–55 (“Informa\n\ntion concerning the defendant’s background, education, employment\nrecord, mental and emotional stability, family relationships, and the\nlike, will be relevant, as will mitigating circumstances surrounding the\ncommission of the offense itself”).

There, counsel’s in\nvestigation was limited to three sources: psychological\ntesting, a presentencing report, and Department of Social\nServices records. 539 U. S., at 523–524. The records\nrevealed that the petitioner’s mother was an alcoholic,\nthat he displayed emotional difficulties in foster care, that\nhe was frequently absent from school, and that on one\noccasion, his mother left him alone for days without food.\nId., at 525. In these circumstances, we concluded, “any\nreasonably competent attorney would have realized that\npursuing these leads was necessary to making an in\nformed choice among possible defenses.” Ibid. Accord\ningly, we held, the state court’s assumption that counsel’s\ninvestigation was adequate was an unreasonable applica\ntion of Strickland. 539 U. S., at 528.23\n   This case is remarkably similar to Wiggins.

Yet counsel\nmade no effort to obtain the readily available evidence\nsuggested by the information they learned, such as Pin\nholster’s schooling or medical records, or to contact\nPinholster’s school authorities. They did not contact Dr.\nDubin or the many other health-care providers who had\ntreated Pinholster.

Counsel\nmade no effort to bolster Brashear’s self-interested testi\nmony with school or medical records, as the prosecutor\neffectively emphasized in closing argument. And because\nthey did not pursue obvious leads, they failed to recognize\nthat Brashear’s testimony painting Pinholster as the bad\napple in a normal, nondeprived family was false.\n   In denying Pinholster’s claim, the California Supreme\nCourt necessarily overlooked Strickland’s clearly estab\nlished admonition that “strategic choices made after less\nthan complete investigation are reasonable precisely to\nthe extent that reasonable professional judgments support\nthe limitations.” 466 U. S., at 690–691. As in Wiggins, in\nlight of the information available to Pinholster’s counsel, it\nis plain that “reasonable professional judgments” could not\nhave supported their woefully inadequate investigation.25\n466 U. S., at 691. Accordingly, the California Supreme\nCourt could not reasonably have concluded that Pinholster\n——————\n  25 The majority chastises the Court of Appeals for “attributing strict\nrules to this Court’s recent case law.” Ante, at 24. I agree that courts\nshould not interpret our cases to prescribe strict rules regarding the\nrequired scope of mitigation investigations. See Rompilla v. Beard, 545\nU. S. 374, 394 (2005) (O’Connor, J., concurring) (noting “our longstand\ning case-by-case approach to determining whether an attorney’s per\nformance was unconstitutionally deficient under Strickland”). The\nNinth Circuit, however, did no such thing. It appropriately gave\nthoughtful consideration to the guideposts contained in these cases,\njust as we have previously done. See, e.g., Bobby v. Van Hook, 558\nU. S. ___, ___ (2009) (per curiam) (slip op., at 8).\n\f32                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhad failed to allege that his counsel’s investigation was\ninadequate under Strickland.\n                             D\n   The majority also concludes that the California Supreme\nCourt could reasonably have concluded that Pinholster did\nnot state a claim of prejudice. This conclusion, in light of\nthe overwhelming mitigating evidence that was not before\nthe jury, is wrong. To establish prejudice, “[t]he defendant\nmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\nfor counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro\nceeding would have been different.” Id., at 694. When a\nhabeas petitioner challenges a death sentence, “the ques\ntion is whether there is a reasonable probability that,\nabsent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded\nthat the balance of aggravating and mitigating circum\nstances did not warrant death.” Id., at 695. This inquiry\nrequires evaluating “the totality of the available mitiga\ntion evidence—both that adduced at trial, and the evi\ndence adduced in the habeas proceeding—in reweighing it\nagainst the evidence in aggravation.” Terry Williams, 529\nU. S., at 397–398. The ultimate question in this case is\nwhether, taking into account all the mitigating and aggra\nvating evidence, “there is a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.”\nWiggins, 539 U. S., at 537; see Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§190.4(b) (West 2008) (requiring a unanimous jury verdict\nto impose a death sentence).\n                              1\n  Like the majority, I first consider the aggravating and\nmitigating evidence presented at trial. By virtue of its\nverdict in the guilt phase, the jury had already concluded\nthat Pinholster had stabbed and killed the victims. As the\nmajority states, the jury saw Pinholster “revel” in his\nhistory of burglaries during the guilt phase. Ante, at 26.\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U.

He threatened to kill the State’s lead\nwitness. And he had an extensive disciplinary record in\njail.\n  Brashear offered brief testimony that was apparently\nintended to be mitigating. See supra, at 19–20; see also\nante, at 27–28.26 However, as the prosecutor argued,\nBrashear was not a neutral witness. See 53 Tr. 7441 (“A\nmother clearly loves her son, ladies and gentlemen.\nClearly not the most unbiased witness in the world”).\nNotwithstanding Brashear’s obvious self-interest, counsel\nfailed to offer readily available, objective evidence that\nwould have substantiated and expanded on her testimony.\nTheir failure to do so allowed the prosecutor to belittle her\ntestimony in closing argument. See supra, at 19–20. And\nBrashear’s statement that Pinholster would not be alive\nmuch longer because he had “a chip in his head floating\naround,” 52 Tr. 7397, could only have undermined her\ncredibility, as the prosecutor urged, see 53 id., at 7447\n(“Does she want you to believe sometime before he got to\n——————\n  26 The majority mischaracterizes several aspects of Brashear’s testi\n\nmony. Although Brashear testified that the family “didn’t have lots of\nmoney,” she followed up that comment by stating that Pinholster did\nnot bring friends to the house because “it was too nice a house.” 52 Tr.\n7404. The prosecutor did not understand Brashear to have testified\nthat Pinholster’s childhood was deprived. See 53 id., at 7442 (“You\nheard that he was not a deprived child”). Nor did the California Su\npreme Court on direct appeal. People v. Pinholster, 1 Cal. 4th 865, 910,\n824 P. 2d 571, 587 (1992).\n  Brashear did testify that Pinholster’s stepfather tried to “discipline”\nhim and that he was “at times” “abusive or near abusive.” 52 Tr. 7392–\n7393. She suggested, however, that Pinholster deserved the “disci\npline” he received. See, e.g., id., at 7392 (“Scott was always—he had a\nmind of his own”). It is unlikely the jury understood Brashear to be\nsuggesting that her husband routinely beat Pinholster. The prosecutor\ndid not come away with this understanding. See 53 id., at 7442.\n\f34                 CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncountry jail some doctor looked in a crystal ball and\nsaid, ‘In three years you are going to die’? That’s ridicu\nlous”). The trial judge was thoroughly unimpressed with\nBrashear’s testimony. See supra, at 20.\n   Moreover, the evidence presented in Pinholster’s state\ncourt petition revealed that Brashear distorted facts in her\ntestimony in ways that undermined Pinholster’s mitiga\ntion case. As in Sears, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3), the\nprosecutor used Brashear’s testimony that Pinholster\ncame from a good family against him. See 53 Tr. 7442.\n   In sum, counsel presented little in the way of mitigating\nevidence, and the prosecutor effectively used their half\nhearted attempt to present a mitigation case to advocate\nfor the death penalty. The jury nonetheless took two days\nto reach a decision to impose a death sentence.\n                             2\n  The additional mitigating evidence presented to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court “adds up to a mitigation case\nthat bears no relation” to Brashear’s unsubstantiated\ntestimony. Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 393.\n  Assuming the evidence presented to the California\nSupreme Court to be true, as that court was required to\ndo, the new mitigating evidence presented to that court\nwould have shown that Pinholster was raised in “chaos\nand poverty.” Record ER–312. The family home was filled\nwith violence. Pinholster’s siblings had extremely trou\nbled pasts. There was substantial evidence of “mental\ndisturbance during Mr. Pinholster’s childhood and some\ndegree of brain damage.” Id., at ER–493.\n  Dr. Woods concluded that Pinholster’s aggressive con\nduct resulted from bipolar mood disorder. Just months\nbefore the murders, a doctor had recommended that Pin\nholster be sent to a psychiatric institute. Dr. Woods also\nexplained that Pinholster’s bizarre behavior before the\nmurders reflected “[a]uditory hallucinations” and “severe\n\f                  Cite as: 563 U.

The available records con\nfirmed that Pinholster suffered from longstanding seizure\ndisorders, which may have been caused by his childhood\nhead injuries.\n   On this record, I do not see how it can be said that “[t]he\n‘new’ evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence\nat trial.” Ante, at 29; see Arizona v. Fulminante, 499 U. S.\n279, 298–299 (1991) (evidence is not “merely cumulative”\nif it corroborates other evidence that is “unbelievable” on\nits own). Brashear’s self-interested testimony was not\nconfirmed with objective evidence, as the prosecutor high\nlighted. The new evidence would have “destroyed the\n[relatively] benign conception of [Pinholster’s] upbringing”\npresented by his mother. Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 391. The\njury heard no testimony at all that Pinholster likely suf\nfered from brain damage or bipolar mood disorder, and\ncounsel offered no evidence to help the jury understand\nthe likely effect of Pinholster’s head injuries or his bizarre\nbehavior on the night of the homicides. The jury heard no\ntestimony recounting the substantial evidence of Pinhol\nster’s likely neurological problems. And it heard no medi\ncal evidence that Pinholster suffered from epilepsy.\n   The majority responds that “much” of Pinholster’s new\nmitigating evidence “is of questionable mitigating value.”\nAnte, at 29. By presenting psychiatric testimony, it con\ntends, “Pinholster would have opened the door to rebuttal\nby a state expert.” Ibid. But, because the California\nSupreme Court denied Pinholster’s petition on the plead\nings, it had no reason to know what a state expert might\nhave said. Moreover, given the record evidence, it is rea\nsonably probable that at least one juror would have cred\nited his expert. In any event, even if a rebuttal expert\ntestified that Pinholster suffered from antisocial personal\nity disorder, this would hardly have come as a surprise to\nthe jury. See ante, at 22 (describing Pinholster as a “psy\nchotic client whose performance at trial hardly endeared\n\f36                     CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhim to the jury”). It is for this reason that it was espe\ncially important for counsel to present the available evi\ndence to help the jury understand Pinholster. See Sears,\n561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6–7).\n   Had counsel conducted an adequate investigation, the\njudge and jury would have heard credible evidence show\ning that Pinholster’s criminal acts and aggressive tenden\ncies were “attributable to a disadvantaged background, or\nto emotional and mental problems.” Penry, 492 U. S., at\n319 (internal quotation marks omitted). They would have\nlearned that Pinholster had the “ ‘kind of troubled history\nwe have declared relevant to assessing a defendant’s\nmoral culpability.’ ” Porter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12)\n(quoting Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 535). Applying Strickland,\nwe have repeatedly found “a reasonable probability,” 466\nU. S., at 694, that the sentencer would have reached a\ndifferent result had counsel presented similar evidence.\nSee, e.g., Porter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12–13) (evi\ndence of the defendant’s childhood history of physical\nabuse, brain abnormality, limited schooling, and heroic\nmilitary service); Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 392 (evidence of\nsevere abuse and neglect as a child, as well as brain\ndamage); Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 535 (evidence of the de\nfendant’s “severe privation and abuse” as a child, home\nlessness, and “diminished mental capacities”); Terry\nWilliams, 529 U. S., at 398 (evidence of childhood\nmistreatment and neglect, head injuries, possible organic\nmental impairments, and borderline mental retardation).\n   The majority does not dispute the similarity between\nthis case and the cited cases. However, it criticizes the\nCourt of Appeals for relying on Rompilla and Terry Wil\nliams on the ground that we reviewed the prejudice ques\ntion de novo in those cases. See ante, at 31. I do not read\nTerry Williams to review the prejudice question de novo.27\n——————\n 27 Terry   Williams held that the state court’s decision was “unreason\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U.

In each of these cases, we did not purport to\ncreate new law; we simply applied the same clearly estab\nlished precedent, Strickland, to a different set of facts.\nBecause these cases illuminate the kinds of mitigation\nevidence that suffice to establish prejudice under Strick\nland, they provide useful, but not dispositive, guidance for\ncourts to consider when determining whether a state court\nhas unreasonably applied Strickland.\n   In many cases, a state court presented with additional\nmitigation evidence will reasonably conclude that there is\nno “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofes\nsional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. This is not such\na case. Admittedly, Pinholster unjustifiably stabbed and\nkilled two people, and his history of violent outbursts and\nburglaries surely did not endear him to the jury. But the\nhomicides did not appear premeditated. And the State’s\naggravation case was no stronger than in Rompilla and\nTerry Williams. See 545 U. S., at 378, 383 (the defendant\ncommitted murder by torture and had a significant history\nof violent felonies, including a rape); 529 U. S., at 418\n(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (the defendant had a lifetime of crime, and after the\nmurder he “savagely beat an elderly woman,” set a home\non fire, and stabbed a man (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Even on the trial record, it took the jury two\ndays to decide on a penalty. The contrast between the “not\n\n—————— \n\nable in at least two respects”: (1) It applied the wrong legal standard,\n\nsee 529 U.

Given these considerations, it\nis not a foregone conclusion, as the majority deems it, that\na juror familiar with his troubled background and psychi\natric issues would have reached the same conclusion\nregarding Pinholster’s culpability. Fairminded jurists\ncould not doubt that, on the record before the California\nSupreme Court, “there [was] a reasonable probability that\nat least one juror would have struck a different balance.”\nWiggins, 539 U. S., at 537.\n                            III\n  The state-court record on its own was more than ade\nquate to support the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court could not reasonably have\nrejected Pinholster’s Strickland claim. The additional\nevidence presented in the federal evidentiary hearing only\nconfirms that conclusion.\n                              A\n   At the hearing, Pinholster offered many of the same\ndocuments that were before the state habeas court. He\nalso offered his trial attorneys’ billing records, which were\nbefore the state habeas court as part of the trial record. Of\nthe seven lay witnesses who testified at the hearing, six\nhad previously executed declarations in support of Pinhol\nster’s state-court petition. (The seventh, Pinholster’s\nuncle, provided testimony cumulative of other testimony.)\n   Two experts testified on Pinholster’s behalf; neither had\npresented declarations to the state habeas court. The first\nwas Dr. Donald Olson, assistant professor of neurology\nand neurological sciences and director of the Pediatric\nEpilepsy Program at Stanford University Medical Center.\nIt appears that Pinholster retained Dr. Olson to rebut the\ntestimony of the expert disclosed by the State in the fed\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U.

Abzug in Support\nof Stipulated Ex Parte Application to Continue Eviden\ntiary Hearing and Discovery Cut-Off and to Substitute\nCounsel in Pinholster v. Calderon, No. CV 95–6240–GLT\n(CD Cal.), p. 2. Relying in part on Pinholster’s abnormal\nEEG, Dr. Olson opined that Pinholster’s childhood acci\ndents “likely result[ed] in brain injury” and that these\ninjuries “conferred a risk of epilepsy.” Record ER–699 to\nER–700. He concluded that it was reasonably probable\nthat Pinholster had suffered from partial epilepsy since at\nleast 1968 and had suffered from brain injury since at\nleast 1964. Id., at ER–701.\n   Pinholster’s second expert was Dr. Sophia Vinogradov,\nassociate professor of psychiatry at the University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco. Dr. Vinogradov’s testimony\nwas based on essentially the same facts as Dr. Woods’ and\nDr. Stalberg’s state-court declarations. She highlighted\nPinholster’s childhood head traumas, history of epilepsy,\nabusive and neglected upbringing, history of substance\nabuse, and bizarre behavior on the night of the homicides.\nShe opined that his aggressive behavior resulted from\nchildhood head traumas:\n    “All data indicates that there were severe effects of\n    the two serious head injuries sustained at age 2 and\n    age 3, with evidence for behavioral changes related to\n    dysfunction of frontal cortex: severe attentional and\n    learning problems in childhood, hyperactivity, aggres\n    sivity, impulsivity, social-emotional impairment, sei\n    zure disorder, and explosive dyscontrol.” Id., at ER–\n    731.\nShe also opined that, right before the homicides, Pinhol\nster was in an “apparently hallucinatory state [that] was\nlikely the result of his intoxication with multiple sub\nstances.” Id., at ER–707\n   The State presented two experts: Dr. Stalberg, the\n\f40                    CULLEN v.

Although Dr. Stalberg\nmaintained that Pinholster suffered from antisocial per\nsonality disorder, which was his original diagnosis in the\nmiddle of trial, he again emphasized that there was “vo\nluminous” and “compelling” mitigation evidence that had\nnot previously been made available to him or presented to\nthe jury. Id., at ER–926, ER–953. He stated that conver\nsations with Pinholster’s family revealed that he and his\nsiblings were “raised like animals, wild animals,” id., at\nER–948, and he opined that Pinholster’s upbringing was a\nrisk factor for antisocial personality disorder. See ibid.\n(Pinholster’s upbringing “would speak volumes, looking at\nit from a mitigation point of view”). And he agreed that\nthe mitigation evidence presented at trial was “profoundly\nmisleading.” Id., at ER–966. Dr. Rudnick testified that\nPinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder.\n   The State also introduced into evidence the 1978 proba\ntion report that Pinholster’s counsel had in their posses\nsion at the time of his trial. The report demonstrated that\ncounsel were aware that Pinholster was in classes for\neducationally handicapped children, that he was commit\nted to a state hospital for emotionally handicapped chil\ndren, and that he suffered two “severe head injuries.” Id.,\nat SER–243.\n                             B\n     Much of the evidence presented at the federal hearing\n——————\n   28 Before the hearing, Dr. Stalberg had opined that Pinholster was\n\n“substantially impaired by a bipolar mood disorder operating synergis\ntically with intoxication and a seizure disorder at the time the crime\nwas committed.” Record ER–587. At a prehearing deposition, however,\nDr. Stalberg revised his opinion and stated that he continued to believe\nthat Pinholster suffered from psychopathic personality traits. After the\ndeposition, Pinholster elected to proceed with a different expert, pre\nsumably in light of Dr. Stalberg’s unexpected change in position. The\nState then retained Dr. Stalberg as its own expert.\n\f                      Cite as: 563 U.

The additional evidence presented at the\nhearing only confirmed that the California Supreme Court\ncould not reasonably have rejected Pinholster’s claim.29\n   For example, the probation report presented by the\nState confirmed that counsel had in their possession in\nformation that would have led any reasonable attorney “to\ninvestigate further.” Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 527. Counsel\nnevertheless took no action to investigate these leads.\n   Pinholster’s experts opined that his childhood head\ntraumas likely resulted in brain injury and conferred a\nrisk of epilepsy. Although the State presented testimony\nthat Pinholster had antisocial personality disorder, it was\nnot clear error for the District Court to conclude that\njurors could have credited Pinholster’s experts. Even the\n——————\n  29 The  State argues that the District Court was not entitled to rely on\nthe evidence adduced at the hearing because Pinholster was not dili\ngent in developing his claims in state court and the hearing was there\nfore barred by 28 U. S. C. §2254(e)(2). This argument is somewhat\nimprecise. Pinholster’s allegations in his amended federal petition\nwere “identical” to the allegations he presented to the California\nSupreme Court, ante, at 6, and he diligently requested a hearing in\nstate court. The State presumably means to argue that Pinholster’s\nnew expert testimony changed “the factual basis” of his claim such that,\nby the time of the evidentiary hearing, he no longer satisfied\n§2254(e)(2). However, at oral argument, the State suggested that\nPinholster was presenting an altogether new claim in the federal court.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. If that is the case, §2254(d)(1) does not apply at\nall, and the State should be arguing lack of exhaustion or procedural\ndefault. I do not understand Pinholster to have presented a new claim\nto the District Court.\n  In any event, Pinholster satisfied §2254(e)(2) in this case. He made\n“a reasonable attempt, in light of the information available at the time,\nto investigate and pursue claims in state court.” Michael Williams, 529\nU. S., at 435. His experts relied on the very same facts and evidence. I\ncannot read §2254(e)(2) to impose a strict requirement that petitioners\nmust use the same experts they presented to the state court. This rule\nwould result in numerous practical problems, for example in the case of\nthe unanticipated death of an expert.\n\f42                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nState’s own expert, Dr. Stalberg, testified to the “volumi\nnous” mitigation evidence in Pinholster’s case. Record ER–\n926.\n  In sum, the evidence confirmed what was already ap\nparent from the state-court record: Pinholster’s counsel\nfailed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation,\nand there was a reasonable probability that at least one\njuror confronted with the “voluminous” mitigating evi\ndence counsel should have discovered would have voted to\nspare Pinholster’s life. Ibid. Accordingly, whether on the\nbasis of the state- or federal-court record, the courts below\ncorrectly concluded that Pinholster had shown that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s decision reflected an unrea\nsonable application of Strickland.30\n                        *     *     *\n  I cannot agree with either aspect of the Court’s ruling. I\nfear the consequences of the Court’s novel interpretation\nof §2254(d)(1) for diligent state habeas petitioners with\ncompelling evidence supporting their claims who were\nunable, through no fault of their own, to present that\nevidence to the state court that adjudicated their claims.\nAnd the Court’s conclusion that the California Supreme\nCourt reasonably denied Pinholster’s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim overlooks counsel’s failure to\ninvestigate obvious avenues of mitigation and the contrast\nbetween the woefully inadequate mitigation case they\npresented and the evidence they should and would have\ndiscovered. I respectfully dissent.\n\n——————\n   30 The State’s challenge in this Court is limited to the questions\n\nwhether the Federal District Court was entitled to consider the addi\ntional evidence in the §2254(d)(1) analysis and whether Pinholster\nsatisfied §2254(d)(1) on the basis of the state-court record. It has not\nchallenged the District Court’s ultimate conclusion that Pinholster had\nproved that he was “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws\nor treaties of the United States.” §2254(a).\n\f",

PINHOLSTER\n\nCERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR\n                  THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n    No. 09–1088. Argued November 9, 2010—Decided April 4, 2011\nA California jury convicted respondent Pinholster on two counts of first\n  degree murder. At the penalty phase before the same jury, the prose\n  cution produced eight witnesses, who testified about Pinholster’s his\n  tory of threatening and violent behavior. Pinholster’s trial counsel,\n  who unsuccessfully sought to exclude the aggravating evidence on the\n  ground that the prosecution had not given Pinholster proper notice\n  under California law, called only Pinholster’s mother. Counsel did\n  not call a psychiatrist, though they had consulted with Dr. Stalberg,\n  who had diagnosed Pinholster with antisocial personality disorder.\n  The jury recommended the death penalty, and Pinholster was sen\n  tenced to death. Pinholster twice sought habeas relief in the Califor\n  nia Supreme Court, alleging, inter alia, that his trial counsel had\n  failed to adequately investigate and present mitigating evidence dur\n  ing the penalty phase. He introduced additional evidence to support\n  his claim: school, medical, and legal records; and declarations from\n  family members, one of his trial attorneys, and Dr. Woods, a psychia\n  trist who diagnosed him with bipolar mood disorder and seizure dis\n  orders, and who criticized Dr. Stalberg’s report. Each time, the State\n  Supreme Court unanimously and summarily denied the claim on the\n  merits. Subsequently, a Federal District Court held an evidentiary\n  hearing and granted Pinholster federal habeas relief under </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span>\n  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §2254. Affirming, the en banc Ninth Circuit considered the\n  new evidence adduced in the District Court hearing and held that the\n  State Supreme Court’s decision “involved an unreasonable applica\n  tion of . . . clearly established Federal law,” §2254(d)(1).\nHeld:\n    1. Review under §2254(d)(1) is limited to the record that was before\n the state court that adjudicated the claim on the merits. Pp. 8–14.\n\f2                       CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                                  Syllabus\n\n          (a) As amended by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Pen\n    alty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), §2254 sets several limits on a federal\n    court’s power to grant habeas relief to a state prisoner. As relevant\n    here, a claim that has been “adjudicated on the merits in State court\n    proceedings,” “shall not be granted . . . unless the adjudication” “(1)\n    resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreason\n    able application of, clearly established Federal law,” or “(2) resulted\n    in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the\n    facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.”\n    §2254(d).

Section 2254(d)(1)’s backward-looking lan\n    guage—“resulted in” and “involved”—requires an examination of the\n    state-court decision at the time it was made. It follows that the re\n    cord under review is also limited to the record in existence at that\n    same time—i.e., the state-court record. This understanding is com\n    pelled by “the broader context of the statute as a whole,” which dem\n    onstrates Congress’ intent to channel prisoners’ claims first to state\n    courts.

It is also con\n    sistent with this Court’s precedents, which emphasize that\n    §2254(d)(1) review focuses on what a state court knew and did. See,\n    e.g., Lockyer v.

The Ninth Circuit wrongly interpreted Wil\n    liams v.

Pp. 8–12.\n          (b) This holding does not render superfluous §2254(e)(2)—which\n    limits the federal habeas courts’ discretion to take new evidence in an\n    evidentiary hearing. At a minimum, §2254(e)(2) still restricts their\n    discretion in claims that were not adjudicated on the merits in state\n    court. Although state prisoners may sometimes submit new evidence\n    in federal court, AEDPA’s statutory scheme is designed to strongly\n    discourage them from doing so. Pp. 13–14.\n          (c) Remand for a properly limited review is inappropriate here,\n    because the Ninth Circuit ruled, in the alternative, that Pinholster\n    merited habeas relief on the state-court record alone.

Pp. 16–18.\n     (c) Pinholster has not shown that the State Supreme Court’s de\ncision that he could not demonstrate deficient performance by his\ntrial counsel necessarily involved an unreasonable application of fed\neral law. Pp. 18–26.\n        (1) The state-court record supports the idea that his counsel\nacted strategically to get the prosecution’s aggravation witnesses ex\ncluded for lack of notice, and if that failed, to put on his mother as a\nmitigation witness. Billing records show that they spent time inves\ntigating mitigating evidence. The record also shows that they had an\nunsympathetic client who had boasted about his criminal history dur\ning the guilt phase, leaving them with limited mitigation strategies.\nIn addition, when Dr. Stalberg concluded that Pinholster had no sig\nnificant mental disorder or defect, he was aware of Pinholster’s medi\ncal and social history. Given these impediments, it would have been\na reasonable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy for\nPinholster’s mother. Pinholster has responded with only a handful of\npost-hoc nondenials by one of his lawyers. Pp. 18–23.\n        (2) The Ninth Circuit misapplied Strickland when it drew from\nthis Court’s recent cases a “constitutional duty to investigate” and a\nprinciple that it was prima facie ineffective for counsel to abandon an\ninvestigation based on rudimentary knowledge of Pinholster’s back\nground. Beyond the general requirement of reasonableness, “specific\nguidelines are not appropriate” under Strickland. 466 U.

Pp. 23–26.\n     (d) Even if his trial counsel had performed deficiently, Pinholster\nalso has failed to show that the State Supreme Court must have un\nreasonably concluded that he was not prejudiced.

Here, the State pre\n\f4                       CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                                 Syllabus\n\n    sented extensive aggravating evidence at both the guilt and penalty\n    phases. The mitigating evidence consisted primarily of the penalty\n    phase testimony of Pinholster’s mother and guilt-phase testimony\n    given by his brother. After considering the evidence, the jury re\n    turned a sentence of death, which the state trial court found sup\n    ported overwhelmingly by the weight of the evidence. Pp. 26–29.\n           (2) There is no reasonable probability that the additional evi\n    dence presented at Pinholster’s state proceedings would have\n    changed the verdict. The “new” evidence largely duplicated the miti\n    gation evidence of his mother and brother at trial. To the extent that\n    there were new factual allegations or evidence, much of it is of ques\n    tionable mitigating value. Dr. Woods’ testimony would have opened\n    the door to rebuttal by a state expert; and new evidence relating to\n    Pinholster’s substance abuse, mental illness, and criminal problems\n    could lead a jury to conclude that he was beyond rehabilitation. The\n    remaining new material in the state habeas record is sparse. Given\n    what little additional mitigating evidence Pinholster presented in\n    state habeas, the Court cannot say that the State Supreme Court’s\n    determination was unreasonable. Pp. 29–30.\n           (3) Because this Court did not apply AEDPA deference to the\n    question of prejudice in Williams v. Taylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145122\"><a href=\"/opinion/145122/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, and Rom\n    pilla v.

On the way, they\nstopped at Lisa Tapar’s house, where Pinholster put his\nbuck knife through her front door and scratched a swas­\ntika into her car after she refused to talk to him. The\nthree men, who were all armed with buck knives, found no\none at Kumar’s house, broke in, and began ransacking the\nhome. They came across only a small amount of mari­\njuana before Kumar’s friends, Thomas Johnson and\nRobert Beckett, arrived and shouted that they were calling\nthe police.\n  Pinholster and his accomplices tried to escape through\nthe rear door, but Johnson blocked their path. Pinholster\nbacked Johnson onto the patio, demanding drugs and\nmoney and repeatedly striking him in the chest. Johnson\ndropped his wallet on the ground and stopped resisting.\nBeckett then came around the corner, and Pinholster\nattacked him, too, stabbing him repeatedly in the chest.\nPinholster forced Beckett to the ground, took both men’s\nwallets, and began kicking Beckett in the head. Mean­\nwhile, Brown stabbed Johnson in the chest, “ ‘bury[ing] his\nknife to the hilt.’ ” 35 Reporter’s Tr. 4947 (hereinafter Tr.).\nJohnson and Beckett died of their wounds.\n  Corona drove the three men to Pinholster’s apartment.\nWhile in the car, Pinholster and Brown exulted, “ ‘We got\n’em, man, we got ’em good.’ ” Ibid. At the apartment,\nPinholster washed his knife, and the three split the pro­\nceeds of the robbery: $23 and one quarter-ounce of mari­\njuana. Although Pinholster instructed Corona to “lay\nlow,” Corona turned himself in to the police two weeks\nlater. Id., at 4955. Pinholster was arrested shortly there­\nafter and threatened to kill Corona if he did not keep quiet\nabout the burglary and murders. Corona later became the\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)            3\n\n                     Opinion of the Court\n\nState’s primary witness. The prosecution brought numer­\nous charges against Pinholster, including two counts of\nfirst-degree murder.\n                             B\n  The California trial court appointed Harry Brainard and\nWilbur Dettmar to defend Pinholster on charges of first­\ndegree murder, robbery, and burglary. Before their ap­\npointment, Pinholster had rejected other attorneys and\ninsisted on representing himself. During that time, the\nState had mailed Pinholster a letter in jail informing him\nthat the prosecution planned to offer aggravating evidence\nduring the penalty phase of trial to support a sentence of\ndeath.\n  The guilt phase of the trial began on February 28, 1984.\nPinholster testified on his own behalf and presented an\nalibi defense. He claimed that he had broken into\nKumar’s house alone at around 8 p.m. on January 8, 1982,\nand had stolen marijuana but denied killing anyone.\nPinholster asserted that later that night around 1 a.m.,\nwhile he was elsewhere, Corona went to Kumar’s house to\nsteal more drugs and did not return for three hours.\nPinholster told the jury that he was a “professional rob­\nber,” not a murderer. 43 id., at 6204. He boasted of com­\nmitting hundreds of robberies over the previous six years\nbut insisted that he always used a gun, never a knife. The\njury convicted Pinholster on both counts of first-degree\nmurder.\n  Before the penalty phase, Brainard and Dettmar moved\nto exclude any aggravating evidence on the ground that\nthe prosecution had failed to provide notice of the evidence\nto be introduced, as required by Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§190.3 (West 2008). At a hearing on April 24, Dettmar\nargued that, in reliance on the lack of notice, he was “not\npresently prepared to offer anything by way of mitigation.”\n52 Tr. 7250. He acknowledged, however, that the prosecu­\n\f4                CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                    Opinion of the Court\n\ntor “possibly ha[d] met the [notice] requirement.” Ibid.\nThe trial court asked whether a continuance might be\nhelpful, but Dettmar declined, explaining that he could\nnot think of a mitigation witness other than Pinholster’s\nmother and that additional time would not “make a great\ndeal of difference.” Id., at 7257–7258. Three days later,\nafter hearing testimony, the court found that Pinholster\nhad received notice while representing himself and denied\nthe motion to exclude.\n  The penalty phase was held before the same jury that\nhad convicted Pinholster. The prosecution produced eight\nwitnesses, who testified about Pinholster’s history of\nthreatening and violent behavior, including resisting\narrest and assaulting police officers, involvement with\njuvenile gangs, and a substantial prison disciplinary\nrecord. Defense counsel called only Pinholster’s mother,\nBurnice Brashear. She gave an account of Pinholster’s\ntroubled childhood and adolescent years, discussed Pin­\nholster’s siblings, and described Pinholster as “a perfect\ngentleman at home.” Id., at 7405. Defense counsel did not\ncall a psychiatrist, though they had consulted Dr. John\nStalberg at least six weeks earlier. Dr. Stalberg noted\nPinholster’s “psychopathic personality traits,” diagnosed\nhim with antisocial personality disorder, and concluded\nthat he “was not under the influence of extreme mental or\nemotional disturbance” at the time of the murders. App.\n131.\n  After 2½ days of deliberation, the jury unanimously\nvoted for death on each of the two murder counts. On\nmandatory appeal, the California Supreme Court affirmed\nthe judgment.

He alleged that Brainard and Dettmar\nhad failed to adequately investigate and present mitigat­\ning evidence, including evidence of mental disorders.\nPinholster supported this claim with school, medical, and\nlegal records, as well as declarations from family mem­\nbers, Brainard, and Dr. George Woods, a psychiatrist who\ndiagnosed Pinholster with bipolar mood disorder and\nseizure disorders.

Section 2254(a) permits a federal court to entertain\nonly those applications alleging that a person is in state\ncustody “in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties\nof the United States.” Sections 2254(b) and (c) provide\nthat a federal court may not grant such applications\nunless, with certain exceptions, the applicant has ex­\nhausted state remedies.\n   If an application includes a claim that has been “adjudi­\ncated on the merits in State court proceedings,” §2254(d),\nan additional restriction applies.

The petitioner carries the burden of proof. Id., at 25.\n   We now hold that review under §2254(d)(1) is limited to\nthe record that was before the state court that adjudicated\nthe claim on the merits. Section 2254(d)(1) refers, in the\npast tense, to a state-court adjudication that “resulted in”\na decision that was contrary to, or “involved” an unrea­\nsonable application of, established law. This backward­\nlooking language requires an examination of the state­\ncourt decision at the time it was made. It follows that the\nrecord under review is limited to the record in existence at\nthat same time⎯i.e., the record before the state court.\n   This understanding of the text is compelled by “the\nbroader context of the statute as a whole,” which demon­\nstrates Congress’ intent to channel prisoners’ claims first\nto the state courts.

If the\nstate-court decision “identifies the correct governing legal\nprinciple” in existence at the time, a federal court must\nassess whether the decision “unreasonably applies that\nprinciple to the facts of the prisoner’s case.” Id., at 413. It\nwould be strange to ask federal courts to analyze whether\na state court’s adjudication resulted in a decision that\nunreasonably applied federal law to facts not before the\nstate court.3\n——————\n  3 JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR argues that there is nothing strange about al­\n\nlowing consideration of new evidence under §2254(d)(1) because, in her\nview, it would not be “so different” from some other tasks that courts\nundertake. Post, at 13 (dissenting opinion). What makes the consid­\neration of new evidence strange is not how “different” the task would\nbe, but rather the notion that a state court can be deemed to have\nunreasonably applied federal law to evidence it did not even know\nexisted. We cannot comprehend how exactly a state court would have\nany control over its application of law to matters beyond its knowledge.\nAdopting JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR’s approach would not take seriously\nAEDPA’s requirement that federal courts defer to state-court decisions\nand would effectively treat the statute as no more than a “ ‘mood’ that\nthe Federal Judiciary must respect,” Terry Williams, 529 U.

In practical effect, we went on to note, this\nmeans that when the state-court record “precludes habeas\nrelief” under the limitations of §2254(d), a district court is\n“not required to hold an evidentiary hearing.” Id., at 474\n(citing with approval the Ninth Circuit’s recognition that\n“an evidentiary hearing is not required on issues that can\nbe resolved by reference to the state court record” (internal\nquotation marks omitted)).\n   The Court of Appeals wrongly interpreted Williams v.\nTaylor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118356\"><a href=\"/opinion/118356/williams-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000) (Michael Williams), as sup­\nporting the contrary view.        The question there was\nwhether the lower court had correctly determined that\n§2254(e)(2) barred the petitioner’s request for a federal\nevidentiary hearing.4 Michael Williams did not concern\nwhether evidence introduced in such a hearing could be\nconsidered under §2254(d)(1). In fact, only one claim at\nissue in that case was even subject to §2254(d); the rest\nhad not been adjudicated on the merits in state-court\nproceedings.

In the\npassage that she quotes, see ibid., the Court merely explains that\n§2254(e)(2) should be interpreted in a way that does not preclude a\nstate prisoner, who was diligent in state habeas court and who can\n\f12                    CULLEN v.

The lower court in that case had determined\nthat the one claim subject to §2254(d)(1) did not satisfy\nthat statutory requirement. In light of that ruling, this\nCourt concluded that it was “unnecessary to reach the\nquestion whether §2254(e)(2) would permit a [federal]\nhearing on th[at] claim.” Id., at 444. That conclusion is\nfully consistent with our holding that evidence later intro­\nduced in federal court is irrelevant to §2254(d)(1) review.\n   The Court of Appeals’ reliance on Holland v.

In\nHolland, we initially stated that “whether a state court’s\ndecision was unreasonable [under §2254(d)(1)] must be\nassessed in light of the record the court had before it.” Id.,\nat 652. We then went on to assume for the sake of argu­\nment what some Courts of Appeals had held⎯that\n§2254(d)(1), despite its mandatory language, simply does\nnot apply when a federal habeas court has admitted new\nevidence that supports a claim previously adjudicated in\nstate court.6 Id., at 653. There was no reason to decide\nthat question because regardless, the hearing should have\nbeen barred by §2254(e)(2). Today, we reject that assump­\ntion and hold that evidence introduced in federal court\nhas no bearing on §2254(d)(1) review. If a claim has\nbeen adjudicated on the merits by a state court, a fed­\neral habeas petitioner must overcome the limitation of\n§2254(d)(1) on the record that was before that state court.7\n——————\nsatisfy §2254(d), from receiving an evidentiary hearing.\n  6 In Bradshaw v.

The additional clarity of §2254(d)(2) on this point,\nhowever, does not detract from our view that §2254(d)(1) also is plainly\nlimited to the state-court record.

Like §2254(d)(1), it carries out\n“AEDPA’s goal of promoting comity, finality, and federal­\nism by giving state courts the first opportunity to review\n[a] claim, and to correct any constitutional violation in the\nfirst instance.” Jimenez v.

For exam­\nple, not all federal habeas claims by state prisoners fall\nwithin the scope of §2254(d), which applies only to claims\n“adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings.” At\na minimum, therefore, §2254(e)(2) still restricts the discre­\ntion of federal habeas courts to consider new evidence\nwhen deciding claims that were not adjudicated on the\nmerits in state court.

The focus of that section is\nnot on “preserving the opportunity” for hearings, post, at 9, but rather\non limiting the discretion of federal district courts in holding hearings.\nWe see no need in this case to address the proper application of\n§2254(e)(2). See n. 20, infra. But see post, at 12 (suggesting that we\nhave given §2254(e)(2) “an unnaturally cramped reading”).\n  9 In all events, of course, the requirements of §§2254(a) through (c)\n\nremain significant limitations on the power of a federal court to grant\nhabeas relief.\n\f14                   CULLEN v.

The California Supreme Court denied each of\nthose petitions “on the substantive ground that it is with­\nout merit.”11\n  Section 2254(d) applies even where there has been a\nsummary denial. See Richter, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at\n8). In these circumstances, Pinholster can satisfy the\n“unreasonable application” prong of §2254(d)(1) only by\nshowing that “there was no reasonable basis” for the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s decision.

See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal\nFoundation 26. By contrast, the most favorable approach for Pinholster\nwould be review of only the second state habeas proceeding, the record\nof which includes all of the evidence that Pinholster ever submitted in\nstate habeas. We have not previously ruled on how to proceed in these\ncircumstances, and we need not do so here. Even taking the approach\nmost favorable to Pinholster, and reviewing only whether the California\nSupreme Court was objectively unreasonable in the second state\nhabeas proceeding, we find that Pinholster has failed to satisfy\n§2254(d)(1).\n\f                  Cite as: 563 U.

Pinholster must demonstrate that it was necessarily\nunreasonable for the California Supreme Court to con­\nclude: (1) that he had not overcome the strong presump­\ntion of competence; and (2) that he had failed to under­\nmine confidence in the jury’s sentence of death.\n                              C\n                              1\n   Pinholster has not shown that the California Supreme\nCourt’s decision that he could not demonstrate deficient\nperformance by his trial counsel necessarily involved an\nunreasonable application of federal law. In arguing to the\nstate court that his counsel performed deficiently, Pinhol­\nster contended that they should have pursued and pre­\nsented additional evidence about: his family members and\ntheir criminal, mental, and substance abuse problems; his\nschooling; and his medical and mental health history,\nincluding his epileptic disorder. To support his allegation\nthat his trial counsel had “no reasonable tactical basis” for\nthe approach they took, Pinholster relied on statements\nhis counsel made at trial. App. to Brief in Opposition 143.\nWhen arguing the motion to exclude the State’s aggravat­\ning evidence at the penalty phase for failure to comply\nwith Cal. Penal Code Ann. §190.3, Dettmar, one of Pinhol­\nster’s counsel, contended that because the State did not\nprovide notice, he “[was] not presently prepared to offer\nanything by way of mitigation,” 52 Tr. 7250. In response\nto the trial court’s inquiry as to whether a continuance\nmight be helpful, Dettmar noted that the only mitigation\nwitness he could think of was Pinholster’s mother. Addi­\ntional time, Dettmar stated, would not “make a great deal\nof difference.” Id., at 7257–7258.\n   We begin with the premise that “under the circum­\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U.

J.).\nFurther, if their motion was denied, counsel were pre­\npared to present only Pinholster’s mother in the penalty\nphase to create sympathy not for Pinholster, but for his\nmother. After all, the “ ‘family sympathy’ ” mitigation\ndefense was known to the defense bar in California at the\ntime and had been used by other attorneys. Id., at 707.\nRather than displaying neglect, we presume that Dett­\nmar’s arguments were part of this trial strategy. See\nGentry, supra, at 8 (“[T]here is a strong presumption that\n[counsel took certain actions] for tactical reasons rather\nthan through sheer neglect” (citing Strickland, supra, at\n690)).\n  The state-court record supports the idea that Pinhol­\nster’s counsel acted strategically to get the prosecution’s\naggravation witnesses excluded for lack of notice, and if\nthat failed, to put on Pinholster’s mother. Other state­\nments made during the argument regarding the motion to\nexclude suggest that defense counsel were trying to take\nadvantage of a legal technicality and were not truly sur­\nprised.

Dettmar admitted that the prosecu­\ntor, “being as thorough as she is, possibly ha[d] met the\nrequirement.” Id., at 7250. But if so, he wanted her “to\nmake that representation to the court.”13 Ibid.\n   Timesheets indicate that Pinholster’s trial counsel\ninvestigated mitigating evidence.14 Long before the guilty\nverdict, Dettmar talked with Pinholster’s mother and\ncontacted a psychiatrist.15 On February 26, two months\nbefore the penalty phase started, he billed six hours\nfor “[p]reparation argument, death penalty phase.” See\nClerk’s Tr. 864. Brainard, who merely assisted Dettmar\nfor the penalty phase, researched epilepsy and also inter­\nviewed Pinholster’s mother.16 We know that Brainard\nlikely spent additional time, not reflected in these entries,\npreparing Pinholster’s brother, Terry, who provided some\nmitigation testimony about Pinholster’s background dur­\n\n——————\n  13 Counsel’s argument was persuasive enough to cause the trial court\n\nto hold a hearing and take testimony before denying the motion to\nexclude.\n  14 Both parties agree that these billing records were before the Cali­\n\nfornia Supreme Court.

He bragged about\nbeing a “professional robber.” 43 id., at 6204. To sup-\nport his defense, Pinholster claimed that he used only\nguns⎯not knives⎯to commit his crimes. But during\ncross-examination, Pinholster admitted that he had previ­\nously been convicted of using a knife in a kidnaping.\nPinholster also said he was a white supremacist and that\nhe frequently carved swastikas into other people’s prop­\nerty as “a sideline to robbery.” 44 id., at 6246.\n   Trial counsel’s psychiatric expert, Dr. Stalberg, had\nconcluded that Pinholster showed no significant signs or\nsymptoms of mental disorder or defect other than his\n“psychopathic personality traits.” App. 131. Dr. Stalberg\nwas aware of Pinholster’s hyperactivity as a youngster,\nhospitalization at age 14 for incorrigibility, alleged epilep­\ntic disorder, and history of drug dependency. Neverthe­\nless, Dr. Stalberg told counsel that Pinholster did not\nappear to suffer from brain damage, was not significantly\nintoxicated or impaired on the night in question, and did\nnot have an impaired ability to appreciate the criminality\nof his conduct.\n   Given these impediments, it would have been a reason­\nable penalty-phase strategy to focus on evoking sympathy\nfor Pinholster’s mother.

The prosecutor carefully opened her\ncross-examination of Pinholster’s mother with, “I hope you\nunderstand I don’t enjoy cross-examining a mother of\nanybody.” 52 Tr. 7407. And in her closing argument, the\nprosecutor attempted to undercut defense counsel’s strat­\negy by pointing out, “Even the most heinous person born,\neven Adolph Hitler[,] probably had a mother who loved\nhim.” 53 id., at 7452.\n   Pinholster’s only response to this evidence is a series of\ndeclarations from Brainard submitted with Pinholster’s\nfirst state habeas petition, seven years after the trial.\nBrainard declares that he has “no recollection” of inter­\nviewing any family members (other than Pinholster’s\nmother) regarding penalty-phase testimony, of attempting\nto secure Pinholster’s school or medical records, or of\ninterviewing any former teachers or counselors.

The jury also heard about Pinholster’s involve­\nment in juvenile gangs and his substantial disciplinary\nrecord in both county and state jails, where he had threat­\nened, assaulted, and thrown urine at guards, and fought\nwith other inmates. While in jail, Pinholster had been\nsegregated for a time due to his propensity for violence\nand placed on a “special disciplinary diet” reserved only\nfor the most disruptive inmates. 52 Tr. 7305.\n   The mitigating evidence consisted primarily of the\npenalty-phase testimony of Pinholster’s mother, Brashear,\nwho gave a detailed account of Pinholster’s troubled child­\nhood and adolescence. Early childhood was quite difficult.\nThe family “didn’t have lots of money.” Id., at 7404.\nWhen he was very young, Pinholster suffered two serious\nhead injuries, first at age 2 or 3 when he was run over by a\ncar, and again at age 4 or 5 when he went through the\nwindshield during a car accident. When he was 5, Pinhol­\nster’s stepfather moved in and was abusive, or nearly so.\n   Pinholster always struggled in school. He was disrup­\ntive in kindergarten and was failing by first grade. He got\nin fights and would run out of the classroom. In third\ngrade, Pinholster’s teacher suggested that he was more\nthan just a “ ‘disruptive child.’ ” Id., at 7394.

He spent six months when he was 12\nin a state mental institution for emotionally handicapped\nchildren. By the time he was 18, Pinholster was in county\njail, where he was beaten badly. Brashear suspected that\nthe beating caused Pinholster’s epilepsy, for which he has\nbeen prescribed medication. After a stint in state prison,\nPinholster returned home but acted “unusual” and had\ntrouble readjusting to life. Id., at 7405.\n   Pinholster’s siblings were “basically very good children,”\nalthough they would get into trouble. Id., at 7401. His\nbrother, Terry, had been arrested for drunk driving and\nhis sister, Tammy, for public intoxication. Tammy also\nwas arrested for drug possession and was self-destructive\nand “wild.” Ibid. Pinholster’s eldest brother, Alvin, died a\nfugitive from California authorities.19\n   In addition to Brashear’s penalty-phase testimony,\nPinholster had previously presented mitigating evidence\nduring the guilt phase from his brother, Terry. Terry\ntestified that Pinholster was “more or less in institutions\nall his life,” suffered from epilepsy, and was “more or less”\ndrunk on the night of the murders. 42 id., at 6015, 6036.\n   After considering this aggravating and mitigating evi­\ndence, the jury returned a sentence of death.

Any diligent prosecutor\nwould have challenged whatever mitigating evidence the defense had\nput on. And, we would certainly not expect the prosecutor’s closing\nargument to have described the evidence in the light most favorable to\nPinholster.

The “new”\nevidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence at\ntrial. School and medical records basically substantiate\nthe testimony of Pinholster’s mother and brother. Decla­\nrations from Pinholster’s siblings support his mother’s\ntestimony that his stepfather was abusive and explain\nthat Pinholster was beaten with fists, belts, and even\nwooden boards.\n   To the extent the state habeas record includes new\nfactual allegations or evidence, much of it is of question­\nable mitigating value. If Pinholster had called Dr. Woods\nto testify consistently with his psychiatric report, Pinhol­\nster would have opened the door to rebuttal by a state\nexpert. See, e.g., Wong v.

Mostly, there are just a few new details\nabout Pinholster’s childhood.       Pinholster apparently\nlooked like his biological father, whom his grandparents\n“loathed.” Pet. for Writ of Habeas Corpus in No. S004616\n(Cal.), Exh. 98, p. 1. Accordingly, whenever his grandpar­\nents “spanked or disciplined” the kids, Pinholster “always\ngot the worst of it.” Ibid. Pinholster was mostly unsuper­\nvised and “didn’t get much love,” because his mother and\nstepfather were always working and “were more concerned\nwith their own lives than the welfare of their kids.” Id., at\n2. Neither parent seemed concerned about Pinholster’s\nschooling. Finally, Pinholster’s aunt once saw the children\nmixing flour and water to make something to eat, al­\nthough “[m]ost meals consisted of canned spaghetti and\nfoods of that ilk.” Id., at 1.\n   Given what little additional mitigating evidence Pinhol­\nster presented in state habeas, we cannot say that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s determination was unreason­\nable. Having already heard much of what is included in\nthe state habeas record, the jury returned a sentence of\ndeath. Moreover, some of the new testimony would likely\nhave undercut the mitigating value of the testimony by\nPinholster’s mother. The new material is thus not so\nsignificant that, even assuming Pinholster’s trial counsel\nperformed deficiently, it was necessarily unreasonable for\nthe California Supreme Court to conclude that Pinholster\nhad failed to show a “substantial” likelihood of a different\nsentence.

An offender who\nbelieves he is entitled to habeas relief must first present a\nclaim (including his evidence) to the state courts. If the\nstate courts reject the claim, then a federal habeas court\nmay review that rejection on the basis of the materials\nconsidered by the state court. If the federal habeas court\nfinds that the state-court decision fails (d)’s test (or if (d)\ndoes not apply), then an (e) hearing may be needed.\n   For example, if the state-court rejection assumed the\nhabeas petitioner’s facts (deciding that, even if those facts\nwere true, federal law was not violated), then (after find\ning the state court wrong on a (d) ground) an (e) hearing\nmight be needed to determine whether the facts alleged\nwere indeed true. Or if the state-court rejection rested on\na state ground, which a federal habeas court found inade\n\f2                  CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                     Opinion of BREYER, J.\n\nquate, then an (e) hearing might be needed to consider the\npetitioner’s (now unblocked) substantive federal claim. Or\nif the state-court rejection rested on only one of several\nrelated federal grounds (e.g., that counsel’s assistance was\nnot “inadequate”), then, if the federal court found that the\nstate court’s decision in respect to the ground it decided\nviolated (d), an (e) hearing might be needed to consider\nother related parts of the whole constitutional claim (e.g.,\nwhether the counsel’s “inadequate” assistance was also\nprejudicial). There may be other situations in which an (e)\nhearing is needed as well.\n   In this case, however, we cannot say whether an (e)\nhearing is needed until we know whether the state court,\nin rejecting Pinholster’s claim on the basis presented to\nthat state court, violated (d). (In my view, the lower\ncourts’ analysis in respect to this matter is inadequate.)\n   There is no role in (d) analysis for a habeas petitioner to\nintroduce evidence that was not first presented to the\nstate courts. But that does not mean that Pinholster is\nwithout recourse to present new evidence. He can always\nreturn to state court presenting new evidence not previ\nously presented. If the state court again denies relief, he\nmight be able to return to federal court to make claims\nrelated to the latest rejection, subject to AEDPA’s limita\ntions on successive petitions.

There is no reason for the majority to decide\nwhether the §2254(d)(1) analysis is limited to the state\ncourt record because Pinholster satisfied §2254(d)(1) on\neither the state- or federal-court record.\n                             I\n  The Court first holds that, in determining whether a\nstate-court decision is an unreasonable application of\nSupreme Court precedent under §2254(d)(1), “review . . . is\nlimited to the record that was before the state court that\nadjudicated the claim on the merits.” Ante, at 9. New\nevidence adduced at a federal evidentiary hearing is\nnow irrelevant to determining whether a petitioner has\nsatisfied §2254(d)(1).

The disclosed documents reveal\nthat the State withheld other exculpatory witness state\nments, but state law would not permit the petitioner to\npresent the new evidence in a successive petition.6\n   Under our precedent, if the petitioner had not presented\nhis Brady claim to the state court at all, his claim would\nbe deemed defaulted and the petitioner could attempt to\nshow cause and prejudice to overcome the default. See\nMichael Williams, 529 U. S., at 444; see also n. 1, supra.\nIf, however, the new evidence merely bolsters a Brady\nclaim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court, it\nis unclear how the petitioner can obtain federal habeas\nrelief after today’s holding. What may have been a rea\nsonable decision on the state-court record may no longer\nbe reasonable in light of the new evidence. See Kyles v.\nWhitley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 436 (1995) (materiality of Brady\nevidence is viewed “collectively, not item by item”). Be\ncause the state court adjudicated the petitioner’s Brady\nclaim on the merits, §2254(d)(1) would still apply. Yet,\nunder the majority’s interpretation of §2254(d)(1), a fed\neral court is now prohibited from considering the new\nevidence in determining the reasonableness of the state\ncourt decision.\n   The majority’s interpretation of §2254(d)(1) thus sug\ngests the anomalous result that petitioners with new\nclaims based on newly obtained evidence can obtain fed\neral habeas relief if they can show cause and prejudice for\ntheir default but petitioners with newly obtained evidence\nsupporting a claim adjudicated on the merits in state court\n——————\n  6 See, e.g., id., at 37–38 (statement by counsel for the respondent\n\nwarden that Virginia law bars all successive habeas applications, even\nin cases where the petitioner has new evidence).\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U.

That the\nmajority’s interpretation leads to this anomaly is good\nreason to conclude that its interpretation is wrong. See\nKeeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112728\"><a href=\"/opinion/112728/keeney-v-tamayo-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">504</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7–8 (1992) (“[I]t is\n. . . irrational to distinguish between failing to properly\nassert a federal claim in state court and failing in state\ncourt to properly develop such a claim”).\n    The majority responds to this anomaly by suggesting\nthat my hypothetical petitioner “may well [have] a new\nclaim.”7 Ante, at 14, n. 10. This suggestion is puzzling.\nNew evidence does not usually give rise to a new claim; it\nmerely provides additional proof of a claim already adjudi\ncated on the merits.8 The majority presumably means\nto suggest that the petitioner might be able to obtain\nfederal-court review of his new evidence if he can show\ncause and prejudice for his failure to present the “new”\nclaim to a state court. In that scenario, however, the\nfederal court would review the purportedly “new” claim de\nnovo. The majority’s approach thus threatens to replace\ndeferential review of new evidence under §2254(d)(1) with\nde novo review of new evidence in the form of “new”\nclaims.9 Because it is unlikely that Congress intended\nde novo review—the result suggested by the majority’s\nopinion—it must have intended for district courts to\nconsider newly discovered evidence in conducting the\n§2254(d)(1) analysis.\n——————\n  7 The majority declines, however, to provide any guidance to the lower\n\ncourts on how to distinguish claims adjudicated on the merits from new\nclaims.\n  8 Even if it can fairly be argued that my hypothetical petitioner has a\n\nnew claim, the majority fails to explain how a diligent petitioner with\nnew evidence supporting an existing claim can present his new evi\ndence to a federal court.\n  9 In this vein, it is the majority’s approach that “would not take seri\n\nously AEDPA’s requirement that federal courts defer to state-court\ndecisions.” Ante, at 10, n. 3.\n\f12                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n  The majority’s reading of §2254(d)(1) appears ultimately\nto rest on its understanding that state courts must have\nthe first opportunity to adjudicate habeas petitioners’\nclaims. See ante, at 9–10 (“It would be contrary to\n[AEDPA’s exhaustion requirement] to allow a petitioner to\novercome an adverse state-court decision with new evi\ndence introduced in a federal habeas court and reviewed\nby that court in the first instance effectively de novo”).10\nJUSTICE BREYER takes the same position. See ante, at 2\n(opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part)\n(AEDPA is designed “to give the State a first opportunity\nto consider most matters”). I fully agree that habeas\npetitioners must attempt to present evidence to state\ncourts in the first instance, as does JUSTICE ALITO, see\nante, at 2. Where I disagree with the majority is in my\nunderstanding that §2254(e)(2) already accomplishes this\nresult.    By reading §2254(d)(1) to do the work of\n§2254(e)(2), the majority gives §2254(e)(2) an unnaturally\ncramped reading. As a result, the majority either has\nforeclosed habeas relief for diligent petitioners who,\nthrough no fault of their own, were unable to present\nexculpatory evidence to the state court that adjudicated\ntheir claims or has created a new set of procedural com\nplexities for the lower courts to navigate to ensure the\navailability of the Great Writ for diligent petitioners.\n                             3\n  These considerations lead me to agree with the courts of\nappeals that have concluded that a federal court should\nassess the reasonableness of a state court’s application of\nclearly established federal law under §2254(d)(1) in light\nof evidence properly admitted in a federal evidentiary\nhearing. There is nothing “strange” about this approach.\n——————\n  10 Under my reading of §2254(d)(1), of course, the district court would\n\nreview properly admitted new evidence through the deferential lens of\n§2254(d)(1), not de novo.\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)          13\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nAnte, at 10. Under §2254(d)(1), federal courts routinely\nengage in analysis that the state court itself might never\nhave conducted or did not conduct. For example, when a\nstate court summarily denies a claim without explanation,\nas the California Supreme Court did here, district courts\nmust deny habeas relief pursuant to §2254(d)(1) so long as\n“there is any reasonable argument” supporting the denial\nof the petitioner’s claim. Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 16). We likewise ask whether a state-court\ndecision unreasonably applied clearly established federal\nlaw when the state court issued a reasoned decision but\nfailed to cite federal law altogether. See Early v. Packer,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"122241\"><a href=\"/opinion/122241/early-v-packer/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (2002) (per curiam). Determining whether a\nstate court could reasonably have denied a petitioner relief\nin light of newly discovered evidence is not so different\nthan determining whether there is any reasonable basis\nfor a state court’s unreasoned decision.\n   Admittedly, the text of §2254(d)(1), standing alone, does\nnot compel either reading of that provision. But constru\ning §2254(d)(1) to permit consideration of evidence prop\nerly introduced in federal court best accords with the text\nof §2254(d)(2) and AEDPA’s structure as a whole. By\ninterpreting §2254(d)(1) to prevent nondiligent petitioners\nfrom gaming the system—the very purpose of\n§2254(e)(2)—the majority potentially has put habeas relief\nout of reach for diligent petitioners with meritorious\nclaims based on new evidence.\n                            C\n  The majority claims that its holding is “consistent” with\nour case law. Ante, at 10. Quite the opposite is true: Our\ncases reflect our previous understanding that evidence\nproperly admitted pursuant to §2254(e)(2) is relevant to\nthe §2254(d)(1) analysis.\n  In Landrigan, JUSTICE THOMAS, the author of today’s\nopinion, confirmed this understanding of the interplay\n\f14                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nbetween §§2254(d)(1) and 2254(e)(2). As noted above, we\nadmonished district courts to consider whether a peti\ntioner’s allegations, if proved true, would satisfy §2254(d)\nin determining whether to grant a hearing. After high\nlighting the deference owed to state courts under\n§§2254(d) and 2254(e)(1), we stated:\n     “In deciding whether to grant an evidentiary hearing,\n     a federal court must consider whether such a hearing\n     could enable an applicant to prove the petition’s fac\n     tual allegations, which, if true, would entitle the\n     applicant to federal habeas relief. Because the defer\n     ential standards prescribed by §2254 control whether\n     to grant habeas relief, a federal court must take into\n     account those standards in deciding whether an evi\n     dentiary hearing is appropriate.” 550 U. S., at 474 (ci\n     tation omitted).\nBy instructing district courts to consider the §2254(d)\nstandards in deciding whether to grant a hearing, we must\nhave understood that the evidence admitted at a hearing\ncould be considered in the §2254(d)(1) analysis. See Brief\nfor American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 9\n(“The whole point of Landrigan’s admonition that the\ncourt must decide whether to hold a hearing with an eye\non §2254(d)(1) is that some proffers of evidence will not\njustify federal fact-finding in view of §2254(d)(1), but that\nother proffers of proof will”).11\n   In Michael Williams, the warden argued that\n§2254(e)(2) bars an evidentiary hearing whenever a peti\ntioner was unable to develop the factual record in state\ncourt, “whether or not through his own fault or neglect.”\n——————\n  11 The majority overlooks this aspect of Landrigan. It quotes Landri\n\ngan’s observation that “if the record refutes the applicant’s factual\nallegations or otherwise precludes habeas relief, a district court is not\nrequired to hold an evidentiary hearing,” 550 U. S., at 474, but that\nstatement has no bearing on the question decided by the Court today.\n\f                    Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                  15\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n529 U. S., at 430. Under the warden’s argument, a peti\ntioner who did not develop the record in state court, what\never the reason, would be barred from presenting evidence\nto the federal court. In rejecting that argument, we\nobserved:\n     “A prisoner who developed his claim in state court and\n     can prove the state court’s decision was ‘contrary to,\n     or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly es\n     tablished Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n     Court of the United States,’ is not barred from obtain\n     ing relief by §2254(d)(1). If the opening clause of\n     §2254(e)(2) covers a request for an evidentiary hear\n     ing on a claim which was pursued with diligence but\n     remained undeveloped in state court because, for in\n     stance, the prosecution concealed the facts, a prisoner\n     lacking clear and convincing evidence of innocence\n     could be barred from a hearing on the claim even if he\n     could satisfy §2254(d).” Id., at 434 (citation omitted;\n     emphasis added).\nA petitioner in the latter situation would almost certainly\nbe unable to “satisfy §2254(d)” without introducing the\nconcealed facts in federal court. This passage thus reflects\nour understanding that, in some circumstances, a peti\ntioner might need an evidentiary hearing in federal court\nto prove the facts necessary to satisfy §2254(d). To avoid\nforeclosing habeas relief for such petitioners, we concluded\nthat §2254(e)(2) could not bear the warden’s “harsh read\ning,” which essentially would have held petitioners strictly\nat fault for their inability to develop the facts in state\ncourt. Ibid. The majority today gives an equally “harsh\nreading” to §2254(d)(1) to achieve the result we rejected in\nMichael Williams.12\n——————\n  12 The majority claims that Michael Williams supports its reading of\n\n§2254(d)(1). With respect to one claim asserted by the petitioner, we\nobserved that “[t]he Court of Appeals rejected this claim on the merits\n\f16                   CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\n   None of the other cases cited by the majority supports\nits result. In Williams v.

However, we had no reason\nto decide whether the §2254(d)(1) inquiry was limited to\nthe state-court record, as the District Court did not hold\nan evidentiary hearing in that case. See id., at 372.\n   In Holland v. Jackson, we stated that “we have made\nclear that whether a state court’s decision was unreason\nable must be assessed in light of the record the court had\nbefore it.” 542 U. S., at 652. In the next sentence, how\never, we observed that the evidence at issue “could have\nbeen the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the District\nCourt, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing to\ndevelop that evidence in state court.” Id., at 652–653. We\nproceeded to find that the evidence was not properly ad\nmitted under §2254(e)(2) before concluding that the Court\nof Appeals had erred in its §2254(d)(1) analysis. Id., at\n653; see also Bradshaw v. Richey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1992738\"><a href=\"/opinion/1992738/bradshaw-v-richey/\"><span class=\"volume\">546</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">74</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 79 (2005)\n(per curiam).\n   In sum, our cases reflect our recognition that it is some\ntimes appropriate to consider new evidence in deciding\nwhether a petitioner can satisfy §2254(d)(1). In reading\nour precedent to require the opposite conclusion, the ma\njority disregards the concerns that motivated our decision\nin Michael Williams: Some petitioners, even if diligent,\n——————\nunder §2254(d)(1), so it is unnecessary to reach the question whether\n§2254(e)(2) would permit a hearing on the claim.” 529 U. S., at 444.\nThat statement merely reflects the fact that the Court of Appeals had\nrejected that claim under §2254(d)(1) without considering whether the\npetitioner was entitled to a hearing because the petitioner had not\nrequested a hearing on that claim.

I therefore highlight several aspects of the\nfacts and history of this case.\n\n——————\n  13 I agree with the majority that the state-court record in this case\nconsists of “the ‘allegations of [the] habeas corpus petition . . . and . . .\nany matter of record pertaining to the case.’ ” Ante, at 16, n. 12 (quot\ning In re Hochberg, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1402261\"><a href=\"/opinion/1402261/in-re-hochberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">2</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">870</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 874, n. 2, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1402261\"><a href=\"/opinion/1402261/in-re-hochberg/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3–4, n. 2\n(1970); some internal quotation marks omitted).\n   The majority does not decide which of the two state-court decisions\nshould be reviewed. See ante, at 15, n. 11. One amicus argues that\nPinholster must prove that both state-court decisions involved an\nunreasonable application of law. See Brief for Criminal Justice Legal\nFoundation as Amicus Curiae 26. This argument is based on amicus’\nunderstanding that the California Supreme Court rejected the second\npetition as successive and, alternatively, on the merits. The State has\nnot argued, however, that the second ruling rests on a procedural\nground. See ante, at 6, n. 2. When a state court denies two petitions on\nthe merits and the difference between the petitions is that the second\npetition contains additional evidence supporting the petitioner’s claim,\nI see no reason why the petitioner must independently show that the\nfirst decision was unreasonable.\n\f18                 CULLEN v.

This prompted discussion at sidebar regarding\nwhether the State had provided notice of its intent to offer\naggravating evidence. Pinholster’s court-appointed attor\nney, Wilbur Dettmar, argued that the State should be\nprecluded from offering aggravating evidence:\n     “I am not presently prepared to offer anything by way\n     of mitigation. If I was going to proceed on mitigation,\n     the people would have the right to rebuttal with or\n     without notice.\n        “I took the position, since the people had not given\n     notice, I had not prepared any evidence by way of miti\n     gation. I would submit it on that basis.” 52 Re\n     porter’s Tr. 7250 (hereinafter Tr.) (emphasis added).\nUndoubtedly anticipating that counsel might need addi\ntional time to prepare an adequate mitigation defense, the\ncourt asked Dettmar whether a continuance would be\nhelpful in the event it ruled against him. He declined the\noffer on the spot, stating: “I think we would probably still\ngo forward on Monday. Clearly the one person that comes\nto mind is the defendant’s mother. How much beyond that\nI don’t know. I don’t think the pa[ss]age of time would\nmake a great deal of difference.” Id., at 7257–7258. After\nhearing testimony, the court denied Pinholster’s motion to\npreclude aggravating evidence.\n   At the penalty phase, defense counsel called only one\nwitness: Pinholster’s mother, Burnice Brashear. Brashear\ntestified that Pinholster “never really wanted for anything\nat home too much” and “had everything normally materi\nalwise that most people have.” Id., at 7395. She said that\nPinholster was “different” from his siblings, whom she\ncharacterized as “basically very good children.” Id., at\n7401–7402. Pinholster, she said, had a “friendly” relation\n\f                    Cite as: 563 U.

She described two car accidents—one\nwhen she ran over him in the driveway and one when he\nwent through the windshield. Id., at 7389–7391. She\nstated that he started failing school in the first grade and\nthat the school eventually “sent him to [an] educationally\nhandicapped class.” Id., at 7393–7394. When Pinholster\nwas 10, a psychologist recommended placing him in a\nmental institution, but she “didn’t think he was that far\ngone.” Id., at 7395. A few years later, she testified, he\nspent six months in a state hospital for emotionally handi\ncapped children. Id., at 7402.\n   According to Brashear, Pinholster had suffered from\nepilepsy since age 18, when he was beaten in jail. Id.,\nat 7397. She said that her family doctor, Dr. Dubin,\nhad given him medication to treat the epilepsy. Ibid.\nBrashear also suggested that Pinholster did not have long\nto live, stating that he had “a chip in his head floating\naround” and that “they don’t think—he won’t be here very\nmuch longer anyway.”14 Ibid.\n   In closing argument, the prosecutor ridiculed Brashear’s\ntestimony. See 53 id., at 7442 (“She said his stepfather\ndisciplined him. So what? I am sure you have all disci\nplined your children. I was disciplined myself”); ibid.

Medical records, something”).\nThe prosecutor also highlighted Brashear’s testimony\nabout Pinholster’s stable home environment, arguing, “He\ncame from a good home. You heard that he was not a\ndeprived child. Had many things going for him, probably\nmore than many children.” Id., at 7442.\n  Notwithstanding the meager mitigation case presented\nby Pinholster’s counsel, it took the jury two days to reach a\ndecision to sentence Pinholster to death. His counsel later\nmoved to modify the sentence to life imprisonment. In\ndenying the motion, the trial judge stated, “The evidence\nwhich the defense offered concerning the defendant’s\nextenuation was merely some testimony from his mother\nthat was not persuasive. His mother did not, in the court’s\nopinion, present any evidence which the court would find\nto be a moral justification or extenuation for his conduct.\nNo witness supplied such evidence.” 54 id., at 7514.\n                                 2\n  After his conviction and sentence were affirmed on\nappeal, Pinholster filed a habeas petition in the California\nSupreme Court alleging, among other things, that his\ncounsel had “unreasonably failed to investigate, prepare\nand present available mitigating evidence during penalty\nphase.” Record ER–103.\n  Pinholster’s state-court petition included 121 exhibits.\nIn a series of declarations, his trial attorney Harry\nBrainard (who had by then been disbarred) confirmed\nwhat Dettmar had forthrightly told the trial court:\nBrainard and Dettmar neither expected nor prepared to\npresent mitigation evidence.15 See id., at ER–333 (“Mr.\n\n——————\n 15 By the time of Pinholster’s state-court habeas petition, Dettmar\n\nwas deceased.\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U.

Pinholster’s elder brother was ar\nrested for armed burglary, robbery, and forcible rape of a\n14-year-old with a deadly weapon. While in custody, he\nwas diagnosed as “catatonic-like” and “acutely psychotic,\nprobably suffering some type of schizophrenia.” Id., at\nER–219, ER–224. He later committed suicide.17 Pinhol\nster’s half sister, a recovering alcoholic, had been made a\nward of the juvenile court for prostitution and forcible\nsexual battery on a 14-year-old.\n  Pinholster’s petition and exhibits described a long his\ntory of emotional disturbance and neurological problems.\nA former schoolteacher stated that, as a child, Pinholster\n“seemed incapable of relating either to his peers or to\nadults,” that “[i]t was even hard to maintain eye contact\nwith him,” and that “[h]is hyperactivity was so extreme\nthat [she] formed the opinion it probably had an organic\nbase.” Id., at ER–231. School records revealed that he\n“talk[ed] to self continuously,” had “many grimaces,”\nfought in his sleep, and could “control self for only 1 hour\nper day.” Id., at ER–230, ER–233. He “show[ed] progres\nsive deterioration each semester since Kindergarten.” Id.,\nat ER–230.

He pointed to\ntrial testimony that immediately before the burglary on\nthe night of the homicides, Pinholster announced that he\n“ ‘ha[d] a message from God’ ”—which Dr. Woods believed\nto reflect “[a]uditory hallucinations” and “severe psycho\nsis.” Id., at ER–169. He concluded that at the time of the\nhomicides Pinholster “was suffering from bipolar mood\ndisorder with psychotic ideation and was suffering a com\nplex partial seizure.” Id., at ER–170. He also observed\nthat Pinholster’s “grossly dysfunctional family, the abuse\nhe received as a child, his history of suffering from sub\nstantial seizure and mood disorders, his frequently un\ntreated psychiatric and psychological disabilities and his\neducational handicaps were relevant circumstances which\nwould extenuate the gravity of the crime.” Id., at ER–171.\n   On the basis of Pinholster’s submission, the California\nSupreme Court denied Pinholster’s ineffective-assistance\nof-counsel claim.\n   Pinholster then filed a habeas petition in Federal Dis\ntrict Court. He included an additional exhibit: a declara\ntion by Dr. John Stalberg, a psychiatrist who had hastily\nexamined Pinholster and produced a two-page report in\nthe middle of the original trial.18 After reviewing the new\nmaterial collected by Pinholster’s habeas counsel, Dr.\nStalberg stated that the available evidence showed a\n——————\n  18 Counsel had arranged for Dr. Stalberg to examine Pinholster in the\n\nmiddle of his original trial.

As we stated in Strickland:\n    “[S]trategic choices made after thorough investigation\n    of law and facts relevant to plausible options are vir\n    tually unchallengeable; and strategic choices made af\n    ter less than complete investigation are reasonable\n    precisely to the extent that reasonable professional\n    judgments support the limitations on investigation.\n    In other words, counsel has a duty to make reasonable\n    investigations or to make a reasonable decision that\n    makes particular investigations unnecessary. In any\n    ineffectiveness case, a particular decision not to inves\n    tigate must be directly assessed for reasonableness in\n    all the circumstances, applying a heavy measure of\n    deference to counsel’s judgments.” 466 U.

There, counsel’s in\nvestigation was limited to three sources: psychological\ntesting, a presentencing report, and Department of Social\nServices records. 539 U. S., at 523–524. The records\nrevealed that the petitioner’s mother was an alcoholic,\nthat he displayed emotional difficulties in foster care, that\nhe was frequently absent from school, and that on one\noccasion, his mother left him alone for days without food.\nId., at 525. In these circumstances, we concluded, “any\nreasonably competent attorney would have realized that\npursuing these leads was necessary to making an in\nformed choice among possible defenses.” Ibid.

PINHOLSTER\n\n                   SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhad failed to allege that his counsel’s investigation was\ninadequate under Strickland.\n                             D\n   The majority also concludes that the California Supreme\nCourt could reasonably have concluded that Pinholster did\nnot state a claim of prejudice. This conclusion, in light of\nthe overwhelming mitigating evidence that was not before\nthe jury, is wrong. To establish prejudice, “[t]he defendant\nmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but\nfor counsel’s unprofessional errors, the result of the pro\nceeding would have been different.” Id., at 694. When a\nhabeas petitioner challenges a death sentence, “the ques\ntion is whether there is a reasonable probability that,\nabsent the errors, the sentencer . . . would have concluded\nthat the balance of aggravating and mitigating circum\nstances did not warrant death.” Id., at 695. This inquiry\nrequires evaluating “the totality of the available mitiga\ntion evidence—both that adduced at trial, and the evi\ndence adduced in the habeas proceeding—in reweighing it\nagainst the evidence in aggravation.” Terry Williams, 529\nU. S., at 397–398. The ultimate question in this case is\nwhether, taking into account all the mitigating and aggra\nvating evidence, “there is a reasonable probability that at\nleast one juror would have struck a different balance.”\nWiggins, 539 U. S., at 537; see Cal. Penal Code Ann.\n§190.4(b) (West 2008) (requiring a unanimous jury verdict\nto impose a death sentence).\n                              1\n  Like the majority, I first consider the aggravating and\nmitigating evidence presented at trial. By virtue of its\nverdict in the guilt phase, the jury had already concluded\nthat Pinholster had stabbed and killed the victims. As the\nmajority states, the jury saw Pinholster “revel” in his\nhistory of burglaries during the guilt phase. Ante, at 26.\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U.

He threatened to kill the State’s lead\nwitness. And he had an extensive disciplinary record in\njail.\n  Brashear offered brief testimony that was apparently\nintended to be mitigating. See supra, at 19–20; see also\nante, at 27–28.26 However, as the prosecutor argued,\nBrashear was not a neutral witness. See 53 Tr. 7441 (“A\nmother clearly loves her son, ladies and gentlemen.\nClearly not the most unbiased witness in the world”).\nNotwithstanding Brashear’s obvious self-interest, counsel\nfailed to offer readily available, objective evidence that\nwould have substantiated and expanded on her testimony.\nTheir failure to do so allowed the prosecutor to belittle her\ntestimony in closing argument. See supra, at 19–20. And\nBrashear’s statement that Pinholster would not be alive\nmuch longer because he had “a chip in his head floating\naround,” 52 Tr. 7397, could only have undermined her\ncredibility, as the prosecutor urged, see 53 id., at 7447\n(“Does she want you to believe sometime before he got to\n——————\n  26 The majority mischaracterizes several aspects of Brashear’s testi\n\nmony. Although Brashear testified that the family “didn’t have lots of\nmoney,” she followed up that comment by stating that Pinholster did\nnot bring friends to the house because “it was too nice a house.” 52 Tr.\n7404. The prosecutor did not understand Brashear to have testified\nthat Pinholster’s childhood was deprived. See 53 id., at 7442 (“You\nheard that he was not a deprived child”). Nor did the California Su\npreme Court on direct appeal. People v. Pinholster, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203248\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203248/people-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">1</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 910,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1203248\"><a href=\"/opinion/1203248/people-v-pinholster/\"><span class=\"volume\">824</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">571</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 587 (1992).\n  Brashear did testify that Pinholster’s stepfather tried to “discipline”\nhim and that he was “at times” “abusive or near abusive.” 52 Tr. 7392–\n7393. She suggested, however, that Pinholster deserved the “disci\npline” he received. See, e.g., id., at 7392 (“Scott was always—he had a\nmind of his own”). It is unlikely the jury understood Brashear to be\nsuggesting that her husband routinely beat Pinholster. The prosecutor\ndid not come away with this understanding. See 53 id., at 7442.\n\f34                 CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                    SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\ncountry jail some doctor looked in a crystal ball and\nsaid, ‘In three years you are going to die’? That’s ridicu\nlous”). The trial judge was thoroughly unimpressed with\nBrashear’s testimony. See supra, at 20.\n   Moreover, the evidence presented in Pinholster’s state\ncourt petition revealed that Brashear distorted facts in her\ntestimony in ways that undermined Pinholster’s mitiga\ntion case. As in Sears, 561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 3), the\nprosecutor used Brashear’s testimony that Pinholster\ncame from a good family against him. See 53 Tr. 7442.\n   In sum, counsel presented little in the way of mitigating\nevidence, and the prosecutor effectively used their half\nhearted attempt to present a mitigation case to advocate\nfor the death penalty. The jury nonetheless took two days\nto reach a decision to impose a death sentence.\n                             2\n  The additional mitigating evidence presented to the\nCalifornia Supreme Court “adds up to a mitigation case\nthat bears no relation” to Brashear’s unsubstantiated\ntestimony. Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 393.\n  Assuming the evidence presented to the California\nSupreme Court to be true, as that court was required to\ndo, the new mitigating evidence presented to that court\nwould have shown that Pinholster was raised in “chaos\nand poverty.” Record ER–312. The family home was filled\nwith violence. Pinholster’s siblings had extremely trou\nbled pasts. There was substantial evidence of “mental\ndisturbance during Mr. Pinholster’s childhood and some\ndegree of brain damage.” Id., at ER–493.\n  Dr. Woods concluded that Pinholster’s aggressive con\nduct resulted from bipolar mood disorder. Just months\nbefore the murders, a doctor had recommended that Pin\nholster be sent to a psychiatric institute. Dr. Woods also\nexplained that Pinholster’s bizarre behavior before the\nmurders reflected “[a]uditory hallucinations” and “severe\n\f                  Cite as: 563 U.

The available records con\nfirmed that Pinholster suffered from longstanding seizure\ndisorders, which may have been caused by his childhood\nhead injuries.\n   On this record, I do not see how it can be said that “[t]he\n‘new’ evidence largely duplicated the mitigation evidence\nat trial.” Ante, at 29; see Arizona v. Fulminante, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112566\"><a href=\"/opinion/112566/arizona-v-fulminante/\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">279</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 298–299 (1991) (evidence is not “merely cumulative”\nif it corroborates other evidence that is “unbelievable” on\nits own). Brashear’s self-interested testimony was not\nconfirmed with objective evidence, as the prosecutor high\nlighted. The new evidence would have “destroyed the\n[relatively] benign conception of [Pinholster’s] upbringing”\npresented by his mother. Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 391. The\njury heard no testimony at all that Pinholster likely suf\nfered from brain damage or bipolar mood disorder, and\ncounsel offered no evidence to help the jury understand\nthe likely effect of Pinholster’s head injuries or his bizarre\nbehavior on the night of the homicides. The jury heard no\ntestimony recounting the substantial evidence of Pinhol\nster’s likely neurological problems. And it heard no medi\ncal evidence that Pinholster suffered from epilepsy.\n   The majority responds that “much” of Pinholster’s new\nmitigating evidence “is of questionable mitigating value.”\nAnte, at 29. By presenting psychiatric testimony, it con\ntends, “Pinholster would have opened the door to rebuttal\nby a state expert.” Ibid. But, because the California\nSupreme Court denied Pinholster’s petition on the plead\nings, it had no reason to know what a state expert might\nhave said. Moreover, given the record evidence, it is rea\nsonably probable that at least one juror would have cred\nited his expert. In any event, even if a rebuttal expert\ntestified that Pinholster suffered from antisocial personal\nity disorder, this would hardly have come as a surprise to\nthe jury. See ante, at 22 (describing Pinholster as a “psy\nchotic client whose performance at trial hardly endeared\n\f36                     CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                        SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nhim to the jury”). It is for this reason that it was espe\ncially important for counsel to present the available evi\ndence to help the jury understand Pinholster. See Sears,\n561 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 6–7).\n   Had counsel conducted an adequate investigation, the\njudge and jury would have heard credible evidence show\ning that Pinholster’s criminal acts and aggressive tenden\ncies were “attributable to a disadvantaged background, or\nto emotional and mental problems.” Penry, 492 U. S., at\n319 (internal quotation marks omitted). They would have\nlearned that Pinholster had the “ ‘kind of troubled history\nwe have declared relevant to assessing a defendant’s\nmoral culpability.’ ” Porter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12)\n(quoting Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 535). Applying Strickland,\nwe have repeatedly found “a reasonable probability,” 466\nU. S., at 694, that the sentencer would have reached a\ndifferent result had counsel presented similar evidence.\nSee, e.g., Porter, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12–13) (evi\ndence of the defendant’s childhood history of physical\nabuse, brain abnormality, limited schooling, and heroic\nmilitary service); Rompilla, 545 U. S., at 392 (evidence of\nsevere abuse and neglect as a child, as well as brain\ndamage); Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 535 (evidence of the de\nfendant’s “severe privation and abuse” as a child, home\nlessness, and “diminished mental capacities”); Terry\nWilliams, 529 U. S., at 398 (evidence of childhood\nmistreatment and neglect, head injuries, possible organic\nmental impairments, and borderline mental retardation).\n   The majority does not dispute the similarity between\nthis case and the cited cases. However, it criticizes the\nCourt of Appeals for relying on Rompilla and Terry Wil\nliams on the ground that we reviewed the prejudice ques\ntion de novo in those cases. See ante, at 31. I do not read\nTerry Williams to review the prejudice question de novo.27\n——————\n 27 Terry   Williams held that the state court’s decision was “unreason\n\f                     Cite as: 563 U. S. ____ (2011)                    37\n\n                       SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nMore fundamentally, however, I cannot agree with the\npremise that “[t]hose cases . . . offer no guidance with\nrespect to whether a state court has unreasonably deter\nmined that prejudice is lacking.” Ante, at 31 (emphasis\ndeleted). In each of these cases, we did not purport to\ncreate new law; we simply applied the same clearly estab\nlished precedent, Strickland, to a different set of facts.\nBecause these cases illuminate the kinds of mitigation\nevidence that suffice to establish prejudice under Strick\nland, they provide useful, but not dispositive, guidance for\ncourts to consider when determining whether a state court\nhas unreasonably applied Strickland.\n   In many cases, a state court presented with additional\nmitigation evidence will reasonably conclude that there is\nno “reasonable probability that, but for counsel’s unprofes\nsional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\ndifferent.” Strickland, 466 U. S., at 694. This is not such\na case. Admittedly, Pinholster unjustifiably stabbed and\nkilled two people, and his history of violent outbursts and\nburglaries surely did not endear him to the jury. But the\nhomicides did not appear premeditated. And the State’s\naggravation case was no stronger than in Rompilla and\nTerry Williams. See 545 U. S., at 378, 383 (the defendant\ncommitted murder by torture and had a significant history\nof violent felonies, including a rape); 529 U. S., at 418\n(Rehnquist, C. J., concurring in part and dissenting in\npart) (the defendant had a lifetime of crime, and after the\nmurder he “savagely beat an elderly woman,” set a home\non fire, and stabbed a man (internal quotation marks\nomitted)). Even on the trial record, it took the jury two\ndays to decide on a penalty. The contrast between the “not\n\n—————— \n\nable in at least two respects”: (1) It applied the wrong legal standard,\n\nsee 529 U. S., at 397, and (2) it “failed to accord appropriate weight to \n\nthe body of mitigation evidence available to trial counsel,” id., at 398.\n\nWe did not purport to conduct de novo review. \n\n\f38                CULLEN v.

Given these considerations, it\nis not a foregone conclusion, as the majority deems it, that\na juror familiar with his troubled background and psychi\natric issues would have reached the same conclusion\nregarding Pinholster’s culpability. Fairminded jurists\ncould not doubt that, on the record before the California\nSupreme Court, “there [was] a reasonable probability that\nat least one juror would have struck a different balance.”\nWiggins, 539 U. S., at 537.\n                            III\n  The state-court record on its own was more than ade\nquate to support the Court of Appeals’ conclusion that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court could not reasonably have\nrejected Pinholster’s Strickland claim. The additional\nevidence presented in the federal evidentiary hearing only\nconfirms that conclusion.\n                              A\n   At the hearing, Pinholster offered many of the same\ndocuments that were before the state habeas court. He\nalso offered his trial attorneys’ billing records, which were\nbefore the state habeas court as part of the trial record. Of\nthe seven lay witnesses who testified at the hearing, six\nhad previously executed declarations in support of Pinhol\nster’s state-court petition. (The seventh, Pinholster’s\nuncle, provided testimony cumulative of other testimony.)\n   Two experts testified on Pinholster’s behalf; neither had\npresented declarations to the state habeas court. The first\nwas Dr. Donald Olson, assistant professor of neurology\nand neurological sciences and director of the Pediatric\nEpilepsy Program at Stanford University Medical Center.\nIt appears that Pinholster retained Dr. Olson to rebut the\ntestimony of the expert disclosed by the State in the fed\n\f                 Cite as: 563 U.

Abzug in Support\nof Stipulated Ex Parte Application to Continue Eviden\ntiary Hearing and Discovery Cut-Off and to Substitute\nCounsel in Pinholster v. Calderon, No. CV 95–6240–GLT\n(CD Cal.), p. 2. Relying in part on Pinholster’s abnormal\nEEG, Dr. Olson opined that Pinholster’s childhood acci\ndents “likely result[ed] in brain injury” and that these\ninjuries “conferred a risk of epilepsy.” Record ER–699 to\nER–700. He concluded that it was reasonably probable\nthat Pinholster had suffered from partial epilepsy since at\nleast 1968 and had suffered from brain injury since at\nleast 1964. Id., at ER–701.\n   Pinholster’s second expert was Dr. Sophia Vinogradov,\nassociate professor of psychiatry at the University of\nCalifornia, San Francisco. Dr. Vinogradov’s testimony\nwas based on essentially the same facts as Dr. Woods’ and\nDr. Stalberg’s state-court declarations. She highlighted\nPinholster’s childhood head traumas, history of epilepsy,\nabusive and neglected upbringing, history of substance\nabuse, and bizarre behavior on the night of the homicides.\nShe opined that his aggressive behavior resulted from\nchildhood head traumas:\n    “All data indicates that there were severe effects of\n    the two serious head injuries sustained at age 2 and\n    age 3, with evidence for behavioral changes related to\n    dysfunction of frontal cortex: severe attentional and\n    learning problems in childhood, hyperactivity, aggres\n    sivity, impulsivity, social-emotional impairment, sei\n    zure disorder, and explosive dyscontrol.” Id., at ER–\n    731.\nShe also opined that, right before the homicides, Pinhol\nster was in an “apparently hallucinatory state [that] was\nlikely the result of his intoxication with multiple sub\nstances.” Id., at ER–707\n   The State presented two experts: Dr. Stalberg, the\n\f40                    CULLEN v.

Although Dr. Stalberg\nmaintained that Pinholster suffered from antisocial per\nsonality disorder, which was his original diagnosis in the\nmiddle of trial, he again emphasized that there was “vo\nluminous” and “compelling” mitigation evidence that had\nnot previously been made available to him or presented to\nthe jury. Id., at ER–926, ER–953. He stated that conver\nsations with Pinholster’s family revealed that he and his\nsiblings were “raised like animals, wild animals,” id., at\nER–948, and he opined that Pinholster’s upbringing was a\nrisk factor for antisocial personality disorder. See ibid.\n(Pinholster’s upbringing “would speak volumes, looking at\nit from a mitigation point of view”). And he agreed that\nthe mitigation evidence presented at trial was “profoundly\nmisleading.” Id., at ER–966. Dr. Rudnick testified that\nPinholster suffered from antisocial personality disorder.\n   The State also introduced into evidence the 1978 proba\ntion report that Pinholster’s counsel had in their posses\nsion at the time of his trial. The report demonstrated that\ncounsel were aware that Pinholster was in classes for\neducationally handicapped children, that he was commit\nted to a state hospital for emotionally handicapped chil\ndren, and that he suffered two “severe head injuries.” Id.,\nat SER–243.\n                             B\n     Much of the evidence presented at the federal hearing\n——————\n   28 Before the hearing, Dr. Stalberg had opined that Pinholster was\n\n“substantially impaired by a bipolar mood disorder operating synergis\ntically with intoxication and a seizure disorder at the time the crime\nwas committed.” Record ER–587. At a prehearing deposition, however,\nDr. Stalberg revised his opinion and stated that he continued to believe\nthat Pinholster suffered from psychopathic personality traits. After the\ndeposition, Pinholster elected to proceed with a different expert, pre\nsumably in light of Dr. Stalberg’s unexpected change in position. The\nState then retained Dr. Stalberg as its own expert.\n\f                      Cite as: 563 U.

The additional evidence presented at the\nhearing only confirmed that the California Supreme Court\ncould not reasonably have rejected Pinholster’s claim.29\n   For example, the probation report presented by the\nState confirmed that counsel had in their possession in\nformation that would have led any reasonable attorney “to\ninvestigate further.” Wiggins, 539 U. S., at 527. Counsel\nnevertheless took no action to investigate these leads.\n   Pinholster’s experts opined that his childhood head\ntraumas likely resulted in brain injury and conferred a\nrisk of epilepsy. Although the State presented testimony\nthat Pinholster had antisocial personality disorder, it was\nnot clear error for the District Court to conclude that\njurors could have credited Pinholster’s experts. Even the\n——————\n  29 The  State argues that the District Court was not entitled to rely on\nthe evidence adduced at the hearing because Pinholster was not dili\ngent in developing his claims in state court and the hearing was there\nfore barred by </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">C</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. §2254(e)(2). This argument is somewhat\nimprecise. Pinholster’s allegations in his amended federal petition\nwere “identical” to the allegations he presented to the California\nSupreme Court, ante, at 6, and he diligently requested a hearing in\nstate court. The State presumably means to argue that Pinholster’s\nnew expert testimony changed “the factual basis” of his claim such that,\nby the time of the evidentiary hearing, he no longer satisfied\n§2254(e)(2). However, at oral argument, the State suggested that\nPinholster was presenting an altogether new claim in the federal court.\nSee Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. If that is the case, §2254(d)(1) does not apply at\nall, and the State should be arguing lack of exhaustion or procedural\ndefault. I do not understand Pinholster to have presented a new claim\nto the District Court.\n  In any event, Pinholster satisfied §2254(e)(2) in this case. He made\n“a reasonable attempt, in light of the information available at the time,\nto investigate and pursue claims in state court.” Michael Williams, 529\nU. S., at 435. His experts relied on the very same facts and evidence. I\ncannot read §2254(e)(2) to impose a strict requirement that petitioners\nmust use the same experts they presented to the state court. This rule\nwould result in numerous practical problems, for example in the case of\nthe unanticipated death of an expert.\n\f42                    CULLEN v. PINHOLSTER\n\n                      SOTOMAYOR, J., dissenting\n\nState’s own expert, Dr. Stalberg, testified to the “volumi\nnous” mitigation evidence in Pinholster’s case. Record ER–\n926.\n  In sum, the evidence confirmed what was already ap\nparent from the state-court record: Pinholster’s counsel\nfailed to conduct an adequate mitigation investigation,\nand there was a reasonable probability that at least one\njuror confronted with the “voluminous” mitigating evi\ndence counsel should have discovered would have voted to\nspare Pinholster’s life. Ibid. Accordingly, whether on the\nbasis of the state- or federal-court record, the courts below\ncorrectly concluded that Pinholster had shown that the\nCalifornia Supreme Court’s decision reflected an unrea\nsonable application of Strickland.30\n                        *     *     *\n  I cannot agree with either aspect of the Court’s ruling. I\nfear the consequences of the Court’s novel interpretation\nof §2254(d)(1) for diligent state habeas petitioners with\ncompelling evidence supporting their claims who were\nunable, through no fault of their own, to present that\nevidence to the state court that adjudicated their claims.\nAnd the Court’s conclusion that the California Supreme\nCourt reasonably denied Pinholster’s ineffective\nassistance-of-counsel claim overlooks counsel’s failure to\ninvestigate obvious avenues of mitigation and the contrast\nbetween the woefully inadequate mitigation case they\npresented and the evidence they should and would have\ndiscovered. I respectfully dissent.\n\n——————\n   30 The State’s challenge in this Court is limited to the questions\n\nwhether the Federal District Court was entitled to consider the addi\ntional evidence in the §2254(d)(1) analysis and whether Pinholster\nsatisfied §2254(d)(1) on the basis of the state-court record. It has not\nchallenged the District Court’s ultimate conclusion that Pinholster had\nproved that he was “in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws\nor treaties of the United States.” §2254(a).\n\f</pre>",
