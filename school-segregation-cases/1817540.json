The plaintiffs in this  case  argue,  and  the  trial\ncourt held, that Medicaid must  pay  for  any  abortion  that  is  medically\nnecessary, citing the Indiana Constitution's requirement that privileges  or\nimmunities cannot be granted to a citizen or class of citizens that  do  not\nequally belong to all citizens on the same terms.\n\n      For  the  reasons  set  forth  in  this  opinion  in  part   I   under\n“Discussion,” I believe that this  provision  of  the  Indiana  Constitution\ndoes not require Medicaid to  pay  for  all  abortions  that  are  medically\nnecessary.  Chief Justice Shepard and Justice Dickson join in this  part  of\nthis opinion.\n\n\n      However, for the reasons set forth in this opinion in  part  II  under\n“Discussion,” I also conclude that, so long as the Indiana Medicaid  program\npays for abortions to preserve the lives of pregnant women  and  where  rape\nor incest cause pregnancy, it must  also  pay  for  abortions  in  cases  of\npregnancies that create for pregnant women serious risk of  substantial  and\nirreversible impairment of a major  bodily  function.   Justices  Boehm  and\nRucker join in this part of this opinion.\n\n\n                                 Background\n\n\n      In 1965, Congress established the Medicaid program, a  joint  federal-\nstate program that pays for some health care costs of low-income people,  by\namending Title XIX of the Social Security  Act,  42  U.S.C.  §§  1396-1396v.\nUnder the Medicaid program, the federal government reimburses  participating\nstates for the  health  care  services  provided  pursuant  to  the  state’s\nmedical assistance or Medicaid plan.   Id.  at  §§  1396a(a)(10),  1396d(a).\nStates are not required to participate in the Medicaid  program  but  states\nthat choose to participate must conform their Medicaid  program  to  federal\nMedicaid law.  Id. at § 1396a(a).\n\n      In 1973, the Supreme Court held that the Due  Process  Clause  of  the\nFourteenth Amendment protected, to a certain extent, the freedom of a  woman\nto terminate a pregnancy.  Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973).\n\n      In 1976, Congress first adopted legislation, referred to as the  “Hyde\nAmendment” for its author, Representative Henry J. Hyde, that prohibits  the\nfederal government from reimbursing states under the  Medicaid  program  for\nabortions except where a woman would be placed “in danger  of  death  unless\nan abortion is performed” or where “the pregnancy is the result  of  an  act\nof rape or incest.”  Pub. L. No. 106-113, §§ 508-509, 113 Stat. 1501, 1501A-\n274(1999).  Although the provisions of the Hyde Amendment have  varied  from\ntime to time, this is the language  of  the  prohibition  and  exception  in\neffect today.[1]\n\n\n      In 1977, the Supreme Court  held  that  the  constitutional  right  to\nabortion recognized in Roe  v.  Wade  did  not  include  an  entitlement  to\nMedicaid payments that were not medically  necessary.   Maher  v.  Roe,  432\nU.S. 464, 470  (1977).   In  1980,  the  Supreme  Court  was  faced  with  a\nchallenge to the constitutionality of  the  Hyde  Amendment,  i.e.,  whether\nCongress could prohibit the use  of  federal  Medicaid  funds  to  reimburse\nstates for medically necessary abortions.  The  court  held  that  the  Hyde\nAmendment did not violate either the Due Process  or  the  Equal  Protection\nClauses of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297 (1980).\n\n\n      Any state that participates in the Medicaid program must  cover  those\nabortions for which federal funds are available.  Zbaraz v. Quern, 596  F.2d\n196, 201 (7th Cir. 1979), cert. denied, 448 U.S. 907 (1980).   Nevertheless,\n“[a] participating state is free, if  it  so  chooses,  to  include  in  its\nMedicaid  plan  those  medically  necessary  abortions  for  which   federal\nreimbursement is unavailable…”  Harris, 448 U.S. at 309.\n\n      Indiana participates in the federal Medicaid program and is  bound  by\nall of its requirements.  Ind.  Code  §  12-15-1-1.   The  Indiana  Medicaid\nprogram  provides  low-income  Hoosier  citizens  with  virtually  all  non-\nexperimental, medically necessary health care, including some  services  for\nwhich federal reimbursement is not available.  See e.g., Ind. Code §  12-15-\n5-1(18) (providing coverage for nonmedical nursing care given in  accordance\nwith tenants and  practices  of  a  recognized  church);  cf.  42  C.F.R.  §\n440.170(b) (restricting federal  funding  for  such  institutions  to  those\norganized pursuant to Section  501(c)(3)  of  the  Internal  Revenue  Code).\nIndiana Medicaid covers inpatient hospital services,  physicians’  services,\nand outpatient hospital or clinic services for all recipients  and  provides\na full range of reproductive health care for  Medicaid-eligible  men.   Ind.\nCode § 12-15-5-1.   Covered  services  must  be  “medically  reasonable  and\nnecessary” and are required to be  provided  to  Medicaid  recipients  in  a\nuniformly equitable manner.   Ind.  Code  §  12-15-1-10.   Indiana  Medicaid\ndefines a “medically reasonable and necessary service” as  one  that  “meets\ncurrent professional standards commonly held to be applicable to the  case.”\n Ind. Admin. Code tit. 405,  r.  5-2-17(2001).   However,  in  the  case  of\nabortion services,  the  program  defines  an  abortion  as  necessary  (and\ntherefore covered under the program) only  if  “performed  to  preserve  the\nlife of the pregnant woman or in other  circumstances  if  the  abortion  is\nrequired to be covered by Medicaid  under  federal  law,”  e.g.,  where  the\npregnancy was caused by rape or incest.   Ind.  Code  §  12-15-5-1(17);  [2]\nInd. Code § 16-34-1-2; [3] Ind. Admin. Code tit. 405, r. 5-28-7.[4]\n\n       The  plaintiffs  in  this  case,  Clinic  for  Women,  Inc.,  Women’s\nPavilion,  Inc.,  Ulrich  G.  Klopfer,  D.O.,  and  Martin  Haskell,   M.D.,\nchallenge the constitutionality of these two statutes and  this  regulation.\nThe plaintiffs  contend  that  the  statutes’  and  regulation’s  collective\nprohibition on the  use  of  state  Medicaid  funds  to  pay  for  abortions\nviolates the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of  Art.  I,  §  23,  as\nwell as Art I, §§ 1 and 12, of the Indiana Constitution.[5]\n\n      After hearing oral argument of the parties, the  trial  court  granted\nthe plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment and denied  the  state’s  cross-\nmotion for  summary  judgment,  ruling  that  the  challenged  statutes  and\nregulation violated  Art.  I,  §  23.   The  trial  court  did  not  address\nplaintiffs’ Art. I, § 1 and 12, claims and they are not before us here.\n\n      Article I, § 23, of the Indiana Constitution reads as follows:\n\n      The General Assembly shall not grant  to  any  citizen,  or  class  of\n      citizens, privileges or immunities which, upon the same  terms,  shall\n      not equally belong to all citizens.\n\nFrom at least 1971 until about nine years ago, this  court  analyzed  claims\nunder the state Equal  Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  using  the  same\ntechniques as those employed by the United States Supreme Court  to  analyze\nclaims under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth  Amendment.   See\nCollins v. Day, 644 N.E.2d 72, 75  (Ind.  1994).   In  Collins,  this  court\njettisoned the use of federal equal  protection  analytical  methodology  to\nclaims alleging violations of Art. I,  §  23,  and  held  that  such  claims\nshould be analyzed using a  different  standard.   Id.   That  standard  was\nsummarized as follows:\n\n      Article  1,  Section  23  of  the  Indiana  Constitution  imposes  two\n      requirements upon statutes that grant unequal privileges or immunities\n      to differing  classes  of  persons.  First,  the  disparate  treatment\n      accorded by the legislation must be  reasonably  related  to  inherent\n      characteristics  which  distinguish  the  unequally  treated  classes.\n      Second, the preferential treatment must be  uniformly  applicable  and\n      equally available to  all  persons  similarly  situated.  Finally,  in\n      determining whether a statute complies with or  violates  Section  23,\n      courts must exercise substantial deference to legislative discretion.\n\nId. at 80.  Indiana courts have made frequent use of  the  Collins  standard\nsince its promulgation, including the trial court here.\n\n      The trial court found that the ban on funding abortions  contained  in\nthe challenged statutes and regulation failed both  prongs  of  the  Collins\nstandard summarized supra.\n\n\n      The  first  prong  of  the  Collins  test  requires  that  \"where  the\nLegislature singles out  one  person  or  class  of  persons  to  receive  a\nprivilege or immunity not equally provided to  others,  such  classification\nmust be based upon distinctive, inherent  characteristics  which  rationally\ndistinguish  the  unequally  treated  class,  and  the  disparate  treatment\naccorded  by  the  legislation  must   be   reasonably   related   to   such\ndistinguishing characteristics.\"  Id. at 78-79. The trial court started  its\nanalysis of this prong with the proposition that the \"Medicaid program is  a\ngovernment program  through  which  a  benefit  --  government  payment  for\nmedically necessary treatment -- is provided to indigent Hoosiers.\"   (Supp.\nR. 8.)  \"However,\" the trial court continued, \"that benefit is not  provided\nequally to all indigent Hoosiers -- women who, for medical reasons, need  to\nterminate their pregnancy in order to preserve and protect their health  did\nnot receive that funding  benefit.   Under  the  Indiana  Medicaid  program,\nindigent men and indigent pregnant women  who  need  treatment  (other  than\nabortion) which is medically necessary to preserve their health are  singled\nout for a benefit which is denied to  indigent  pregnant  women  needing  to\nterminate their pregnancy to preserve and protect their health.”  (Supp.  R.\n8.)\n\n\n      The  second  prong  of  the  Collins  analysis   requires   that   the\npreferential treatment \"be uniformly applicable  and  equally  available  to\nall persons similarly situated.\"  Collins,  644  N.E.2d  at  80.   Here  the\ntrial  court  found  that  \"[a]ll  Medicaid-eligible  pregnant   women   are\nsimilarly situated in that all may require, from time to time, an  array  of\nmedically necessary treatment to protect and preserve their  health.\"   But,\nunder the challenged Medicaid statutes and regulations,  \"Medicaid  coverage\nof  needed  medical  services  is  not  ‘uniformly  applicable  and  equally\navailable’ to those  similarly  situated.   Pregnant  women  who  require  a\nmedically necessary abortion to  preserve  their  health  will  not  receive\nstate funding while pregnant women who  require  other  types  of  medically\nnecessary treatment will receive state funding.”  (Supp. R. 9.)\n\n\n      Under  Collins,  legislative  discretion   is   accorded   substantial\ndeference.  Collins, 644 N.E.2d at 80-81.  The trial  court  identified  the\nState's interests claimed to  be  served  by  the  challenged  statutes  and\nregulation  as  potential  life,   administrative   simplicity,   and   cost\ncontainment.  But it found these justifications insufficient.\n\n\n      [P]ursuing the  goal  of  promoting  fetal  life  at  the  expense  of\n      preserving the health of women who need to terminate  their  pregnancy\n      for medical reasons contravenes the purpose of the  Medicaid  program,\n      which is designed to enable  indigent  Hoosiers  to  obtain  medically\n      necessary treatment.  The State's asserted interest in  administrative\n      simplicity and cost containment also do not justify the  funding  ban.\n      First, the goal of achieving administrative simplicity in  itself  can\n      never serve as a sufficient goal to justify depriving some citizens of\n      privileges accorded others.  Second, the goal of cost  containment  is\n      also not reasonably related to the funding ban.   Abortions  are  less\n      expensive  than  the  costs  associated  with  childbirth.   Moreover,\n      preventing a Medicaid-eligible woman from terminating her pregnancy to\n      protect and preserve her health will necessarily mean  that  she  will\n      have increased health problems that the Indiana Medicaid program  must\n      cover.  Cost containment is not served by the funding ban  and  cannot\n      be the basis to  depriving  some  citizens  of  a  privilege  accorded\n      others.\n\n(Supp. R. 10.)\n\n      The State appealed the judgment directly  to  our  Court  pursuant  to\nInd. Appellate Rule 4(A)(1)(b).[6]\n\n      Our Court has been informed in this matter by a substantial number  of\ndecisions from sister courts on similar claims under their respective  state\nconstitutions, including some with constitutional  provisions  the  same  as\nour Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause.  Many of  these  are  identified\nand discussed in an excellent law journal article,  Melanie  D.  Price,  The\nPrivacy Paradox:  The Divergent Paths of the  United  States  Supreme  Court\nand State courts on the Issue of Sexuality,  33 Ind. L.  Rev.  863,  875-879\n(2000).\n\n      The Court also appreciates the assistance  of  amicus  curiae  Indiana\nCivil Liberties Union, Inc., Indiana Right  to  Life  Committee,  Inc.,  and\ntwelve members of the Indiana General Assembly (Senators Frank  Mrvan,  Jr.,\nKent Adams, David C. Ford, Allie V. Craycraft, Jr., and  R.  Michael  Young,\nand Representatives Gary L. Cook,  Jeffrey  A.  Thompson,  P.  Eric  Turner,\nJames Russell Buck,  Dennis  K.  Kruse,  and  Jerry  L.  Denbo),  and  their\nrespective counsel.\n\n\n                                 Discussion\n\n\n\n                                      I\n\n\n      The Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. I,  §  23,  of  the\nIndiana Constitution states, “The General Assembly shall not  grant  to  any\ncitizen, or class of citizens, privileges or  immunities,  which,  upon  the\nsame terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.”\n\n      Article  I,  Section  23  of  the  Indiana  Constitution  imposes  two\n      requirements upon statutes that grant unequal privileges or immunities\n      to differing classes  of  persons.   First,  the  disparate  treatment\n      accorded by the legislation must be  reasonably  related  to  inherent\n      characteristics  which  distinguish  the  unequally  treated  classes.\n      Second, the preferential treatment must be  uniformly  applicable  and\n      equally available to all person similarly situated.\n\nCollins, 644 N.E.2d at 80.  In determining whether a statute  complies  with\nor violates this provision, the Court shows  substantial  deference  to  the\ndiscretion of the  Legislature  in  attempting  to  “balance  the  competing\ninterest  involved,”  and  the   Legislature’s   basis   in   creating   the\ndistinction.  Id.  To resolve conflicts between the state  constitution  and\na challenged statute, this Court has stated that “the better  course  is  to\nconstrue or reconstrue the statute in such a way as to further  the  purpose\nof the legislature without offending the Indiana Constitution.”   Van  Dusen\nv. Stotts, 712 N.E.2d 491, 496 (Ind. 1999).\n\n      Under the first prong of the Collins test,  any  “disparate  treatment\naccorded  by  the  legislation  must  be  reasonably  related  to   inherent\ncharacteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes.”   Collins,\n644 N.E.2d at 80.\n\n      Where the legislature singles out one person or class  of  persons  to\n      receive a privilege or immunity not equally provided to  others,  such\n      classification   must   be   based    upon    distinctive,    inherent\n      characteristics which rationally  distinguish  the  unequally  treated\n      class, and the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be\n      reasonably related to such distinguishing characteristics.\n\nId. at 78-79.\n\n      Before we can determine whether the legislative  classification  under\nthe first  prong  of  Collins  is  permissible,  we  need  to  identify  the\nlegislative classification at issue.  The parties here define  the  relevant\nclassification differently.  The plaintiffs contend  (and  the  trial  court\nagreed) that the legislative classification at issue  places  (1)  “indigent\nmen and indigent women who need treatment (other  than  abortion)  which  is\nmedically necessary to preserve their health” into a  class  for  which  the\nnecessary treatment is provided, and (2) “indigent  pregnant  women  needing\nto terminate their pregnancy to preserve and protect their  health”  into  a\nclass for which the necessary treatment is  not  provided.   (Supp.  R.  8.)\nThe State argues that the relevant classification is between (1)  “medically\nnecessary services and supplies” for which  federal  Medicaid  reimbursement\nat some level is available (a  class  that  includes  abortions  to  save  a\nwoman’s life and where pregnancy resulted  from  rape  or  incest)  and  (2)\nmedically necessary services and supplies for which it is not (a class  that\nincludes all other medically necessary abortions).   Br.  of  Appellants  at\n14.\n\n      In McIntosh v. Melroe Co., Justice Boehm examined  the  way  in  which\nthe legislative classification at issue in the first prong of Collins is  to\nbe determined:\n\n      Although Collins itself uses  the  word  \"inherent\"  to  describe  the\n      characteristic that defines the class, this  cannot  be  equated  with\n      \"innate\" characteristics  of  members  of  the  class.   The  worker's\n      compensation scheme [the  statute  at  issue  in  Collins],  like  the\n      Product Liability Act [the statute at issue in McIntosh], turns on the\n      characteristics of the employers, not the injured workers.  Similarly,\n      under the Product Liability Act, everyone may potentially recover  for\n      an injury from a product not yet ten years old, and  everyone  injured\n      from an older product is barred.  It is  the  claim,  not  any  innate\n      characteristic of the person, that defines the class.\n\n729 N.E.2d 972, 981 (Ind. 2000).  We think the claim here,  reduced  to  its\nessentials, is that some Medicaid-eligible pregnant  women  in  Indiana  are\nentitled to Medicaid-financed medically necessary abortions and  others  are\nnot.  We think this “claim  …  defines  the  class:”  (1)  Medicaid-eligible\npregnant women who seek to terminate their pregnancies in order to  preserve\ntheir lives or where their pregnancies resulted from rape or incest  are  in\na class where Medicaid pays for their abortions; and  (2)  Medicaid-eligible\npregnant women who  seek  to  terminate  their  pregnancies  for  any  other\nmedically necessary reason are in a class where Medicaid will  not  pay  for\ntheir abortions.  Although this formulation of the classification  at  issue\ndiffers  somewhat  from  those  advanced  by  the  parties,  we  believe  it\nsufficiently similar to each that their arguments against and  in  favor  of\nthe classifications retain their full force.\n\n      As already discussed, in analyzing the  constitutional  permissibility\nof the classification identified, we \"accord considerable deference  to  the\nmanner  in  which  the  legislature  has  balanced  the  competing  interest\ninvolved.\"  Collins, 644 N.E.2d at 80 (citing Johnson v. St. Vincent  Hosp.,\n273 Ind. 374, 404-05, 404 N.E.2d 585, 604 (1980)).   Indeed,  we  frequently\nrecite that the challenger  to  the  constitutionality  of  the  legislative\nscheme bears the burden \"to negative every  conceivable  basis  which  might\nhave supported the classification.\"  Johnson, 273 Ind. at  392,  404  N.E.2d\nat 597.  In Collins, we quoted from an earlier  opinion  of  this  Court  in\nthis regard:\n\n      Legislative classification becomes a judicial question only where  the\n      lines drawn appear arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable.  So  long  as\n      the  classification  is  based  upon  substantial  distinctions   with\n      reference to the subject matter, we will not substitute  our  judgment\n      for that of the legislature; nor will we inquire into the  legislative\n      motives prompting such classification.\n\n\n\n\nCollins, 644 N.E.2d at 80 (quoting Chaffin v. Nicosia, 261  Ind.  698,  701,\n310 N.E.2d 867, 869 (1974).\n\n\n      The plaintiffs contend that even this deferential standard  of  review\nis  violated  by  the  statutory  and  regulatory  scheme  challenged  here.\nCalling the classification \"manifestly unreasonable,\" Br.  of  Appellees  at\n21, they argue that the\n\n      …classes of persons granted and denied the  privilege  are  inherently\n      the same in ways that relate directly to the  subject  matter  of  the\n      Medicaid legislation: they are low-income, such  that  they  meet  the\n      Medicaid eligibility requirements, and  they  seek  medical  care  for\n      which they have a medical need.  What distinguishes between the two is\n      that the members  of  the  group  denied  the  privilege  have  health\n      conditions which cause them to need  an  abortion  to  preserve  their\n      health, while members of the class granted the privilege  have  health\n      conditions which cause them to need medical care other  than  abortion\n      to preserve their health.  However, that difference does not relate to\n      the subject matter of the Medicaid statutes.  In fact, denying funding\n      to a woman whose health will deteriorate  if  she  does  not  have  an\n      abortion  runs  directly  counter  to  the  subject  matter   of   the\n      legislation.\n\nId. at 19.\n\n      The State offers four justifications for the classification.\n\n      First, the State argues that the unavailability of  federal  financial\nparticipation means that it would not be  \"fiscally  prudent  and  rational\"\nand that it would otherwise be \"administrative[ly] inconvenien[t]\"  for  the\nState to pay for abortions that are not eligible for federal  reimbursement.\n Br. of Appellants at 14, 15.\n\n      Second, the  State  argues  that  it  has  a  \"valid  and  compelling\"\ninterest in protecting fetal life, quoting from  this  court's  decision  in\nCheaney v. State, 259 Ind. 138, 147,  285  N.E.2d  265,  270  (1972),  cert.\ndenied, 410 U.S. 991 (1973).[7]  The State quotes from Harris v.  McRae  for\nsupport  in  pressing  its  point  that  \"limiting  government  funding  for\nabortion is a rational means for indicating  the  government's  interest  in\nprotecting fetal life.\"  Br. of Appellants at 17 (quoting Harris,  448  U.S.\nat 325).\n\n      Third,  in  addition  to  the  fiscal  and  administrative  efficiency\ndimensions of the federal funding argument made supra,  the  State  advances\nadditional fiscal and administrative justifications for the  classification.\n It argues that a more liberal system of government  payments  for  abortion\n\"will result in more of that activity\" and \"may have a  dramatic  impact  on\nthe  State's  future  tax  base.\"   Its  broader  point  here  is  that  the\nallocation of Medicaid spending is a fiscal  policy  determination  for  the\nlegislative and executive branches.  Br. of Appellants at 18-19.\n\n      The plaintiffs respond that the State should not be entitled to  offer\njustifications for the classification  extraneous  to  the  purpose  of  the\nMedicaid  program  itself.   \"If  the  State's  position  is  accepted,  the\nLegislature could insulate any discriminatory  statute  from  constitutional\nchallenge by simply claiming that it serves multiple  purposes.   Thus,  the\nState could withhold any and all government benefits  from  women  who  have\nhad abortions, irrespective of the subject matter or goal of the statute  at\nissue.   For  example,  the  State  could  grant  free  tuition   to   state\nuniversities to all its citizens except for those who have had an  abortion,\non the grounds that the statute furthers the State's interest in  protecting\nfetal life.\"  Br. of Appellees at 21.\n\n      We appreciate the point plaintiffs make but think it  only  has  force\nif our determination is binary.  To the contrary, Collins,  its  precursors,\nand its progeny all indicate that we look at  the  Legislature’s  \"balancing\nof the competing interest involved.\"  See American Legion Post  No.  113  v.\nState, 656 N.E.2d 1190, 1192 (Ind.  Ct.  App.  1995)  (citing  Collins,  644\nN.E.2d at 80 (citing Johnson, 273 Ind.  at  404-05,  404  N.E.2d  at  604)),\ntrans. denied.\n\n      In balancing the interests here, we have given  careful  attention  to\nthe evidence presented by the plaintiffs in the trial court demonstrating  a\nnumber of different health risks faced by pregnant  women  with  respect  to\nwhich an abortion is medically necessary.  In support of  their  motion  for\nsummary judgment,  the  plaintiffs  submitted  the  affidavit  of  Dr.  Jane\nHodgson, a physician  specializing  in  obstetrics  and  gynecology  and  an\nexpert in the  field.   Dr.  Hodgson  testified  that  many  women  confront\nserious health risk when pregnant.  Hypertension complicates about 8-10%  of\npregnancies.   Hypertensive  pregnant  women  are  at  a  higher  risk   for\ncerebrovascular   accidents   (strokes),   abruptio   placentae   (premature\nseparation  of   the   placenta   from   the   uterus),   and   disseminated\nintravasscular  coagulation  (a  severe  bleeding  disorder).   Dr.  Hodgson\nfurther testified that pregnancy-induced diabetes occurs in approximately 1-\n3% of pregnancies.  Women with preexisting diabetes have ten times the  risk\nof pregnancy-related death than do non-diabetic women.   Diabetes-associated\nretinopathy (eye disease)  or  nephropathy  (kidney  disease)  often  worsen\nsignificantly  during  pregnancy.   Dr.   Hodgson   added   that   pregnancy\njeopardizes the health of a woman with advanced coronary artery  disease  or\nsevere impairment of the heart valve, and  all  pregnant  women  with  heart\ndisease have a higher risk of congestive heart failure, cardiac  infections,\nand arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms).  The health of a pregnant woman  is\nseriously impaired when she suffers from chronic renal  failure,  myasthenia\ngravis, or pulmonary embolism from a  previous  pregnancy.   Pregnant  women\nwith lupus may experience aggravation of their disease.\n\n      Dr. Hodgson also  testified  that  pregnant  women  with  sickle  cell\nanemia experience more  frequent  and  more  severe  crises,  especially  in\nbones,  infections  such  as  pneumonia  and   urinary   tract   infections,\nincreasingly  severe  anemia,  congestive  heart  failure,   and   pulmonary\ncomplications such as embolus.  Other conditions  exacerbated  by  pregnancy\ninclude  asthma,  arthritis,  inflammatory  bowel  disease,   gall   bladder\ndisease, liver disease, and epilepsy.  Dr. Hodgson added  that  when  cancer\nthreatens a pregnant woman’s life, the pregnancy puts further strain on  the\nwoman’s health, and may require a suspension of cancer treatment because  of\nharm to the fetus from such treatments.  Thus, if treatment of  the  disease\nrequires radiation or chemotherapy,  a  choice  must  be  made  between  the\nhealth of the patient and the  fetus,  since  these  forms  of  therapy  are\nlikely to result in fetal malformation or death.  Pregnancy  may  accelerate\nthe condition of women  with  malignant  breast  tumors  that  are  estrogen\nreceptor positive.  Dr. Hodgson’s  testimony  was  bolstered  by  the  other\naffidavits submitted by the  plaintiffs  from  Dr.  Judith  Belsky  and  Dr.\nWilliam Mudd Haskell.\n\n      The question for this Court is whether the  Legislature  may  prohibit\nthe State from paying for  an  abortion  for  a  Medicaid-eligible  pregnant\nwoman facing any of these health risks while at the same time it  authorizes\nthe State to pay for an  abortion  to  preserve  the  life  of  a  Medicaid-\neligible pregnant woman or  where  the  pregnancy  was  caused  by  rape  or\nincest.  We find the State’s justifications  of  unavailability  of  federal\nfinancial participation, interest in protecting fetal life,  fiscal  policy,\nand administrative efficiency sufficient to  sustain  the  constitutionality\nof the classification under the first prong of the Collins test.  We are  in\nno position to deny plaintiffs’ argument that the  statutes  and  regulation\nat issue impose significant financial, physical, and emotional  hardship  on\nmany low-income Hoosier women.  But we hold that the State’s  justifications\nfor the classification do not rise to  the  level  of  being  “arbitrary  or\nmanifestly unreasonable.”  Collins, 644 N.E.2d at 80 (quoting  Chaffin,  261\nInd. at 701, 310 N.E.2d at 869).\n\n      The second prong of the Collins test requires  that  the  \"privileged\"\nlegislative classification \"be open to any and all  persons  who  share  the\ninherent characteristics which distinguish and justify  the  classification,\nwith  the  special  treatment  accorded  to  any  particular  classification\nextended equally to all such persons.\"  Collins, 644 N.E.2d at 79.\n\n      The  trial  court  found  this  aspect  of  Collins  violated  because\n\"[p]regnant women who require a medically  necessary  abortion  to  preserve\ntheir health will not receive state funding while those  who  require  other\ntypes of medically necessary treatment will receive state funding.\"   (Supp.\nR. 9.)  We believe the State is correct when it responds that,  because  the\nplaintiffs \"challenge not the provision of  Medicaid  benefits  to  indigent\npeople generally, but rather the deprivation of Medicaid  benefits  to  some\nwho seek abortions, it is  clearer  to  frame  the  issue  as  whether  that\ndeprivation  is  uniformly  applicable  to  all  who  share   the   inherent\ncharacteristics that justify the classification.\"  Brief  of  Appellants  at\n23.  We find the requirement of the second  prong  of  Collins  met  because\nMedicaid will pay for abortions for all persons  in  the  classification  of\nMedicaid eligible pregnant women seeking to terminate their  pregnancies  to\npreserve their life or where the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.\n\n\n\n                                     II\n\n\n      A statute that is constitutional on its face may  be  unconstitutional\nas applied to a particular plaintiff.  See  Martin  v.  Richey,  711  N.E.2d\n1273, 1284-85 (Ind. 1999) (holding Indiana Medical Malpractice  Act  statute\nof limitations constitutional on its face but  unconstitutional  as  applied\nto plaintiffs whose  medical  condition  and  the  nature  of  the  asserted\nmalpractice make it unreasonable to expect  that  they  could  discover  the\nasserted malpractice and resulting injury within  the  limitations  period);\nCity of Fort Wayne v. Cameron, 267  Ind.  329,  334,  370  N.E.2d  338,  341\n(1977) (holding Indiana Tort Claims Act  notice  requirement  constitutional\non its face but unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs whose  mental  and\nphysical  incapacity  render  them  unable  to  comply   with   the   notice\nrequirement).  For the reasons set forth below, we believe that the  statute\nand regulations challenged here are unconstitutional as applied to Medicaid-\neligible  pregnant  women  whose  pregnancies  “create   serious   risk   of\nsubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”[8]\n\n\n      Article I,  §  23,  of  our  Constitution  prohibits  a  statute  from\nproviding disparate  treatment  to  different  classes  of  persons  if  the\ndisparate treatment is not reasonably related  to  inherent  characteristics\nthat distinguish the unequally treated classes.   McIntosh,  729  N.E.2d  at\n981; Martin, 711 N.E.2d at 1280; Collins, 644  N.E.2d  at  80.   We  believe\nthat the characteristics that distinguish Medicaid-eligible  pregnant  women\nwhose pregnancies  create  serious  risk  of  substantial  and  irreversible\nimpairment of a major bodily  function  to  be  virtually  indistinguishable\nfrom the characteristics of women for whose abortions the  State  does  pay.\nTo the extent there  is  a  distinction,  it  is  too  insubstantial  to  be\nsustained by the State’s justifications.\n\n\n      The challenged statutory and regulatory scheme here provides disparate\ntreatment to different  classes  of  persons:  Medicaid  (1)  will  pay  for\nabortions where necessary to preserve the life  of  the  pregnant  woman  or\nwhere the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest but (2) will  not  pay  for\nany other abortions.  Thus the  Constitution  requires  that  the  disparate\ntreatment  be  reasonably   related   to   inherent   characteristics   that\ndistinguish the “preserve the life, rape,  or  incest”  classification  from\nthe  “any  other  abortions”  classification.   Within   this   “any   other\nabortions” classification is a subset  consisting  of  abortions  where  the\npregnancies  create  for  Medicaid-eligible  women   a   serious   risk   of\nsubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\n\n      The State’s argument is that there  are  “inherent  characteristics  …\nreasonably related to permissible legislative goals” that justify  Medicaid-\nfunded abortions where necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant  woman\nor where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest.  Br. of  Appellants  at\n17.  This is because “[a]bortions in those circumstances raise problems  and\nconcerns that abortions in other circumstances do not.”   Id.   Although  it\ndoes not elaborate, the State says that these problems  are  the  result  of\ncertain “medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns” that  “do  not  arise\nin other abortion cases.”  Id. at 18.\n\n      That is, the State says that providing Medicaid-financed abortions  is\nreasonably related to the “inherent characteristics”  that  distinguish  the\n“preserve the life, rape, or incest”  classification  from  the  “any  other\nabortions”   classification   (and,   therefore,   makes   the   distinction\nconstitutionally  permissible).   Those  inherent  characteristics  are  the\n“medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns” raised by the  “preserve  the\nlife, rape, or incest” classification that are not raised by the “any  other\nabortions” classification.\n\n      It is clear that the inherent characteristics  of  the  “preserve  the\nlife, rape, or incest” classification do not require that the  life  of  the\npregnant woman be at stake.  This classification  includes  abortions  where\nthe pregnancy was caused by rape  or  incest  where  there  is  no  inherent\nthreat to life.  But if the “medical, moral, social, and  ethical  concerns”\nthat justify Medicaid-funded abortions do not require that the life  of  the\npregnant woman be at stake,  what  are  the  inherent  characteristics  that\ndistinguish the abortions permitted by the  “preserve  the  life,  rape,  or\nincest”  classification  from  cases  where   the   pregnant   woman   faces\nsubstantial and irreversible impairment of a  major  bodily  function?   The\nmedical, moral, social, and ethical concerns are the same or  at  least  the\ndifferences   too   insubstantial   to   be   sustained   by   the   State’s\njustifications.\n\n      The application of the challenged statute and regulations to  pregnant\nwomen who face substantial and irreversible impairment  of  a  major  bodily\nfunction is significant because the Legislature  itself  has  identified  it\nfor special treatment in the  State  abortion  control  statute.   For  that\npurpose, the Legislature has treated in exactly the  same  way  cases  where\nthe life of the pregnant woman is at stake and cases where the  woman  faces\nsubstantial  and  irreversible  impairment  of  a  major  bodily   function.\nIndiana law forbids an abortion  to  be  performed  in  Indiana  unless  the\npregnant woman consents following specified disclosures provided to  her  at\nleast 18 hours before the abortion is performed.   Ind.  Code  §16-34-2-1.1.\nHowever, the Legislature has exempted  from  these  disclosure  and  waiting\nperiod  cases  where  “the  medical  condition  of  a   pregnant   woman   …\nnecessitates the immediate termination of her pregnancy to avert  her  death\nor  for  which  a  delay  would  create  serious  risk  of  substantial  and\nirreversible impairment of a major bodily function.”  Ind. Code §§  16-18-2-\n223.5 (emphasis supplied) & 16-34-2-1.1; A Woman's Choice-East Side  Women's\nClinic v. Newman, 671 N.E.2d 104,  111  (Ind.  1996)  (“severe-but-temporary\nconditions in which an abortion is not  the  medically  necessary  treatment\nare not covered by the exception”).\n\n      The fact that the Legislature has treated as a  single  classification\nin the abortion control statute “abortions for which a  delay  would  create\nserious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of  a  major  bodily\nfunction” and abortions necessary to  preserve  the  pregnant  woman’s  life\nreinforces our conclusion that the inherent characteristics of  these  cases\n(when combined with abortions where the pregnancy  was  caused  by  rape  or\nincest) are so similar that  disparate  treatment  is  not  justified  under\nMedicaid.  McIntosh,  729  N.E.2d  at  981;  Martin,  711  N.E.2d  at  1280;\nCollins, 644 N.E.2d at 80.  We find the challenged statute  and  regulations\nunconstitutional as applied to  Medicaid-eligible  women  whose  pregnancies\ncreate serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment  of  a  major\nbodily  function.   So  long  as  the  Indiana  Medicaid  program  pays  for\nabortions for Medicaid-eligible women where necessary to preserve  the  life\nof the pregnant woman or where the pregnancy was caused by rape  or  incest,\nwe hold that it must pay for abortions  for  Medicaid-eligible  women  whose\npregnancies create serious risk of substantial and  irreversible  impairment\nof a major bodily function.[9]\n\n                                 Conclusion\n\n\n      It is the judgment of the Court that the challenged Medicaid  statutes\nand regulation do not violate the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause  of\nthe Indiana Constitution and are, therefore, constitutional except that,  so\nlong as the Indiana Medicaid program pays  for  abortions  to  preserve  the\nlives of pregnant women and where pregnancies are caused by rape or  incest,\nit  must  also  pay  for  abortions  for   Medicaid-eligible   women   whose\npregnancies create serious risk of substantial and  irreversible  impairment\nof a major bodily function.   The  trial  court  is  reversed  in  part  and\naffirmed in part.\n\n\n            Shepard, C. J., and Dickson, J., concur in Part  I  and  dissent\n      from Part II.\n            Boehm and Rucker, JJ., dissent from Part I and  concur  in  Part\n      II.\n            Shepard, C.J., concurs and dissents with separate opinion.\n            Dickson, J., concurs and dissents with separate opinion.\n            Boehm, J., concurs and dissents with separate opinion  in  which\n      Rucker, J., concurs.\n\n\n\n\nShepard, Chief Justice, concurring and dissenting.\n\n      I join in Part I of Justice Sullivan’s opinion, but not  in  Part  II,\nwhich I think produces the wrong result.\n\n      A former colleague of ours once told us in conference (but never  took\noccasion to say in writing) that for  all  the  jurisprudential  effort  put\ninto devising standards for trial and appellate review, the  most  that  any\narticulated standard can achieve is to “tell the judge what mood  to  be  in\nas he or she approaches a topic.”  Various standards tell us  to  be  strict\nor liberal, deferential or non-deferential, to name a few.\n\n      The Court correctly announces the standard applicable to  the  present\ncase.  It is that the judiciary should defer  to  the  lines  drawn  by  the\nGeneral Assembly and Governors Bowen and Bayh unless they are “arbitrary  or\nmanifestly unreasonable.”  Slip op.  at  15,  citing  Collins  v.  Day,  644\nN.E.2d 72, 80 (Ind. 1994).\n\n      I cannot say that the decisions made on the very  difficult  topic  of\npublic payments for abortion,  made  by  Indiana’s  elected  representatives\n(and for that matter by the Congress and President Carter) are so  arbitrary\nand unreasonable that they are unconstitutional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDICKSON, Justice, concurring with Part I and dissenting from Part II.\n\n      I concur with the holding of Part I of Justice Sullivan's opinion for\nthe Court, that Indiana's Medicaid abortion coverage restrictions do not\nviolate the requirements of Collins v. Day, 644 N.E.2d 72 (Ind. 1994), and\nthus do not violate Article 1, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution.\n\n      The Indiana Privileges and Immunities Clause, Article 1, Section 23\nof the Indiana Constitution, clearly permits enactment of laws that provide\n\"disparate treatment\" for different classes where the legislation is\n\"reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the\nunequally treated classes.\"  Collins, 644 N.E.2d at 80.\n\n      The Court correctly acknowledges that \"the State's justifications of\nunavailability of federal financial participation, interest in protecting\nfetal life, fiscal policy, and administrative efficiency,\" and the uniform\napplicability of the Medicaid abortion benefit to all who qualify, are\nsufficient to sustain the constitutionality of the classification.\nSullivan slip opin. at 14.\n\n\n      I believe it preferable, however, to address the specific\nclassifications that were identified by the plaintiffs-appellees and trial\ncourt as receiving unequal treatment: (1) indigent men and women who need\ntreatment (other than abortion) which is medically necessary to preserve\ntheir health, and (2) indigent pregnant women needing to terminate their\npregnancy to preserve and protect their health but whose pregnancies do not\nthreaten their lives and were not the result of rape or incest.  These two\nasserted classifications do not contrast the persons entitled to receive\nMedicaid abortions with those ineligible.  Rather, they compare the\ntreatment received by persons entitled to Medicaid benefits provided for\nnon-abortion medical services with those seeking Medicaid-funded abortions.\n These two classifications receive different treatment in that the medical\nservices for the second are limited to exclude abortions except in narrow\ncircumstances.  This disparate treatment is clearly related to the inherent\ncharacteristic that distinguishes the unequally treated classes: namely,\nthe medical treatment in the second classification, abortion, requires the\ntermination of fetal life.   The legislative decision to impose\nrestrictions upon Medicaid-funded abortions is obviously and reasonably\nrelated to whether the medical services involve the termination of fetal\nlife.  Thus, even using the classifications identified by the trial court\nand the appellees, the Indiana Medicaid abortion restrictions do not\nviolate Section 23.\n\n\n      I dissent, however, from Part II and the Conclusion of the Court's\nopinion, which appears to condition the holding in Part I by judicially\nexpanding Indiana's Medicaid abortion coverage to require the state to\nprovide abortion benefits clearly not intended by the Indiana General\nAssembly.\n\n\n      Under Part II, the Indiana Medicaid program must now begin paying for\nabortions for Medicaid-eligible women whose pregnancies create a \"serious\nrisk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily\nfunction,\" even though the pregnancy does not present a threat to the\nwoman's life.  Sullivan slip opin. at 15.    I believe that this conclusion\nand its rationale are erroneous.\n\n      The majority in Part II of Justice Sullivan's opinion purports to\napply Collins but does so only by framing and then comparing its own two\n\"classifications\" of Medicaid-eligible pregnant women: (1) those for whom\nabortions are necessary to preserve their lives or where their pregnancies\nwere caused by rape and incest, and (2) those who seek abortions for all\nother reasons, particularly the subset consisting of pregnant women whose\npregnancies present a serious, but not life-threatening, risk of\nsubstantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.  Having\ncombined in a single classification both those abortions needed to preserve\nthe life of a pregnant woman and those abortions for pregnancies resulting\nfrom rape and incest, the majority in Part II then questions and dismisses\nthe validity of the independent factors that reasonably relate to each sub-\nclassification by observing that the these factors are not applicable in\ncommon to both sub-classifications.  Upon this highly questionable premise,\nthe majority then declares that the factors supporting each sub-\nclassification are the same or their differences \"too insubstantial\" to\njustify different treatment.  With this rhetorical device, Part II\ndisregards the protection of fetal life, and the medical, moral, social,\nand ethical concerns that properly distinguish and justify the restrictions\non Medicaid abortions.\n\n\n      Proper application of Collins to the majority's classifications would\nseem to require that the first one be separated into its two independent\ncomponents: (a) pregnancies for which abortions are necessary to preserve\nthe life of the pregnant woman, and (b) pregnancies resulting from rape or\nincest.  As between those abortions necessary to preserve the life of the\npregnant woman and the majority's \"substantial and irreversible impairment\"\nsubclass, the access to Medicaid-funded abortions for the former is clearly\nand reasonably related to the inherent difference that distinguishes the\nclasses—the risk of the woman's death without an abortion.  It is the\nlegislature's prerogative to balance its interest in preserving fetal life\nwith its interest in not placing the mother at risk of death.  Likewise, as\nbetween abortions in pregnancies resulting from rape or incest and those in\nthe \"substantial and irreversible impairment\" subclass, the access to\nMedicaid-funded abortions for the former is obviously related to the\ninherent difference distinguishing the classes—whether the pregnancy was\ncaused by criminal conduct.  It is neither arbitrary nor manifestly\nunreasonable for the legislature to conclude that the medical, moral,\nsocial, and ethical implications of a compelled pregnancy under these\ncircumstances outweighs the government's interest in the preservation of\nfetal life.  Furthermore, as to both subclasses (\"risk of death\" and \"rape\nor incest\"), the access to Medicaid-funded abortions that are denied to the\n\"substantial and irreversible impairment\" classification is reasonably\nrelated to the fact that the federal government reimbursement is not\navailable for the latter.  Such fiscal considerations by the legislature\nare within the considerable legislative discretion accorded under Collins.\n\n\n      The legitimate reasons that separately justify the Medicaid program's\nfunding for abortions needed to preserve a woman's life and its funding for\nabortions where the pregnancy results from rape or incest cannot be\nneutralized by declaring these two groups merged into the same\nclassification, and then finding their independent separate justifications\nthereby inconsequential because they do not simultaneously apply to both\n\"risk of death\" and \"rape or incest\" abortions.\n\n\n      Despite the requirement of Collins that we show substantial deference\nto the discretion of the legislature, the majority in Part II of Justice\nSullivan's opinion disregards the clear and unequivocal language and intent\nof the Indiana General Assembly.  Indiana Code section 16-34-1-2 explicitly\ndeclares: \"Neither the state nor any political subdivision of the state may\nmake a payment from any fund under its control for the performance of an\nabortion unless the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the\npregnant woman.\"  The effect of Part II is to nullify this legislative\nlimitation and to substantially expand the obligation of the Indiana\nMedicaid program to henceforth fund abortions for medical conditions that\nare not needed to save the mother's life.\n\n      An examination of Indiana Code section 16-34 et seq. makes clear that\nthe legislature clearly intended and articulated a deliberate distinction\nbetween the two classes of women.  Some statutes use broader language that\nis not limited to situations in which a pregnant woman is at risk of death.\n For example, section 16-34-2-1(a)(3)(C) criminalizes abortion performed\nafter viability of the fetus unless the abortion is \"necessary to prevent a\nsubstantial permanent impairment of the life or physical health of the\npregnant woman.\"  (emphasis added).  Section 16-34-2-1.1 requires that\ncertain information be given to a woman at least eighteen hours before an\nabortion except in the case of a medical emergency, which is defined in\nIndiana Code section 16-18-2-223.5 as a condition that \"necessitates the\nimmediate termination of [a woman's] pregnancy to avert her death or for\nwhich a delay would create serious risk of substantial and irreversible\nimpairment of a major bodily function.\"  Section 16-34-2-1.2 requires that\nan abortion provider inform a woman facing a medical emergency of the\nmedical indications supporting the provider's judgment that an abortion is\nnecessary to prevent the mother's death or \"a substantial and irreversible\nimpairment of a major bodily function.\"  Section 16-34-2-3(a) states that\nall abortions performed after viability shall be performed in a hospital\nhaving premature birth intensive care units unless compliance would result\nin \"an increased risk to the life or health of the mother.\"  (emphasis\nadded).  Subsection (b) requires there to be in attendance a second\nphysician who shall care for a child born alive as a result of an abortion\nunless \"compliance would result in an increased risk to the life or health\nof the mother.\"  (emphasis added).  In other statutes, however, it is clear\nthat the legislature intended provisions or exceptions to apply only to\nwomen whose lives are in danger.  Indiana Code section 16-34-2-1(a)(1)(B)\nstates that, \"if in the judgment of the physician the abortion is necessary\nto preserve the life of the woman, her consent is not required.\" (emphasis\nadded).  Indiana Code section 16-34-2-1(b) prohibits partial birth\nabortions unless a physician reasonably believes that it is necessary to\nsave the woman's life and no other medical procedure is sufficient.\n\n      The fact that certain sections apply when a woman faces risk of death\nor impairment of a major bodily function, such as section 16-34-2-1.1,\nwhile other sections apply only when she faces risk of death, such as\nsections 16-34-2-1(b) and 16-34-1-2, indicates that the legislature's\nchoice of language was precise and deliberate, demonstrating that the\nlegislature intended to identify and treat differently these distinct\nclasses of women with respect to the different statutory provisions.\n\n      In Part II, the majority imports the language of its new definition\nfrom Indiana Code section 16-18-2-223.5.  This provision does not address\nany term used in the statute restricting eligibility for taxpayer-funded\nabortions, I.C. § 16-34-1-2, but rather provides an exception to the\ninformed consent requirements of Indiana's general abortion law in cases of\n\"medical emergency,\" which it defines as a condition that \"complicates the\nmedical condition of a pregnant woman so that it necessitates the immediate\ntermination of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay would\ncreate serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major\nbodily function.\"  I.C. § 16-18-2-223.5.  In A Woman's Choice – East Side\nWomen's Clinic v. Newman, 671 N.E.2d 104, 109 (Ind. 1996), this Court\nconstrued this \"medical emergency\" definition to permit a physician to\ndispense with the informed consent provisions whenever the doctor concluded\nthat an abortion was medically necessary in the doctor's clinical judgment\nbased on \"all relevant factors pertaining to a woman's health.\"  By its\nimportation of this language, the majority improperly scuttles the present\nrestrictions in the Indiana Medicaid program's abortion coverage and\nappears to imply that Medicaid-eligible women may henceforth receive\nabortions at taxpayer expense in any case supported by the clinical\njudgment of a doctor based upon the woman's health factors, irrespective of\nwhether she is at risk of death.\n\n\n      The majority's alarming expansion of the coverage is exacerbated by\nthe fact that it imposes upon Indiana's Medicaid program the requirement to\nfund not only abortions necessary to prevent substantial and irreversible\nimpairment of a major bodily function, but also abortions necessary to\nprevent even serious risk of the same.  Plaintiffs claim in their brief\nthat hypertension (high blood pressure) complicates approximately 8% – 10%\nof pregnancies, and that \"[a]lthough in most cases serious harm to health\ncan be averted, hypertensive pregnant women are at higher risk for\ncerebrovascular accidents (strokes), abruptio placentae (premature\nseparation of the placenta from the uterus), and disseminated intravascular\ncoagulation (a severe bleeding disorder).\"  Br. of Appellees at 5-6\n(emphasis added).  Plaintiffs also discuss the risks pregnancy can have on\nwomen with diabetes, including retinopathy (eye disease, including\nblindness) and nephropathy (kidney disease), a fourfold increase in the\nlikelihood of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia and hypertensive diseases, and a\ntenfold increase in the risk of pregnancy-related death.  Other conditions\npotentially necessitating abortion, according to the plaintiffs, are cancer\nthat requires radiation or chemotherapy, and sickle cell anemia, which can\ncause \"severe crises (especially in bones), infections such as pneumonia[,]\n. . . increasingly severe anemia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary\ncomplications such as embolus.\"  Br. of Appellees at 7.  Plaintiffs admit\nthat \"[w]hile these conditions may not always be life threatening, they can\nseriously and permanently compromise a woman's health.\"  Br. of Appellees\nat 7 (emphasis added).  Under Justice Sullivan's expanded definition, these\nconditions arguably may now warrant coverage under Indiana's Medicaid\nabortion coverage.\n\n\n      Thus Justice Sullivan's opinion, while purporting in Part I to find\nthe enacted limitations on Medicaid abortion coverage constitutionally\nvalid, nevertheless in Part II has the effect of granting almost all the\nrelief sought by the plaintiffs in this case.  In judicially repealing the\nexpress legislative pronouncement that state and local government funds\ncannot be used to pay for any abortion unless necessary to preserve the\nmother's life, the majority establishes a potentially ever-expanding set of\nmedical conditions that may be transformed into entitlements for state-\nfunded abortions for which there will be no federal Medicaid reimbursement.\n This is blatantly contrary to the intentions of both the Indiana General\nAssembly that enacted Indiana Code section 16-34-1-2 and Governor Evan Bayh\nwho signed the bill into law.\n\n\n      For these reasons I dissent from Part II of Justice Sullivan's\nopinion.   The fact that the Indiana Medicaid program does not pay for\nabortions in cases of  \"pregnancies that create for pregnant women serious\nrisk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function\"\ndoes not render the challenged statute and regulations unconstitutional as\napplied.\n\n\n\n\nBoehm, Justice, dissenting as to Part I.\n\n      For the reasons given below, I respectfully dissent from Part I of the\nmajority  opinion.   Twelve  of  the  seventeen  state  courts   that   have\nconsidered the issue in published opinions have  concluded  that  denial  of\nbenefits to indigent women for medically necessary abortions is a  violation\nof their state constitution.[10]  Under prevailing  constitutional  doctrine\nin this state, I would reach the same result.\n\n\n      There is no doubt that a pregnant woman has  the  right  to  elect  an\nabortion as set forth in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S.  113  (1973).   There  is  no\ndoubt that the State may elect to have a Medicaid program  or  not  to  have\none.  And there is no doubt  that  the  State  may  elect  to  fund  medical\nprocedures for the indigent  without  providing  the  same  benefit  to  all\ncitizens.  Finally, it is plain on the face of the Medicaid statute that  by\nrestricting abortion benefits to those necessary to  prevent  death  of  the\nmother or to terminate pregnancies generated by rape or incest, the  Indiana\nMedicaid program seeks to provide  different  benefits  for  some  abortions\nthan it does for other “medically necessary” procedures.\n\n\n      The  plaintiffs  here  posit  their  claim   as   a   constitutionally\nimpermissible distinction arising from Medicaid’s refusal to fund  medically\nnecessary abortions for certain indigent women while providing benefits  for\nall other indigents in  need  of  medical  treatment.   The  plaintiffs  are\nentitled to frame their own complaint, so this different  treatment  is  the\nissue presented in this case.  Plaintiffs do not base their challenge  on  a\ncomparison of funding  for  pregnancies  arising  from  rape  or  incest  or\nthreatening the woman’s life to funding for other abortions.   It  therefore\nseems to me that the Indiana constitutional issue presented by this case  is\nsimply stated: is it permissible under Article I, Section 23 for  the  State\nto  provide  funding  for  medically  necessary  treatment   for   indigents\ngenerally, but to refuse it for medically  necessary  abortions  unless  the\nmother’s life is at stake or the pregnancy results from rape or  incest?   I\nconclude  it  is  not,  as  to  those  pregnancies  for  which  the  federal\nconstitution guarantees  the  woman  the  right  to  make  the  election  to\nterminate her pregnancy.\n\n\n\n      I. Equal Privileges Under the Indiana Constitution\n\n\n      The plaintiff’s constitutional challenge to this legislation is  based\nsolely on the Equal Privileges Clause found in Article I, Section 23 of  the\nIndiana Constitution.  The test for constitutionality under that  clause  is\nestablished in Collins v. Day, 644 N.E.2d 72 (Ind. 1994), and is  accurately\nrecited by the majority:\n\n      First, the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be\n      reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the\n      unequally treated classes.  Second, the preferential treatment must be\n      uniformly applicable and equally available to all persons similarly\n      situated.  Finally, in determining whether a statute complies with or\n      violates Section 23, courts must exercise substantial deference to\n      legislative discretion.\n\nId. at 80.\n\n\n      Although the Collins formulation is often described as a “two-pronged”\ntest, it really breaks down into three components because the first  “prong”\nestablishes two  requirements:  1)  the  classification  must  be  based  on\n“characteristics”  that  “rationally  distinguish  the   unequally   treated\nclass”, and 2) the “disparate treatment” must  be  “reasonably  related”  to\nthe characteristics that define the class.  I think this  means,  in  simple\nterms, that the class must be  defined  by  a  characteristic  that  is  not\narbitrary or otherwise impermissible and that the difference in  legislative\ntreatment must be reasonably related to the difference between the  classes.\n The second “prong” of Collins imposes a third  test:  everyone  who  is  in\nfact in the class (i.e., everyone who shares  the  defining  characteristic)\nmust be treated alike, and everyone who is not in the class must be  treated\nalike.  As we noted in McIntosh v. Melroe Co., 729 N.E.2d 972  (Ind.  2000),\nthe “characteristic” that defines the legislative class is  not  necessarily\ninnate (e.g., race, national origin).  It may be  a  mutable  characteristic\nthat the same person may have as of a given time, but lack at others  (e.g.,\npeople who are over age sixty-two  can  elect  to  receive  Social  Security\nbenefits, but are ineligible before attaining that age; a  corporation  with\nseventy-five or fewer shareholders can elect to be taxed more or less  as  a\npartnership, but is ineligible with seventy-six shareholders).   Or,  as  in\nMcIntosh, the classification may be based on a sequence of  events  (persons\ninjured by products in use for over  ten  years  have  no  claim  under  the\nProduct Liability Act).[11]  And so on.\n\n\n      Here  the  relevant  characteristics  defining  the  class   generally\nentitled to Medicaid benefits are  indigence  and  desire  for  a  medically\nnecessary treatment.  In Section 23 terms, the Medicaid  statute  confers  a\nprivilege on those persons.  The  plaintiffs  here  are  indigent  and  seek\nreimbursement for procedures that are “medically necessary” as that term  is\nused in the  Medicaid  statute.   The  State  refuses  to  pay  because  the\nrequested medical treatment would terminate  a  pregnancy  that  is  neither\nlife endangering nor the result of rape or incest.  Therefore, the  defining\ncharacteristic of the classification of citizens this legislation  draws  is\nthose women who are (1) requesting a medically necessary  abortion  and  (2)\notherwise eligible for Medicaid benefits but (3) whose pregnancy is  neither\nlife endangering nor a result of rape or incest.  The result  is  that  this\nlegislation  confers  a  privilege  by  providing  benefits   to   indigents\nrequiring medically necessary treatment, but withholds that  privilege  from\npoor  women  in  need  of  medically  necessary  abortions  to  terminate  a\npregnancy that is  neither  life  threatening  nor  originated  by  rape  or\nincest.  The statute thus sets up a scheme for  funding  abortions  that  is\ndifferent from that for funding for all other medical treatment.\n      II. Equal Protection Under the Federal Constitution\n\n      In order to understand the  higher  standard  demanded  by  the  state\nconstitution, it is important to review the basis of the  holding  that  the\nfederal  constitution  does  not  prevent  the  states  from  imposing  this\ncondition on funding for indigent medical care.  In  Harris  v.  McRae,  448\nU.S. 297 (1980), the  United  States  Supreme  Court,  in  a  5-4  decision,\nestablished that federal equal protection  doctrine  did  not  prohibit  the\nfederal government from enacting a  federal  statute,  the  Hyde  Amendment,\nthat denies federal reimbursement for the  procedures  at  issue  here.   In\nreaching that conclusion, the majority relied on  prevailing  federal  equal\nprotection doctrine.  The  only  Equal  Protection  Clause  in  the  federal\nconstitution is found in the Fourteenth Amendment which imposes  limitations\non state legislation, but does  not  apply  to  federal  statutes.   Indeed,\nuntil 1954, it was  accepted  dogma  that  there  was  no  equal  protection\ndoctrine applicable to federal legislation.  Kenneth  L.  Karst,  The  Fifth\nAmendment Guarantee of Equal Protection, 55 N.C. L. Rev.  541,  542  (1971);\nsee, e.g., Detroit Bank v. United States, 317 U.S.  329,  337  (1943).   The\nSupreme Court for the first time found  equal  protection  applicable  to  a\nfederal law in a companion case to Brown v. Board  of  Education,  347  U.S.\n483 (1954).  Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497  (1954)  addressed  segregation\nin the schools of  the  District  of  Columbia.   Because  the  District  of\nColumbia was a federal enclave and not a  state,  the  Fourteenth  Amendment\ndid not apply.  The Supreme Court unanimously  held  that  the  Due  Process\nClause of the Fifth Amendment required no less  than  the  Equal  Protection\nClause of the  Fourteenth  Amendment,  finding  it  “unthinkable”  that  the\nfederal government could impose distinctions that the  Constitution  forbids\nto the states.  By the mid 1970’s, it had become  accepted  that  the  equal\nprotection doctrine developed under the Fourteenth  Amendment  with  respect\nto state laws applied equally to federal legislation.   See,  e.g.,  Buckley\nv. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 93 (1976).[12] It  was  within  this  legal  framework\nthat Harris upheld the federal Hyde Amendment in 1980.\n\n\n      The  four-Justice  majority  in  Harris  first  found  that  the  Hyde\nAmendment did not itself “impinge on a right or  liberty  protected  by  the\n[federal] Constitution.”  Id. at 322.  This was based on the conclusion,  in\naddressing claims under the federal Due Process Clause, that although  there\nis a federal constitutional right to elect an abortion under  Roe  v.  Wade,\nthere  is  no  federal  constitutional  right  to  receive  funding  for  an\nabortion.\n\n\n      Because no federal constitutional right  was  impinged,  and  indigent\npregnant women were not a suspect class, the majority  in  Harris  evaluated\nthe federal equal protection claim under the standard taken from McGowan  v.\nMaryland, 366 U.S. 420 (1961): the classification must be  sustained  unless\nit  “rests  on  grounds  wholly  irrelevant  to  the  achievement  of   [any\nlegitimate governmental] objective.”  Harris, 448 U.S. at 322  (brackets  in\noriginal).  The majority recognized a legitimate  governmental  interest  in\nprotecting human life by  “subsidizing  the  medical  expenses  of  indigent\nwomen who  carry  their  pregnancies  to  term  while  not  subsidizing  the\ncomparable  expenses  of  women  who  undergo  abortions.”   Id.   at   325.\nAccordingly, the Harris majority held that  nothing  in  the  federal  equal\nprotection doctrine  prevents  a  state  from  refusing  to  fund  medically\nnecessary abortions for indigent women.  The majority  thus  relied  on  the\nprevailing “rationality” test for federal equal  protection:  a  legislative\nclassification requires only “a  rational  relationship  to  any  legitimate\ngovernmental interest.”  John E. Nowak & Ronald D.  Rotunda,  Constitutional\nLaw §14.3, at 644 (6th ed. 2000).\n\n\n      Four Justices dissented in Harris,  taking  the  view  that  the  Hyde\nAmendment and its consequent state implementations imposed an  impermissible\nburden on the exercise of a  woman’s  constitutionally  protected  right  to\nchoose.  For that reason,  some  of  the  dissenters  did  not  address  the\nfederal equal protection claims raised  in  that  case.   Justice  Marshall,\nhowever, did find both due process and  equal  protection  violations  in  a\nscheme that provides government funding for one  choice,  but  not  for  the\nother, when the right to  make  that  election  is  itself  constitutionally\nprotected.  In addition to placing an impermissible burden on  the  exercise\nof a constitutionally protected  right  in  violation  of  the  federal  Due\nProcess Clause, Justice Marshall concluded that the classification  effected\nby the statute did not pass the federal equal protection test formulated  by\nthe majority.  In his view, the  asserted  governmental  interest—protection\nof human life—was not rational as that term  is  used  in  equal  protection\ndoctrine  because  it  is,  as  a  matter  of  federal  constitutional  law,\nsubordinate to the individual women’s “interest in  preserving  their  lives\nand health by obtaining medically necessary treatment.”   Harris,  448  U.S.\nat 346.\n\n\n      I agree that the Harris majority identified a legitimate  governmental\ninterest in promotion of human  life.   This  is  a  factor  supporting  the\npolicy found in both the federal Hyde Amendment and the Indiana  statute  at\nissue here.  The state has a second valid consideration in its  concern  for\npublic expenditures.  The federal government has elected not to  participate\nin funding of medical procedures to terminate these pregnancies. The  result\nis the state bears all of any cost, not  merely  approximately  thirty-eight\npercent.  The parties cite various studies suggesting that funding  abortion\nwould have a financial impact of zero or even a  positive  effect  on  total\nfederal  and  state  Medicaid  expenses.   This  conclusion  is   based   on\ncomparisons to the cost of delivering the child and bearing  its  subsequent\nhealth-care costs. Thus, the federal decision to deny  benefits  may  indeed\nrely solely on social policy,  not  financial  considerations.   However  on\nthis record I cannot conclude that the State’s  claimed  financial  concerns\nare a sham.  Evaluation of  that  factor  is  therefore  a  matter  for  the\nlegislature.  Given that the federal scheme embodied in the  Hyde  Amendment\ntreats these pregnancies  differently  than  it  does  all  other  medically\nnecessary procedures, plaintiffs have not established that  it  is  fiscally\nirrational for the state legislature to  refuse  to  underwrite  the  entire\nexpense rather than the sixty-two percent it bears  for  all  other  medical\nexpenses.  As the majority  points  out,  the  legislature  is  entitled  to\nsubstantial deference  in  drawing  lines  where  judgment  is  required  in\nbalancing competing interests.  For both these reasons, I agree  that  under\nthe rationality test adopted by the Harris  majority,  which  requires  only\nsome minimal governmental interest in the absence of a suspect  class  or  a\ndirectly  infringed  constitutional  right,  no  federal  equal   protection\nviolation is to be  found.   But  both  the  analysis  and  the  result  are\ndifferent under the Indiana Constitution.\n\n\n\n      III. The Plaintiffs’ Claim Under the Indiana Constitution\n\n\n      The Indiana constitutional provision that the plaintiffs invoke is not\nequal protection, but rather the Equal Privileges Clause  found  in  Article\nI, Section 23.  It provides: “The General Assembly shall not  grant  to  any\ncitizen, or class of citizens, privileges or  immunities,  which,  upon  the\nsame terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.”  As  Collins  pointed\nout, Article I, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution  is  quite  different\nin both its language and its  meaning  from  the  federal  Equal  Protection\nClause whose doctrines governed the United States Supreme Court majority  in\nHarris.  By demanding that legislative privileges  be  dispensed  “equally”,\nand plainly applying  to  treatment  of  Indiana’s  own  citizens,  it  also\ndiffers significantly from the  Privileges  and  Immunities  Clause  of  the\nFourteenth Amendment.  The Equal Privileges Clause was found in the  Indiana\nConstitution well before 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment introduced  both\nthe Equal Protection Clause and the Privileges and  Immunities  Clause  into\nthe  United  States  Constitution.   Some  regarded   the   Privileges   and\nImmunities Clause, not either the Equal Protection or  Due  Process  Clause,\nto be the primary guarantor of individual rights  against  state  intrusion.\nNowak & Rotunda, Constitutional Law § 14.1 at 632.  The  federal  Privileges\nand Immunities Clause prohibits state laws that “abridge the  privileges  or\nimmunities of citizens of  the  United  States”  but  makes  no  mention  of\n“equal” treatment.  The Slaughterhouse Cases, 83 U.S.  36  (1872),  promptly\nheld this provision to apply only to state laws that discriminate  in  favor\nof their own citizens and against outsiders.  Thus, the  federal  Privileges\nand Immunities Clause was rendered a  dead  letter  as  a  limitation  on  a\nstate’s ability to restrict rights of its own  citizens.   That  result  was\nbased in large part on the view  that  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  “was  not\nintended to displace the critical role of the states as protectors of  their\nown citizens.”  Lawrence H. Tribe, Constitutional Law  §14  at  10  (3d  ed.\n2000).  Thus, for over a century,[13] the Privileges and  Immunities  Clause\nof the Federal Constitution was thought to  defer  to  its  counterparts  in\nstate constitutions.  It is the Indiana Equal Privileges Clause that  is  in\nissue here, and for the reasons explained below, I believe it requires  more\nthan either the Equal Protection Clause or  the  Privileges  and  Immunities\nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment.   In  the  course  of  establishing  its\nstandard for constitutional legislative classifications  under  the  Indiana\nEqual Privileges Clause,  Collins  explicitly  rejected  the  federal  equal\nprotection approach of degrees of scrutiny.   Collins,  644  N.E.2d  at  80.\nRather, “[t]he protections assured by Section 23 apply fully,  equally,  and\nwithout diminution to prohibit  any  and  all  improper  grants  of  unequal\nprivileges or immunities, including not only those grants involving  suspect\nclasses or impinging upon  fundamental  rights  but  other  such  grants  as\nwell.”  Id. at 80.  Thus, all claims  of  unequal  privilege  are  evaluated\nunder the test described in Part I of this opinion.\n\n\n      The method chosen—denial of funding—undoubtedly meets the  requirement\nthat the legislation be related to the goal of promoting human life.  But  I\nbelieve  the  legislation   fails   the   Collins   requirement   that   the\nclassification be reasonably related to  the  legislative  objectives.   The\nplaintiffs  point  to  other  measures,  such  as  denying  scholarships  at\nuniversities to women who elect abortions, that they contend might  also  be\njustified in the name  of  deterring  abortions,  if  the  State’s  Medicaid\nstatutes are upheld.  Although these hypothetical examples  are  not  before\nus today, in general I think they raise  the  issue  whether  the  disparate\ntreatment is “reasonably related” to the defining  characteristic,  and  not\nwhether the class is defined by a permissible characteristic.\n\n\n      Under Collins, as Justice Sullivan points out, the  reasonableness  of\nthe relationship between the classification and  the  legislative  objective\nturns on a balancing test.  The woman’s right under the Constitution of  the\nUnited  States  to  elect  an  abortion  is  established  by  Roe  v.  Wade,\nirrespective of  the  origin  of  the  pregnancy  or  whether  her  life  is\nthreatened by carrying the fetus to term.  The U.S.  Supreme  Court  in  Roe\nheld, “the State in promoting its interest  in  the  potentiality  of  human\nlife may, if it chooses,  regulate,  and  even  proscribe,  abortion  except\nwhere  it  is  necessary,  in  appropriate   medical   judgment,   for   the\npreservation of the life or health of the mother.”  Roe, 411  U.S.  at  164-\n65.  Thus, the right to choose is not absolute,  but  the  interest  of  the\nState  in  promoting  childbirth  is  constitutionally  subordinate  to  the\nwoman’s right to choose to protect her life and her  health.   As  explained\nabove, under Harris, federal equal  protection  doctrine  would  permit  the\nState to deny funding  even  if  its  interest—promotion  of  human  life—is\noffset and  outweighed  by  other  interests  as  long  as  the  legislation\ndisadvantages no suspect classification and impinges no  fundamental  right.\nBut the Indiana Constitution is rife with provisions asserting  the  primacy\nof individual rights.  The 1851 Constitution,  like  its  1816  predecessor,\nbegins  with  a  Bill  of  Rights  and  only  later  turns   to   provisions\nestablishing the branches of government.  The Bill  of  Rights  starts  with\nArticle 1, Section 1, which borrows from the Declaration of Independence  in\nasserting rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness.   This  emphasis\non individual rights reflected the strong populist sentiment  prevailing  at\nthe 1851 convention, which essentially carried out the agenda set  in  1816.\nSee Price v. State, 622 N.E.2d 954, 962  n.11  (Ind.  1993).   In  the  same\nvein, the Indiana Equal Privileges  Clause  elevates  individual  rights  by\nrequiring  more  than  some   recognized   governmental   interests   before\nlegislation can override the  interests  of  the  individual.   Thus,  under\nCollins a “rational relationship to any  legitimate  governmental  interest”\nis not enough to carry the day.  Under  the  balancing  test  of  our  state\nconstitution, the governmental interests must outweigh those of the  private\ncitizen before a statute may deny a  privilege  granted  to  others.   Under\nthis standard, when faced with the federal constitutional right of  a  woman\nto choose to protect her health, the State’s interests fail  to  carry  that\nburden.\n\n\n      This case presents a classic confrontation between  individual  rights\nand the will of the majority as reflected in legislation.  The law at  issue\nhere affects only women who are indigent and desire  a  medically  necessary\nprocedure.  The effect of the statute is to impose a financial penalty on  a\nwoman’s election  to  exercise  her  constitutionally  guaranteed  right  to\nchoose.  Of course, as a  practical  matter,  this  financial  obstacle  may\nresult in delays that complicate the woman’s medical  condition,  and  often\nmay force the result of a choice that is for the woman alone to  make.   The\nState thus seeks to impose its choice upon the woman to whom  that  decision\nis  constitutionally  reserved.   By  so  choosing,  the  State   seeks   to\nprioritize the interest it  advances  over  the  woman’s  right  to  choose.\nWhether the State seeks to advance its interest by criminalizing  abortions,\nas it no longer can do,  or  by  creating  legislation  that  penalizes  the\nexercise  of  that  right,  either  is,  as  a  matter   of   constitutional\npriorities, an unreasonable balance.  As such, this legislation  imposes  an\nunreasonable classification and is invalid under Collins.\n\n\n      Justice Sullivan concludes that indigent women whose  pregnancy  risks\nserious and permanent impairment of a  major  bodily  function  may  not  be\ndenied Medicaid benefits.  Those women are a  subset  of  all  indigents  in\nneed of medically necessary procedures.  Accordingly, I concur  in  Part  II\nof Justice Sullivan’s opinion, though it does not grant all  of  the  relief\nto which I believe the plaintiffs are entitled.\n\n\n      Rucker, J., concurs.\n\n-----------------------\n[1] The Hyde Amendment has  never  had  the  status  of  permanent  law  but\ninstead has been attached annually to legislation  appropriating  funds  for\ncertain departments of the federal government for a  given  fiscal  year  or\nhas been adopted as a stand-alone joint resolution.   The  full  version  of\nthe Hyde Amendment in effect on the date this lawsuit was filed states:\n      “Sec. 508. (a) None of the funds  appropriated  under  this  Act,  and\nnone of the funds in any trust funds are appropriated under this  Act  shall\nbe expended for any abortion.\n      (b) None of the funds appropriated under this Act,  and  none  of  the\nfunds in any trust fund to which funds  are  appropriated  under  this  Act,\nshall be expended for health benefits coverage  that  includes  coverage  of\nabortion.\n      (c) The term “health benefits coverage” means the package of  services\ncovered by a managed care provider or organization pursuant  to  a  contract\nor other arrangement.\n      Sec. 509 (a) The limitations  established  in  the  preceding  section\nshall not apply to an abortion\n      (1) if the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest; or\n      (2) in the case where  a  woman  suffers  from  a  physical  disorder,\nphysical injury, or physical illness, including a life-endangering  physical\ncondition caused by or arising from the pregnancy  itself,  that  would,  as\ncertified by a physician, place the woman  in  danger  of  death  unless  an\nabortion is performed.\n       (b)  Nothing  in  the  preceding  section  shall  be   construed   as\nprohibiting the expenditure by a State, locality, entity, or private  person\nof State, local, or private  funds  (other  than  a  State’s  or  locality’s\ncontribution of Medicaid matching funds).\n       (c)  Nothing  in  the  preceding  section  shall  be   construed   as\nrestricting the ability of any managed care provider from offering  abortion\ncoverage or the ability of a State or locality to contract  separately  with\nsuch a provider for such coverage with State funds (other than a State’s  or\nlocality’s  contribution  of   Medicaid   matching   funds).

Code § 16-18-2-223.5 (1998), the  State\nabortion control statute, discussed infra.\n[9]  The State, in addition to its arguments on Art I, § 23, sought  summary\njudgment on two additional grounds.\n      First, it argued that the plaintiffs were barred from the relief  they\nsought by Ind. Code §  12-15-5-2,  which  prohibits  Indiana  Medicaid  from\nfunding any service for  which  the  federal  government  does  not  provide\nreimbursement.  The trial court found, first, that one statute  cannot  save\nanother found to be unconstitutional, and second, that the  State  does  not\nstrictly abide by the statute because the Indiana  Medicaid  program  covers\nservices for which federal financial participation is unavailable.\n      The State also argued that the Separation of Functions clause of  Art.\nIII, § 1, of the Indiana Constitution barred the  court  from  granting  the\nrelief that the plaintiffs requested.  The trial court  found  that  if  the\nchallenged enactments violate the state Constitution, the Court could  grant\nrelief even if doing so means that state funds will be  spent  in  a  manner\nnot explicitly approved of by the Legislature.  “The Court has the power  to\nshape appropriate remedies and the Legislature has  a  duty  to  appropriate\nfunds to meet its constitutional obligations.”  (Supp. R. 12 (quoting  State\nv. Monfort, 723 N.E.2d 407, 413 (Ind. 2000).))\n      While we do not necessarily agree with the trial court’s reasoning, we\naffirm as to these issues.  We  believe  the  course  of  these  proceedings\neffectively  placed  Ind.  Code  §  12-15-5-2  at  issue.   And  as  to  the\nseparation of powers issue, we  believe  that  the  general  and  open-ended\nnature of the Medicaid  appropriation,  combined  with  the  limited  relief\nprovided, does not tread impermissibly upon the Legislature’s  appropriation\nprerogatives.\n[10] Planned Parenthood v.

However, I do  not  agree  with  the  majority  that  “this  claim\ndefines the class” as that term is used in  McIntosh.   The  issue  in  that\ncase was whether  the  statute  of  repose  in  the  Product  Liability  Act\nviolated Article I, Section 23 by shutting off claims based on  products  in\nuse over ten years before the event giving rise to the  plaintiff’s  injury.\nIn saying that the “claim . . . defines the  class,”  McIntosh  referred  to\nthe claim of the plaintiffs in the underlying product  liability  case,  not\nto the claim  of  unconstitutionality.   In  other  words,  the  claim  that\ndefined the class was the claim that the plaintiff was injured by a  product\nmore than ten years old, not the claim that the statute of  repose  violated\nthe Indiana Constitution.\n[12] For an account of this journey,  which  includes  a  few  detours,  see\ngenerally Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

The plaintiffs in this case argue, and the trial court held, that Medicaid must pay for any abortion that is medically necessary, citing the Indiana Constitution's requirement that privileges or immunities cannot be granted to a citizen or class of citizens that do not equally belong to all citizens on the same terms.</p>\n<p>For the reasons set forth in this opinion in part I under \"Discussion,\" I believe that this provision of the Indiana Constitution does not require Medicaid to pay for all abortions that are medically necessary. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*249</span> Chief Justice Shepard and Justice Dickson join in this part of this opinion.</p>\n<p>However, for the reasons set forth in this opinion in part II under \"Discussion,\" I also conclude that, so long as the Indiana Medicaid program pays for abortions to preserve the lives of pregnant women and where rape or incest cause pregnancy, it must also pay for abortions in cases of pregnancies that create for pregnant women serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. Justices Boehm and Rucker join in this part of this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>In 1965, Congress established the Medicaid program, a joint federal-state program that pays for some health care costs of low-income people, by amending Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1396v. Under the Medicaid program, the federal government reimburses participating states for the health care services provided pursuant to the state's medical assistance or Medicaid plan. <i>Id.</i> at §§ 1396a(a)(10), 1396d(a). States are not required to participate in the Medicaid program but states that choose to participate must conform their Medicaid program to federal Medicaid law. <i>Id.</i> at § 1396a(a).</p>\n<p>In 1973, the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protected, to a certain extent, the freedom of a woman to terminate a pregnancy. <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973).</p>\n<p>In 1976, Congress first adopted legislation, referred to as the \"Hyde Amendment\" for its author, Representative Henry J. Hyde, that prohibits the federal government from reimbursing states under the Medicaid program for abortions except where a woman would be placed \"in danger of death unless an abortion is performed\" or where \"the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.\" Pub.L. No. 106-113, §§ 508-509, 113 Stat. 1501, 1501A-274 (1999). Although the provisions of the Hyde Amendment have varied from time to time, this is the language of the prohibition and exception in effect today.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*250</span> In 1977, the Supreme Court held that the constitutional right to abortion recognized in <i>Roe v. Wade</i> did not include an entitlement to Medicaid payments that were not medically necessary. <i>Maher v. Roe,</i> 432 U.S. 464, 470, 97 S.Ct. 2376, 53 L.Ed.2d 484 (1977). In 1980, the Supreme Court was faced with a challenge to the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, <i>i.e.,</i> whether Congress could prohibit the use of federal Medicaid funds to reimburse states for medically necessary abortions. The court held that the Hyde Amendment did not violate either the Due Process or the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Harris v. McRae,</i> 448 U.S. 297, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980).</p>\n<p>Any state that participates in the Medicaid program must cover those abortions for which federal funds are available. <i>Zbaraz v. Quern,</i> 596 F.2d 196, 201 (7th Cir.1979), <i>cert. denied,</i> 448 U.S. 907, 100 S.Ct. 3048, 65 L.Ed.2d 1136 (1980). Nevertheless, \"[a] participating state is free, if it so chooses, to include in its Medicaid plan those medically necessary abortions for which federal reimbursement is unavailable...\" <i>Harris,</i> 448 U.S. at 309, 100 S.Ct. 2671.</p>\n<p>Indiana participates in the federal Medicaid program and is bound by all of its requirements. Ind.Code § 12-15-1-1. The Indiana Medicaid program provides low-income Hoosier citizens with virtually all non-experimental, medically necessary health care, including some services for which federal reimbursement is not available. <i>See e.g.,</i> Ind.Code § 12-15-5-1(18) (providing coverage for nonmedical nursing care given in accordance with tenants and practices of a recognized church); <i>cf.</i> 42 C.F.R. § 440.170(b) (restricting federal funding for such institutions to those organized pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code). Indiana Medicaid covers inpatient hospital services, physicians' services, and outpatient hospital or clinic services for all recipients and provides a full range of reproductive health care for Medicaid-eligible men. Ind.Code § 12-15-5-1. Covered services must be \"medically reasonable and necessary\" and are required to be provided to Medicaid recipients in a uniformly equitable manner. Ind.Code § 12-15-1-10. Indiana Medicaid defines a \"medically reasonable and necessary service\" as one that \"meets current professional standards commonly held to be applicable to the case.\" Ind. Admin. Code tit. 405, r. 5-2-17 (2001). However, in the case of abortion services, the program defines an abortion as necessary (and therefore covered under the program) only if \"performed to preserve the life of the pregnant woman or in other circumstances if the abortion is required to be covered by Medicaid under federal law,\" <i>e.g.,</i> where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest. Ind.Code § 12-15-5-1(17);<sup>[2]</sup> Ind.Code § 16-34-1-2;<sup>[3]</sup> Ind. Admin. Code tit. 405, r. 5-28-7.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*251</span> The plaintiffs in this case, Clinic for Women, Inc., Women's Pavilion, Inc., Ulrich G. Klopfer, D.O., and Martin Haskell, M.D., challenge the constitutionality of these two statutes and this regulation. The plaintiffs contend that the statutes' and regulation's collective prohibition on the use of state Medicaid funds to pay for abortions violates the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. I, § 23, as well as Art I, §§ 1 and 12, of the Indiana Constitution.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>After hearing oral argument of the parties, the trial court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denied the state's cross-motion for summary judgment, ruling that the challenged statutes and regulation violated Art. I, § 23. The trial court did not address plaintiffs' Art. I, § 1 and 12, claims and they are not before us here.</p>\n<p>Article I, § 23, of the Indiana Constitution reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>The General Assembly shall not grant to any citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.</blockquote>\n<p>From at least 1971 until about nine years ago, this court analyzed claims under the state Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause using the same techniques as those employed by the United States Supreme Court to analyze claims under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Collins v. Day,</i> 644 N.E.2d 72, 75 (Ind.1994). In <i>Collins,</i> this court jettisoned the use of federal equal protection analytical methodology to claims alleging violations of Art. I, § 23, and held that such claims should be analyzed using a different standard. <i>Id.</i> That standard was summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Article 1, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution imposes two requirements upon statutes that grant unequal privileges or immunities to differing classes of persons. First, the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes. Second, the preferential treatment must be uniformly applicable and equally available to all persons similarly situated. Finally, in determining whether a statute complies with or violates Section 23, courts must exercise substantial deference to legislative discretion.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 80. Indiana courts have made frequent use of the <i>Collins</i> standard since its promulgation, including the trial court here.</p>\n<p>The trial court found that the ban on funding abortions contained in the challenged statutes and regulation failed both prongs of the <i>Collins</i> standard summarized <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>The first prong of the Collins test requires that \"where the Legislature singles <span class=\"star-pagination\">*252</span> out one person or class of persons to receive a privilege or immunity not equally provided to others, such classification must be based upon distinctive, inherent characteristics which rationally distinguish the unequally treated class, and the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to such distinguishing characteristics.\" <i>Id.</i> at 78-79. The trial court started its analysis of this prong with the proposition that the \"Medicaid program is a government program through which a benefitgovernment payment for medically necessary treatmentis provided to indigent Hoosiers.\" (Supp. R. 8.) \"However,\" the trial court continued, \"that benefit is not provided equally to all indigent Hoosierswomen who, for medical reasons, need to terminate their pregnancy in order to preserve and protect their health did not receive that funding benefit. Under the Indiana Medicaid program, indigent men and indigent pregnant women who need treatment (other than abortion) which is medically necessary to preserve their health are singled out for a benefit which is denied to indigent pregnant women needing to terminate their pregnancy to preserve and protect their health.\" (Supp. R. 8.)</p>\n<p>The second prong of the <i>Collins</i> analysis requires that the preferential treatment \"be uniformly applicable and equally available to all persons similarly situated.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80. Here the trial court found that \"[a]ll Medicaid-eligible pregnant women are similarly situated in that all may require, from time to time, an array of medically necessary treatment to protect and preserve their health.\" But, under the challenged Medicaid statutes and regulations, \"Medicaid coverage of needed medical services is not `uniformly applicable and equally available' to those similarly situated. Pregnant women who require a medically necessary abortion to preserve their health will not receive state funding while pregnant women who require other types of medically necessary treatment will receive state funding.\" (Supp. R. 9.)</p>\n<p>Under <i>Collins,</i> legislative discretion is accorded substantial deference. <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80-81. The trial court identified the State's interests claimed to be served by the challenged statutes and regulation as potential life, administrative simplicity, and cost containment. But it found these justifications insufficient.</p>\n<blockquote>[P]ursuing the goal of promoting fetal life at the expense of preserving the health of women who need to terminate their pregnancy for medical reasons contravenes the purpose of the Medicaid program, which is designed to enable indigent Hoosiers to obtain medically necessary treatment. The State's asserted interest in administrative simplicity and cost containment also do not justify the funding ban. First, the goal of achieving administrative simplicity in itself can never serve as a sufficient goal to justify depriving some citizens of privileges accorded others. Second, the goal of cost containment is also not reasonably related to the funding ban. Abortions are less expensive than the costs associated with childbirth. Moreover, preventing a Medicaid-eligible woman from terminating her pregnancy to protect and preserve her health will necessarily mean that she will have increased health problems that the Indiana Medicaid program must cover. Cost containment is not served by the funding ban and cannot be the basis to depriving some citizens of a privilege accorded others.</blockquote>\n<p>(Supp. R. 10.)</p>\n<p>The State appealed the judgment directly to our Court pursuant to Ind. Appellate</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*253</span> Rule 4(A)(1)(b).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Our Court has been informed in this matter by a substantial number of decisions from sister courts on similar claims under their respective state constitutions, including some with constitutional provisions the same as our Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause. Many of these are identified and discussed in an excellent law journal article, Melanie D. Price, <i>The Privacy Paradox: The Divergent Paths of the United States Supreme Court and State courts on the Issue of Sexuality,</i> 33 Ind. L.Rev. 863, 875-879 (2000).</p>\n<p>The Court also appreciates the assistance of amicus curiae Indiana Civil Liberties Union, Inc., Indiana Right to Life Committee, Inc., and twelve members of the Indiana General Assembly (Senators Frank Mrvan, Jr., Kent Adams, David C. Ford, Allie V. Craycraft, Jr., and R. Michael Young, and Representatives Gary L. Cook, Jeffrey A. Thompson, P. Eric Turner, James Russell Buck, Dennis K. Kruse, and Jerry L. Denbo), and their respective counsel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. I, § 23, of the Indiana Constitution states, \"The General Assembly shall not grant to any citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\"</p>\n<blockquote>Article I, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution imposes two requirements upon statutes that grant unequal privileges or immunities to differing classes of persons. First, the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes. Second, the preferential treatment must be uniformly applicable and equally available to all person similarly situated.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80. In determining whether a statute complies with or violates this provision, the Court shows substantial deference to the discretion of the Legislature in attempting to \"balance the competing interest involved,\" and the Legislature's basis in creating the distinction. <i>Id.</i> To resolve conflicts between the state constitution and a challenged statute, this Court has stated that \"the better course is to construe or reconstrue the statute in such a way as to further the purpose of the legislature without offending the Indiana Constitution.\" <i>Van Dusen v. Stotts,</i> 712 N.E.2d 491, 496 (Ind.1999).</p>\n<p>Under the first prong of the <i>Collins</i> test, any \"disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80.</p>\n<blockquote>Where the legislature singles out one person or class of persons to receive a privilege or immunity not equally provided to others, such classification must be based upon distinctive, inherent characteristics which rationally distinguish the unequally treated class, and the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to such distinguishing characteristics.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 78-79.</p>\n<p>Before we can determine whether the legislative classification under the first prong of <i>Collins</i> is permissible, we need to identify the legislative classification at issue. The parties here define the relevant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*254</span> classification differently. The plaintiffs contend (and the trial court agreed) that the legislative classification at issue places (1) \"indigent men and indigent women who need treatment (other than abortion) which is medically necessary to preserve their health\" into a class for which the necessary treatment is provided, and (2) \"indigent pregnant women needing to terminate their pregnancy to preserve and protect their health\" into a class for which the necessary treatment is not provided. (Supp. R. 8.) The State argues that the relevant classification is between (1) \"medically necessary services and supplies\" for which federal Medicaid reimbursement at some level is available (a class that includes abortions to save a woman's life and where pregnancy resulted from rape or incest) and (2) medically necessary services and supplies for which it is not (a class that includes all other medically necessary abortions).

Melroe Co</i><i>.,</i> Justice Boehm examined the way in which the legislative classification at issue in the first prong of <i>Collins</i> is to be determined:</p>\n<blockquote>Although <i>Collins</i> itself uses the word \"inherent\" to describe the characteristic that defines the class, this cannot be equated with \"innate\" characteristics of members of the class. The worker's compensation scheme [the statute at issue in <i>Collins],</i> like the Product Liability Act [the statute at issue in <i>McIntosh],</i> turns on the characteristics of the employers, not the injured workers. Similarly, under the Product Liability Act, everyone may potentially recover for an injury from a product not yet ten years old, and everyone injured from an older product is barred. It is the claim, not any innate characteristic of the person, that defines the class.</blockquote>\n<p>729 N.E.2d 972, 981 (Ind.2000). We think the claim here, reduced to its essentials, is that some Medicaid-eligible pregnant women in Indiana are entitled to Medicaid-financed medically necessary abortions and others are not. We think this \"claim ... defines the class:\" (1) Medicaid-eligible pregnant women who seek to terminate their pregnancies in order to preserve their lives or where their pregnancies resulted from rape or incest are in a class where Medicaid pays for their abortions; and (2) Medicaid-eligible pregnant women who seek to terminate their pregnancies for any other medically necessary reason are in a class where Medicaid will not pay for their abortions. Although this formulation of the classification at issue differs somewhat from those advanced by the parties, we believe it sufficiently similar to each that their arguments against and in favor of the classifications retain their full force.</p>\n<p>As already discussed, in analyzing the constitutional permissibility of the classification identified, we \"accord considerable deference to the manner in which the legislature has balanced the competing interest involved.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80 (citing <i>Johnson v. St. Vincent Hosp.,</i> 273 Ind. 374, 404-05, 404 N.E.2d 585, 604 (1980)). Indeed, we frequently recite that the challenger to the constitutionality of the legislative scheme bears the burden \"to negative every conceivable basis which might have supported the classification.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 273 Ind. at 392, 404 N.E.2d at 597. In <i>Collins,</i> we quoted from an earlier opinion of this Court in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote>Legislative classification becomes a judicial question only where the lines drawn appear arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable. So long as the classification is based upon substantial distinctions with reference to the subject matter, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the legislature; nor will we inquire into <span class=\"star-pagination\">*255</span> the legislative motives prompting such classification.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80 (quoting <i>Chaffin v. Nicosia,</i> 261 Ind. 698, 701, 310 N.E.2d 867, 869 (1974)).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs contend that even this deferential standard of review is violated by the statutory and regulatory scheme challenged here. Calling the classification \"manifestly unreasonable,\" Br. of Appellees at 21, they argue that the</p>\n<blockquote>... classes of persons granted and denied the privilege are inherently the same in ways that relate directly to the subject matter of the Medicaid legislation: they are low-income, such that they meet the Medicaid eligibility requirements, and they seek medical care for which they have a medical need. What distinguishes between the two is that the members of the group denied the privilege have health conditions which cause them to need an abortion to preserve their health, while members of the class granted the privilege have health conditions which cause them to need medical care other than abortion to preserve their health. However, that difference does not relate to the subject matter of the Medicaid statutes. In fact, denying funding to a woman whose health will deteriorate if she does not have an abortion runs directly counter to the subject matter of the legislation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 19.</p>\n<p>The State offers four justifications for the classification.</p>\n<p>First, the State argues that the unavailability of federal financial participation means that it would not be \"fiscally prudent and rational\" and that it would otherwise be \"administrative[ly] inconvenien[t]\" for the State to pay for abortions that are not eligible for federal reimbursement. Br. of Appellants at 14, 15.</p>\n<p>Second, the State argues that it has a \"valid and compelling\" interest in protecting fetal life, quoting from this court's decision in <i>Cheaney v. State,</i> 259 Ind. 138, 147, 285 N.E.2d 265, 270 (1972), <i>cert. denied,</i> 410 U.S. 991, 93 S.Ct. 1516, 36 L.Ed.2d 189 (1973).<sup>[7]</sup> The State quotes from <i>Harris v. McRae</i> for support in pressing its point that \"limiting government funding for abortion is a rational means for indicating the government's interest in protecting fetal life.\" Br. of Appellants at 17 <i>(quoting </i><i>Harris,</i> 448 U.S. at 325, 100 S.Ct. 2671).</p>\n<p>Third, in addition to the fiscal and administrative efficiency dimensions of the federal funding argument made <i>supra,</i> the State advances additional fiscal and administrative justifications for the classification. It argues that a more liberal system of government payments for abortion \"will result in more of that activity\" and \"may have a dramatic impact on the State's future tax base.\" Its broader point here is that the allocation of Medicaid spending is a fiscal policy determination for the legislative and executive branches. Br. of Appellants at 18-19.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs respond that the State should not be entitled to offer justifications for the classification extraneous to the purpose of the Medicaid program itself. \"If the State's position is accepted, the Legislature could insulate any discriminatory statute from constitutional challenge by simply claiming that it serves multiple purposes. Thus, the State could withhold any and all government benefits from women who have had abortions, irrespective of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*256</span> subject matter or goal of the statute at issue. For example, the State could grant free tuition to state universities to all its citizens except for those who have had an abortion, on the grounds that the statute furthers the State's interest in protecting fetal life.\" Br. of Appellees at 21.</p>\n<p>We appreciate the point plaintiffs make but think it only has force if our determination is binary. To the contrary, <i>Collins,</i> its precursors, and its progeny all indicate that we look at the Legislature's \"balancing of the competing interest involved.\" <i>See </i><i>American Legion Post No. 113 v. State,</i> 656 N.E.2d 1190, 1192 (Ind.Ct.App. 1995) <i>(citing </i><i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80 <i>(citing </i><i>Johnson,</i> 273 Ind. at 404-05, 404 N.E.2d at 604)), <i>trans. denied.</i></p>\n<p>In balancing the interests here, we have given careful attention to the evidence presented by the plaintiffs in the trial court demonstrating a number of different health risks faced by pregnant women with respect to which an abortion is medically necessary. In support of their motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs submitted the affidavit of Dr. Jane Hodgson, a physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology and an expert in the field. Dr. Hodgson testified that many women confront serious health risk when pregnant. Hypertension complicates about 8-10% of pregnancies. Hypertensive pregnant women are at a higher risk for cerebrovascular accidents (strokes), abruptio placentae (premature separation of the placenta from the uterus), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (a severe bleeding disorder). Dr. Hodgson further testified that pregnancy-induced diabetes occurs in approximately 1-3% of pregnancies. Women with preexisting diabetes have ten times the risk of pregnancy-related death than do non-diabetic women. Diabetes-associated retinopathy (eye disease) or nephropathy (kidney disease) often worsen significantly during pregnancy. Dr. Hodgson added that pregnancy jeopardizes the health of a woman with advanced coronary artery disease or severe impairment of the heart valve, and all pregnant women with heart disease have a higher risk of congestive heart failure, cardiac infections, and arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms). The health of a pregnant woman is seriously impaired when she suffers from chronic renal failure, myasthenia gravis, or pulmonary embolism from a previous pregnancy. Pregnant women with lupus may experience aggravation of their disease.</p>\n<p>Dr. Hodgson also testified that pregnant women with sickle cell anemia experience more frequent and more severe crises, especially in bones, infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections, increasingly severe anemia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary complications such as embolus. Other conditions exacerbated by pregnancy include asthma, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, gall bladder disease, liver disease, and epilepsy. Dr. Hodgson added that when cancer threatens a pregnant woman's life, the pregnancy puts further strain on the woman's health, and may require a suspension of cancer treatment because of harm to the fetus from such treatments. Thus, if treatment of the disease requires radiation or chemotherapy, a choice must be made between the health of the patient and the fetus, since these forms of therapy are likely to result in fetal malformation or death. Pregnancy may accelerate the condition of women with malignant breast tumors that are estrogen receptor positive. Dr. Hodgson's testimony was bolstered by the other affidavits submitted by the plaintiffs from Dr. Judith Belsky and Dr. William Mudd Haskell.</p>\n<p>The question for this Court is whether the Legislature may prohibit the State from paying for an abortion for a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*257</span> Medicaid-eligible pregnant woman facing any of these health risks while at the same time it authorizes the State to pay for an abortion to preserve the life of a Medicaid-eligible pregnant woman or where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest. We find the State's justifications of unavailability of federal financial participation, interest in protecting fetal life, fiscal policy, and administrative efficiency sufficient to sustain the constitutionality of the classification under the first prong of the <i>Collins</i> test. We are in no position to deny plaintiffs' argument that the statutes and regulation at issue impose significant financial, physical, and emotional hardship on many low-income Hoosier women. But we hold that the State's justifications for the classification do not rise to the level of being \"arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80 <i>(quoting </i><i>Chaffin,</i> 261 Ind. at 701, 310 N.E.2d at 869).</p>\n<p>The second prong of the <i>Collins</i> test requires that the \"privileged\" legislative classification \"be open to any and all persons who share the inherent characteristics which distinguish and justify the classification, with the special treatment accorded to any particular classification extended equally to all such persons.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 79.</p>\n<p>The trial court found this aspect of <i>Collins</i> violated because \"[p]regnant women who require a medically necessary abortion to preserve their health will not receive state funding while those who require other types of medically necessary treatment will receive state funding.\" (Supp. R. 9.) We believe the State is correct when it responds that, because the plaintiffs \"challenge not the provision of Medicaid benefits to indigent people generally, but rather the deprivation of Medicaid benefits to some who seek abortions, it is clearer to frame the issue as whether that deprivation is uniformly applicable to all who share the inherent characteristics that justify the classification.\" Brief of Appellants at 23. We find the requirement of the second prong of <i>Collins</i> met because Medicaid will pay for abortions for all persons in the classification of Medicaid eligible pregnant women seeking to terminate their pregnancies to preserve their life or where the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>A statute that is constitutional on its face may be unconstitutional as applied to a particular plaintiff. <i>See </i><i>Martin v. Richey,</i> 711 N.E.2d 1273, 1284-85 (Ind. 1999) (holding Indiana Medical Malpractice Act statute of limitations constitutional on its face but unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs whose medical condition and the nature of the asserted malpractice make it unreasonable to expect that they could discover the asserted malpractice and resulting injury within the limitations period); <i>City of Fort Wayne v. Cameron,</i> 267 Ind. 329, 334, 370 N.E.2d 338, 341 (1977) (holding Indiana Tort Claims Act notice requirement constitutional on its face but unconstitutional as applied to plaintiffs whose mental and physical incapacity render them unable to comply with the notice requirement). For the reasons set forth below, we believe that the statute and regulations challenged here are unconstitutional as applied to Medicaid-eligible pregnant women whose pregnancies \"create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*258</span> Article I, § 23, of our Constitution prohibits a statute from providing disparate treatment to different classes of persons if the disparate treatment is not reasonably related to inherent characteristics that distinguish the unequally treated classes. <i>McIntosh,</i> 729 N.E.2d at 981; <i>Martin,</i> 711 N.E.2d at 1280; <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80. We believe that the characteristics that distinguish Medicaid-eligible pregnant women whose pregnancies create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function to be virtually indistinguishable from the characteristics of women for whose abortions the State does pay. To the extent there is a distinction, it is too insubstantial to be sustained by the State's justifications.</p>\n<p>The challenged statutory and regulatory scheme here provides disparate treatment to different classes of persons: Medicaid (1) will pay for abortions where necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman or where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest but (2) will not pay for any other abortions. Thus the Constitution requires that the disparate treatment be reasonably related to inherent characteristics that distinguish the \"preserve the life, rape, or incest\" classification from the \"any other abortions\" classification. Within this \"any other abortions\" classification is a subset consisting of abortions where the pregnancies create for Medicaid-eligible women a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.</p>\n<p>The State's argument is that there are \"inherent characteristics ... reasonably related to permissible legislative goals\" that justify Medicaid-funded abortions where necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman or where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest. Br. of Appellants at 17. This is because \"[a]bortions in those circumstances raise problems and concerns that abortions in other circumstances do not.\" <i>Id.</i> Although it does not elaborate, the State says that these problems are the result of certain \"medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns\" that \"do not arise in other abortion cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 18.</p>\n<p>That is, the State says that providing Medicaid-financed abortions is reasonably related to the \"inherent characteristics\" that distinguish the \"preserve the life, rape, or incest\" classification from the \"any other abortions\" classification (and, therefore, makes the distinction constitutionally permissible). Those inherent characteristics are the \"medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns\" raised by the \"preserve the life, rape, or incest\" classification that are not raised by the \"any other abortions\" classification.</p>\n<p>It is clear that the inherent characteristics of the \"preserve the life, rape, or incest\" classification do not require that the life of the pregnant woman be at stake. This classification includes abortions where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest where there is no inherent threat to life. But if the \"medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns\" that justify Medicaid-funded abortions do not <i>require</i> that the life of the pregnant woman be at stake, what are the inherent characteristics that distinguish the abortions permitted by the \"preserve the life, rape, or incest\" classification from cases where the pregnant woman faces substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function? The medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns are the same or at least the differences too insubstantial to be sustained by the State's justifications.</p>\n<p>The application of the challenged statute and regulations to pregnant women who face substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function is significant because the Legislature itself has identified it for special treatment in the State abortion control statute. For that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*259</span> purpose, the Legislature has treated in exactly the same way cases where the life of the pregnant woman is at stake and cases where the woman faces substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. Indiana law forbids an abortion to be performed in Indiana unless the pregnant woman consents following specified disclosures provided to her at least 18 hours before the abortion is performed. Ind.Code § 16-34-2-1.1. However, the Legislature has exempted from these disclosure and waiting period cases where \"the medical condition of a pregnant woman ... necessitates the immediate termination of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay would create <i>serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"</i> Ind.Code §§ 16-18-2-223.5 (emphasis supplied) &amp; 16-34-2-1.1; <i>A Woman's Choice-East Side Women's Clinic v. Newman,</i> 671 N.E.2d 104, 111 (Ind.1996) (\"severe-but-temporary conditions in which an abortion is not the medically necessary treatment are not covered by the exception\").</p>\n<p>The fact that the Legislature has treated as a single classification in the abortion control statute \"abortions for which a delay would create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function\" and abortions necessary to preserve the pregnant woman's life reinforces our conclusion that the inherent characteristics of these cases (when combined with abortions where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest) are so similar that disparate treatment is not justified under Medicaid. <i>McIntosh,</i> 729 N.E.2d at 981; <i>Martin,</i> 711 N.E.2d at 1280; <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80. We find the challenged statute and regulations unconstitutional as applied to Medicaid-eligible women whose pregnancies create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. So long as the Indiana Medicaid program pays for abortions for Medicaid-eligible women where necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman or where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, we hold that it must pay for abortions for Medicaid-eligible women whose pregnancies create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It is the judgment of the Court that the challenged Medicaid statutes and regulation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> do not violate the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Indiana Constitution and are, therefore, constitutional except that, so long as the Indiana Medicaid program pays for abortions to preserve the lives of pregnant women and where pregnancies are caused by rape or incest, it must also pay for abortions for Medicaid-eligible women whose pregnancies create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. The trial court is reversed in part and affirmed in part.</p>\n<p>SHEPARD, C.J., and DICKSON, J., concur in Part I and dissent from Part II.</p>\n<p>BOEHM and RUCKER, JJ., dissent from Part I and concur in Part II.</p>\n<p>SHEPARD, C.J., concurs and dissents with separate opinion.</p>\n<p>DICKSON, J., concurs and dissents with separate opinion.</p>\n<p>BOEHM, J., concurs and dissents with separate opinion in which RUCKER, J., concurs.</p>\n<p>SHEPARD, Chief Justice, concurring and dissenting.</p>\n<p>I join in Part I of Justice Sullivan's opinion, but not in Part II, which I think produces the wrong result.</p>\n<p>A former colleague of ours once told us in conference (but never took occasion to say in writing) that for all the jurisprudential effort put into devising standards for trial and appellate review, the most that any articulated standard can achieve is to \"tell the judge what mood to be in as he or she approaches a topic.\" Various standards tell us to be strict or liberal, deferential or non-deferential, to name a few.</p>\n<p>The Court correctly announces the standard applicable to the present case. It is that the judiciary should defer to the lines drawn by the General Assembly and Governors Bowen and Bayh unless they are \"arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable.\" Op. at 257, citing <i>Collins v. Day,</i> 644 N.E.2d 72, 80 (Ind.1994).</p>\n<p>I cannot say that the decisions made on the very difficult topic of public payments for abortion, made by Indiana's elected representatives (and for that matter by the Congress and President Carter) are so arbitrary and unreasonable that they are unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>DICKSON, Justice, concurring with Part I and dissenting from Part II.</p>\n<p>I concur with the holding of Part I of Justice Sullivan's opinion for the Court, that Indiana's Medicaid abortion coverage restrictions do not violate the requirements of <i>Collins v. Day,</i> 644 N.E.2d 72 (Ind.1994), and thus do not violate Article 1, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution.</p>\n<p>The Indiana Privileges and Immunities Clause, Article 1, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution, clearly permits enactment of laws that provide \"disparate treatment\" for different classes where the legislation is \"reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80.</p>\n<p>The Court correctly acknowledges that \"the State's justifications of unavailability of federal financial participation, interest in protecting fetal life, fiscal policy, and administrative efficiency,\" and the uniform applicability of the Medicaid abortion benefit to all who qualify, are sufficient to sustain the constitutionality of the classification. Sullivan opin. at 257.</p>\n<p>I believe it preferable, however, to address the specific classifications that were identified by the plaintiffs-appellees and trial court as receiving unequal treatment: (1) indigent men and women who need <span class=\"star-pagination\">*261</span> treatment (other than abortion) which is medically necessary to preserve their health, and (2) indigent pregnant women needing to terminate their pregnancy to preserve and protect their health but whose pregnancies do not threaten their lives and were not the result of rape or incest. These two asserted classifications do not contrast the persons entitled to receive Medicaid abortions with those ineligible. Rather, they compare the treatment received by persons entitled to Medicaid benefits provided for non-abortion medical services with those seeking Medicaid-funded abortions. These two classifications receive different treatment in that the medical services for the second are limited to exclude abortions except in narrow circumstances. This disparate treatment is clearly related to the inherent characteristic that distinguishes the unequally treated classes: namely, the medical treatment in the second classification, abortion, requires the termination of fetal life. The legislative decision to impose restrictions upon Medicaid-funded abortions is obviously and reasonably related to whether the medical services involve the termination of fetal life. Thus, even using the classifications identified by the trial court and the appellees, the Indiana Medicaid abortion restrictions do not violate Section 23.</p>\n<p>I dissent, however, from Part II and the Conclusion of the Court's opinion, which appears to condition the holding in Part I by judicially expanding Indiana's Medicaid abortion coverage to require the state to provide abortion benefits clearly not intended by the Indiana General Assembly.</p>\n<p>Under Part II, the Indiana Medicaid program must now begin paying for abortions for Medicaid-eligible women whose pregnancies create a \"serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,\" even though the pregnancy does not present a threat to the woman's life. Sullivan opin. at 257. I believe that this conclusion and its rationale are erroneous.</p>\n<p>The majority in Part II of Justice Sullivan's opinion purports to apply <i>Collins</i> but does so only by framing and then comparing its own two \"classifications\" of Medicaid-eligible pregnant women: (1) those for whom abortions are necessary to preserve their lives or where their pregnancies were caused by rape and incest, and (2) those who seek abortions for all other reasons, particularly the subset consisting of pregnant women whose pregnancies present a serious, but not life-threatening, risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. Having combined in a single classification both those abortions needed to preserve the life of a pregnant woman and those abortions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, the majority in Part II then questions and dismisses the validity of the independent factors that reasonably relate to each sub-classification by observing that these factors are not applicable in common to both sub-classifications. Upon this highly questionable premise, the majority then declares that the factors supporting each sub-classification are the same or their differences \"too insubstantial\" to justify different treatment. With this rhetorical device, Part II disregards the protection of fetal life, and the medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns that properly distinguish and justify the restrictions on Medicaid abortions.</p>\n<p>Proper application of <i>Collins</i> to the majority's classifications would seem to require that the first one be separated into its two independent components: (a) pregnancies for which abortions are necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman, and (b) pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. As between those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*262</span> abortions necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman and the majority's \"substantial and irreversible impairment\" subclass, the access to Medicaid-funded abortions for the former is clearly and reasonably related to the inherent difference that distinguishes the classesthe risk of the woman's death without an abortion. It is the legislature's prerogative to balance its interest in preserving fetal life with its interest in not placing the mother at risk of death. Likewise, as between abortions in pregnancies resulting from rape or incest and those in the \"substantial and irreversible impairment\" subclass, the access to Medicaid-funded abortions for the former is obviously related to the inherent difference distinguishing the classeswhether the pregnancy was caused by criminal conduct. It is neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable for the legislature to conclude that the medical, moral, social, and ethical implications of a compelled pregnancy under these circumstances outweighs the government's interest in the preservation of fetal life. Furthermore, as to both subclasses (\"risk of death\" and \"rape or incest\"), the access to Medicaid-funded abortions that are denied to the \"substantial and irreversible impairment\" classification is reasonably related to the fact that the federal government reimbursement is not available for the latter. Such fiscal considerations by the legislature are within the considerable legislative discretion accorded under <i>Collins.</i></p>\n<p>The legitimate reasons that separately justify the Medicaid program's funding for abortions needed to preserve a woman's life and its funding for abortions where the pregnancy results from rape or incest cannot be neutralized by declaring these two groups merged into the same classification, and then finding their independent separate justifications thereby inconsequential because they do not simultaneously apply to both \"risk of death\" and \"rape or incest\" abortions.</p>\n<p>Despite the requirement of <i>Collins</i> that we show substantial deference to the discretion of the legislature, the majority in Part II of Justice Sullivan's opinion disregards the clear and unequivocal language and intent of the Indiana General Assembly. Indiana Code section 16-34-1-2 explicitly declares: \"Neither the state nor any political subdivision of the state may make a payment from any fund under its control for the performance of an abortion unless the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman.\" The effect of Part II is to nullify this legislative limitation and to substantially expand the obligation of the Indiana Medicaid program to henceforth fund abortions for medical conditions that are not needed to save the mother's life.</p>\n<p>An examination of Indiana Code section 16-34 <i>et seq.</i> makes clear that the legislature clearly intended and articulated a deliberate distinction between the two classes of women. Some statutes use broader language that is not limited to situations in which a pregnant woman is at risk of death. For example, section 16-34-2-1(a)(3)(C) criminalizes abortion performed after viability of the fetus unless the abortion is \"necessary to prevent a substantial permanent impairment of the life <i>or physical health</i> of the pregnant woman.\" (emphasis added). Section 16-34-2-1.1 requires that certain information be given to a woman at least eighteen hours before an abortion <i>except in the case of a medical emergency,</i> which is defined in Indiana Code section 16-18-2-223.5 as a condition that \"necessitates the immediate termination of [a woman's] pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay would create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" Section 16-34-2-1.2 requires <span class=\"star-pagination\">*263</span> that an abortion provider inform a woman facing a medical emergency of the medical indications supporting the provider's judgment that an abortion is necessary to prevent the mother's death <i>or</i> \"a substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" Section 16-34-2-3(a) states that all abortions performed after viability shall be performed in a hospital having premature birth intensive care units unless compliance would result in \"an increased risk to the life <i>or health</i> of the mother.\" (emphasis added). Subsection (b) requires there to be in attendance a second physician who shall care for a child born alive as a result of an abortion unless \"compliance would result in an increased risk to the life <i>or health</i> of the mother.\" (emphasis added). In other statutes, however, it is clear that the legislature intended provisions or exceptions to apply <i>only</i> to women whose lives are in danger. Indiana Code section 16-34-2-1(a)(1)(B) states that, \"if in the judgment of the physician the abortion is <i>necessary to preserve the life</i> of the woman, her consent is not required.\" (emphasis added). Indiana Code section 16-34-2-1(b) prohibits partial birth abortions unless a physician reasonably believes that it is <i>necessary to save the woman's life</i> and no other medical procedure is sufficient.</p>\n<p>The fact that certain sections apply when a woman faces risk of death <i>or</i> impairment of a major bodily function, such as section 16-34-2-1.1, while other sections apply <i>only</i> when she faces risk of death, such as sections 16-34-2-1(b) and 16-34-1-2, indicates that the legislature's choice of language was precise and deliberate, demonstrating that the legislature intended to identify and treat differently these distinct classes of women with respect to the different statutory provisions.</p>\n<p>In Part II, the majority imports the language of its new definition from Indiana Code section 16-18-2-223.5. This provision does not address any term used in the statute restricting eligibility for taxpayer-funded abortions, I.C. § 16-34-1-2, but rather provides an exception to the informed consent requirements of Indiana's general abortion law in cases of \"medical emergency,\" which it defines as a condition that \"complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman so that it necessitates the immediate termination of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay would create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" I.C. § 16-18-2-223.5. In <i>A Woman's ChoiceEast Side Women's Clinic v. Newman,</i> 671 N.E.2d 104, 109 (Ind.1996), this Court construed this \"medical emergency\" definition to permit a physician to dispense with the informed consent provisions whenever the doctor concluded that an abortion was medically necessary in the doctor's clinical judgment based on \"all relevant factors pertaining to a woman's health.\" By its importation of this language, the majority improperly scuttles the present restrictions in the Indiana Medicaid program's abortion coverage and appears to imply that Medicaid-eligible women may henceforth receive abortions at taxpayer expense in any case supported by the clinical judgment of a doctor based upon the woman's health factors, irrespective of whether she is at risk of death.</p>\n<p>The majority's alarming expansion of the coverage is exacerbated by the fact that it imposes upon Indiana's Medicaid program the requirement to fund not only abortions necessary to prevent substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function, but also abortions necessary to prevent even serious <i>risk</i> of the same. Plaintiffs claim in their brief that hypertension (high blood pressure) complicates approximately 8%10% of pregnancies, and that \"[a]lthough in most cases <span class=\"star-pagination\">*264</span> serious harm to health can be averted, hypertensive pregnant women are at higher <i>risk</i> for cerebrovascular accidents (strokes), abruptio placentae (premature separation of the placenta from the uterus), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (a severe bleeding disorder).\" Br. of Appellees at 5-6 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs also discuss the risks pregnancy can have on women with diabetes, including retinopathy (eye disease, including blindness) and nephropathy (kidney disease), a fourfold increase in the likelihood of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia and hypertensive diseases, and a tenfold increase in the risk of pregnancy-related death. Other conditions potentially necessitating abortion, according to the plaintiffs, are cancer that requires radiation or chemotherapy, and sickle cell anemia, which can cause \"severe crises (especially in bones), infections such as pneumonia[,] ... increasingly severe anemia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary complications such as embolus.\" Br. of Appellees at 7. Plaintiffs admit that \"[w]hile these conditions may not always be life threatening, they <i>can</i> seriously and permanently compromise a woman's health.\" Br. of Appellees at 7 (emphasis added). Under Justice Sullivan's expanded definition, these conditions arguably may now warrant coverage under Indiana's Medicaid abortion coverage.</p>\n<p>Thus Justice Sullivan's opinion, while purporting in Part I to find the enacted limitations on Medicaid abortion coverage constitutionally valid, nevertheless in Part II has the effect of granting almost all the relief sought by the plaintiffs in this case. In judicially repealing the express legislative pronouncement that state and local government funds cannot be used to pay for any abortion unless necessary to preserve the mother's life, the majority establishes a potentially ever-expanding set of medical conditions that may be transformed into entitlements for state-funded abortions for which there will be no federal Medicaid reimbursement. This is blatantly contrary to the intentions of both the Indiana General Assembly that enacted Indiana Code section 16-34-1-2 and Governor Evan Bayh who signed the bill into law.</p>\n<p>For these reasons I dissent from Part II of Justice Sullivan's opinion. The fact that the Indiana Medicaid program does not pay for abortions in cases of \"pregnancies that create for pregnant women serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function\" does not render the challenged statute and regulations unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p>BOEHM, Justice, dissenting as to Part I.</p>\n<p>For the reasons given below, I respectfully dissent from Part I of the majority opinion. Twelve of the seventeen state courts that have considered the issue in published opinions have concluded that denial of benefits to indigent women for medically necessary abortions is a violation of their state constitution.<sup>[1]</sup> Under prevailing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*265</span> constitutional doctrine in this state, I would reach the same result.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that a pregnant woman has the right to elect an abortion as set forth in <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> 410 U.S. 113, 93 S.Ct. 705, 35 L.Ed.2d 147 (1973). There is no doubt that the State may elect to have a Medicaid program or not to have one. And there is no doubt that the State may elect to fund medical procedures for the indigent without providing the same benefit to all citizens. Finally, it is plain on the face of the Medicaid statute that by restricting abortion benefits to those necessary to prevent death of the mother or to terminate pregnancies generated by rape or incest, the Indiana Medicaid program seeks to provide different benefits for some abortions than it does for other \"medically necessary\" procedures.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs here posit their claim as a constitutionally impermissible distinction arising from Medicaid's refusal to fund medically necessary abortions for certain indigent women while providing benefits for all other indigents in need of medical treatment. The plaintiffs are entitled to frame their own complaint, so this different treatment is the issue presented in this case. Plaintiffs do not base their challenge on a comparison of funding for pregnancies arising from rape or incest or threatening the woman's life to funding for other abortions. It therefore seems to me that the Indiana constitutional issue presented by this case is simply stated: is it permissible under Article I, Section 23 for the State to provide funding for medically necessary treatment for indigents generally, but to refuse it for medically necessary abortions unless the mother's life is at stake or the pregnancy results from rape or incest? I conclude it is not, as to those pregnancies for which the federal constitution guarantees the woman the right to make the election to terminate her pregnancy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Equal Privileges Under the Indiana Constitution</h2>\n<p>The plaintiff's constitutional challenge to this legislation is based solely on the Equal Privileges Clause found in Article I, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution. The test for constitutionality under that clause is established in <i>Collins v. Day,</i> 644 N.E.2d 72 (Ind.1994), and is accurately recited by the majority:</p>\n<blockquote>First, the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes. Second, the preferential treatment must be uniformly applicable and equally available to all persons similarly situated. Finally, in determining whether a statute complies with or violates Section 23, courts must exercise substantial deference to legislative discretion.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 80.</p>\n<p>Although the <i>Collins</i> formulation is often described as a \"two-pronged\" test, it really breaks down into three components because the first \"prong\" establishes two requirements: 1) the classification must be based on \"characteristics\" that \"rationally distinguish the unequally treated class\", and 2) the \"disparate treatment\" must be \"reasonably related\" to the characteristics that define the class. I think this means, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> in simple terms, that the class must be defined by a characteristic that is not arbitrary or otherwise impermissible and that the difference in legislative treatment must be reasonably related to the difference between the classes. The second \"prong\" of <i>Collins</i> imposes a third test: everyone who is in fact in the class (i.e., everyone who shares the defining characteristic) must be treated alike, and everyone who is not in the class must be treated alike. As we noted in <i>McIntosh v. Melroe Co.,</i> 729 N.E.2d 972 (Ind.2000), the \"characteristic\" that defines the legislative class is not necessarily innate (e.g., race, national origin). It may be a mutable characteristic that the same person may have as of a given time, but lack at others (e.g., people who are over age sixty-two can elect to receive Social Security benefits, but are ineligible before attaining that age; a corporation with seventy-five or fewer shareholders can elect to be taxed more or less as a partnership, but is ineligible with seventy-six shareholders). Or, as in <i>McIntosh,</i> the classification may be based on a sequence of events (persons injured by products in use for over ten years have no claim under the Product Liability Act).<sup>[2]</sup> And so on.</p>\n<p>Here the relevant characteristics defining the class generally entitled to Medicaid benefits are indigence and desire for a medically necessary treatment. In Section 23 terms, the Medicaid statute confers a privilege on those persons. The plaintiffs here are indigent and seek reimbursement for procedures that are \"medically necessary\" as that term is used in the Medicaid statute. The State refuses to pay because the requested medical treatment would terminate a pregnancy that is neither life endangering nor the result of rape or incest. Therefore, the defining characteristic of the classification of citizens this legislation draws is those women who are (1) requesting a medically necessary abortion and (2) otherwise eligible for Medicaid benefits but (3) whose pregnancy is neither life endangering nor a result of rape or incest. The result is that this legislation confers a privilege by providing benefits to indigents requiring medically necessary treatment, but withholds that privilege from poor women in need of medically necessary abortions to terminate a pregnancy that is neither life threatening nor originated by rape or incest. The statute thus sets up a scheme for funding abortions that is different from that for funding for all other medical treatment.</p>\n<p>II. Equal Protection Under the Federal Constitution</p>\n<p>In order to understand the higher standard demanded by the state constitution, it is important to review the basis of the holding that the federal constitution does not prevent the states from imposing this condition on funding for indigent medical care. In <i>Harris v. McRae,</i> 448 U.S. 297, 100 S.Ct. 2671, 65 L.Ed.2d 784 (1980), the United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> decision, established that federal equal protection doctrine did not prohibit the federal government from enacting a federal statute, the Hyde Amendment, that denies federal reimbursement for the procedures at issue here. In reaching that conclusion, the majority relied on prevailing federal equal protection doctrine. The only Equal Protection Clause in the federal constitution is found in the Fourteenth Amendment which imposes limitations on state legislation, but does not apply to federal statutes. Indeed, until 1954, it was accepted dogma that there was no equal protection doctrine applicable to federal legislation. Kenneth L. Karst, <i>The Fifth Amendment Guarantee of Equal Protection,</i> 55 N.C. L.Rev. 541, 542 (1971); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Detroit Bank v. United States,</i> 317 U.S. 329, 337, 63 S.Ct. 297, 87 L.Ed. 304 (1943). The Supreme Court for the first time found equal protection applicable to a federal law in a companion case to <i>Brown v. Board of Education,</i> 347 U.S. 483, 74 S.Ct. 686, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954). <i>Bolling v. Sharpe,</i> 347 U.S. 497, 74 S.Ct. 693, 98 L.Ed. 884 (1954) addressed segregation in the schools of the District of Columbia. Because the District of Columbia was a federal enclave and not a state, the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply. The Supreme Court unanimously held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment required no less than the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, finding it \"unthinkable\" that the federal government could impose distinctions that the Constitution forbids to the states. By the mid 1970's, it had become accepted that the equal protection doctrine developed under the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to state laws applied equally to federal legislation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> 424 U.S. 1, 93, 96 S.Ct. 612, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976).<sup>[3]</sup> It was within this legal framework that <i>Harris</i> upheld the federal Hyde Amendment in 1980.</p>\n<p>The four-Justice majority in <i>Harris</i> first found that the Hyde Amendment did not itself \"impinge on a right or liberty protected by the [federal] Constitution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 322, 100 S.Ct. 2671. This was based on the conclusion, in addressing claims under the federal Due Process Clause, that although there is a federal constitutional right to elect an abortion under <i>Roe v. Wade</i><i>,</i> there is no federal constitutional right to receive funding for an abortion.</p>\n<p>Because no federal constitutional right was impinged, and indigent pregnant women were not a suspect class, the majority in <i>Harris</i> evaluated the federal equal protection claim under the standard taken from <i>McGowan v. Maryland,</i> 366 U.S. 420, 81 S.Ct. 1101, 6 L.Ed.2d 393 (1961): the classification must be sustained unless it \"rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate governmental] objective.\" <i>Harris,</i> 448 U.S. at 322, 100 S.Ct. 2671 (brackets in original). The majority recognized a legitimate governmental interest in protecting human life by \"subsidizing the medical expenses of indigent women who carry their pregnancies to term while not subsidizing the comparable expenses of women who undergo abortions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 325, 100 S.Ct. 2671. Accordingly, the <i>Harris</i> majority held that nothing in the federal equal protection doctrine prevents a state from refusing to fund medically necessary abortions for indigent women. The majority thus relied on the prevailing \"rationality\" test for federal equal protection: a legislative classification requires only \"a rational relationship to any legitimate governmental <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> interest.\" John E. Nowak &amp; Ronald D. Rotunda, <i>Constitutional Law</i> § 14.3, at 644 (6th ed. 2000).</p>\n<p>Four Justices dissented in <i>Harris,</i> taking the view that the Hyde Amendment and its consequent state implementations imposed an impermissible burden on the exercise of a woman's constitutionally protected right to choose. For that reason, some of the dissenters did not address the federal equal protection claims raised in that case. Justice Marshall, however, did find both due process and equal protection violations in a scheme that provides government funding for one choice, but not for the other, when the right to make that election is itself constitutionally protected. In addition to placing an impermissible burden on the exercise of a constitutionally protected right in violation of the federal Due Process Clause, Justice Marshall concluded that the classification effected by the statute did not pass the federal equal protection test formulated by the majority. In his view, the asserted governmental interestprotection of human lifewas not rational as that term is used in equal protection doctrine because it is, as a matter of federal constitutional law, subordinate to the individual women's \"interest in preserving their lives and health by obtaining medically necessary treatment.\" <i>Harris,</i> 448 U.S. at 346, 100 S.Ct. 2701.</p>\n<p>I agree that the <i>Harris</i> majority identified a legitimate governmental interest in promotion of human life. This is a factor supporting the policy found in both the federal Hyde Amendment and the Indiana statute at issue here. The state has a second valid consideration in its concern for public expenditures. The federal government has elected not to participate in funding of medical procedures to terminate these pregnancies. The result is the state bears all of any cost, not merely approximately thirty-eight percent. The parties cite various studies suggesting that funding abortion would have a financial impact of zero or even a positive effect on total federal and state Medicaid expenses. This conclusion is based on comparisons to the cost of delivering the child and bearing its subsequent health-care costs. Thus, the federal decision to deny benefits may indeed rely solely on social policy, not financial considerations. However on this record I cannot conclude that the State's claimed financial concerns are a sham. Evaluation of that factor is therefore a matter for the legislature. Given that the federal scheme embodied in the Hyde Amendment treats these pregnancies differently than it does all other medically necessary procedures, plaintiffs have not established that it is fiscally irrational for the state legislature to refuse to underwrite the entire expense rather than the sixty-two percent it bears for all other medical expenses. As the majority points out, the legislature is entitled to substantial deference in drawing lines where judgment is required in balancing competing interests. For both these reasons, I agree that under the rationality test adopted by the <i>Harris</i> majority, which requires only some minimal governmental interest in the absence of a suspect class or a directly infringed constitutional right, no federal equal protection violation is to be found. But both the analysis and the result are different under the Indiana Constitution.</p>\n<p>III. The Plaintiffs' Claim Under the Indiana Constitution</p>\n<p>The Indiana constitutional provision that the plaintiffs invoke is not equal protection, but rather the Equal Privileges Clause found in Article I, Section 23. It provides: \"The General Assembly shall not grant to any citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\" As <i>Collins</i> pointed out, Article <span class=\"star-pagination\">*269</span> I, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution is quite different in both its language and its meaning from the federal Equal Protection Clause whose doctrines governed the United States Supreme Court majority in <i>Harris.</i> By demanding that legislative privileges be dispensed \"equally\", and plainly applying to treatment of Indiana's own citizens, it also differs significantly from the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Equal Privileges Clause was found in the Indiana Constitution well before 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment introduced both the Equal Protection Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause into the United States Constitution. Some regarded the Privileges and Immunities Clause, not either the Equal Protection or Due Process Clause, to be the primary guarantor of individual rights against state intrusion. Nowak &amp; Rotunda, <i>Constitutional Law</i> § 14.1 at 632. The federal Privileges and Immunities Clause prohibits state laws that \"abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\" but makes no mention of \"equal\" treatment. <i>The Slaughter-House Cases,</i> 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36, 21 L.Ed. 394 (1872), promptly held this provision to apply only to state laws that discriminate in favor of their own citizens and against outsiders. Thus, the federal Privileges and Immunities Clause was rendered a dead letter as a limitation on a state's ability to restrict rights of its own citizens. That result was based in large part on the view that the Fourteenth Amendment \"was not intended to displace the critical role of the states as protectors of their own citizens.\" Lawrence H. Tribe, <i>Constitutional Law</i> § 14 at 10 (3d ed. 2000). Thus, for over a century,<sup>[4]</sup> the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Federal Constitution was thought to defer to its counterparts in state constitutions. It is the Indiana Equal Privileges Clause that is in issue here, and for the reasons explained below, I believe it requires more than either the Equal Protection Clause or the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the course of establishing its standard for constitutional legislative classifications under the Indiana Equal Privileges Clause, <i>Collins</i> explicitly rejected the federal equal protection approach of degrees of scrutiny. <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80. Rather, \"[t]he protections assured by Section 23 apply fully, equally, and without diminution to prohibit any and all improper grants of unequal privileges or immunities, including not only those grants involving suspect classes or impinging upon fundamental rights but other such grants as well.\" <i>Id.</i> at 80. Thus, all claims of unequal privilege are evaluated under the test described in Part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p>The method chosendenial of funding undoubtedly meets the requirement that the legislation be related to the goal of promoting human life. But I believe the legislation fails the <i>Collins</i> requirement that the classification be reasonably related to the legislative objectives. The plaintiffs point to other measures, such as denying scholarships at universities to women who elect abortions, that they contend might also be justified in the name of deterring abortions, if the State's Medicaid statutes are upheld. Although these hypothetical examples are not before us today, in general I think they raise the issue whether the disparate treatment is \"reasonably related\" to the defining characteristic, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*270</span> and not whether the class is defined by a permissible characteristic.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Collins,</i> as Justice Sullivan points out, the reasonableness of the relationship between the classification and the legislative objective turns on a balancing test. The woman's right under the Constitution of the United States to elect an abortion is established by <i>Roe v. Wade</i><i>,</i> irrespective of the origin of the pregnancy or whether her life is threatened by carrying the fetus to term. The U.S. Supreme Court in <i>Roe</i> held, \"the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\" <i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S. at 164-65, 93 S.Ct. 705. Thus, the right to choose is not absolute, but the interest of the State in promoting childbirth is constitutionally subordinate to the woman's right to choose to protect her life and her health. As explained above, under <i>Harris,</i> federal equal protection doctrine would permit the State to deny funding even if its interest promotion of human lifeis offset and outweighed by other interests as long as the legislation disadvantages no suspect classification and impinges no fundamental right. But the Indiana Constitution is rife with provisions asserting the primacy of individual rights. The 1851 Constitution, like its 1816 predecessor, begins with a Bill of Rights and only later turns to provisions establishing the branches of government. The Bill of Rights starts with Article 1, Section 1, which borrows from the Declaration of Independence in asserting rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. This emphasis on individual rights reflected the strong populist sentiment prevailing at the 1851 convention, which essentially carried out the agenda set in 1816. <i>See </i><i>Price v. State,</i> 622 N.E.2d 954, 962 n. 11 (Ind.1993). In the same vein, the Indiana Equal Privileges Clause elevates individual rights by requiring more than some recognized governmental interests before legislation can override the interests of the individual. Thus, under <i>Collins</i> a \"rational relationship to any legitimate governmental interest\" is not enough to carry the day. Under the balancing test of our state constitution, the governmental interests must outweigh those of the private citizen before a statute may deny a privilege granted to others. Under this standard, when faced with the federal constitutional right of a woman to choose to protect her health, the State's interests fail to carry that burden.</p>\n<p>This case presents a classic confrontation between individual rights and the will of the majority as reflected in legislation. The law at issue here affects only women who are indigent and desire a medically necessary procedure. The effect of the statute is to impose a financial penalty on a woman's election to exercise her constitutionally guaranteed right to choose. Of course, as a practical matter, this financial obstacle may result in delays that complicate the woman's medical condition, and often may force the result of a choice that is for the woman alone to make. The State thus seeks to impose its choice upon the woman to whom that decision is constitutionally reserved. By so choosing, the State seeks to prioritize the interest it advances over the woman's right to choose. Whether the State seeks to advance its interest by criminalizing abortions, as it no longer can do, or by creating legislation that penalizes the exercise of that right, either is, as a matter of constitutional priorities, an unreasonable balance. As such, this legislation imposes an unreasonable classification and is invalid under <i>Collins.</i></p>\n<p>Justice Sullivan concludes that indigent women whose pregnancy risks serious and permanent impairment of a major bodily <span class=\"star-pagination\">*271</span> function may not be denied Medicaid benefits. Those women are a subset of all indigents in need of medically necessary procedures. Accordingly, I concur in Part II of Justice Sullivan's opinion, though it does not grant all of the relief to which I believe the plaintiffs are entitled.</p>\n<p>RUCKER, J., concurs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Hyde Amendment has never had the status of permanent law but instead has been attached annually to legislation appropriating funds for certain departments of the federal government for a given fiscal year or has been adopted as a stand-alone joint resolution.

The trial court found, first, that one statute cannot save another found to be unconstitutional, and second, that the State does not strictly abide by the statute because the Indiana Medicaid program covers services for which federal financial participation is unavailable.</p>\n<p>The State also argued that the Separation of Functions clause of Art. III, § 1, of the Indiana Constitution barred the court from granting the relief that the plaintiffs requested. The trial court found that if the challenged enactments violate the state Constitution, the Court could grant relief even if doing so means that state funds will be spent in a manner not explicitly approved of by the Legislature. \"The Court has the power to shape appropriate remedies and the Legislature has a duty to appropriate funds to meet its constitutional obligations.\" (Supp. R. 12 (quoting <i>State v.

We believe the course of these proceedings effectively placed Ind.Code § 12-15-5-2 at issue.

However, I do not agree with the majority that \"this claim defines the class\" as that term is used in <i>McIntosh.</i> The issue in that case was whether the statute of repose in the Product Liability Act violated Article I, Section 23 by shutting off claims based on products in use over ten years before the event giving rise to the plaintiff's injury. In saying that the \"claim ... defines the class,\" <i>McIntosh</i> referred to the claim of the plaintiffs in the underlying product liability case, not to the claim of unconstitutionality.

The plaintiffs in this case argue, and the trial court held, that Medicaid must pay for any abortion that is medically necessary, citing the Indiana Constitution's requirement that privileges or immunities cannot be granted to a citizen or class of citizens that do not equally belong to all citizens on the same terms.</p>\n<p>For the reasons set forth in this opinion in part I under \"Discussion,\" I believe that this provision of the Indiana Constitution does not require Medicaid to pay for all abortions that are medically necessary. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*249</span> Chief Justice Shepard and Justice Dickson join in this part of this opinion.</p>\n<p>However, for the reasons set forth in this opinion in part II under \"Discussion,\" I also conclude that, so long as the Indiana Medicaid program pays for abortions to preserve the lives of pregnant women and where rape or incest cause pregnancy, it must also pay for abortions in cases of pregnancies that create for pregnant women serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. Justices Boehm and Rucker join in this part of this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Background</h2>\n<p>In 1965, Congress established the Medicaid program, a joint federal-state program that pays for some health care costs of low-income people, by amending Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-1396v. Under the Medicaid program, the federal government reimburses participating states for the health care services provided pursuant to the state's medical assistance or Medicaid plan. <i>Id.</i> at §§ 1396a(a)(10), 1396d(a). States are not required to participate in the Medicaid program but states that choose to participate must conform their Medicaid program to federal Medicaid law. <i>Id.</i> at § 1396a(a).</p>\n<p>In 1973, the Supreme Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protected, to a certain extent, the freedom of a woman to terminate a pregnancy. <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108713\"><a href=\"/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108713\"><a href=\"/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hyde, that prohibits the federal government from reimbursing states under the Medicaid program for abortions except where a woman would be placed \"in danger of death unless an abortion is performed\" or where \"the pregnancy is the result of an act of rape or incest.\" Pub.L. No. 106-113, §§ 508-509, 113 Stat. 1501, 1501A-274 (1999). Although the provisions of the Hyde Amendment have varied from time to time, this is the language of the prohibition and exception in effect today.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*250</span> In 1977, the Supreme Court held that the constitutional right to abortion recognized in <i>Roe v.

In 1980, the Supreme Court was faced with a challenge to the constitutionality of the Hyde Amendment, <i>i.e.,</i> whether Congress could prohibit the use of federal Medicaid funds to reimburse states for medically necessary abortions.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2671</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Indiana participates in the federal Medicaid program and is bound by all of its requirements. Ind.Code § 12-15-1-1. The Indiana Medicaid program provides low-income Hoosier citizens with virtually all non-experimental, medically necessary health care, including some services for which federal reimbursement is not available. <i>See e.g.,</i> Ind.Code § 12-15-5-1(18) (providing coverage for nonmedical nursing care given in accordance with tenants and practices of a recognized church); <i>cf.</i> 42 C.F.R. § 440.170(b) (restricting federal funding for such institutions to those organized pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code). Indiana Medicaid covers inpatient hospital services, physicians' services, and outpatient hospital or clinic services for all recipients and provides a full range of reproductive health care for Medicaid-eligible men. Ind.Code § 12-15-5-1. Covered services must be \"medically reasonable and necessary\" and are required to be provided to Medicaid recipients in a uniformly equitable manner. Ind.Code § 12-15-1-10. Indiana Medicaid defines a \"medically reasonable and necessary service\" as one that \"meets current professional standards commonly held to be applicable to the case.\" Ind. Admin. Code tit. 405, r. 5-2-17 (2001). However, in the case of abortion services, the program defines an abortion as necessary (and therefore covered under the program) only if \"performed to preserve the life of the pregnant woman or in other circumstances if the abortion is required to be covered by Medicaid under federal law,\" <i>e.g.,</i> where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest. Ind.Code § 12-15-5-1(17);<sup>[2]</sup> Ind.Code § 16-34-1-2;<sup>[3]</sup> Ind. Admin. Code tit. 405, r. 5-28-7.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*251</span> The plaintiffs in this case, Clinic for Women, Inc., Women's Pavilion, Inc., Ulrich G. Klopfer, D.O., and Martin Haskell, M.D., challenge the constitutionality of these two statutes and this regulation. The plaintiffs contend that the statutes' and regulation's collective prohibition on the use of state Medicaid funds to pay for abortions violates the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. I, § 23, as well as Art I, §§ 1 and 12, of the Indiana Constitution.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>After hearing oral argument of the parties, the trial court granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment and denied the state's cross-motion for summary judgment, ruling that the challenged statutes and regulation violated Art. I, § 23. The trial court did not address plaintiffs' Art. I, § 1 and 12, claims and they are not before us here.</p>\n<p>Article I, § 23, of the Indiana Constitution reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>The General Assembly shall not grant to any citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.</blockquote>\n<p>From at least 1971 until about nine years ago, this court analyzed claims under the state Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause using the same techniques as those employed by the United States Supreme Court to analyze claims under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Collins v. Day,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2149780\"><a href=\"/opinion/2149780/collins-v-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 75 (Ind.1994). In <i>Collins,</i> this court jettisoned the use of federal equal protection analytical methodology to claims alleging violations of Art. I, § 23, and held that such claims should be analyzed using a different standard. <i>Id.</i> That standard was summarized as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Article 1, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution imposes two requirements upon statutes that grant unequal privileges or immunities to differing classes of persons. First, the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes. Second, the preferential treatment must be uniformly applicable and equally available to all persons similarly situated. Finally, in determining whether a statute complies with or violates Section 23, courts must exercise substantial deference to legislative discretion.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 80. Indiana courts have made frequent use of the <i>Collins</i> standard since its promulgation, including the trial court here.</p>\n<p>The trial court found that the ban on funding abortions contained in the challenged statutes and regulation failed both prongs of the <i>Collins</i> standard summarized <i>supra.</i></p>\n<p>The first prong of the Collins test requires that \"where the Legislature singles <span class=\"star-pagination\">*252</span> out one person or class of persons to receive a privilege or immunity not equally provided to others, such classification must be based upon distinctive, inherent characteristics which rationally distinguish the unequally treated class, and the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to such distinguishing characteristics.\" <i>Id.</i> at 78-79. The trial court started its analysis of this prong with the proposition that the \"Medicaid program is a government program through which a benefitgovernment payment for medically necessary treatmentis provided to indigent Hoosiers.\" (Supp. R. 8.) \"However,\" the trial court continued, \"that benefit is not provided equally to all indigent Hoosierswomen who, for medical reasons, need to terminate their pregnancy in order to preserve and protect their health did not receive that funding benefit. Under the Indiana Medicaid program, indigent men and indigent pregnant women who need treatment (other than abortion) which is medically necessary to preserve their health are singled out for a benefit which is denied to indigent pregnant women needing to terminate their pregnancy to preserve and protect their health.\" (Supp. R. 8.)</p>\n<p>The second prong of the <i>Collins</i> analysis requires that the preferential treatment \"be uniformly applicable and equally available to all persons similarly situated.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80. Here the trial court found that \"[a]ll Medicaid-eligible pregnant women are similarly situated in that all may require, from time to time, an array of medically necessary treatment to protect and preserve their health.\" But, under the challenged Medicaid statutes and regulations, \"Medicaid coverage of needed medical services is not `uniformly applicable and equally available' to those similarly situated. Pregnant women who require a medically necessary abortion to preserve their health will not receive state funding while pregnant women who require other types of medically necessary treatment will receive state funding.\" (Supp. R. 9.)</p>\n<p>Under <i>Collins,</i> legislative discretion is accorded substantial deference. <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80-81. The trial court identified the State's interests claimed to be served by the challenged statutes and regulation as potential life, administrative simplicity, and cost containment. But it found these justifications insufficient.</p>\n<blockquote>[P]ursuing the goal of promoting fetal life at the expense of preserving the health of women who need to terminate their pregnancy for medical reasons contravenes the purpose of the Medicaid program, which is designed to enable indigent Hoosiers to obtain medically necessary treatment. The State's asserted interest in administrative simplicity and cost containment also do not justify the funding ban. First, the goal of achieving administrative simplicity in itself can never serve as a sufficient goal to justify depriving some citizens of privileges accorded others. Second, the goal of cost containment is also not reasonably related to the funding ban. Abortions are less expensive than the costs associated with childbirth. Moreover, preventing a Medicaid-eligible woman from terminating her pregnancy to protect and preserve her health will necessarily mean that she will have increased health problems that the Indiana Medicaid program must cover. Cost containment is not served by the funding ban and cannot be the basis to depriving some citizens of a privilege accorded others.</blockquote>\n<p>(Supp. R. 10.)</p>\n<p>The State appealed the judgment directly to our Court pursuant to Ind. Appellate</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*253</span> Rule 4(A)(1)(b).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Our Court has been informed in this matter by a substantial number of decisions from sister courts on similar claims under their respective state constitutions, including some with constitutional provisions the same as our Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause. Many of these are identified and discussed in an excellent law journal article, Melanie D. Price, <i>The Privacy Paradox: The Divergent Paths of the United States Supreme Court and State courts on the Issue of Sexuality,</i> 33 Ind. L.Rev. 863, 875-879 (2000).</p>\n<p>The Court also appreciates the assistance of amicus curiae Indiana Civil Liberties Union, Inc., Indiana Right to Life Committee, Inc., and twelve members of the Indiana General Assembly (Senators Frank Mrvan, Jr., Kent Adams, David C. Ford, Allie V. Craycraft, Jr., and R. Michael Young, and Representatives Gary L. Cook, Jeffrey A. Thompson, P. Eric Turner, James Russell Buck, Dennis K. Kruse, and Jerry L. Denbo), and their respective counsel.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Discussion</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I</h2>\n<p>The Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of Art. I, § 23, of the Indiana Constitution states, \"The General Assembly shall not grant to any citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\"</p>\n<blockquote>Article I, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution imposes two requirements upon statutes that grant unequal privileges or immunities to differing classes of persons. First, the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes. Second, the preferential treatment must be uniformly applicable and equally available to all person similarly situated.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80. In determining whether a statute complies with or violates this provision, the Court shows substantial deference to the discretion of the Legislature in attempting to \"balance the competing interest involved,\" and the Legislature's basis in creating the distinction. <i>Id.</i> To resolve conflicts between the state constitution and a challenged statute, this Court has stated that \"the better course is to construe or reconstrue the statute in such a way as to further the purpose of the legislature without offending the Indiana Constitution.\" <i>Van Dusen v. Stotts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2117017\"><a href=\"/opinion/2117017/van-dusen-v-stotts/\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">491</span></a></span>, 496 (Ind.1999).</p>\n<p>Under the first prong of the <i>Collins</i> test, any \"disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80.</p>\n<blockquote>Where the legislature singles out one person or class of persons to receive a privilege or immunity not equally provided to others, such classification must be based upon distinctive, inherent characteristics which rationally distinguish the unequally treated class, and the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to such distinguishing characteristics.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 78-79.</p>\n<p>Before we can determine whether the legislative classification under the first prong of <i>Collins</i> is permissible, we need to identify the legislative classification at issue. The parties here define the relevant <span class=\"star-pagination\">*254</span> classification differently. The plaintiffs contend (and the trial court agreed) that the legislative classification at issue places (1) \"indigent men and indigent women who need treatment (other than abortion) which is medically necessary to preserve their health\" into a class for which the necessary treatment is provided, and (2) \"indigent pregnant women needing to terminate their pregnancy to preserve and protect their health\" into a class for which the necessary treatment is not provided. (Supp. R. 8.) The State argues that the relevant classification is between (1) \"medically necessary services and supplies\" for which federal Medicaid reimbursement at some level is available (a class that includes abortions to save a woman's life and where pregnancy resulted from rape or incest) and (2) medically necessary services and supplies for which it is not (a class that includes all other medically necessary abortions). Br. of Appellants at 14.</p>\n<p>In <i>McIntosh v. Melroe Co</i><i>.,</i> Justice Boehm examined the way in which the legislative classification at issue in the first prong of <i>Collins</i> is to be determined:</p>\n<blockquote>Although <i>Collins</i> itself uses the word \"inherent\" to describe the characteristic that defines the class, this cannot be equated with \"innate\" characteristics of members of the class. The worker's compensation scheme [the statute at issue in <i>Collins],</i> like the Product Liability Act [the statute at issue in <i>McIntosh],</i> turns on the characteristics of the employers, not the injured workers. Similarly, under the Product Liability Act, everyone may potentially recover for an injury from a product not yet ten years old, and everyone injured from an older product is barred. It is the claim, not any innate characteristic of the person, that defines the class.</blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"853600\"><a href=\"/opinion/853600/mcintosh-v-melroe-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">972</span></a></span>, 981 (Ind.2000). We think the claim here, reduced to its essentials, is that some Medicaid-eligible pregnant women in Indiana are entitled to Medicaid-financed medically necessary abortions and others are not. We think this \"claim ... defines the class:\" (1) Medicaid-eligible pregnant women who seek to terminate their pregnancies in order to preserve their lives or where their pregnancies resulted from rape or incest are in a class where Medicaid pays for their abortions; and (2) Medicaid-eligible pregnant women who seek to terminate their pregnancies for any other medically necessary reason are in a class where Medicaid will not pay for their abortions. Although this formulation of the classification at issue differs somewhat from those advanced by the parties, we believe it sufficiently similar to each that their arguments against and in favor of the classifications retain their full force.</p>\n<p>As already discussed, in analyzing the constitutional permissibility of the classification identified, we \"accord considerable deference to the manner in which the legislature has balanced the competing interest involved.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80 (citing <i>Johnson v. St. Vincent Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">273</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ind.</span> <span class=\"page\">374</span></span>, 404-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2021966\"><a href=\"/opinion/2021966/johnson-v-st-vincent-hospital-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">585</span></a></span>, 604 (1980)). Indeed, we frequently recite that the challenger to the constitutionality of the legislative scheme bears the burden \"to negative every conceivable basis which might have supported the classification.\" <i>Johnson,</i> 273 Ind. at 392, 404 N.E.2d at 597. In <i>Collins,</i> we quoted from an earlier opinion of this Court in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote>Legislative classification becomes a judicial question only where the lines drawn appear arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable. So long as the classification is based upon substantial distinctions with reference to the subject matter, we will not substitute our judgment for that of the legislature; nor will we inquire into <span class=\"star-pagination\">*255</span> the legislative motives prompting such classification.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80 (quoting <i>Chaffin v. Nicosia,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">261</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ind.</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></span>, 701, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2030553\"><a href=\"/opinion/2030553/chaffin-v-nicosia/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">867</span></a></span>, 869 (1974)).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs contend that even this deferential standard of review is violated by the statutory and regulatory scheme challenged here. Calling the classification \"manifestly unreasonable,\" Br. of Appellees at 21, they argue that the</p>\n<blockquote>... classes of persons granted and denied the privilege are inherently the same in ways that relate directly to the subject matter of the Medicaid legislation: they are low-income, such that they meet the Medicaid eligibility requirements, and they seek medical care for which they have a medical need. What distinguishes between the two is that the members of the group denied the privilege have health conditions which cause them to need an abortion to preserve their health, while members of the class granted the privilege have health conditions which cause them to need medical care other than abortion to preserve their health. However, that difference does not relate to the subject matter of the Medicaid statutes. In fact, denying funding to a woman whose health will deteriorate if she does not have an abortion runs directly counter to the subject matter of the legislation.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 19.</p>\n<p>The State offers four justifications for the classification.</p>\n<p>First, the State argues that the unavailability of federal financial participation means that it would not be \"fiscally prudent and rational\" and that it would otherwise be \"administrative[ly] inconvenien[t]\" for the State to pay for abortions that are not eligible for federal reimbursement. Br. of Appellants at 14, 15.</p>\n<p>Second, the State argues that it has a \"valid and compelling\" interest in protecting fetal life, quoting from this court's decision in <i>Cheaney v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ind.</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span>, 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2252486\"><a href=\"/opinion/2252486/cheaney-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">265</span></a></span>, 270 (1972), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">189</span></span> (1973).<sup>[7]</sup> The State quotes from <i>Harris v. McRae</i> for support in pressing its point that \"limiting government funding for abortion is a rational means for indicating the government's interest in protecting fetal life.\" Br. of Appellants at 17 <i>(quoting </i><i>Harris,</i> 448 U.S. at 325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110333\"><a href=\"/opinion/110333/harris-v-mcrae/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2671</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>Third, in addition to the fiscal and administrative efficiency dimensions of the federal funding argument made <i>supra,</i> the State advances additional fiscal and administrative justifications for the classification. It argues that a more liberal system of government payments for abortion \"will result in more of that activity\" and \"may have a dramatic impact on the State's future tax base.\" Its broader point here is that the allocation of Medicaid spending is a fiscal policy determination for the legislative and executive branches. Br. of Appellants at 18-19.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs respond that the State should not be entitled to offer justifications for the classification extraneous to the purpose of the Medicaid program itself. \"If the State's position is accepted, the Legislature could insulate any discriminatory statute from constitutional challenge by simply claiming that it serves multiple purposes. Thus, the State could withhold any and all government benefits from women who have had abortions, irrespective of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*256</span> subject matter or goal of the statute at issue. For example, the State could grant free tuition to state universities to all its citizens except for those who have had an abortion, on the grounds that the statute furthers the State's interest in protecting fetal life.\" Br. of Appellees at 21.</p>\n<p>We appreciate the point plaintiffs make but think it only has force if our determination is binary. To the contrary, <i>Collins,</i> its precursors, and its progeny all indicate that we look at the Legislature's \"balancing of the competing interest involved.\" <i>See </i><i>American Legion Post No. 113 v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2032408\"><a href=\"/opinion/2032408/american-legion-post-113-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">656</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></a></span>, 1192 (Ind.Ct.App. 1995) <i>(citing </i><i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80 <i>(citing </i><i>Johnson,</i> 273 Ind. at 404-05, 404 N.E.2d at 604)), <i>trans. denied.</i></p>\n<p>In balancing the interests here, we have given careful attention to the evidence presented by the plaintiffs in the trial court demonstrating a number of different health risks faced by pregnant women with respect to which an abortion is medically necessary. In support of their motion for summary judgment, the plaintiffs submitted the affidavit of Dr. Jane Hodgson, a physician specializing in obstetrics and gynecology and an expert in the field. Dr. Hodgson testified that many women confront serious health risk when pregnant. Hypertension complicates about 8-10% of pregnancies. Hypertensive pregnant women are at a higher risk for cerebrovascular accidents (strokes), abruptio placentae (premature separation of the placenta from the uterus), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (a severe bleeding disorder). Dr. Hodgson further testified that pregnancy-induced diabetes occurs in approximately 1-3% of pregnancies. Women with preexisting diabetes have ten times the risk of pregnancy-related death than do non-diabetic women. Diabetes-associated retinopathy (eye disease) or nephropathy (kidney disease) often worsen significantly during pregnancy. Dr. Hodgson added that pregnancy jeopardizes the health of a woman with advanced coronary artery disease or severe impairment of the heart valve, and all pregnant women with heart disease have a higher risk of congestive heart failure, cardiac infections, and arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythms). The health of a pregnant woman is seriously impaired when she suffers from chronic renal failure, myasthenia gravis, or pulmonary embolism from a previous pregnancy. Pregnant women with lupus may experience aggravation of their disease.</p>\n<p>Dr. Hodgson also testified that pregnant women with sickle cell anemia experience more frequent and more severe crises, especially in bones, infections such as pneumonia and urinary tract infections, increasingly severe anemia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary complications such as embolus. Other conditions exacerbated by pregnancy include asthma, arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, gall bladder disease, liver disease, and epilepsy. Dr. Hodgson added that when cancer threatens a pregnant woman's life, the pregnancy puts further strain on the woman's health, and may require a suspension of cancer treatment because of harm to the fetus from such treatments. Thus, if treatment of the disease requires radiation or chemotherapy, a choice must be made between the health of the patient and the fetus, since these forms of therapy are likely to result in fetal malformation or death. Pregnancy may accelerate the condition of women with malignant breast tumors that are estrogen receptor positive. Dr. Hodgson's testimony was bolstered by the other affidavits submitted by the plaintiffs from Dr. Judith Belsky and Dr. William Mudd Haskell.</p>\n<p>The question for this Court is whether the Legislature may prohibit the State from paying for an abortion for a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*257</span> Medicaid-eligible pregnant woman facing any of these health risks while at the same time it authorizes the State to pay for an abortion to preserve the life of a Medicaid-eligible pregnant woman or where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest. We find the State's justifications of unavailability of federal financial participation, interest in protecting fetal life, fiscal policy, and administrative efficiency sufficient to sustain the constitutionality of the classification under the first prong of the <i>Collins</i> test. We are in no position to deny plaintiffs' argument that the statutes and regulation at issue impose significant financial, physical, and emotional hardship on many low-income Hoosier women. But we hold that the State's justifications for the classification do not rise to the level of being \"arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80 <i>(quoting </i><i>Chaffin,</i> 261 Ind. at 701, 310 N.E.2d at 869).</p>\n<p>The second prong of the <i>Collins</i> test requires that the \"privileged\" legislative classification \"be open to any and all persons who share the inherent characteristics which distinguish and justify the classification, with the special treatment accorded to any particular classification extended equally to all such persons.\" <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 79.</p>\n<p>The trial court found this aspect of <i>Collins</i> violated because \"[p]regnant women who require a medically necessary abortion to preserve their health will not receive state funding while those who require other types of medically necessary treatment will receive state funding.\" (Supp. R. 9.) We believe the State is correct when it responds that, because the plaintiffs \"challenge not the provision of Medicaid benefits to indigent people generally, but rather the deprivation of Medicaid benefits to some who seek abortions, it is clearer to frame the issue as whether that deprivation is uniformly applicable to all who share the inherent characteristics that justify the classification.\" Brief of Appellants at 23. We find the requirement of the second prong of <i>Collins</i> met because Medicaid will pay for abortions for all persons in the classification of Medicaid eligible pregnant women seeking to terminate their pregnancies to preserve their life or where the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II</h2>\n<p>A statute that is constitutional on its face may be unconstitutional as applied to a particular plaintiff. <i>See </i><i>Martin v.

For the reasons set forth below, we believe that the statute and regulations challenged here are unconstitutional as applied to Medicaid-eligible pregnant women whose pregnancies \"create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*258</span> Article I, § 23, of our Constitution prohibits a statute from providing disparate treatment to different classes of persons if the disparate treatment is not reasonably related to inherent characteristics that distinguish the unequally treated classes. <i>McIntosh,</i> 729 N.E.2d at 981; <i>Martin,</i> 711 N.E.2d at 1280; <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80. We believe that the characteristics that distinguish Medicaid-eligible pregnant women whose pregnancies create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function to be virtually indistinguishable from the characteristics of women for whose abortions the State does pay. To the extent there is a distinction, it is too insubstantial to be sustained by the State's justifications.</p>\n<p>The challenged statutory and regulatory scheme here provides disparate treatment to different classes of persons: Medicaid (1) will pay for abortions where necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman or where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest but (2) will not pay for any other abortions. Thus the Constitution requires that the disparate treatment be reasonably related to inherent characteristics that distinguish the \"preserve the life, rape, or incest\" classification from the \"any other abortions\" classification. Within this \"any other abortions\" classification is a subset consisting of abortions where the pregnancies create for Medicaid-eligible women a serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.</p>\n<p>The State's argument is that there are \"inherent characteristics ... reasonably related to permissible legislative goals\" that justify Medicaid-funded abortions where necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman or where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest. Br. of Appellants at 17. This is because \"[a]bortions in those circumstances raise problems and concerns that abortions in other circumstances do not.\" <i>Id.</i> Although it does not elaborate, the State says that these problems are the result of certain \"medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns\" that \"do not arise in other abortion cases.\" <i>Id.</i> at 18.</p>\n<p>That is, the State says that providing Medicaid-financed abortions is reasonably related to the \"inherent characteristics\" that distinguish the \"preserve the life, rape, or incest\" classification from the \"any other abortions\" classification (and, therefore, makes the distinction constitutionally permissible). Those inherent characteristics are the \"medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns\" raised by the \"preserve the life, rape, or incest\" classification that are not raised by the \"any other abortions\" classification.</p>\n<p>It is clear that the inherent characteristics of the \"preserve the life, rape, or incest\" classification do not require that the life of the pregnant woman be at stake. This classification includes abortions where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest where there is no inherent threat to life. But if the \"medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns\" that justify Medicaid-funded abortions do not <i>require</i> that the life of the pregnant woman be at stake, what are the inherent characteristics that distinguish the abortions permitted by the \"preserve the life, rape, or incest\" classification from cases where the pregnant woman faces substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function? The medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns are the same or at least the differences too insubstantial to be sustained by the State's justifications.</p>\n<p>The application of the challenged statute and regulations to pregnant women who face substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function is significant because the Legislature itself has identified it for special treatment in the State abortion control statute. For that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*259</span> purpose, the Legislature has treated in exactly the same way cases where the life of the pregnant woman is at stake and cases where the woman faces substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. Indiana law forbids an abortion to be performed in Indiana unless the pregnant woman consents following specified disclosures provided to her at least 18 hours before the abortion is performed. Ind.Code § 16-34-2-1.1. However, the Legislature has exempted from these disclosure and waiting period cases where \"the medical condition of a pregnant woman ... necessitates the immediate termination of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay would create <i>serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\"</i> Ind.Code §§ 16-18-2-223.5 (emphasis supplied) &amp; 16-34-2-1.1; <i>A Woman's Choice-East Side Women's Clinic v.

We find the challenged statute and regulations unconstitutional as applied to Medicaid-eligible women whose pregnancies create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. So long as the Indiana Medicaid program pays for abortions for Medicaid-eligible women where necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman or where the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest, we hold that it must pay for abortions for Medicaid-eligible women whose pregnancies create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>It is the judgment of the Court that the challenged Medicaid statutes and regulation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*260</span> do not violate the Equal Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Indiana Constitution and are, therefore, constitutional except that, so long as the Indiana Medicaid program pays for abortions to preserve the lives of pregnant women and where pregnancies are caused by rape or incest, it must also pay for abortions for Medicaid-eligible women whose pregnancies create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.

It is that the judiciary should defer to the lines drawn by the General Assembly and Governors Bowen and Bayh unless they are \"arbitrary or manifestly unreasonable.\" Op. at 257, citing <i>Collins v.

Sullivan opin. at 257.</p>\n<p>I believe it preferable, however, to address the specific classifications that were identified by the plaintiffs-appellees and trial court as receiving unequal treatment: (1) indigent men and women who need <span class=\"star-pagination\">*261</span> treatment (other than abortion) which is medically necessary to preserve their health, and (2) indigent pregnant women needing to terminate their pregnancy to preserve and protect their health but whose pregnancies do not threaten their lives and were not the result of rape or incest. These two asserted classifications do not contrast the persons entitled to receive Medicaid abortions with those ineligible. Rather, they compare the treatment received by persons entitled to Medicaid benefits provided for non-abortion medical services with those seeking Medicaid-funded abortions. These two classifications receive different treatment in that the medical services for the second are limited to exclude abortions except in narrow circumstances. This disparate treatment is clearly related to the inherent characteristic that distinguishes the unequally treated classes: namely, the medical treatment in the second classification, abortion, requires the termination of fetal life. The legislative decision to impose restrictions upon Medicaid-funded abortions is obviously and reasonably related to whether the medical services involve the termination of fetal life. Thus, even using the classifications identified by the trial court and the appellees, the Indiana Medicaid abortion restrictions do not violate Section 23.</p>\n<p>I dissent, however, from Part II and the Conclusion of the Court's opinion, which appears to condition the holding in Part I by judicially expanding Indiana's Medicaid abortion coverage to require the state to provide abortion benefits clearly not intended by the Indiana General Assembly.</p>\n<p>Under Part II, the Indiana Medicaid program must now begin paying for abortions for Medicaid-eligible women whose pregnancies create a \"serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function,\" even though the pregnancy does not present a threat to the woman's life. Sullivan opin. at 257. I believe that this conclusion and its rationale are erroneous.</p>\n<p>The majority in Part II of Justice Sullivan's opinion purports to apply <i>Collins</i> but does so only by framing and then comparing its own two \"classifications\" of Medicaid-eligible pregnant women: (1) those for whom abortions are necessary to preserve their lives or where their pregnancies were caused by rape and incest, and (2) those who seek abortions for all other reasons, particularly the subset consisting of pregnant women whose pregnancies present a serious, but not life-threatening, risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function. Having combined in a single classification both those abortions needed to preserve the life of a pregnant woman and those abortions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest, the majority in Part II then questions and dismisses the validity of the independent factors that reasonably relate to each sub-classification by observing that these factors are not applicable in common to both sub-classifications. Upon this highly questionable premise, the majority then declares that the factors supporting each sub-classification are the same or their differences \"too insubstantial\" to justify different treatment. With this rhetorical device, Part II disregards the protection of fetal life, and the medical, moral, social, and ethical concerns that properly distinguish and justify the restrictions on Medicaid abortions.</p>\n<p>Proper application of <i>Collins</i> to the majority's classifications would seem to require that the first one be separated into its two independent components: (a) pregnancies for which abortions are necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman, and (b) pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. As between those <span class=\"star-pagination\">*262</span> abortions necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman and the majority's \"substantial and irreversible impairment\" subclass, the access to Medicaid-funded abortions for the former is clearly and reasonably related to the inherent difference that distinguishes the classesthe risk of the woman's death without an abortion. It is the legislature's prerogative to balance its interest in preserving fetal life with its interest in not placing the mother at risk of death. Likewise, as between abortions in pregnancies resulting from rape or incest and those in the \"substantial and irreversible impairment\" subclass, the access to Medicaid-funded abortions for the former is obviously related to the inherent difference distinguishing the classeswhether the pregnancy was caused by criminal conduct. It is neither arbitrary nor manifestly unreasonable for the legislature to conclude that the medical, moral, social, and ethical implications of a compelled pregnancy under these circumstances outweighs the government's interest in the preservation of fetal life. Furthermore, as to both subclasses (\"risk of death\" and \"rape or incest\"), the access to Medicaid-funded abortions that are denied to the \"substantial and irreversible impairment\" classification is reasonably related to the fact that the federal government reimbursement is not available for the latter. Such fiscal considerations by the legislature are within the considerable legislative discretion accorded under <i>Collins.</i></p>\n<p>The legitimate reasons that separately justify the Medicaid program's funding for abortions needed to preserve a woman's life and its funding for abortions where the pregnancy results from rape or incest cannot be neutralized by declaring these two groups merged into the same classification, and then finding their independent separate justifications thereby inconsequential because they do not simultaneously apply to both \"risk of death\" and \"rape or incest\" abortions.</p>\n<p>Despite the requirement of <i>Collins</i> that we show substantial deference to the discretion of the legislature, the majority in Part II of Justice Sullivan's opinion disregards the clear and unequivocal language and intent of the Indiana General Assembly. Indiana Code section 16-34-1-2 explicitly declares: \"Neither the state nor any political subdivision of the state may make a payment from any fund under its control for the performance of an abortion unless the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman.\" The effect of Part II is to nullify this legislative limitation and to substantially expand the obligation of the Indiana Medicaid program to henceforth fund abortions for medical conditions that are not needed to save the mother's life.</p>\n<p>An examination of Indiana Code section 16-34 <i>et seq.</i> makes clear that the legislature clearly intended and articulated a deliberate distinction between the two classes of women. Some statutes use broader language that is not limited to situations in which a pregnant woman is at risk of death. For example, section 16-34-2-1(a)(3)(C) criminalizes abortion performed after viability of the fetus unless the abortion is \"necessary to prevent a substantial permanent impairment of the life <i>or physical health</i> of the pregnant woman.\" (emphasis added). Section 16-34-2-1.1 requires that certain information be given to a woman at least eighteen hours before an abortion <i>except in the case of a medical emergency,</i> which is defined in Indiana Code section 16-18-2-223.5 as a condition that \"necessitates the immediate termination of [a woman's] pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay would create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" Section 16-34-2-1.2 requires <span class=\"star-pagination\">*263</span> that an abortion provider inform a woman facing a medical emergency of the medical indications supporting the provider's judgment that an abortion is necessary to prevent the mother's death <i>or</i> \"a substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" Section 16-34-2-3(a) states that all abortions performed after viability shall be performed in a hospital having premature birth intensive care units unless compliance would result in \"an increased risk to the life <i>or health</i> of the mother.\" (emphasis added). Subsection (b) requires there to be in attendance a second physician who shall care for a child born alive as a result of an abortion unless \"compliance would result in an increased risk to the life <i>or health</i> of the mother.\" (emphasis added). In other statutes, however, it is clear that the legislature intended provisions or exceptions to apply <i>only</i> to women whose lives are in danger. Indiana Code section 16-34-2-1(a)(1)(B) states that, \"if in the judgment of the physician the abortion is <i>necessary to preserve the life</i> of the woman, her consent is not required.\" (emphasis added). Indiana Code section 16-34-2-1(b) prohibits partial birth abortions unless a physician reasonably believes that it is <i>necessary to save the woman's life</i> and no other medical procedure is sufficient.</p>\n<p>The fact that certain sections apply when a woman faces risk of death <i>or</i> impairment of a major bodily function, such as section 16-34-2-1.1, while other sections apply <i>only</i> when she faces risk of death, such as sections 16-34-2-1(b) and 16-34-1-2, indicates that the legislature's choice of language was precise and deliberate, demonstrating that the legislature intended to identify and treat differently these distinct classes of women with respect to the different statutory provisions.</p>\n<p>In Part II, the majority imports the language of its new definition from Indiana Code section 16-18-2-223.5. This provision does not address any term used in the statute restricting eligibility for taxpayer-funded abortions, I.C. § 16-34-1-2, but rather provides an exception to the informed consent requirements of Indiana's general abortion law in cases of \"medical emergency,\" which it defines as a condition that \"complicates the medical condition of a pregnant woman so that it necessitates the immediate termination of her pregnancy to avert her death or for which a delay would create serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function.\" I.C. § 16-18-2-223.5. In <i>A Woman's ChoiceEast Side Women's Clinic v. Newman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2015657\"><a href=\"/opinion/2015657/a-womans-choice-east-side-v-newman/\"><span class=\"volume\">671</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">104</span></a></span>, 109 (Ind.1996), this Court construed this \"medical emergency\" definition to permit a physician to dispense with the informed consent provisions whenever the doctor concluded that an abortion was medically necessary in the doctor's clinical judgment based on \"all relevant factors pertaining to a woman's health.\" By its importation of this language, the majority improperly scuttles the present restrictions in the Indiana Medicaid program's abortion coverage and appears to imply that Medicaid-eligible women may henceforth receive abortions at taxpayer expense in any case supported by the clinical judgment of a doctor based upon the woman's health factors, irrespective of whether she is at risk of death.</p>\n<p>The majority's alarming expansion of the coverage is exacerbated by the fact that it imposes upon Indiana's Medicaid program the requirement to fund not only abortions necessary to prevent substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function, but also abortions necessary to prevent even serious <i>risk</i> of the same. Plaintiffs claim in their brief that hypertension (high blood pressure) complicates approximately 8%10% of pregnancies, and that \"[a]lthough in most cases <span class=\"star-pagination\">*264</span> serious harm to health can be averted, hypertensive pregnant women are at higher <i>risk</i> for cerebrovascular accidents (strokes), abruptio placentae (premature separation of the placenta from the uterus), and disseminated intravascular coagulation (a severe bleeding disorder).\" Br. of Appellees at 5-6 (emphasis added). Plaintiffs also discuss the risks pregnancy can have on women with diabetes, including retinopathy (eye disease, including blindness) and nephropathy (kidney disease), a fourfold increase in the likelihood of pre-eclampsia or eclampsia and hypertensive diseases, and a tenfold increase in the risk of pregnancy-related death. Other conditions potentially necessitating abortion, according to the plaintiffs, are cancer that requires radiation or chemotherapy, and sickle cell anemia, which can cause \"severe crises (especially in bones), infections such as pneumonia[,] ... increasingly severe anemia, congestive heart failure, and pulmonary complications such as embolus.\" Br. of Appellees at 7. Plaintiffs admit that \"[w]hile these conditions may not always be life threatening, they <i>can</i> seriously and permanently compromise a woman's health.\" Br. of Appellees at 7 (emphasis added). Under Justice Sullivan's expanded definition, these conditions arguably may now warrant coverage under Indiana's Medicaid abortion coverage.</p>\n<p>Thus Justice Sullivan's opinion, while purporting in Part I to find the enacted limitations on Medicaid abortion coverage constitutionally valid, nevertheless in Part II has the effect of granting almost all the relief sought by the plaintiffs in this case. In judicially repealing the express legislative pronouncement that state and local government funds cannot be used to pay for any abortion unless necessary to preserve the mother's life, the majority establishes a potentially ever-expanding set of medical conditions that may be transformed into entitlements for state-funded abortions for which there will be no federal Medicaid reimbursement. This is blatantly contrary to the intentions of both the Indiana General Assembly that enacted Indiana Code section 16-34-1-2 and Governor Evan Bayh who signed the bill into law.</p>\n<p>For these reasons I dissent from Part II of Justice Sullivan's opinion. The fact that the Indiana Medicaid program does not pay for abortions in cases of \"pregnancies that create for pregnant women serious risk of substantial and irreversible impairment of a major bodily function\" does not render the challenged statute and regulations unconstitutional as applied.</p>\n<p>BOEHM, Justice, dissenting as to Part I.</p>\n<p>For the reasons given below, I respectfully dissent from Part I of the majority opinion. Twelve of the seventeen state courts that have considered the issue in published opinions have concluded that denial of benefits to indigent women for medically necessary abortions is a violation of their state constitution.<sup>[1]</sup> Under prevailing <span class=\"star-pagination\">*265</span> constitutional doctrine in this state, I would reach the same result.</p>\n<p>There is no doubt that a pregnant woman has the right to elect an abortion as set forth in <i>Roe v. Wade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108713\"><a href=\"/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108713\"><a href=\"/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span> (1973). There is no doubt that the State may elect to have a Medicaid program or not to have one. And there is no doubt that the State may elect to fund medical procedures for the indigent without providing the same benefit to all citizens. Finally, it is plain on the face of the Medicaid statute that by restricting abortion benefits to those necessary to prevent death of the mother or to terminate pregnancies generated by rape or incest, the Indiana Medicaid program seeks to provide different benefits for some abortions than it does for other \"medically necessary\" procedures.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs here posit their claim as a constitutionally impermissible distinction arising from Medicaid's refusal to fund medically necessary abortions for certain indigent women while providing benefits for all other indigents in need of medical treatment. The plaintiffs are entitled to frame their own complaint, so this different treatment is the issue presented in this case. Plaintiffs do not base their challenge on a comparison of funding for pregnancies arising from rape or incest or threatening the woman's life to funding for other abortions. It therefore seems to me that the Indiana constitutional issue presented by this case is simply stated: is it permissible under Article I, Section 23 for the State to provide funding for medically necessary treatment for indigents generally, but to refuse it for medically necessary abortions unless the mother's life is at stake or the pregnancy results from rape or incest? I conclude it is not, as to those pregnancies for which the federal constitution guarantees the woman the right to make the election to terminate her pregnancy.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Equal Privileges Under the Indiana Constitution</h2>\n<p>The plaintiff's constitutional challenge to this legislation is based solely on the Equal Privileges Clause found in Article I, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution. The test for constitutionality under that clause is established in <i>Collins v. Day,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2149780\"><a href=\"/opinion/2149780/collins-v-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">644</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span> (Ind.1994), and is accurately recited by the majority:</p>\n<blockquote>First, the disparate treatment accorded by the legislation must be reasonably related to inherent characteristics which distinguish the unequally treated classes. Second, the preferential treatment must be uniformly applicable and equally available to all persons similarly situated. Finally, in determining whether a statute complies with or violates Section 23, courts must exercise substantial deference to legislative discretion.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 80.</p>\n<p>Although the <i>Collins</i> formulation is often described as a \"two-pronged\" test, it really breaks down into three components because the first \"prong\" establishes two requirements: 1) the classification must be based on \"characteristics\" that \"rationally distinguish the unequally treated class\", and 2) the \"disparate treatment\" must be \"reasonably related\" to the characteristics that define the class. I think this means, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*266</span> in simple terms, that the class must be defined by a characteristic that is not arbitrary or otherwise impermissible and that the difference in legislative treatment must be reasonably related to the difference between the classes. The second \"prong\" of <i>Collins</i> imposes a third test: everyone who is in fact in the class (i.e., everyone who shares the defining characteristic) must be treated alike, and everyone who is not in the class must be treated alike. As we noted in <i>McIntosh v. Melroe Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"853600\"><a href=\"/opinion/853600/mcintosh-v-melroe-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">729</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">972</span></a></span> (Ind.2000), the \"characteristic\" that defines the legislative class is not necessarily innate (e.g., race, national origin). It may be a mutable characteristic that the same person may have as of a given time, but lack at others (e.g., people who are over age sixty-two can elect to receive Social Security benefits, but are ineligible before attaining that age; a corporation with seventy-five or fewer shareholders can elect to be taxed more or less as a partnership, but is ineligible with seventy-six shareholders). Or, as in <i>McIntosh,</i> the classification may be based on a sequence of events (persons injured by products in use for over ten years have no claim under the Product Liability Act).<sup>[2]</sup> And so on.</p>\n<p>Here the relevant characteristics defining the class generally entitled to Medicaid benefits are indigence and desire for a medically necessary treatment. In Section 23 terms, the Medicaid statute confers a privilege on those persons. The plaintiffs here are indigent and seek reimbursement for procedures that are \"medically necessary\" as that term is used in the Medicaid statute. The State refuses to pay because the requested medical treatment would terminate a pregnancy that is neither life endangering nor the result of rape or incest. Therefore, the defining characteristic of the classification of citizens this legislation draws is those women who are (1) requesting a medically necessary abortion and (2) otherwise eligible for Medicaid benefits but (3) whose pregnancy is neither life endangering nor a result of rape or incest. The result is that this legislation confers a privilege by providing benefits to indigents requiring medically necessary treatment, but withholds that privilege from poor women in need of medically necessary abortions to terminate a pregnancy that is neither life threatening nor originated by rape or incest. The statute thus sets up a scheme for funding abortions that is different from that for funding for all other medical treatment.</p>\n<p>II. Equal Protection Under the Federal Constitution</p>\n<p>In order to understand the higher standard demanded by the state constitution, it is important to review the basis of the holding that the federal constitution does not prevent the states from imposing this condition on funding for indigent medical care. In <i>Harris v. McRae,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110333\"><a href=\"/opinion/110333/harris-v-mcrae/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110333\"><a href=\"/opinion/110333/harris-v-mcrae/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">784</span></a></span> (1980), the United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*267</span> decision, established that federal equal protection doctrine did not prohibit the federal government from enacting a federal statute, the Hyde Amendment, that denies federal reimbursement for the procedures at issue here. In reaching that conclusion, the majority relied on prevailing federal equal protection doctrine. The only Equal Protection Clause in the federal constitution is found in the Fourteenth Amendment which imposes limitations on state legislation, but does not apply to federal statutes. Indeed, until 1954, it was accepted dogma that there was no equal protection doctrine applicable to federal legislation. Kenneth L. Karst, <i>The Fifth Amendment Guarantee of Equal Protection,</i> 55 N.C. L.Rev. 541, 542 (1971); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Detroit Bank v.

Because the District of Columbia was a federal enclave and not a state, the Fourteenth Amendment did not apply. The Supreme Court unanimously held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment required no less than the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, finding it \"unthinkable\" that the federal government could impose distinctions that the Constitution forbids to the states. By the mid 1970's, it had become accepted that the equal protection doctrine developed under the Fourteenth Amendment with respect to state laws applied equally to federal legislation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Buckley v. Valeo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 93, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109380\"><a href=\"/opinion/109380/buckley-v-valeo/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This was based on the conclusion, in addressing claims under the federal Due Process Clause, that although there is a federal constitutional right to elect an abortion under <i>Roe v. Wade</i><i>,</i> there is no federal constitutional right to receive funding for an abortion.</p>\n<p>Because no federal constitutional right was impinged, and indigent pregnant women were not a suspect class, the majority in <i>Harris</i> evaluated the federal equal protection claim under the standard taken from <i>McGowan v. Maryland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106249\"><a href=\"/opinion/106249/mcgowan-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">366</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106249\"><a href=\"/opinion/106249/mcgowan-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">393</span></a></span> (1961): the classification must be sustained unless it \"rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of [any legitimate governmental] objective.\" <i>Harris,</i> 448 U.S. at 322, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110333\"><a href=\"/opinion/110333/harris-v-mcrae/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2671</span></a></span> (brackets in original). The majority recognized a legitimate governmental interest in protecting human life by \"subsidizing the medical expenses of indigent women who carry their pregnancies to term while not subsidizing the comparable expenses of women who undergo abortions.\" <i>Id.</i> at 325, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110333\"><a href=\"/opinion/110333/harris-v-mcrae/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2671</span></a></span>. Accordingly, the <i>Harris</i> majority held that nothing in the federal equal protection doctrine prevents a state from refusing to fund medically necessary abortions for indigent women. The majority thus relied on the prevailing \"rationality\" test for federal equal protection: a legislative classification requires only \"a rational relationship to any legitimate governmental <span class=\"star-pagination\">*268</span> interest.\" John E. Nowak &amp; Ronald D. Rotunda, <i>Constitutional Law</i> § 14.3, at 644 (6th ed. 2000).</p>\n<p>Four Justices dissented in <i>Harris,</i> taking the view that the Hyde Amendment and its consequent state implementations imposed an impermissible burden on the exercise of a woman's constitutionally protected right to choose. For that reason, some of the dissenters did not address the federal equal protection claims raised in that case. Justice Marshall, however, did find both due process and equal protection violations in a scheme that provides government funding for one choice, but not for the other, when the right to make that election is itself constitutionally protected. In addition to placing an impermissible burden on the exercise of a constitutionally protected right in violation of the federal Due Process Clause, Justice Marshall concluded that the classification effected by the statute did not pass the federal equal protection test formulated by the majority. In his view, the asserted governmental interestprotection of human lifewas not rational as that term is used in equal protection doctrine because it is, as a matter of federal constitutional law, subordinate to the individual women's \"interest in preserving their lives and health by obtaining medically necessary treatment.\" <i>Harris,</i> 448 U.S. at 346, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2701</span></span>.</p>\n<p>I agree that the <i>Harris</i> majority identified a legitimate governmental interest in promotion of human life. This is a factor supporting the policy found in both the federal Hyde Amendment and the Indiana statute at issue here. The state has a second valid consideration in its concern for public expenditures. The federal government has elected not to participate in funding of medical procedures to terminate these pregnancies. The result is the state bears all of any cost, not merely approximately thirty-eight percent. The parties cite various studies suggesting that funding abortion would have a financial impact of zero or even a positive effect on total federal and state Medicaid expenses. This conclusion is based on comparisons to the cost of delivering the child and bearing its subsequent health-care costs. Thus, the federal decision to deny benefits may indeed rely solely on social policy, not financial considerations. However on this record I cannot conclude that the State's claimed financial concerns are a sham. Evaluation of that factor is therefore a matter for the legislature. Given that the federal scheme embodied in the Hyde Amendment treats these pregnancies differently than it does all other medically necessary procedures, plaintiffs have not established that it is fiscally irrational for the state legislature to refuse to underwrite the entire expense rather than the sixty-two percent it bears for all other medical expenses. As the majority points out, the legislature is entitled to substantial deference in drawing lines where judgment is required in balancing competing interests. For both these reasons, I agree that under the rationality test adopted by the <i>Harris</i> majority, which requires only some minimal governmental interest in the absence of a suspect class or a directly infringed constitutional right, no federal equal protection violation is to be found. But both the analysis and the result are different under the Indiana Constitution.</p>\n<p>III. The Plaintiffs' Claim Under the Indiana Constitution</p>\n<p>The Indiana constitutional provision that the plaintiffs invoke is not equal protection, but rather the Equal Privileges Clause found in Article I, Section 23. It provides: \"The General Assembly shall not grant to any citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities, which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens.\" As <i>Collins</i> pointed out, Article <span class=\"star-pagination\">*269</span> I, Section 23 of the Indiana Constitution is quite different in both its language and its meaning from the federal Equal Protection Clause whose doctrines governed the United States Supreme Court majority in <i>Harris.</i> By demanding that legislative privileges be dispensed \"equally\", and plainly applying to treatment of Indiana's own citizens, it also differs significantly from the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Equal Privileges Clause was found in the Indiana Constitution well before 1868 when the Fourteenth Amendment introduced both the Equal Protection Clause and the Privileges and Immunities Clause into the United States Constitution. Some regarded the Privileges and Immunities Clause, not either the Equal Protection or Due Process Clause, to be the primary guarantor of individual rights against state intrusion. Nowak &amp; Rotunda, <i>Constitutional Law</i> § 14.1 at 632. The federal Privileges and Immunities Clause prohibits state laws that \"abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States\" but makes no mention of \"equal\" treatment. <i>The Slaughter-House Cases,</i> 83 U.S. (16 Wall.) 36, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">394</span></span> (1872), promptly held this provision to apply only to state laws that discriminate in favor of their own citizens and against outsiders. Thus, the federal Privileges and Immunities Clause was rendered a dead letter as a limitation on a state's ability to restrict rights of its own citizens. That result was based in large part on the view that the Fourteenth Amendment \"was not intended to displace the critical role of the states as protectors of their own citizens.\" Lawrence H. Tribe, <i>Constitutional Law</i> § 14 at 10 (3d ed. 2000). Thus, for over a century,<sup>[4]</sup> the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Federal Constitution was thought to defer to its counterparts in state constitutions. It is the Indiana Equal Privileges Clause that is in issue here, and for the reasons explained below, I believe it requires more than either the Equal Protection Clause or the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In the course of establishing its standard for constitutional legislative classifications under the Indiana Equal Privileges Clause, <i>Collins</i> explicitly rejected the federal equal protection approach of degrees of scrutiny. <i>Collins,</i> 644 N.E.2d at 80. Rather, \"[t]he protections assured by Section 23 apply fully, equally, and without diminution to prohibit any and all improper grants of unequal privileges or immunities, including not only those grants involving suspect classes or impinging upon fundamental rights but other such grants as well.\" <i>Id.</i> at 80. Thus, all claims of unequal privilege are evaluated under the test described in Part I of this opinion.</p>\n<p>The method chosendenial of funding undoubtedly meets the requirement that the legislation be related to the goal of promoting human life. But I believe the legislation fails the <i>Collins</i> requirement that the classification be reasonably related to the legislative objectives. The plaintiffs point to other measures, such as denying scholarships at universities to women who elect abortions, that they contend might also be justified in the name of deterring abortions, if the State's Medicaid statutes are upheld. Although these hypothetical examples are not before us today, in general I think they raise the issue whether the disparate treatment is \"reasonably related\" to the defining characteristic, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*270</span> and not whether the class is defined by a permissible characteristic.</p>\n<p>Under <i>Collins,</i> as Justice Sullivan points out, the reasonableness of the relationship between the classification and the legislative objective turns on a balancing test. The woman's right under the Constitution of the United States to elect an abortion is established by <i>Roe v. Wade</i><i>,</i> irrespective of the origin of the pregnancy or whether her life is threatened by carrying the fetus to term. The U.S. Supreme Court in <i>Roe</i> held, \"the State in promoting its interest in the potentiality of human life may, if it chooses, regulate, and even proscribe, abortion except where it is necessary, in appropriate medical judgment, for the preservation of the life or health of the mother.\" <i>Roe,</i> 410 U.S. at 164-65, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108713\"><a href=\"/opinion/108713/roe-v-wade/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span>. Thus, the right to choose is not absolute, but the interest of the State in promoting childbirth is constitutionally subordinate to the woman's right to choose to protect her life and her health. As explained above, under <i>Harris,</i> federal equal protection doctrine would permit the State to deny funding even if its interest promotion of human lifeis offset and outweighed by other interests as long as the legislation disadvantages no suspect classification and impinges no fundamental right. But the Indiana Constitution is rife with provisions asserting the primacy of individual rights. The 1851 Constitution, like its 1816 predecessor, begins with a Bill of Rights and only later turns to provisions establishing the branches of government. The Bill of Rights starts with Article 1, Section 1, which borrows from the Declaration of Independence in asserting rights to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness. This emphasis on individual rights reflected the strong populist sentiment prevailing at the 1851 convention, which essentially carried out the agenda set in 1816. <i>See </i><i>Price v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2101520\"><a href=\"/opinion/2101520/price-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">622</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span>, 962 n. 11 (Ind.1993). In the same vein, the Indiana Equal Privileges Clause elevates individual rights by requiring more than some recognized governmental interests before legislation can override the interests of the individual. Thus, under <i>Collins</i> a \"rational relationship to any legitimate governmental interest\" is not enough to carry the day. Under the balancing test of our state constitution, the governmental interests must outweigh those of the private citizen before a statute may deny a privilege granted to others. Under this standard, when faced with the federal constitutional right of a woman to choose to protect her health, the State's interests fail to carry that burden.</p>\n<p>This case presents a classic confrontation between individual rights and the will of the majority as reflected in legislation. The law at issue here affects only women who are indigent and desire a medically necessary procedure. The effect of the statute is to impose a financial penalty on a woman's election to exercise her constitutionally guaranteed right to choose. Of course, as a practical matter, this financial obstacle may result in delays that complicate the woman's medical condition, and often may force the result of a choice that is for the woman alone to make. The State thus seeks to impose its choice upon the woman to whom that decision is constitutionally reserved. By so choosing, the State seeks to prioritize the interest it advances over the woman's right to choose. Whether the State seeks to advance its interest by criminalizing abortions, as it no longer can do, or by creating legislation that penalizes the exercise of that right, either is, as a matter of constitutional priorities, an unreasonable balance. As such, this legislation imposes an unreasonable classification and is invalid under <i>Collins.</i></p>\n<p>Justice Sullivan concludes that indigent women whose pregnancy risks serious and permanent impairment of a major bodily <span class=\"star-pagination\">*271</span> function may not be denied Medicaid benefits. Those women are a subset of all indigents in need of medically necessary procedures. Accordingly, I concur in Part II of Justice Sullivan's opinion, though it does not grant all of the relief to which I believe the plaintiffs are entitled.</p>\n<p>RUCKER, J., concurs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The Hyde Amendment has never had the status of permanent law but instead has been attached annually to legislation appropriating funds for certain departments of the federal government for a given fiscal year or has been adopted as a stand-alone joint resolution.

The trial court found, first, that one statute cannot save another found to be unconstitutional, and second, that the State does not strictly abide by the statute because the Indiana Medicaid program covers services for which federal financial participation is unavailable.</p>\n<p>The State also argued that the Separation of Functions clause of Art. III, § 1, of the Indiana Constitution barred the court from granting the relief that the plaintiffs requested. The trial court found that if the challenged enactments violate the state Constitution, the Court could grant relief even if doing so means that state funds will be spent in a manner not explicitly approved of by the Legislature. \"The Court has the power to shape appropriate remedies and the Legislature has a duty to appropriate funds to meet its constitutional obligations.\" (Supp. R. 12 (quoting <i>State v.

However, I do not agree with the majority that \"this claim defines the class\" as that term is used in <i>McIntosh.</i> The issue in that case was whether the statute of repose in the Product Liability Act violated Article I, Section 23 by shutting off claims based on products in use over ten years before the event giving rise to the plaintiff's injury. In saying that the \"claim ... defines the class,\" <i>McIntosh</i> referred to the claim of the plaintiffs in the underlying product liability case, not to the claim of unconstitutionality. In other words, the claim that defined the class was the claim that the plaintiff was injured by a product more than ten years old, not the claim that the statute of repose violated the Indiana Constitution.</p>\n<p>[3]  For an account of this journey, which includes a few detours, see generally <i>Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.
