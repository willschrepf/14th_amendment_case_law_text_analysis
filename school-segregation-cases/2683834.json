For clarity and in accordance with\n\fthe parties’ conventions, we will refer to Power Reps, Inc., as “PRI” and to Global\n\nTransformer Specialists as “GTS.” We will refer to Power Reps Industrial, LLC,\n\nalso known as Cy Cates Energy Reps, LLC, as “Industrial.” Cates, Industrial, and\n\nGTS cross-appeal.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI assert 11 issues on appeal: (1) the trial court erred\n\nby asking the jury whether a document signed on April 12, 2010, was an\n\nagreement, rather than ruling on that issue as a matter of law; (2) the trial court\n\nerred by failing to award Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI damages for Cates’s breach of\n\nthe April 12 “agreement,” despite the fact that the jury was not asked about such\n\ndamages; (3) there was no or insufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict that\n\nBergin and Jacquin were fiduciaries of Cates; (4) there was no or insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s damages findings with respect to Cates’s claim for\n\ntortious interference with prospective contracts; (5) the trial court erred in\n\nawarding damages on the commission split and rent agreement because any such\n\nagreement was subsumed in the April 12 “agreement”; (6) there was no or\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict that PRI converted Cates’s\n\nproperty; (7) there was no or insufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict that\n\nBergin and Jacquin engaged in oppressive conduct towards Cates; (8) the\n\nattorney’s fees awarded to Cates, Industrial, and GTS by the jury were\n\nunreasonable and excessive, not properly segregated, and not recoverable because\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fCates did not prevail on any claim for which fees are recoverable; (9) the trial court\n\nshould have disregarded the jury’s verdict that PRI was not damaged by Cates’s\n\nbreach of his employment agreement and therefore should have awarded Bergin,\n\nJacquin, and PRI their attorney’s fees; (10) the trial court erred in awarding Cates\n\nownership and control of the PRIHouston.com domain, website, and email\n\naddresses; and (11) the trial court erred by awarding Cates, Industrial, and GTS\n\nprejudgment interest on the jury’s “net” award, inclusive of both damages and\n\nattorney’s fees, and by awarding interest on the awards against Bergin and Jacquin\n\nindividually.\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS respond that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI waived\n\ntheir issues 1 through 3, 5, and 7 through 10; that all 11 issues lack merit; and that,\n\neven if Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI could demonstrate error, they have not\n\ndemonstrated reversible error with respect to any issue.          See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 44.1(a)(1).\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS also raise two issues on their cross-appeal: (1) the\n\ntrial court erred as a matter of law by failing to award Cates the damages found by\n\nthe jury for Bergin and Jacquin’s breach of the April 12 agreement because Cates’s\n\nbreach did not excuse performance by Bergin and Jacquin; and (2) the trial court\n\nerred by refusing to award as costs of court the cost of the accounting expert\n\nretained by Cates, Industrial, and GTS and the cost of the discovery special master.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for the trial court to\n\nrecalculate the correct amounts of prejudgment interest and any offsets between\n\nawards.\n\n                                    Background\n\nA.    Bergin, Jacquin, and Cates do business together\n\n      This case arises from a falling-out between Bergin and Jacquin on the one\n\nside and Cates on the other side over the management of Power Reps, Inc. PRI, a\n\nclosely-held Texas corporation, operates as an independent sales representative for\n\na number of manufacturers and distributing companies that sell electrical\n\nequipment, parts, and accessories. PRI has two general categories of customers or\n\nclients, which it classifies as “utility” or “industrial,” depending on the business of\n\nthat customer or client and the type of customers or clients that it, in turn, serves.\n\nWithin the “utility” classification, PRI serves two subtypes of customers:\n\n(1) “public power” companies, including cooperatives and municipal utilities, and\n\n(2) investor-owned utility companies.\n\n      PRI has three principal shareholders and officers, each of whom works as a\n\nsales representative. Bergin, an original shareholder, serves as PRI’s president and\n\nhandles primarily “public power” accounts. Cates, another original shareholder, is\n\na vice president and serves primarily “industrial” accounts. Jacquin became a\n\nshareholder when his company merged with PRI approximately 10 years ago; he is\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fa vice president and serves primarily investor-owned utility accounts. The only\n\nother shareholder, Robert E. Bergin, Sr., is retired and inactive in the corporation’s\n\naffairs. Cates was assisted in his work by another PRI employee, Celine Wilson.\n\n      By convention, commissions received by PRI were divided as follows:\n\napproximately 70% of each commission went to the salesman or team that\n\ngenerated the sale, and the remainder went to PRI for overhead. At least one\n\ndocument indicates that Bergin, Jacquin, and Cates discussed fixing the split at\n\nprecisely 70-30 from December 2009 forward, although it does not indicate that\n\nthey reached an actual agreement. 1\n\n      Cates also owned and controlled Global Transformer Specialists, a company\n\nthat offered accessories for the types of equipment that PRI sold. 2 Cates was the\n\nsole owner, officer, director, and bank signatory of GTS. According to Jacquin,\n\nCates, at his own discretion, used PRI funds to meet GTS’s needs and used GTS\n\nfunds to meet PRI’s needs.\n\n1\n      Cates, GTS, and Industrial argue that this document constitutes a formal\n      agreement. But the document in question, an email from Bergin to Jacquin\n      and Cates, specifically identifies the 70-30 split as an “item[] that need[s] to\n      be voted on.” There is no indication in that document that PRI’s principals\n      ever voted to formalize the division of commissions.\n2\n      Although GTS is a party to the suit and a named appellee and cross-\n      appellant, none of the parties’ briefs in this Court identifies GTS, explains its\n      origins, or meaningfully explains its relevance to the claims, counterclaims,\n      or defenses raised in this case. The facts herein are therefore drawn from\n      our own review of the record.\n\n\n                                          5\n\fB.    The shareholders negotiate their disagreements\n\n      In 2009, PRI found itself unable to make its full payroll on several\n\noccasions. Bergin and Jacquin came to believe that the blame for the shortfalls in\n\nPRI’s finances lay with Cates. Specifically, they believed that Cates was misusing\n\ncorporate funds and engaging in undisclosed deals with PRI clients, both through\n\nGTS and otherwise.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and Cates attempted to resolve their differences by\n\nnegotiating a spin-off of the “industrial” component of PRI’s business, to be run by\n\nCates. To that end, they exchanged a series of emails in late March 2010. Cates\n\ndrafted the first email, proposing “[m]y idea of this spin-off” and suggesting terms\n\nfor a sale of his PRI shares to PRI, payment of PRI debts, allocation of expenses\n\nand income, allocation of clients, separation of the corporate data into two sets, and\n\nother terms. Bergin responded, interspersing his own comments amongst Cates’s\n\nstatements, distinguishing them by typing them in an orange font. Cates replied,\n\ninterspersing additional comments among the existing statements, this time in a\n\nbold font. On April 12, 2010, Cates, Bergin, and Jacquin each signed their names\n\nto a printed copy of this email chain.\n\n      At first, Bergin, Jacquin, and Cates apparently treated the April 12 document\n\nas reflecting an agreement among the three of them and began taking actions to\n\ndivide PRI’s existing business between PRI and a new entity to be operated by\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fCates. Cates formed a new entity, Power Reps Industrial, LLC, in April 2010 and\n\nregistered the internet domain name PRIHouston.com in August 2010.\n\n      It soon became clear, however, that the parties did not agree on the terms of\n\ntheir agreement. For example, Cates paid for the domain name PRIHouston.com\n\nand stated that he intended to use it for Industrial, although Bergin and Jacquin saw\n\nthe initials “PRI” as capable of referring only to Power Reps, Inc., such that the\n\ndomain name would cause confusion. In addition, Cates interpreted the document\n\nas requiring Bergin and Jacquin to form their own entity, Power Reps Utility, but\n\nBergin and Jacquin did not do so and disputed that they had an obligation to do so.\n\nIn fact, Bergin and Jacquin maintain that the April 12 document had no binding\n\neffect, while Cates maintains that it constitutes an enforceable agreement. Despite\n\nthese disagreements—and despite Bergin and Jacquin’s insistence that the April 12\n\ndocument was not a contract—Bergin and Jacquin, on one side, and Cates, on the\n\nother, each concluded that the other side had breached obligations set forth in the\n\nApril 12 document.\n\n      Meanwhile, when Cates created Industrial, he hired Wilson, who had\n\nworked with him at PRI, as an Industrial employee. Wilson began working for\n\nIndustrial in April or May 2010. She resigned, however, in September 2010 and\n\nreturned to PRI shortly thereafter. According to Cates, when Wilson left, she took\n\nIndustrial property with her, including office equipment and confidential\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\finformation. According to Wilson, however, the property in question all belonged\n\nto PRI.\n\nC.    PRI files suit\n\n      In September 2010, PRI filed suit against Cates, Industrial, and GTS,\n\nalleging breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conversion, conspiracy to defraud PRI,\n\ndeceptive trade practices, and against Cates individually for breach of an\n\nemployment contract with PRI. Cates, Industrial, and GTS countersued PRI and\n\nsued as third-party defendants Bergin, Jacquin, and Wilson, alleging breach of\n\ncontract based on the April 12 document, breach of fiduciary duty, shareholder\n\noppression, conversion, a claim under the Texas Theft Liability Act, tortious\n\ninterference with prospective and existing contracts, and an equitable claim to the\n\nPRIHouston.com domain name and associated email accounts, among other causes\n\nof action.\n\nD.    The case proceeds to trial\n\n      During discovery, the parties disagreed over the production of certain\n\nemails, leading Cates, Industrial, and GTS to file a motion to compel discovery and\n\nresulting in the trial court’s appointment of a special discovery master. The parties\n\nalso each retained a forensic accountant to determine the balances, if any, due from\n\neach party to each other party. Pursuant to an agreed order, the parties agreed that\n\nthe accountants would produce a joint report and that the accountants’ fees would\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\fbe treated as costs of court. In a subsequent Rule 11 agreement, they agreed that\n\nthe accountants would produce a second, supplemental report and that the\n\naccountants’ costs would be “total, then split equally between the parties.”\n\n      In April 2013, after a five-week trial, the trial court presented 60 questions to\n\nthe jury. Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI made no objections to the jury charge. Cates,\n\nIndustrial, and GTS objected to the submission of jury Questions 56 through 59,\n\nregarding an employment agreement between PRI and Cates, on the ground that no\n\nevidence showed the existence of such an agreement.\n\n      The first question in the charge asked, “Do you find that the writing of April\n\n12, 2010 constituted an agreement whereby Cy Cates, Bob Bergin, and Jeff\n\nJacquin agreed to divide the business of Power Reps, Inc.?” If the jury answered\n\nthat the document was an agreement, Questions 2 through 5 asked the jury to\n\ndetermine whether Bergin, Jacquin, or Cates breached the agreement (Question 2),\n\nwho breached first (Question 3), whether any breach by Cates was excused\n\n(Question 4), and the amount of damages to Cates, Industrial, and GTS for any\n\nbreach by Bergin or Jacquin (Question 5). Question 55 asked,\n\n      Do you find that the April 12, 2010 agreement, if any, permitted Cy\n      Cates to operate and market his business as Power Reps Industrial\n      (now Cy Cates Energy Reps, LLC) and Cy Cates purchased the\n      internet domain “PRIHouston.com” and developed the website with\n      Cy [Cates’s] funds in furtherance of that agreement[?]\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      In response to jury Questions 1 through 3, the jury found that the April 12\n\ndocument was an agreement, that Bergin, Cates, and Jacquin each breached that\n\nagreement, and that Cates breached it first. It then found, in response to jury\n\nQuestions 4 and 5, that Cates’s breach was not excused, but that Cates, Industrial,\n\nand GTS were damaged in the amount of $283,000 by Bergin and Jacquin’s\n\nsubsequent breach of the agreement. It also found, in response to Questions 6\n\nthrough 12, that Cates breached fiduciary duties that he owed to PRI, but Bergin\n\nand Jacquin, in turn, breached fiduciary duties that they owed to Cates.        In\n\nresponse to Question 55, the jury found that the April 12, 2010 agreement\n\n“permitted” Cates to operate and market his business as Power Reps Industrial and\n\nthat Cates purchased and developed the PRIHouston.com domain name with his\n\nown funds in furtherance of that agreement.\n\n      The jury further found, in response to Questions 16–28, 34–43, 46–51, and\n\n56–59, that PRI tortiously interfered with prospective and existing contracts of\n\nCates, Industrial, and GTS (Questions 16–21); PRI defamed and disparaged Cates,\n\nIndustrial, and GTS (Questions 22–28); PRI stole and converted property of Cates,\n\nIndustrial, or GTS (Questions 34–37); Bergin and Jacquin engaged in oppressive\n\nconduct against Cates (Questions 38–40); PRI defrauded Cates, Industrial, or GTS\n\n(Questions 41–43); Cates defrauded PRI (Questions 48–49); Cates converted\n\nproperty of PRI (Questions 50–51); PRI breached an agreement regarding\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\fdistribution of commissions and payment of rent (Questions 46–47); and Cates\n\nbreached an employment agreement with PRI (Questions 56–59). It also found, in\n\nresponse to Questions 54 and 60, amounts certain of attorney’s fees for both\n\ngroups of parties.\n\nE.    The parties’ post-trial motions\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI filed 16 motions for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict, each of which the trial court denied. Cates, Industrial, and GTS also filed\n\na motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the trial court denied.\n\nCates, Industrial, and GTS also asked the trial court to award to them as costs of\n\ncourt the fees of their accounting expert and costs related to the discovery master,\n\nbut the trial court refused to do so.\n\n      The trial court entered judgment on the jury’s verdict, but declined to award\n\ndamages to Cates, Industrial, and GTS for breach of the April 12 agreement on the\n\nground that Cates breached the agreement first. Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI then\n\nmoved for a new trial and, while that motion was pending, filed a notice of appeal.\n\nThe trial court subsequently entered an amended final judgment, modifying the\n\napplication of prejudgment interest. Cates, Industrial, and GTS then filed their\n\nown notice of appeal. Subsequently, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI amended their\n\nmotion for new trial, which was overruled by operation of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f                  Immaterial Question: The April 12 Document\n\n      In their first issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue that the April 12\n\ndocument is unenforceable as a matter of law and that the trial court therefore erred\n\nin submitting a jury question asking whether the document was an agreement. The\n\nfirst question posed to the jury asked whether “the writing of April 12, 2010\n\nconstituted an agreement.” Instead of submitting this question, Bergin, Jacquin,\n\nand PRI argue, the trial court should have ruled as a matter of law that the April 12\n\ndocument was not a contract or, at most, an unenforceable “agreement to agree.”\n\nAs support, they point to the document’s express statement that “[a] letter of intent\n\nis necessary to proceed,” as well as various terms that the document states “will\n\nhave to be discussed,” that the parties “will need to discuss,” or that are simply\n\nunclear. In the alternative, if the document is an enforceable agreement, they argue\n\nin their second issue that the trial court erred in refusing to make a finding as to\n\ntheir damages from Cates’s breach of the agreement.\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS respond that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI waived\n\ntheir first argument—that the document is not an enforceable agreement and that\n\nthe trial court erred in submitting the issue to the jury—by failing to raise it during\n\nthe jury charge conference. They also argue that whether the document is a\n\ncontract is a fact issue for the jury. Finally, Cates, Industrial, and GTS respond\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fthat the trial court properly rejected Bergin and Jacquin’s request for a damages\n\naward because no question on those damages was submitted to the jury.\n\nA.    Immateriality of jury finding on enforceability of contract\n\n      “Whether parties intend to make a contractual agreement is usually a\n\nquestion of fact.” Chapman v. Mitsui Eng’g & Shipbuilding Co., Ltd., 781 S.W.2d\n\n312, 316 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1989, writ denied); see Scott v. Ingle\n\nBros. Pac. Inc., 489 S.W.2d 554, 556 (Tex. 1972); Henry C. Beck Co. v. Arcrete,\n\nInc., 515 S.W.2d 712, 716 (Tex. Civ. App.—Dallas 1974, writ dism’d). “But\n\nwhether a particular agreement constitutes a valid contract is generally a legal\n\ndetermination that the court must make.” Chapman, 781 S.W.2d at 316; see Lone\n\nStar Steel Co. v. Scott, 759 S.W.2d 144, 156–157 (Tex. App.—Texarkana 1988,\n\nwrit denied); Success Motivation Inst., Inc. v. Jamieson, 473 S.W.2d 275, 280\n\n(Tex. Civ. App.—Waco 1971, no writ). This well-settled rule is grounded in the\n\nlogic that “determination of whether a written instrument constitutes a contract or\n\nnot requires a construction of the instrument, and is therefore addressed to the\n\ncourt and not the jury.” Success Motivation Inst., 473 S.W.2d at 280.\n\n      When a trial court asks a jury to answer a question of law, the jury’s finding\n\non that question is immaterial to the judgment that the trial court should enter.\n\nSpencer v. Eagle Star Ins. Co. of Am., 876 S.W.2d 154, 157 (Tex. 1994); Fazio v.\n\nCypress/GR Houston I, L.P., 403 S.W.3d 390, 394 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\n\n\n                                        13\n\fDist.] 2013, pet. denied); Ballesteros v. Jones, 985 S.W.2d 485, 499 (Tex. App.—\n\nSan Antonio 1998, pet. denied). Both the trial court and, on appeal, the appellate\n\ncourt should disregard an immaterial jury finding. Spencer, 876 S.W.2d at 157;\n\nFazio, 403 S.W.3d at 394; see TEX. R. CIV. P. 301 (upon motion and reasonable\n\nnotice, trial court may disregard jury finding if directed verdict was proper or if\n\nfinding has no support in evidence).\n\nB.    Waiver of enforceability argument\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI waived their\n\nargument that the jury’s answer to Question 1 was immaterial by failing to raise it\n\nat the charge conference.\n\n      Waiver is “an intentional relinquishment of a known right or intentional\n\nconduct inconsistent with claiming that right.” Jernigan v. Langley, 111 S.W.3d\n\n153, 156 (Tex. 2003). “Waiver is largely a matter of intent, and for implied waiver\n\nto be found through a party’s actions, intent must be clearly demonstrated by the\n\nsurrounding facts and circumstances.” Id. To preserve error when the trial court\n\nsubmits or refuses to submit a question or instruction to the jury, the complaining\n\nparty “must point out distinctly the objectionable matter and the grounds of the\n\nobjection” before the charge is submitted to the jury.

A party is not required, however, to object\n\nbefore submission of the jury charge to preserve a complaint that a jury question is\n\n\n\n                                        14\n\fimmaterial. Ballesteros, 985 S.W.2d at 499; Sunwest Bank of El Paso v. Basil\n\nSmith Eng’g Co., Inc., 939 S.W.2d 671, 673 n.1 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1996, writ\n\ndenied).\n\n      Throughout the trial, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argued to the trial court that\n\nthe document was not a contract. They were not required to object at the charge\n\nconference to preserve their complaint that the jury’s answer to Question 1 was\n\nimmaterial. Ballesteros, 985 S.W.2d at 499; Sunwest Bank of El Paso, 939 S.W.2d\n\nat 673 n.1. Under these facts, we decline to find that they waived the issue for\n\npurposes of this appeal.\n\n      We also reject Cates, Industrial, and GTS’s waiver argument because Cates\n\nhimself seeks to enforce the April 12 document as a contract and would have us\n\nhold that he was entitled to the jury’s award of damages for Bergin and Jacquin’s\n\nbreach of the parties’ agreement. Cates, Industrial, and GTS base their argument\n\nin part on whether the jury found a material breach of the agreement and on\n\nwhether Bergin and Jacquin demanded performance after Cates’s breach. These\n\narguments necessarily require us to determine what responsibilities, if any, the\n\nparties bore under the purported agreement.\n\n      Finally, throughout trial and in their appellate briefs, the parties have pointed\n\nto the April 12 document as defining their respective rights and responsibilities.\n\nThese rights and responsibilities touch on numerous other issues raised on appeal,\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\fincluding the existence of fiduciary duties, conversion of property, rights to the\n\nPRIHouston.com domain name and associated assets, and whether Industrial had\n\nprospective contracts with which PRI could have tortiously interfered. We cannot\n\naddress those issues without first determining whether the April 12 document is a\n\nlegally-binding contract.\n\nC.    Enforceability of the April 12 document\n\n      Having held that the issue of whether the April 12 document is a contract is\n\nproperly before us, we turn to the merits. Whether the April 12 document itself\n\nwas an enforceable contract is a question of law, not a question of fact. See\n\nChapman, 781 S.W.2d at 316.\n\n      “Parties form a binding contract when the following elements are present:\n\n(1) an offer, (2) an acceptance in strict compliance with the terms of the offer,\n\n(3) meeting of the minds, (4) each party’s consent to the terms, and (5) execution\n\nand delivery of the contract with the intent that it be mutual and binding.”\n\nWinchek v. Am. Express Travel Related Servs. Co., Inc., 232 S.W.3d 197, 202\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2007, no pet.). “In order to be legally binding, a\n\ncontract must be sufficiently definite in its terms so that a court can understand\n\nwhat the promisor undertook.” T.O. Stanley Boot Co., Inc. v. Bank of El Paso, 847\n\nS.W.2d 218, 221 (Tex. 1992).\n\n\n\n\n                                       16\n\f      “The issue of whether [an] . . . agreement fails for lack of an essential term is\n\n‘a question of law to be determined by the court, unless there is ambiguity or\n\nunless surrounding facts and circumstances demonstrate a factual issue as to an\n\nagreement.’” Gen. Metal Fabricating Corp. v. Stergiou, 438 S.W.3d 737, 744\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.) (quoting Ronin v. Lerner, 7 S.W.3d\n\n883, 888 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, no pet.)). “A binding [agreement]\n\nmay exist when parties agree upon some terms, understanding them to be an\n\nagreement, and leave other terms to be made later.”             Id. (citing Oakrock\n\nExploration Co. v. Killam, 87 S.W.3d 685, 690 (Tex. App.—San Antonio 2002,\n\npet. denied)). “When an agreement leaves essential (or material) matters open for\n\nfuture negotiation and those negotiations are unsuccessful, however, the agreement\n\n‘is not binding upon the parties and merely constitutes an agreement to agree.’” Id.\n\n(footnote omitted) (quoting Fort Worth Indep. Sch. Dist. v. City of Fort Worth, 22\n\nS.W.3d 831, 846 (Tex. 2000)). “While Texas courts favor validating transactions\n\nrather than voiding them, a court may not create a contract where none exists and\n\ngenerally may not add, alter, or eliminate essential terms.” Id. at 744–45.\n\n      We begin by noting that the signed copy of the April 12 document bears a\n\nlarge number of handwritten comments that are not initialed, dated, or—at least on\n\nthe face of the document—attributed to any particular author. For example, in\n\nseveral places, “spin-off” is crossed out, and “reorg” is written in. In another, the\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\fhandwritten words “1.5 yr max” appear next to the statement that Cates would sell\n\nhis existing shares “once the Bank of America Loan is paid off, and within 1 year,”\n\nbut immediately above the statement, “Power Reps, Inc. continues as normal until\n\neffective date of spin-off reorg.”     We cannot ascertain which statement the\n\nhandwritten term modifies. In other places, the handwritten comments include\n\nstatements such as “Bob and Jeff Take Wells Fargo Note. Cy [indecipherable]\n\nBOA Note.” 3\n\n      In two places, the April 12 document indicates that the parties contemplated\n\na formal “letter of intent” before proceeding with the spin-off or reorganization of\n\nPRI. First, the typed text of the email chain includes the statements:\n\n      A letter of intent is necessary to proceed with the spin-off. This letter\n      of intent will be signed by each of the stockholders.\n\nSecond, immediately above the principals’ signatures appear the handwritten\n\nwords, “Letter of intent to follow,” although “to follow” is crossed out and\n\n“Follow” is written in.\n\n      The document’s material terms are incomplete or, in some instances, wholly\n\nabsent. For example, the document explicitly states that a letter of intent signed by\n\nall shareholders “is necessary to proceed” with the division of PRI’s business, but\n\nit does not state what terms such a letter of intent must contain. The parties agree\n\n\n3\n      There is no testimony in the record clarifying this statement.\n\n\n                                         18\n\fthat no such letter was ever signed. The document includes broad and vague\n\nstatements that “Expenses (including employees) are split,” “Income is split,” and\n\n“Power Reps, Utility and Industrial must settle the debt to GTS.” It is silent as to\n\nhow such amounts were to be “split” and as to the amount and nature of the debt in\n\nquestion. One comment in the document refers to how expenses could be split\n\n“[i]f we use 60/40,” but there is no indication that the parties actually agreed to that\n\nproportion, nor is it clear who would bear each share of such a split. Rather, the\n\ndocument leaves open the possibility that the parties eventually decided to split\n\nincome and expenses equally into halves, in proportion to each shareholder’s stake\n\nin the company, in proportion to the relative contributions of the utility and\n\nindustrial customers, or in any number of other ways. But the division of income\n\nand expenses is an essential term of the proposed agreement.\n\n          The April 12 document also includes multiple statements contemplating\n\nfurther discussion of material terms. For example, the sixth numbered paragraph\n\nstates,\n\n          [Typed:] There is a Wells Fargo note from the Buy Out of\n          Westmoreland Engineering in the amount of about $70,000 that will\n          need to be discussed. I am not sure whose name is on it. I don’t\n          think I have signed any personal guarantee. My paying the BOA\n          note off is enough – I think. [Handwritten:] Bob & Jeff Take Wells\n          Fargo Note. Cy [indecipherable] BOA Note.\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\f(emphasis in original). The parties disputed responsibility for the Bank of America\n\nnote in question, but the parties have not identified any evidence from which we\n\nmight determine the meaning of the indecipherable portion of the handwriting.\n\n      Regarding payment of an unspecified “debt to GTS,” the document is\n\nsimilarly imprecise. Its ninth numbered paragraph reads, in full:\n\n      9. Power Reps, Utility and Industrial must settle the debt to GTS.\n      ******* 4 We will need to discuss this one also. I am willing to look\n      at possibly removing Cy’s name from #6 above in exchange for\n      removing PRI Utility from [indecipherable] OR we combined [sic] the\n      two and split 3 ways[.]\n      We have been through this several times and you know my feelings\n      on this[.] I am willing to look at some type of compromise but I still\n      feel this debt is no different [than] monies owed to me[.]\n\n(emphasis in original).    In this paragraph, in particular, we cannot say with\n\ncertainty who wrote which words, much less which terms, if any, the parties\n\nintended to be binding. On the contrary, the final statement indicates no more than\n\nan agreement to “look at some type of compromise.” 5 In addition, this paragraph\n\nimplies that the parties contemplated combining responsibility for the Bank of\n\n\n4\n      The document contains a series of dots or asterisks of uneven shape and\n      positioning. Based on the document in the record, we cannot tell whether\n      these dots are typed or handwritten, nor can we determine their original\n      color. Similar dots appear in several of the paragraphs in the document, but\n      it is not clear from the record what they signify, if anything.\n5\n      The only reference to this term that we have found in the record is Jacquin’s\n      testimony that Cates “believed that monies were owed to GTS from Power\n      Reps. . . . [b]ecause that’s what he felt.”\n\n\n                                         20\n\fAmerica loan with responsibility for other debts, casting further doubt on who bore\n\nresponsibility for the former.\n\n       Likewise, the parties discussed the question, “How will we split data\n\ninformation or programs?” The response to that question, printed in bold font,\n\nwas,\n\n       I’m discussing the options with programmers. I suggest we operate 2\n       separate databases. Migrating data to each. The existing server\n       should handle both. Password protection will control access to each.\n       We can determine what data to migrate examples: (all customer TEC,\n       all customer Centerpoint, etc.) This could apply to contacts and\n       transactions. Another possibility is we each sign a confidentiality\n       agreement and migrate all data to both databases. All new\n       information will be limited.\n\nAgain, we cannot determine what the parties agreed to with respect to data or\n\nsoftware ownership, if anything. But the division of these assets was a material\n\nterm of the proposed agreement; the document itself reflects that the parties held\n\nsignificant concerns about access and confidentiality, and even the parties’\n\nappellate briefs reflect a focus on ownership and confidentiality of data.\n\n       Because the April 12 document does not contain essential terms of the\n\nparties’ purported agreement, it is unenforceable as a matter of law. See Fort\n\nWorth Indep. Sch. Dist., 22 S.W.3d at 846; Oakrock Exploration Co., 87 S.W.3d at\n\n691. The document is not legally binding for the additional reason that it is not\n\nsufficiently definite to enable us to understand what each party promised to do.\n\nT.O. Stanley Boot Co., 847 S.W.2d at 221.           Finally, the parties’ signatures\n\n\n                                         21\n\fnotwithstanding, the document reflects that there was no “acceptance in strict\n\ncompliance with the terms of the offer” because the responses expressed ongoing\n\ndisagreement and uncertainty regarding various terms. See Winchek, 232 S.W.3d\n\nat 202. The document does not evince a “meeting of the minds” as to numerous\n\nmaterial terms because the text of the document contains incompatible proposals,\n\nwith no indication of which terms form the parties’ agreement. Id. For each of\n\nthese reasons, the document is not enforceable as a contract. See id. We therefore\n\nsustain Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s first issue and hold that the trial court erred in\n\nentering judgment on the jury’s answer to Question 1, rather than disregarding it as\n\nan immaterial finding on a question of law. 6\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s second issue addresses whether the trial court\n\nshould have determined the amount of damages due for Cates’s breach of the\n\n6\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue in a footnote, “Should this Court find error,\n      [Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI] fail to demonstrate reversible error,” citing Texas\n      Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.1(a)(1). They reiterate this same argument,\n      always in footnotes and using exactly the same language, regarding each of\n      the eleven issues raised by Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI. They do not elaborate\n      on these arguments with any citations to other authority, the record, or any\n      briefing whatsoever. Cates, Industrial, and GTS have thus not raised any\n      particular issue or argument with respect to reversible error. See TEX. R.\n      APP. P. 38.1(i) (“The [appellant’s] brief must contain a clear and concise\n      argument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities\n      and to the record.”), 38.2(a)(1) (“An appellee’s brief must conform to the\n      requirements of Rule 38.1,” with exceptions not relevant here.). We have,\n      however, considered and applied the reversibility requirements set forth in\n      Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.1 to each issue raised by the parties. See\n      TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1.\n\n\n                                         22\n\fpurported April 12 agreement and entered judgment in that amount. Because we\n\nhold that the April 12 document is not an enforceable contract, we overrule that\n\nissue as moot.\n\n                              Evidentiary Sufficiency\n\n      We now turn to Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s evidentiary sufficiency issues,\n\nnamely their issues three through seven and nine.\n\nA.    Standard of review\n\n      When we consider whether legally sufficient evidence supports a challenged\n\nfinding, we must consider evidence that supports the finding if a reasonable\n\nfactfinder could do so, and we must disregard contrary evidence unless a\n\nreasonable factfinder could not do so. See City of Keller v. Wilson, 168 S.W.3d\n\n802, 827 (Tex. 2005). We may not sustain a legal insufficiency, or “no evidence,”\n\npoint unless the record demonstrates (1) a complete absence of evidence of a vital\n\nfact; (2) that the court is barred by rules of law or of evidence from giving weight\n\nto the only evidence offered to prove a vital fact; (3) that the evidence offered to\n\nprove a vital fact is no more than a mere scintilla; or (4) that the evidence\n\nconclusively establishes the opposite of the vital fact. Id. at 810.\n\n      “When reviewing a jury verdict to determine the factual sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, the court of appeals must consider and weigh all the evidence, and\n\nshould set aside the verdict only if it is so contrary to the overwhelming weight of\n\n\n\n                                          23\n\fthe evidence as to be clearly wrong and unjust.” Cain v. Bain, 709 S.W.2d 175,\n\n176 (Tex. 1986); see Vill. Place, Ltd. v. VP Shopping, LLC, 404 S.W.3d 115, 124\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.).\n\n      A no-evidence argument is an attack on the legal sufficiency of the evidence\n\nand must be preserved for appeal through (1) a motion for instructed verdict; (2) a\n\nmotion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict; (3) an objection to the\n\nsubmission of the issue to the jury; (4) a motion to disregard the jury’s answer to a\n\nvital fact issue; or (5) a motion for new trial. T.O. Stanley Boot Co., 847 S.W.2d at\n\n220. Similarly, a factual-sufficiency argument must be preserved by a motion for\n\nnew trial. TEX. R. CIV. P. 324(b).\n\nB.    Fiduciary duties\n\n      In their third issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue that there is no or legally\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict that Bergin and Jacquin are\n\nfiduciaries of Cates. Specifically, they argue that the evidence is insufficient for\n\nthree reasons: (1) “the underlying facts are undisputed,” making the existence of a\n\nfiduciary duty a question of law; (2) Bergin and Jacquin’s actions relevant to this\n\ncase were all taken in their capacities as directors and officers of PRI; and (3) the\n\neconomic loss rule bars any recovery by Cates for Bergin and Jacquin’s breach of\n\ntheir fiduciary duties.\n\n\n\n\n                                         24\n\f      Cates, Industrial, and GTS respond that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI waived\n\nthis issue by failing to raise it at the jury charge conference. In the alternative, they\n\nargue that sufficient evidence supports the judgment.\n\n      1.     Waiver\n\n      A party may preserve a legal-sufficiency issue through a motion for\n\ninstructed verdict, an objection to submission of an issue to the jury, a motion for a\n\njudgment notwithstanding the verdict, a motion to disregard the jury’s answer to a\n\nvital fact issue, or a motion for a new trial. Salinas v. Fort Worth Cab & Baggage\n\nCo., Inc., 725 S.W.2d 701, 704 (Tex. 1987); see Williams v. S. Pac. Transp. Co.,\n\n804 S.W.2d 132, 134 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1990, writ denied). Bergin,\n\nJacquin, and PRI filed a motion to disregard the jury’s findings regarding Bergin\n\nand Jacquin’s fiduciary duties to Cates. They have thus preserved this issue.\n\n      2.     Existence and breach of fiduciary duty\n\n      “The elements of a breach-of-fiduciary-duty claim are (1) the existence of a\n\nfiduciary relationship between the plaintiff and defendant; (2) the defendant’s\n\nbreach of the fiduciary duties arising from that relationship; and (3) injury to the\n\nplaintiff, or benefit to the defendant, resulting from that breach.” Plotkin v. Joekel,\n\n304 S.W.3d 455, 479 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2009, pet. denied); Jones v.\n\nBlume, 196 S.W.3d 440, 447 (Tex. App.—Dallas 2006, pet. denied).\n\n\n\n\n                                           25\n\f      “A fiduciary duty is an extraordinary duty that is not lightly created.”\n\nWayne Duddlesten, Inc. v. Highland Ins. Co., 110 S.W.3d 85, 96 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2003, pet. denied); Garrison Contractors, Inc. v. Liberty Mut.\n\nIns. Co., 927 S.W.2d 296, 301 (Tex. App.—El Paso 1996), aff’d on other grounds,\n\n966 S.W.2d 482 (Tex. 1998). Thus, fiduciary duties arise only out of certain\n\nspecial relationships. See, e.g., Nat’l Plan Adm’rs, Inc. v. Nat’l Health Ins. Co.,\n\n235 S.W.3d 695, 700 (Tex. 2007); J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. v. Tex. Contract\n\nCarpet, Inc., 302 S.W.3d 515, 536 (Tex. App.—Austin 2009, no pet.). “In certain\n\nformal relationships, such as an attorney-client or trustee relationship, a fiduciary\n\nduty arises as a matter of law.” Meyer v. Cathey, 167 S.W.3d 327, 330 (Tex.\n\n2005). Texas courts “also recognize an informal fiduciary duty that arises from ‘a\n\nmoral, social, domestic or purely personal relationship of trust and confidence.’”\n\nId. (quoting Associated Indem. Corp. v. CAT Contracting, Inc., 964 S.W.2d 276,\n\n287 (Tex. 1998)). Cates argues that an informal fiduciary relationship existed\n\nbetween him and Bergin and Jacquin.\n\n      “A [corporate] director’s fiduciary duty runs only to the corporation, not to\n\nindividual shareholders or even to a majority of the shareholders.” Richardson v.\n\nNewman, 439 S.W.3d 538, 542 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.)\n\n(quoting Somers ex rel. EGL, Inc. v. Crane, 295 S.W.3d 5, 11 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2009, pets. denied)). “While corporate officers owe fiduciary\n\n\n\n                                         26\n\fduties to the corporation they serve, they do not generally owe fiduciary duties to\n\nindividual shareholders unless a contract or confidential relationship exists\n\nbetween them in addition to the corporate relationship.” Somers, 295 S.W.3d at\n\n11 (quoting Cotten v. Weatherford Bancshares, Inc., 187 S.W.3d 687, 698 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Fort Worth 2006, pet. denied) (emphasis added)). Further, the relationship\n\nbetween shareholders in a closely-held corporation, taken alone, does not give rise\n\nto fiduciary duties. Cardiac Perfusion Servs., Inc. v. Hughes, 436 S.W.3d 790, 791\n\nn.1 (Tex. 2014).\n\n      When the underlying facts are undisputed, the determination of whether a\n\nfiduciary relationship exists is a question of law for the court. Meyer, 167 S.W.3d\n\nat 330; Envtl. Procedures, Inc. v. Guidry, 282 S.W.3d 602, 627 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [14th Dist.] 2009, pet. denied). Thus, “[a]lthough the existence of facts\n\ngiving rise to a fiduciary duty is a question for the factfinder’s determination, the\n\nissue of whether those facts give rise to a formal fiduciary relationship is a\n\nquestion of law.” Envtl. Procedures, 282 S.W.3d at 627; see Brewer & Pritchard,\n\nP.C. v. Johnson, 7 S.W.3d 862, 867 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1999), aff’d,\n\n73 S.W.3d 193 (2002).\n\n      We consider a variety of factors to determine whether an informal fiduciary\n\nrelationship exists. Gregan v. Kelly, 355 S.W.3d 223, 228 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2011, no pet.). Our first consideration is the nature of the parties’\n\n\n\n                                         27\n\frelationship. Id.; see Thigpen v. Locke, 363 S.W.2d 247, 253 (Tex. 1962) (“The\n\nexistence of the fiduciary relationship is to be determined from the actualities of\n\nthe relationship between the persons involved.”); Lee v. Hasson, 286 S.W.3d 1,\n\n14–16 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2007, pet. denied) (analyzing (1) parties’\n\ncloseness, including whether relationship is close personal friendship or close\n\nbusiness relationship, (2) whether parties’ transactions were conducted at arm’s\n\nlength, and (3) terms of any contracts between parties). As part of the parties’\n\nrelationship, we must consider whether the purported fiduciary exercised\n\ndominance and undue influence over the other party. See R.R. St. & Co., Inc. v.\n\nPilgrim Enters., Inc., 81 S.W.3d 276, 306 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001)\n\n(“[F]iduciary relationships juxtapose trust and dependence on one side with\n\ndominance and influence on the other”), rev’d in part sub nom., 166 S.W.3d 232\n\n(Tex. 2005).7 We also consider the length of the parties’ relationship, although a\n\nlong personal relationship alone is insufficient to create a fiduciary relationship.\n\nLee, 286 S.W.3d at 15; Hoggett v. Brown, 971 S.W.2d 472, 488 (Tex. App.—\n\n7\n      See also Associated Indem. Corp. v.

(“A confidential relationship\n      exists where one person has a special confidence in another to the extent that\n      the parties do not deal with each other equally, either because of dominance\n      on one side or weakness, dependence, or justifiable trust on the other.”).\n\n                                        28\n\fHouston [14th Dist.] 1997, pet. denied) (observing that long personal relationship\n\nalone is insufficient to create fiduciary relationship).\n\n      A second factor is whether the plaintiff actually relied on the purported\n\nfiduciary “for moral, financial, or personal support or guidance.”          Trostle v.\n\nTrostle, 77 S.W.3d 908, 915 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 2002, no pet.); see Lee, 286\n\nS.W.3d at 15. Third, we examine whether such reliance is justifiable. Ins. Co. of\n\nN. Am. v. Morris, 981 S.W.2d 667, 674 (Tex. 1998) (stating informal fiduciary\n\nrelationship “may arise when the parties have dealt with each other in such a\n\nmanner for a long period of time that one party is justified in expecting the other to\n\nact in its best interest”); Thigpen, 363 S.W.2d at 253 (“[W]e hold that in this case\n\nthere is not such evidence of justifiable trust and confidence as will create a\n\nfiduciary relationship”); Gregan, 355 S.W.3d at 228 (“[O]ne factor we consider is\n\nwhether party claiming to be owed a fiduciary relationship justifiably placed\n\nspecial confidence in the other party to act in his best interest.”).\n\n      In addition to these factors, there is one bright-line temporal requirement\n\nthat must be satisfied to establish an informal fiduciary relationship: “[t]o impose\n\nan informal fiduciary duty in a business transaction, the special relationship of trust\n\nand confidence must exist prior to, and apart from, the agreement made the basis of\n\nthe suit.” Meyer, 167 S.W.3d at 331; Wayne Duddlesten, Inc., 110 S.W.3d at 96;\n\nsee Schlumberger Tech. Corp. v. Swanson, 959 S.W.2d 171, 177 (Tex. 1997).\n\n\n\n                                           29\n\f      Applying these factors, we first consider the nature of the relationship\n\nbetween Bergin, Jacquin, and Cates. Gregan, 355 S.W.3d at 228; see Thigpen, 363\n\nS.W.2d at 253; Lee, 286 S.W.3d at 14–16. The record does not contain any\n\nagreement, whether written or oral, that creates an informal fiduciary relationship.\n\nThe record shows that these men had a long-standing relationship spanning more\n\nthan 20 years.     That relationship, however, began with and centered on the\n\nmanagement and eventual breakup of PRI.           No evidence indicates that the\n\nrelationship was especially close or intimate such that it might rise to the level of\n\nan informal fiduciary relationship. Cf. Lee, 286 S.W.3d at 14–16 (evidence of\n\nlong-standing business relationship and personal friendship in which parties\n\nvacationed together with their families was legally and factually sufficient to\n\nsupport jury’s finding of informal fiduciary relationship); Flanary v. Mills, 150\n\nS.W.3d 785, 794 (Tex. App.—Austin 2004, pet. denied) (legally and factually\n\nsufficient evidence existed that shareholder in homebuilding corporation had\n\nconfidential relationship with corporation’s other shareholder who was both his\n\nuncle and former partner in another business). Further, nothing in the record\n\nindicates   that   the   purported   fiduciaries—Bergin   and Jacquin—exercised\n\ndominance and undue influence over Cates. See R.R. St. & Co., 81 S.W.3d at 306.\n\nThis first factor therefore does not support the existence of an informal fiduciary\n\nrelationship.\n\n\n\n                                         30\n\f      We next look at whether Cates actually relied on Bergin and Jacquin “for\n\nmoral, financial, or personal support or guidance.” Trostle, 77 S.W.3d at 915; see\n\nLee, 286 S.W.3d at 15. No evidence indicates that he did. Rather, the three men\n\noperated somewhat independently, and it was Cates, not the others, who eventually\n\nopted to leave PRI and operate his business independently. This second factor\n\ndoes not support the existence of a fiduciary relationship. The absence of support\n\nfor this factor also renders the third factor—whether Cates’s reliance is\n\njustifiable—inapplicable.\n\n      Finally, we note that “the special relationship of trust and confidence must\n\nexist prior to, and apart from, the agreement made the basis of the suit.” Meyer,\n\n167 S.W.3d at 331; see Schlumberger, 959 S.W.2d at 177. No evidence indicates\n\nthat the parties had such a special relationship that pre-dated the purported\n\nagreements at issue in this suit.\n\n      We hold that, as a matter of law, the evidence does not support the jury’s\n\nfinding that Bergin and Jacquin were fiduciaries of Cates. 8 We sustain Bergin,\n\n\n\n\n8\n      We note that the jury awarded damages to PRI for Cates’s breach of a\n      fiduciary duty. No party challenges that award or the jury’s liability findings\n      underlying the award. We note, however, that the award to PRI is based on\n      a different theory—Cates’s relationship to PRI—than that supporting\n      Cates’s recovery against Bergin and Jacquin and is therefore not affected by\n      our holding here.\n\n\n                                         31\n\fJacquin, and PRI’s third issue 9 and reverse the trial court’s awards of damages for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duties by Bergin and Jacquin. 10\n\nC.    Tortious interference with prospective contracts\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue in their fourth issue that no or insufficient\n\nevidence supports the jury’s liability finding and damages award to Cates,\n\nIndustrial, and GTS for tortious interference with prospective contracts in response\n\nto jury Questions 16 and 18. Therefore, according to Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI, the\n\ntrial court should have disregarded the jury’s findings relevant to that claim.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not cite any authority in connection with their\n\nfourth issue. They do not identify the elements of a claim for tortious interference\n\nwith prospective business relations, nor do they explain which element or elements\n\nof the claim are supported by insufficient evidence. 11 Because Bergin, Jacquin,\n\n\n9\n      Because we sustain this issue based on Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s first two\n      arguments, we do not reach their arguments regarding the economic loss\n      rule.\n10\n      The trial court awarded these damages in two apparently overlapping\n      portions. In paragraph 13 of the judgment, it awarded $281,000, the amount\n      found by the jury, against “Bergin . . . jointly and severally with . . .\n      Jacquin.” Then, in paragraph 14 of the judgment, it awarded 40% of that\n      amount to “Jacquin, jointly and severally with . . . Bergin.” We reverse both\n      awards, as both depend on the same liability findings.\n11\n      We also note that, contrary to PRI’s position, a claim for tortious\n      interference with prospective business relations does not necessarily require\n      proof of a prospective contract; it may instead involve interference with a\n      continuing relationship that has not been reduced to a formal contract. See,\n      e.g., Heil–Quaker Corp. v. Mischer Corp., 863 S.W.2d 210, 214 (Tex.\n\n                                          32\n\fand PRI have inadequately briefed this issue, they have waived it. See TEX. R.\n\nAPP. P. 38.1(i) (“The brief must contain a clear and concise argument for the\n\ncontentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities and to the record.”); see\n\nalso, e.g., Tesoro Petroleum Corp. v. Nabors Drilling USA, Inc., 106 S.W.3d 118,\n\n128 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2002, pet. denied). Moreover, to the extent\n\nthat Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI raise any complaint regarding the jury charge’s\n\nquestion on liability, they waived it by failing to object at the jury charge\n\nconference. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 272, 274.\n\n      With respect to damages, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI assert that “the evidence\n\nshows clearly that Cates suffered no damage from any actions or conduct by PRI,\n\nBergin or Jacquin that interfered with [his] business relations or ‘contracts.’” This\n\nbriefing is inadequate in that it fails to identify legal authority relevant to the\n\napplicable standard of review, the law of tortious interference, or damages. It does\n\nnot identify the evidence that “shows clearly that Cates suffered no damage” due to\n\ntheir actions. Nor do Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI discuss, in either their opening brief\n\nor their reply brief, the evidence to which Cates points as support for the tortious\n\ninterference finding: disparaging remarks by Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI to Cates’s\n\n\n      App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1993) (citing RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF\n      TORTS § 766B, cmts. a, c (1979)), writ granted w.r.m., 877 S.W.2d 300\n      (Tex. 1994); see also Faucette v. Chantos, 322 S.W.3d 901, 915 (Tex.\n      App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2010, no pet.).\n\n\n                                         33\n\factual and potential customers, meetings between Wilson and Cates’s actual\n\ncustomer Olsun, and PRI’s attempt to have a commission check payable to\n\nIndustrial reissued and made payable to PRI. By failing to brief their complaint by\n\naddressing neither the relevant law nor the evidence, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI\n\nhave waived this issue. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i).\n\n      We hold that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have waived their fourth issue.\n\nD.    Commission-split and rent agreement\n\n      In their fifth issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue that the trial court should\n\nhave disregarded the jury’s findings regarding the purported 70-30 commission-\n\nsplit and rent agreement.      In support, they make two arguments: (1) “any\n\nagreement relating to commission split and payment of rent was subsumed in the\n\nincomplete April 12, 2010 agreement draft which the jury found Defendant Cates\n\nbreached first,” and (2) there is no evidence or legally insufficient evidence that\n\nPRI did not comply with its obligations “under an alleged agreement to make\n\ncommission payments.”\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI again cite no legal authority in connection with this\n\nissue. They do cite to the record, but their record references do not support their\n\nargument that the parties intended that the April 12 document would supersede the\n\npurported commission-split and rent agreement, nor do they demonstrate that Cates\n\nreceived all monies that he claimed under that agreement. We also note that their\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\fbriefing regarding the purported commission-split and rent agreement in the trial\n\ncourt, like their briefing here, fails to cite any legal authorities supporting the\n\nargument that the agreement had been superseded or subsumed into any other\n\nagreement. Finally, we note that the April 12 document—which we have already\n\nheld was not a binding contract—does not contain a merger clause or other\n\nindication that the parties intended it to supersede any prior agreements. Bergin,\n\nJacquin, and PRI do not articulate any argument as to why we should construe it as\n\nhaving such an effect, even assuming that it was binding.\n\n      Because Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not cite legal authority or evidence to\n\nsupport their fifth issue, we overrule it as inadequately briefed. See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 38.1(i); see also Tesoro Petroleum, 106 S.W.3d at 128.\n\nE.    Conversion\n\n      In their sixth issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue that there is no or\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury’s liability finding and damages award, in\n\nresponse to jury Questions 34 and 35, for PRI’s conversion of property belonging\n\nto Cates, Industrial, or GTS. They contend that, when the disputed property is\n\nmoney, an action for conversion is generally inappropriate, citing Edlund v.\n\nBounds, 842 S.W.2d 719 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1992, writ denied). According to\n\nBergin, Jacquin, and PRI, the evidence showed that all funds or property to which\n\n\n\n\n                                        35\n\fCates was entitled were either released to Cates or credited against amounts that he\n\nowed to PRI.\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS respond that the jury could have found that PRI\n\nconverted computer and phone equipment, confidential information, and\n\ncommissions that Cates and Industrial earned and that were received and\n\nwrongfully withheld by PRI.\n\n      “Conversion is the wrongful assumption and exercise of dominion and\n\ncontrol over the personal property of another to the exclusion of, or inconsistent\n\nwith, the owner’s rights.” Lee v. Lee, 411 S.W.3d 95, 108–09 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] 2013, no pet.); Burns v. Rochon, 190 S.W.3d 263, 267–68\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2006, no pet.).\n\n      To establish a claim for conversion, a plaintiff must prove that (1) the\n      plaintiff owned or had possession of the property or entitlement to\n      possession; (2) the defendant unlawfully and without authorization\n      assumed and exercised control over the property to the exclusion of,\n      or inconsistent with, the plaintiff’s rights as an owner; (3) the plaintiff\n      demanded return of the property; and (4) the defendant refused to\n      return the property.\n\nLee, 411 S.W.3d at 109. “An action for the conversion of money will lie if the\n\nmoney can be identified as a specific chattel.” Edlund, 842 S.W.2d at 727 (citing\n\nEckman v. Centennial Sav. Bank, 757 S.W.2d 392, 398 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1988,\n\nwrit denied)). But “[w]hen an indebtedness can be discharged by payment of\n\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fmoney generally, an action in conversion is inappropriate.” Id. (quoting Eckman,\n\n757 S.W.2d at 398).\n\n      Jury Question 34 asked whether “[PRI], Bergin, and/or Jacquin convert[ed]\n\nproperty belonging to Cy Cates individually, [Industrial], and/or [GTS].” The\n\naccompanying instructions properly instructed the jury regarding the elements of\n\nconversion, although they did not distinguish between personal property and\n\nmoney. Instead, the instructions defined “personal property” to include “items\n\nordinarily considered to be personal property (e.g. cars, jewelry), in addition to\n\nconfidential information, such as customer lists and trade secrets, and money,\n\nincluding bank deposits and rental proceeds.” They did not define “confidential\n\ninformation” or “trade secrets.”\n\n      The record does not contain any evidence that Cates, Industrial, or GTS had\n\nany right to computer and phone equipment or confidential information that they\n\nobtained from PRI. Rather, their claims to such equipment and information are\n\npremised on the purported terms of the parties’ agreement to split PRI into two\n\nentities. But, as we have already held, no legally-binding agreement exists. As for\n\ncommissions that Cates and Industrial earned, the parties make no attempt to\n\nidentify that money as associated with a particular chattel.       An action for\n\nconversion of that money is therefore inappropriate. See Edlund, 842 S.W.2d at\n\n727 (quoting Eckman, 757 S.W.2d at 398).\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f      We hold that the record contains legally insufficient evidence that PRI\n\nconverted any property of Cates, Industrial, or GTS. We therefore sustain Bergin,\n\nJacquin, and PRI’s sixth issue.\n\nF.    Oppressive conduct\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI contend in their seventh issue that there is no or\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury’s liability finding and damages award for\n\nBergin and Jacquin’s oppressive conduct against Cates. They contend that they\n\ntook all of the allegedly oppressive actions in their capacities as officers and\n\ndirectors of PRI, not as individuals, and that such actions were proper.\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI failed to raise\n\nthis issue in the trial court and thus did not preserve it for appeal. Although PRI’s\n\ninitial motion for new trial challenged the sufficiency of the evidence regarding\n\noppressive conduct, Bergin and Jacquin did not join that motion.           They did,\n\nhowever, join PRI’s amended motion for new trial after the trial court amended its\n\njudgment.   They have therefore preserved their legal-sufficiency argument on\n\noppressive conduct for purposes of appeal. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 324(b); T.O.\n\nStanley Boot Co., 847 S.W.2d at 220.\n\n      On appeal, however, they have waived this issue by inadequate briefing.\n\nBergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not cite any evidence in support of their argument\n\nother than testimony that PRI held a board meeting to which Cates was invited.\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fThey cite only three cases in support of their arguments, all of which have been\n\noverruled or disapproved by the Supreme Court of Texas. See Willis v. Donnelly,\n\n118 S.W.3d 10 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2003), overruled in part, 199\n\nS.W.3d 262, 279 (Tex. 2006); Willis v. Bydalek, 997 S.W.2d 798, 801 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1999, pet. denied), disapproved by Ritchie v. Rupe, 443\n\nS.W.3d 856, 870–71 n.17 (Tex. 2014); Davis v. Sheerin, 754 S.W.2d 375, 383\n\n(Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1988, writ denied), disapproved by Ritchie, 443\n\nS.W.3d at 876. Moreover, these cases do not support the proposition for which\n\nBergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue: that, as a matter of law, a shareholder of a closely-\n\nheld entity does not oppress another shareholder, so long as he acts solely in an\n\nofficial capacity to carry out the allegedly oppressive acts.\n\n      We hold that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have waived their seventh issue.\n\nG.    Employment agreement\n\n      In their ninth issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue that no or insufficient\n\nevidence supports the jury’s award of zero damages for Cates’s breach of his\n\nemployment agreement with PRI and that the trial court therefore erred in denying\n\nPRI attorney’s fees on that claim.        The jury found that Cates breached his\n\nemployment agreement, but it awarded no damages for that breach. Although the\n\njury awarded attorney’s fees to PRI, the trial court did not award those fees in the\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\fjudgment because PRI did not recover damages on its breach-of-contract claim\n\nrelated to the employment agreement.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not cite to any authority in support of their\n\nargument. More significantly, they also do not cite to any relevant evidence. In\n\nfact, they do not cite to or identify the employment agreement or its terms. Rather,\n\nthey cite only to expert testimony regarding damages caused by Cates’s actions\n\ngenerally. They do not explain how any action by Cates breached any term of the\n\nalleged employment agreement or explain what damages suffered by PRI are\n\nattributable to any such breach.\n\n      Given their failure to identify the employment agreement, its terms, or any\n\nrelevant authority, we hold that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have waived their ninth\n\nissue by inadequately briefing it. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i); Tesoro Petroleum,\n\n106 S.W.3d at 128.\n\n                                   Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In their eighth issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI challenge the trial court’s\n\naward of attorney’s fees to Cates, Industrial, and GTS. They contend that (1) the\n\nfee amounts awarded by the jury were unreasonable and excessive; (2) Cates,\n\nIndustrial, and GTS did not segregate their attorney’s fees between claims for\n\nwhich fees are recoverable and those for which they are not; and (3) Cates either\n\ndid not recover or should not have recovered on each claim for which fees are\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\frecoverable.     Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI\n\nwaived this issue by failing to raise it in the charge conference or when the\n\nevidence of fees was presented.\n\n      The following comprises the entirety of the briefing on Bergin, Jacquin, and\n\nPRI’s first two arguments:\n\n      The Court erred in failing to disregard the jury’s answers to Question\n      No 54 and in awarding attorney fees to Defendants Cates, Power Reps\n      Industrial, LLC, (now Cy Cates Energy Reps, LLC) and Global\n      Transformer Specialists, Inc. for the reasons that\n\n      (a)      the fee amounts found by the jury were unreasonable and\n               excessive relative to any respective claims upon which\n               Defendants could have been entitled to recover attorney fees;\n               [and]\n\n      (b)      Defendants’ [sic] failed to segregate its [sic] claims for attorney\n               fees for any respective claim on which Defendants sought to\n               recover attorney fees[.]\n\nBergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not cite or refer to any authority or evidence to\n\nsupport these arguments. We therefore hold that they have waived these points.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i); Tesoro Petroleum, 106 S.W.3d at 128.\n\n      In their third argument, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI attack each basis on which\n\nCates, Industrial, and GTS could have recovered attorney’s fees. Specifically, they\n\ncontend that the jury’s finding that Cates breached the April 12 “agreement”\n\nundermines recovery on that basis. They also insist that the trial court should have\n\ndisregarded the jury’s finding on Cates, Industrial, and GTS’s theft claim because\n\n\n\n                                            41\n\fthe only evidence of any theft was that Cates stole property from PRI. Finally,\n\nthey assert that the trial court should have disregarded the jury’s finding that PRI\n\nbreached the purported 70-30 commission-split and rent agreement.\n\n       Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have waived this third argument, as well. They\n\nagain fail to cite any authority in support of their contentions. Their only citations\n\nto the record are to demonstrate purported bad acts by Cates, not to demonstrate\n\nthe absence of evidence supporting any portion of the judgment regarding a cause\n\nof action for which fees are recoverable. We therefore hold that they have waived\n\ntheir third attack on the attorney’s fees award by inadequately briefing it. See TEX.\n\nR. APP. P. 38.1(i); Tesoro Petroleum, 106 S.W.3d at 128.\n\n       Because Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have waived their eighth issue, we\n\noverrule it.12\n\n\n12\n       We note that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI raise a fourth argument under the\n       heading of “Argument on Point of Error Eight:” that the trial court should\n       have disregarded the jury’s award of zero damages for Cates’s breach of his\n       employment agreement. This point, however, has nothing to do with the\n       trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to Cates, Industrial, and GTS, as those\n       parties cannot recover fees in connection with that claim. See 1/2 Price\n       Checks Cashed v. United Auto Ins. Co., 344 S.W.3d 378, 383 (Tex. 2011)\n       (explaining that TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 38.001 establishes\n       “one-way fee shift,” under which defendant is liable for successful plaintiff’s\n       fees in breach-of-contract action, but reverse is not true). Indeed, Bergin,\n       Jacquin, and PRI do not mention fees in connection with this point. Rather,\n       the argument focuses entirely on damages connected to the employment\n       agreement. We have therefore considered this argument in connection with\n       Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s ninth issue, addressed above.\n\n\n                                          42\n\f  Declaratory Judgment Regarding PRIHouston.com and Associated Assets\n\n      In their tenth issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI contend that the trial court\n\nerred in declaring that Cates owns the domain name PRIHouston.com and the\n\nassociated website and email addresses. Specifically, they argue that these assets\n\nare indelibly associated with and are property of PRI, and “[t]here is no legal or\n\nequitable basis for the [trial court’s] judgment awarding [these assets] to\n\nDefendants.” They continue, “The use of those names or marks by Defendants is\n\ncertain to promote confusion as to the source, endorsement, affiliation or\n\nsponsorship of the user company and/or its products, and will damage Plaintiff\n\nPower Reps, Inc.” In conclusion, they contend,\n\n      The use of the internet domain, website or the name ‘PRIHouston’ is\n      and will be unfair competition per se, will be an identifying mark that\n      is deceptively similar to the business name and internet presence of\n      Plaintiff, Power Reps, Inc., will be confusing to the business relations,\n      clients and customers of Plaintiff, is error and must be set aside.”\n\n      Declaratory judgments are authorized by Section 37.003 of the Civil Practice\n\nand Remedies Code, which provides, “A court of record within its jurisdiction has\n\npower to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further\n\nrelief is or could be claimed.” TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE ANN. § 37.003(a)\n\n(West 2015). A trial court’s decision to enter or refuse a declaratory judgment\n\nrests within the sound discretion of the trial court. See, e.g., Space Master Int’l,\n\nInc. v. Porta-Kamp Mfg. Co., Inc., 794 S.W.2d 944, 947 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st\n\n\n\n                                         43\n\fDist.] 1990, no pet.). A trial court abuses its discretion if it “rule[s] arbitrarily,\n\nunreasonably, or without regard to guiding legal principles.” Bocquet v. Herring,\n\n972 S.W.2d 19, 21 (Tex. 1998).\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not provide any citations to the record in\n\nsupport of their contentions, nor do they cite any authorities regarding the nature of\n\ndeclaratory judgments or the applicable standard of review. The four cases that\n\nthey do cite all address either the law of unfair competition, which is not at issue in\n\nthis case, or the “four corners” rule of interpretation of contracts. None of these\n\ncases provides any basis for overturning the trial court’s declarations.\n\n      First, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI rely on Pebble Beach Co. v. Tour 18 I Ltd.,\n\n155 F.3d 526 (5th Cir. 1998), for the proposition that the trial court’s judgment\n\n“merely establishes a basis and opportunity for use by Defendants to unfairly\n\ncompete with the now separate business entities.”          They do not cite to any\n\nparticular portion of the Fifth Circuit’s thirty-page opinion in Pebble Beach as\n\nauthority for their contentions. Moreover, Pebble Beach has since been partially\n\nabrogated by the Supreme Court of the United States. TrafFix Devices, Inc. v.\n\nMktg. Displays, Inc., 532 U.S. 23, 121 S. Ct. 1255 (2001), partially abrogating\n\nPebble Beach, 155 F.3d 526, as recognized by Nola Spice Designs, L.L.C. v.\n\nHaydel Enters., 783 F.3d 527, 544–45 (5th Cir. 2015). Unlike Pebble Beach, this\n\ncase does not involve any claims of unfair competition, nor do the parties’ disputes\n\n\n\n                                          44\n\fover the PRIHouston.com domain name and related assets center on the likelihood\n\nof confusion among the public.        Rather, those disputes turn on the parties’\n\nrespective claims to ownership and control of those assets in the first place. We\n\nfind no support in the since-abrogated Pebble Beach opinion for Bergin, Jacquin,\n\nand PRI’s argument that Cates’s ownership of the PRIHouston.com domain and\n\nassociated assets nonetheless depends on the law of unfair competition. Pebble\n\nBeach has no bearing on this case.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI then argue that the “four corners” rule, as applied\n\nto the April 12 document, precludes a finding that the document gave Cates\n\nownership or control rights over the assets in question. As support, they provide\n\ntheir three remaining citations to authority in connection with this issue, each of\n\nwhich simply states the “four corners” rule: Lakin Enters. v. Sebastian, No. 05-08-\n\n00213-CV, 2009 WL 428491 (Tex. App.—Dallas Feb. 23, 2009, no pet.) (no pin\n\ncite provided); P. Bordages–Account B, L.P. v. Air Prods., L.P., 127 F. App’x 724\n\n(5th Cir. Apr. 15, 2005) (no pin cite provided); and P. Bordages–Account B, L.P. v.\n\nAir Prods., L.P., 369 F. Supp. 2d 860 (E.D. Tex. 2004) (no pin cite provided). We\n\nagree with Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI that the April 12 document does not mention\n\nthe PRIHouston.com domain name or associated assets and that the document is\n\nnot enforceable as a contract. It therefore does not explicitly confer upon Cates\n\nany ownership or rights to control the assets at stake.\n\n\n\n                                          45\n\f      Our inquiry does not end there, however, as the rights conferred by the\n\nApril 12 document are not the only bases upon which the trial court could have\n\nrendered its judgment. Jury Question 55 asked:\n\n      Do you find that the April 12, 2010 agreement, if any, permitted Cy\n      Cates to operate and market his business as Power Reps Industrial\n      (now Cy Cates Energy Reps, LLC) and Cy Cates purchased the\n      internet domain “PRIHouston.com” and developed the website with\n      Cy Cates’ funds in furtherance of that agreement[?]\n\nThe judgment stated simply, “Cy Cates is awarded full and exclusive right,\n\ncustody, use, and control of [the] PRIHouston.com website, domain, webpage, and\n\nassociated email accounts.”\n\n      In other words, neither Question 55 nor the judgment depended on rights\n\nexpressly conferred by the April 12, 2010 document. Rather, the jury was asked\n\nwhether it “permitted” Cates to take certain actions, including purchasing the\n\nPRIHouston.com domain name and developing the associated website.\n\n      It is undisputed that Cates purchased the PRIHouston.com domain name,\n\nusing his personal credit card, in August 2010, months after execution of the April\n\n12, 2010 document. The document does not mention that domain name, nor does\n\nit prohibit Cates from using any particular names or marks in marketing and\n\npromoting Industrial. The jury’s finding thus is compatible with the evidence: in\n\nthe absence of an enforceable agreement in the April 12 document prohibiting\n\nCates’s actions, and given testimony that Cates attempted to act consistently with\n\n\n\n                                        46\n\fthat document in registering the domain name, there is evidence that the document\n\n“permitted” his actions and that he acted “in furtherance of” the purported\n\nagreement.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI make no attempt to show that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion by granting declaratory relief.    They do not cite the Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act or any standard of review. Instead, they simply argue\n\nthat (1) the April 12 document does not support the declaration and (2) the\n\ndeclaration will promote unfair competition. But as we have already observed,\n\nneither jury Question 55 nor the trial court’s judgment was expressly based on\n\nrights conferred by the April 12 document. Rather, the question posed to the jury\n\nwas whether the document “permitted” his actions, and the jury’s affirmative\n\nfinding is not inconsistent with the evidence. As to the second argument, unfair\n\ncompetition was not a cause of action or defense in this case, and the trial court\n\nwas not required to address questions of unfair competition in order to enter\n\njudgment on the jury’s verdict regarding ownership of the disputed assets.\n\n      We hold that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have failed to show that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in granting declaratory relief to Cates. We therefore\n\noverrule their tenth issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                        47\n\f                   Cates, Industrial, and GTS’s Cross-Appeal\n\nA.    Damages for breach of the April 12 agreement\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue in their first issue on cross-appeal that the\n\ntrial court erred by failing to award damages of $283,000 for Bergin and Jacquin’s\n\nbreach of the April 12, 2010 document, as found by the jury in response to\n\nQuestion 5. They contend that, because Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI did not raise\n\nCates’s prior material breach of that document as an affirmative defense, it was\n\nerror for the trial court to apply that breach as a bar to recovery. We do not reach\n\nthose arguments because the April 12, 2010 document is not an enforceable\n\ncontract. We therefore overrule the first cross-issue as moot.\n\nB.    Expert witness fees and costs related to special master\n\n      We now turn to Cates, Industrial, and GTS’s second and final issue, which\n\nhas the potential to affect the amounts recoverable under the judgment, before\n\nturning to the calculation of interest on those amounts. First, Cates, Industrial, and\n\nGTS argue that the trial court erred in refusing to award as costs their accountant’s\n\nfees, to which they claim they were entitled for “good cause” shown under Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 141 by virtue of a pair of Rule 11 agreements. Second, they argue\n\nthat they were entitled to an award of expenses related to the discovery special\n\nmaster. Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI respond to both arguments that such costs were\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\fnot recoverable and, to the extent that the trial court had discretion to award them,\n\nit did not abuse that discretion.\n\n      “The successful party to a suit shall recover of his adversary all costs\n\nincurred therein, except where otherwise provided.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 131. “‘Costs,’\n\nwhen used in legal proceedings, refer not just to any expense, but to those paid to\n\ncourts or their officers . . . .” In re Nalle Plastics Family Ltd. P’ship, 406 S.W.3d\n\n168, 175 (Tex. 2013). “As [the Supreme Court of Texas has] recognized for\n\ndecades, the term costs is generally understood [to mean] the fees or compensation\n\nfixed by law collectible by the officers of court, witnesses, and such like items, and\n\ndoes not ordinarily include attorney’s fees which are recoverable only by virtue of\n\ncontract or statute.” Id. (quoting Johnson v. Universal Life & Accident Ins. Co., 94\n\nS.W.2d 1145, 1146 (Tex. 1936)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n      For purposes of Rule 131, “[a] ‘successful party’ is ‘one who obtains\n\njudgment of a competent court vindicating a civil right or claim.’” Henry v.\n\nMasson, 453 S.W.3d 43, 50 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2014, no pet.)\n\n(quoting City of Houston v. Woods, 138 S.W.3d 574, 581 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[14th Dist.] 2004, no pet.)).\n\n      Rule 141 provides an exception to the mandate of Rule 131: “The court may,\n\nfor good cause, to be stated on the record, adjudge the costs otherwise than as\n\nprovided by law or these rules.” TEX. R. CIV. P. 141. “‘Good cause’ is a very\n\n\n\n                                         49\n\felusive concept which can only be determined on a case-by-case basis.” Rogers v.\n\nWalmart Stores, Inc., 686 S.W.2d 599, 601 (Tex. 1985). The award and allocation\n\nof court costs under Rules 131 and 141 are matters for the trial court’s discretion\n\nand will not be overturned on appeal unless the trial court abused its discretion.\n\nSee Furr’s Supermarkets, Inc. v. Bethune, 53 S.W.3d 375, 376 (Tex. 2001);\n\nRogers, 686 S.W.2d at 601; Henry, 453 S.W.3d at 50–51.\n\n      1.    Expert witness fees\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS first argue that they are entitled to an award for\n\nthe expense of paying their forensic accountant. They contend that (1) the parties\n\nfiled two Rule 11 agreements with the court requiring such an award, and (2) they\n\nthus showed “good cause” under Rule 141.\n\n      A prevailing party may not recover the costs of accountants and other expert\n\nwitnesses under Rule 141, regardless of whether good cause is shown. See, e.g.,\n\nGriffin v. Carson, No. 01-08-00340-CV, 2009 WL 1493467, at *7 (Tex. App.—\n\nHouston [1st Dist.] May 28, 2009, pet. denied) (mem. op.); Headington Oil Co.,\n\nL.P. v. White, 287 S.W.3d 204, 212 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no\n\npet.); see also Richards v. Mena, 907 S.W.2d 566, 571 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi\n\n1995, writ dism’d) (“Regardless of any good cause shown, costs of experts are\n\nincidental expenses in preparation for trial and not recoverable.”); King v. Acker,\n\n725 S.W.2d 750, 755 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 1987, no writ) (costs of\n\n\n\n                                        50\n\fexperts “are litigation expenses and are not recoverable”); Whitley v. King, 581\n\nS.W.2d 541, 544 (Tex. App.—Fort Worth 1979, no writ) (Rule 141 “good cause”\n\nfinding cannot support award of expert costs).\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS nevertheless argue that Headington Oil Co., L.P.\n\nv. White, 287 S.W.3d 204 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2009, no pet.),\n\nprovides support for an award of expert expenses as costs under Rule 141. On the\n\ncontrary, Headington Oil overturned a trial court’s award of such “costs” because\n\nthe award lacked support in the record. 287 S.W.3d at 212–13. Our sister court\n\ndid not hold that such expenses were recoverable under Rule 141. Moreover, our\n\nown precedent and the weight of authority in other courts hold to the contrary. See\n\nGriffin, 2009 WL 1493467, at *7; see also Richards, 907 S.W.2d at 571; King, 725\n\nS.W.2d at 755; Whitley, 581 S.W.2d at 544.\n\n      These cases notwithstanding, Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue that the trial\n\ncourt was required to award them the costs of their forensic accountant by virtue of\n\na pair of agreements.\n\n      The first agreement, an agreed order, states merely that the costs of the first\n\nreport would be “treated as cost[s] of this suit,” which we interpret to mean that\n\nthose costs would be recoverable by the “successful party” under Rule 131.\n\nIndeed, Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue that, as “the prevailing party,” they are\n\n\n\n\n                                         51\n\fentitled to have the full cost of the first report taxed against Bergin, Jacquin, and\n\nPRI.\n\n       But Cates, Industrial, and GTS are not the only prevailing parties in this\n\ncase. The trial court’s judgment awarded damages to PRI and against Cates for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty and conversion. Moreover, Cates, Industrial, and GTS do\n\nnot attempt to link the costs of the financial audit to any particular claim or\n\ndefense, nor did they attempt to do so in their motion for costs in the trial court.\n\nThey complain that the costs were necessary and assert that they prevailed, but the\n\nrecord does not support their assertions. On the contrary, to the extent that the\n\nfinancial audits were relevant to the claims that Cates breached a fiduciary duty or\n\nconverted property of PRI, those are claims on which Cates lost. We cannot say,\n\nbased on this record, that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing each party\n\nto bear its own costs in connection with the first accounting audit and report.\n\n       The second agreement, made under Rule of Civil Procedure 11, governed a\n\nsubsequent report. It provides, “Each accountant[’s] costs in complying with this\n\nRule 11 and issuance of the amended/supplemental report shall be totaled, then\n\nsplit equally between the parties.” According to Cates, Industrial, and GTS, in this\n\ndocument “the parties agreed on a way to treat these costs in this enforceable court\n\norder, which constitutes sufficient ‘good cause’ to tax at least half of the total cost\n\nof the Supplemental Joint Report against PRI, Bergin and Jacquin.”                They\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\fconclude that the trial court “erred in not taxing them as such,” relying on Rule 11\n\nand Eaton Metal Products, L.L.C. v. U.S. Denro Steels, Inc., No. 14-09-00757-CV,\n\n2010 WL 3795192 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Sept. 30, 2010, no pet.)\n\n(mem. op.), for the proposition that a trial court has “a ministerial duty to enforce a\n\nvalid Rule 11 agreement” and thus no discretion to do otherwise. Eaton Metal\n\nProds., 2010 WL 3795192, at *2.\n\n      The Rule 11 agreement did not, however, specify that the costs of the\n\nsupplemental report were to be taxed as costs of court. Its only use of the term\n\n“costs” was in the context of the phrase “[e]ach accountants’ [sic] costs in\n\ncomplying with this Rule 11 and issuance of the amended/supplemental report,”\n\nnot in the sense of costs of court. Further, the Rule 11 agreement did not require\n\nthe trial court to do anything with respect to the costs of the supplemental report.\n\nInstead, it provided merely that the costs “shall be totaled, then split equally.” It\n\nmade no mention of court costs, Rule 131, Rule 141, or any other basis for the trial\n\ncourt to award the expenses in question as costs, which the trial court otherwise\n\nhas no authority to do.       Instead, the Rule 11 agreement merely created a\n\ncontractual obligation in each group of parties to pay one-half of all parties’\n\ncombined accountant costs. The trial court was not obligated—and, indeed, had no\n\npower—to enforce that agreement through an award of costs under Rules 131 or\n\n\n\n\n                                          53\n\f141. See Griffin, 2009 WL 1493467, at *7; see also Richards, 907 S.W.2d at 571;\n\nKing, 725 S.W.2d at 755; Whitley, 581 S.W.2d at 544.13\n\n      We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to award\n\nCates, Industrial, and GTS the costs of their forensic accountant.\n\n      2.     Special master\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS also argue that they should recover as costs\n\n$4,995 in expenses that they incurred in connection with the special master whom\n\nthe trial court appointed to conduct electronic searches and make privilege\n\ndeterminations to resolve discovery disputes between the parties regarding\n\nproduction of emails. Their reasoning is based entirely on Rule 141. 14 Again,\n\nhowever, they do not attempt to tie the special master’s costs to any particular\n\nclaim or defense, nor do they identify any particular documents produced as a\n\n\n13\n      Instead, to enforce the Rule 11 agreement, Cates, Industrial, and GTS have a\n      claim for substantive relief, namely enforcement of a contract. See, e.g., EP\n      Energy E&P Co., L.P. v. Cudd Pressure Control, Inc., No. 14-13-00734-\n      CV, 2014 WL 7345938, at *3 (Tex. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] Dec. 23,\n      2014, pet. denied) (mem. op.); In re M.A.H., 365 S.W.3d 814, 818–19 (Tex.\n      App.—Dallas 2012, no pet.); ExxonMobil Corp. v. Valence Operating Co.,\n      174 S.W.3d 303, 309 (Tex. App.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2005, pet. denied).\n14\n      Costs incurred in connection with special masters are actually governed by\n      Rule 171. TEX. R. CIV. P. 171. No party, however, mentions Rule 171 in its\n      briefs, nor did Cates, Industrial, and GTS mention it in their motion for\n      costs. Cates, Industrial, and GTS have therefore not preserved any argument\n      based on Rule 171 for appeal. We note, however, that we would reach the\n      same conclusion if they had preserved it, as they fail to show that they were\n      prevailing parties for purposes of a costs award.\n\n\n                                         54\n\fresult of the special master process. Instead, they argue that the entire special\n\nmaster process was important because “[a] majority of Cates et al.’s affirmative\n\ncauses of action and defenses in this suit derive from email communications\n\nbetween the parties, their employees, customers, and manufacturers.” Although\n\nthey argue that “32 emails produced in this search played a critical role in trial,”\n\nthey do not identify the emails in question or explain their relevance to any cause\n\nof action or defense. Moreover, the award of costs under Rule 141 is a matter for\n\nthe trial court’s discretion. Cates, Industrial, and GTS do not demonstrate that the\n\ntrial court abused that discretion.\n\n      Because Cates, Industrial, and GTS have failed to demonstrate that they are\n\nentitled to an award of costs related to the forensic accounting audits or the special\n\nmaster, we overrule their second issue.\n\n                                Prejudgment Interest\n\n      Finally, in their eleventh issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue that the trial\n\ncourt erred in assessing prejudgment interest on the net amount of damages and\n\nattorney’s fees due to each party under the judgment. Cates, Industrial, and GTS\n\nrespond that each portion of the trial court’s calculations and interest award was\n\nsupported by the evidence and controlling or persuasive authority.\n\n      The trial court’s judgment first awarded $351,000 to PRI against Cates for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty and conversion. It then awarded $200,000 to Cates,\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\fIndustrial, and GTS against PRI for tortious interference, conversion, and breach of\n\nthe commission-split and rent agreement. The trial court offset these amounts and\n\nadded to the result $682,000 in attorney’s fees, which it awarded to Cates,\n\nIndustrial, and GTS. The trial court concluded that this resulted in a net judgment\n\nto Cates, Industrial, and GTS against PRI in the amount of $531,000. The trial\n\ncourt awarded prejudgment interest on this amount.\n\n      The trial court then proceeded to award $283,000 to Cates, against Bergin\n\nand Jacquin, jointly and severally, for breach of fiduciary duty and oppressive\n\nbehavior, along with prejudgment interest on that amount. It then awarded 40% of\n\nthat same amount, or $113,200, to Cates, against Bergin and Jacquin, jointly and\n\nseverally, for the same claims, and further prejudgment interest on that amount. 15\n\n      Although we reverse portions of the trial court’s judgment today, numerous\n\nawards of fees and damages remain undisturbed: (1) the award to Cates, Industrial,\n\nand GTS for tortious interference with prospective contracts, (2) the award to Cates\n\nfor oppressive conduct, (3) the award to Cates, Industrial, and GTS for breach of\n\nthe commission-split and rent agreement, (4) the award to PRI for Cates’s breach\n\n\n15\n      In our holding on Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s third issue, however, we\n      determined that no evidence supported the jury’s finding that Bergin and\n      Jacquin breached a fiduciary duty owed to Cates. These awards are\n      therefore reversed to the extent that they reflect damages for Cates’s breach\n      of fiduciary duty claim, and we mention them here only to explain the trial\n      court’s calculations relevant to prejudgment interest.\n\n\n                                         56\n\fof fiduciary duties, (5) the award to PRI for conversion, and (6) the attorney’s fees\n\nawarded to each party. We therefore consider whether the trial court’s judgment\n\ncontains error in its award of prejudgment interest on these amounts.\n\nA.    Prejudgment interest on attorney’s fees\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI first argue that the effect of the trial court’s\n\njudgment was to award prejudgment interest on attorney’s fees and that this\n\nconstitutes error. We agree.\n\n      Generally speaking, prejudgment interest is not available on attorney’s fees.\n\nSee Hervey v. Passero, 658 S.W.2d 148, 149 (Tex. 1983); Sentinel Integrity\n\nSolutions, Inc. v. Mistras Grp., Inc., 414 S.W.3d 911, 931 (Tex. App.—Houston\n\n[1st Dist.] 2013, pet. denied); Cushman & Wakefield, Inc. v. Fletcher, 915 S.W.2d\n\n538, 547 (Tex. App.—Dallas 1995, writ denied); Berry Prop. Mgmt., Inc. v.\n\nBliskey, 850 S.W.2d 644, 670 (Tex. App.—Corpus Christi 1993, writ dism’d by\n\nagr.). Cates, Industrial, and GTS attempt to avoid this rule by arguing that they\n\npaid $90,555.62 in attorney’s fees before trial. 16 As they observe, some courts\n\nhave allowed prejudgment interest on attorney’s fees actually paid by a party\n\n16\n      We also note that Cates, Industrial, and GTS do not support their\n      calculations. They cite to 127 consecutive pages of the record apparently\n      reflecting various charges and payments of fees. They also cite to an\n      appendix to their brief, which is not in the record and cannot be considered\n      on appeal. We are not required to scour the record to perform our own\n      calculation of the amounts paid before trial, and we decline the invitation to\n      do so.\n\n\n                                         57\n\fbefore judgment. See Nova Cas. Co. v. Turner Constr., 335 S.W.3d 698, 706 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [14th Dist.] 2011, no pet.) (allowing such recovery); A.V.I., Inc. v.\n\nHeathington, 842 S.W.2d 712, 717 (Tex. App.—Amarillo 1992, writ denied)\n\n(same); see also MMR Int’l Ltd. v. Waller Marine, Inc., Civ. A. No. H-11-1188,\n\n2013 WL 6491186, at *12 (S.D. Tex. Dec. 10, 2013) (same). To the extent that\n\nthis Court has considered the issue, however, we have held that no interest is\n\nrecoverable on attorney’s fees. See Sentinel Integrity Solutions, 414 S.W.3d at 931\n\n(prejudgment interest on attorney’s fees is unavailable in suit under Covenants Not\n\nto Compete Act); Moore v. Bank Midwest, N.A., 39 S.W.3d 395, 406 n.10 (Tex.\n\nApp.—Houston [1st Dist.] 2001, pet. denied) (noting in dicta that prejudgment\n\ninterest is not available on attorney’s fees).\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue that this case presents a case of first\n\nimpression because no Texas court of appeals has considered whether prejudgment\n\ninterest is proper on an award that offsets damages with attorney’s fees. We\n\ndisagree that this case calls for any special consideration or novel analysis with\n\nrespect to interest calculations. Applying the prejudgment interest rate to the\n\ncombined parts of the net judgment has the same effect as applying that rate to\n\neach component of the judgment, assuming the starting dates are chosen correctly.\n\nIn other words, the legal question is simply whether prejudgment interest is\n\navailable on attorney’s fees, not whether it is available on a sum that happens to\n\n\n\n                                           58\n\finvolve attorney’s fees. While this case may present an unusual factual posture, it\n\ndoes not present any legal issues of first impression.\n\n      We hold that the trial court erred by applying prejudgment interest to the\n\nattorney’s fees award to Cates, Industrial, and GTS. We note that the judgment\n\ndoes not identify the dates from which prejudgment interest should run against any\n\nparty, nor does it calculate prejudgment interest up to the date of judgment. We\n\ntherefore remand the case to the trial court for correction of its interest\n\ncalculations. On remand, the trial court should determine the appropriate start date\n\nfor prejudgment interest on each award of damages and calculate that interest\n\nseparately for each award of damages. It should not apply any prejudgment\n\ninterest on attorney’s fees. Only after performing these calculations should the\n\ntrial court consider whether any offsets in the resulting amounts are appropriate.\n\nB.    Prejudgment interest against Bergin and Jacquin\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI also argue that the trial court’s award of\n\nprejudgment interest against Bergin and Jacquin constitutes error. They premise\n\nthis argument on two assertions: (1) “the damages found by the jury for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty and oppressive conduct were already considered by the Court in\n\noffsetting the damage awards to arrive at the prejudgment interest on the ‘net’\n\njudgment amount noted in the preceding paragraph;” and (2) once the “excessive\n\nand improper attorney fee award for Cates” is removed from the calculation, there\n\n\n\n                                          59\n\fis no net judgment for Cates, Industrial, and GTS for purposes of prejudgment\n\ninterest calculations. They do not cite to the record or to any authority in support\n\nof these arguments.\n\n       The first argument is factually incorrect.    The offsetting awards in the\n\njudgment are the award to PRI for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion and the\n\naward to Cates, Industrial, and GTS against PRI for tortious interference,\n\nconversion, and breach of the commission-split and rent agreement. The awards to\n\nCates individually for Bergin and Jacquin’s breaches of fiduciary duty—which we\n\nhave reversed—and oppression are not included in the calculation. We therefore\n\nreject the first argument.\n\n       We also reject the second argument—that the “excessive and improper\n\nattorney fee award to Cates” must be removed—because we have already held that\n\nBergin, Jacquin, and PRI waived their attack on the attorney’s fees award itself by\n\ninadequately briefing their eighth issue.\n\n       We sustain Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s eleventh issue in part and overrule it\n\nin part.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n       We reverse the trial court’s judgment to the extent that it relies on the jury\n\nfinding that the April 12, 2010 document was an enforceable agreement and\n\ndeclare that it is unenforceable. As an unenforceable agreement, that document\n\n\n\n                                            60\n\fcannot serve as a basis for awarding damages or attorney’s fees. We also reverse\n\nthe trial court’s award of damages against Bergin and Jacquin for breach of\n\nfiduciary duties owed to Cates. We further reverse the award against PRI for\n\nconversion and render judgment that Cates take nothing by that claim. Finally, we\n\nreverse the trial court’s inclusion of attorney’s fees in its calculation of\n\nprejudgment interest. We otherwise affirm the judgment of the trial court. We\n\nremand the case to the trial court for calculation of prejudgment interest in\n\naccordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Harvey Brown\n                                            Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Keyes, Higley, and Brown.\n\n\n\n\n                                       61\n\f",

For clarity and in accordance with\n\fthe parties’ conventions, we will refer to Power Reps, Inc., as “PRI” and to Global\n\nTransformer Specialists as “GTS.” We will refer to Power Reps Industrial, LLC,\n\nalso known as Cy Cates Energy Reps, LLC, as “Industrial.” Cates, Industrial, and\n\nGTS cross-appeal.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI assert 11 issues on appeal: (1) the trial court erred\n\nby asking the jury whether a document signed on April 12, 2010, was an\n\nagreement, rather than ruling on that issue as a matter of law; (2) the trial court\n\nerred by failing to award Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI damages for Cates’s breach of\n\nthe April 12 “agreement,” despite the fact that the jury was not asked about such\n\ndamages; (3) there was no or insufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict that\n\nBergin and Jacquin were fiduciaries of Cates; (4) there was no or insufficient\n\nevidence to support the jury’s damages findings with respect to Cates’s claim for\n\ntortious interference with prospective contracts; (5) the trial court erred in\n\nawarding damages on the commission split and rent agreement because any such\n\nagreement was subsumed in the April 12 “agreement”; (6) there was no or\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict that PRI converted Cates’s\n\nproperty; (7) there was no or insufficient evidence to support the jury’s verdict that\n\nBergin and Jacquin engaged in oppressive conduct towards Cates; (8) the\n\nattorney’s fees awarded to Cates, Industrial, and GTS by the jury were\n\nunreasonable and excessive, not properly segregated, and not recoverable because\n\n\n\n                                          2\n\fCates did not prevail on any claim for which fees are recoverable; (9) the trial court\n\nshould have disregarded the jury’s verdict that PRI was not damaged by Cates’s\n\nbreach of his employment agreement and therefore should have awarded Bergin,\n\nJacquin, and PRI their attorney’s fees; (10) the trial court erred in awarding Cates\n\nownership and control of the PRIHouston.com domain, website, and email\n\naddresses; and (11) the trial court erred by awarding Cates, Industrial, and GTS\n\nprejudgment interest on the jury’s “net” award, inclusive of both damages and\n\nattorney’s fees, and by awarding interest on the awards against Bergin and Jacquin\n\nindividually.\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS respond that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI waived\n\ntheir issues 1 through 3, 5, and 7 through 10; that all 11 issues lack merit; and that,\n\neven if Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI could demonstrate error, they have not\n\ndemonstrated reversible error with respect to any issue.          See TEX. R. APP.\n\nP. 44.1(a)(1).\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS also raise two issues on their cross-appeal: (1) the\n\ntrial court erred as a matter of law by failing to award Cates the damages found by\n\nthe jury for Bergin and Jacquin’s breach of the April 12 agreement because Cates’s\n\nbreach did not excuse performance by Bergin and Jacquin; and (2) the trial court\n\nerred by refusing to award as costs of court the cost of the accounting expert\n\nretained by Cates, Industrial, and GTS and the cost of the discovery special master.\n\n\n\n                                          3\n\f      We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for the trial court to\n\nrecalculate the correct amounts of prejudgment interest and any offsets between\n\nawards.\n\n                                    Background\n\nA.    Bergin, Jacquin, and Cates do business together\n\n      This case arises from a falling-out between Bergin and Jacquin on the one\n\nside and Cates on the other side over the management of Power Reps, Inc. PRI, a\n\nclosely-held Texas corporation, operates as an independent sales representative for\n\na number of manufacturers and distributing companies that sell electrical\n\nequipment, parts, and accessories. PRI has two general categories of customers or\n\nclients, which it classifies as “utility” or “industrial,” depending on the business of\n\nthat customer or client and the type of customers or clients that it, in turn, serves.\n\nWithin the “utility” classification, PRI serves two subtypes of customers:\n\n(1) “public power” companies, including cooperatives and municipal utilities, and\n\n(2) investor-owned utility companies.\n\n      PRI has three principal shareholders and officers, each of whom works as a\n\nsales representative. Bergin, an original shareholder, serves as PRI’s president and\n\nhandles primarily “public power” accounts. Cates, another original shareholder, is\n\na vice president and serves primarily “industrial” accounts. Jacquin became a\n\nshareholder when his company merged with PRI approximately 10 years ago; he is\n\n\n\n                                          4\n\fa vice president and serves primarily investor-owned utility accounts. The only\n\nother shareholder, Robert E. Bergin, Sr., is retired and inactive in the corporation’s\n\naffairs. Cates was assisted in his work by another PRI employee, Celine Wilson.\n\n      By convention, commissions received by PRI were divided as follows:\n\napproximately 70% of each commission went to the salesman or team that\n\ngenerated the sale, and the remainder went to PRI for overhead. At least one\n\ndocument indicates that Bergin, Jacquin, and Cates discussed fixing the split at\n\nprecisely 70-30 from December 2009 forward, although it does not indicate that\n\nthey reached an actual agreement. 1\n\n      Cates also owned and controlled Global Transformer Specialists, a company\n\nthat offered accessories for the types of equipment that PRI sold. 2 Cates was the\n\nsole owner, officer, director, and bank signatory of GTS. According to Jacquin,\n\nCates, at his own discretion, used PRI funds to meet GTS’s needs and used GTS\n\nfunds to meet PRI’s needs.\n\n1\n      Cates, GTS, and Industrial argue that this document constitutes a formal\n      agreement. But the document in question, an email from Bergin to Jacquin\n      and Cates, specifically identifies the 70-30 split as an “item[] that need[s] to\n      be voted on.” There is no indication in that document that PRI’s principals\n      ever voted to formalize the division of commissions.\n2\n      Although GTS is a party to the suit and a named appellee and cross-\n      appellant, none of the parties’ briefs in this Court identifies GTS, explains its\n      origins, or meaningfully explains its relevance to the claims, counterclaims,\n      or defenses raised in this case. The facts herein are therefore drawn from\n      our own review of the record.\n\n\n                                          5\n\fB.    The shareholders negotiate their disagreements\n\n      In 2009, PRI found itself unable to make its full payroll on several\n\noccasions. Bergin and Jacquin came to believe that the blame for the shortfalls in\n\nPRI’s finances lay with Cates. Specifically, they believed that Cates was misusing\n\ncorporate funds and engaging in undisclosed deals with PRI clients, both through\n\nGTS and otherwise.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and Cates attempted to resolve their differences by\n\nnegotiating a spin-off of the “industrial” component of PRI’s business, to be run by\n\nCates. To that end, they exchanged a series of emails in late March 2010. Cates\n\ndrafted the first email, proposing “[m]y idea of this spin-off” and suggesting terms\n\nfor a sale of his PRI shares to PRI, payment of PRI debts, allocation of expenses\n\nand income, allocation of clients, separation of the corporate data into two sets, and\n\nother terms. Bergin responded, interspersing his own comments amongst Cates’s\n\nstatements, distinguishing them by typing them in an orange font. Cates replied,\n\ninterspersing additional comments among the existing statements, this time in a\n\nbold font. On April 12, 2010, Cates, Bergin, and Jacquin each signed their names\n\nto a printed copy of this email chain.\n\n      At first, Bergin, Jacquin, and Cates apparently treated the April 12 document\n\nas reflecting an agreement among the three of them and began taking actions to\n\ndivide PRI’s existing business between PRI and a new entity to be operated by\n\n\n\n                                          6\n\fCates. Cates formed a new entity, Power Reps Industrial, LLC, in April 2010 and\n\nregistered the internet domain name PRIHouston.com in August 2010.\n\n      It soon became clear, however, that the parties did not agree on the terms of\n\ntheir agreement. For example, Cates paid for the domain name PRIHouston.com\n\nand stated that he intended to use it for Industrial, although Bergin and Jacquin saw\n\nthe initials “PRI” as capable of referring only to Power Reps, Inc., such that the\n\ndomain name would cause confusion. In addition, Cates interpreted the document\n\nas requiring Bergin and Jacquin to form their own entity, Power Reps Utility, but\n\nBergin and Jacquin did not do so and disputed that they had an obligation to do so.\n\nIn fact, Bergin and Jacquin maintain that the April 12 document had no binding\n\neffect, while Cates maintains that it constitutes an enforceable agreement. Despite\n\nthese disagreements—and despite Bergin and Jacquin’s insistence that the April 12\n\ndocument was not a contract—Bergin and Jacquin, on one side, and Cates, on the\n\nother, each concluded that the other side had breached obligations set forth in the\n\nApril 12 document.\n\n      Meanwhile, when Cates created Industrial, he hired Wilson, who had\n\nworked with him at PRI, as an Industrial employee. Wilson began working for\n\nIndustrial in April or May 2010. She resigned, however, in September 2010 and\n\nreturned to PRI shortly thereafter. According to Cates, when Wilson left, she took\n\nIndustrial property with her, including office equipment and confidential\n\n\n\n                                         7\n\finformation. According to Wilson, however, the property in question all belonged\n\nto PRI.\n\nC.    PRI files suit\n\n      In September 2010, PRI filed suit against Cates, Industrial, and GTS,\n\nalleging breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, conversion, conspiracy to defraud PRI,\n\ndeceptive trade practices, and against Cates individually for breach of an\n\nemployment contract with PRI. Cates, Industrial, and GTS countersued PRI and\n\nsued as third-party defendants Bergin, Jacquin, and Wilson, alleging breach of\n\ncontract based on the April 12 document, breach of fiduciary duty, shareholder\n\noppression, conversion, a claim under the Texas Theft Liability Act, tortious\n\ninterference with prospective and existing contracts, and an equitable claim to the\n\nPRIHouston.com domain name and associated email accounts, among other causes\n\nof action.\n\nD.    The case proceeds to trial\n\n      During discovery, the parties disagreed over the production of certain\n\nemails, leading Cates, Industrial, and GTS to file a motion to compel discovery and\n\nresulting in the trial court’s appointment of a special discovery master. The parties\n\nalso each retained a forensic accountant to determine the balances, if any, due from\n\neach party to each other party. Pursuant to an agreed order, the parties agreed that\n\nthe accountants would produce a joint report and that the accountants’ fees would\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\fbe treated as costs of court. In a subsequent Rule 11 agreement, they agreed that\n\nthe accountants would produce a second, supplemental report and that the\n\naccountants’ costs would be “total, then split equally between the parties.”\n\n      In April 2013, after a five-week trial, the trial court presented 60 questions to\n\nthe jury. Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI made no objections to the jury charge. Cates,\n\nIndustrial, and GTS objected to the submission of jury Questions 56 through 59,\n\nregarding an employment agreement between PRI and Cates, on the ground that no\n\nevidence showed the existence of such an agreement.\n\n      The first question in the charge asked, “Do you find that the writing of April\n\n12, 2010 constituted an agreement whereby Cy Cates, Bob Bergin, and Jeff\n\nJacquin agreed to divide the business of Power Reps, Inc.?” If the jury answered\n\nthat the document was an agreement, Questions 2 through 5 asked the jury to\n\ndetermine whether Bergin, Jacquin, or Cates breached the agreement (Question 2),\n\nwho breached first (Question 3), whether any breach by Cates was excused\n\n(Question 4), and the amount of damages to Cates, Industrial, and GTS for any\n\nbreach by Bergin or Jacquin (Question 5). Question 55 asked,\n\n      Do you find that the April 12, 2010 agreement, if any, permitted Cy\n      Cates to operate and market his business as Power Reps Industrial\n      (now Cy Cates Energy Reps, LLC) and Cy Cates purchased the\n      internet domain “PRIHouston.com” and developed the website with\n      Cy [Cates’s] funds in furtherance of that agreement[?]\n\n\n\n\n                                          9\n\f      In response to jury Questions 1 through 3, the jury found that the April 12\n\ndocument was an agreement, that Bergin, Cates, and Jacquin each breached that\n\nagreement, and that Cates breached it first. It then found, in response to jury\n\nQuestions 4 and 5, that Cates’s breach was not excused, but that Cates, Industrial,\n\nand GTS were damaged in the amount of $283,000 by Bergin and Jacquin’s\n\nsubsequent breach of the agreement. It also found, in response to Questions 6\n\nthrough 12, that Cates breached fiduciary duties that he owed to PRI, but Bergin\n\nand Jacquin, in turn, breached fiduciary duties that they owed to Cates.        In\n\nresponse to Question 55, the jury found that the April 12, 2010 agreement\n\n“permitted” Cates to operate and market his business as Power Reps Industrial and\n\nthat Cates purchased and developed the PRIHouston.com domain name with his\n\nown funds in furtherance of that agreement.\n\n      The jury further found, in response to Questions 16–28, 34–43, 46–51, and\n\n56–59, that PRI tortiously interfered with prospective and existing contracts of\n\nCates, Industrial, and GTS (Questions 16–21); PRI defamed and disparaged Cates,\n\nIndustrial, and GTS (Questions 22–28); PRI stole and converted property of Cates,\n\nIndustrial, or GTS (Questions 34–37); Bergin and Jacquin engaged in oppressive\n\nconduct against Cates (Questions 38–40); PRI defrauded Cates, Industrial, or GTS\n\n(Questions 41–43); Cates defrauded PRI (Questions 48–49); Cates converted\n\nproperty of PRI (Questions 50–51); PRI breached an agreement regarding\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\fdistribution of commissions and payment of rent (Questions 46–47); and Cates\n\nbreached an employment agreement with PRI (Questions 56–59). It also found, in\n\nresponse to Questions 54 and 60, amounts certain of attorney’s fees for both\n\ngroups of parties.\n\nE.    The parties’ post-trial motions\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI filed 16 motions for judgment notwithstanding the\n\nverdict, each of which the trial court denied. Cates, Industrial, and GTS also filed\n\na motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, which the trial court denied.\n\nCates, Industrial, and GTS also asked the trial court to award to them as costs of\n\ncourt the fees of their accounting expert and costs related to the discovery master,\n\nbut the trial court refused to do so.\n\n      The trial court entered judgment on the jury’s verdict, but declined to award\n\ndamages to Cates, Industrial, and GTS for breach of the April 12 agreement on the\n\nground that Cates breached the agreement first. Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI then\n\nmoved for a new trial and, while that motion was pending, filed a notice of appeal.\n\nThe trial court subsequently entered an amended final judgment, modifying the\n\napplication of prejudgment interest. Cates, Industrial, and GTS then filed their\n\nown notice of appeal. Subsequently, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI amended their\n\nmotion for new trial, which was overruled by operation of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                        11\n\f                  Immaterial Question: The April 12 Document\n\n      In their first issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue that the April 12\n\ndocument is unenforceable as a matter of law and that the trial court therefore erred\n\nin submitting a jury question asking whether the document was an agreement. The\n\nfirst question posed to the jury asked whether “the writing of April 12, 2010\n\nconstituted an agreement.” Instead of submitting this question, Bergin, Jacquin,\n\nand PRI argue, the trial court should have ruled as a matter of law that the April 12\n\ndocument was not a contract or, at most, an unenforceable “agreement to agree.”\n\nAs support, they point to the document’s express statement that “[a] letter of intent\n\nis necessary to proceed,” as well as various terms that the document states “will\n\nhave to be discussed,” that the parties “will need to discuss,” or that are simply\n\nunclear. In the alternative, if the document is an enforceable agreement, they argue\n\nin their second issue that the trial court erred in refusing to make a finding as to\n\ntheir damages from Cates’s breach of the agreement.\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS respond that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI waived\n\ntheir first argument—that the document is not an enforceable agreement and that\n\nthe trial court erred in submitting the issue to the jury—by failing to raise it during\n\nthe jury charge conference. They also argue that whether the document is a\n\ncontract is a fact issue for the jury. Finally, Cates, Industrial, and GTS respond\n\n\n\n\n                                          12\n\fthat the trial court properly rejected Bergin and Jacquin’s request for a damages\n\naward because no question on those damages was submitted to the jury.\n\nA.

Ballesteros, 985 S.W.2d at 499; Sunwest Bank of El Paso, 939 S.W.2d\n\nat 673 n.1. Under these facts, we decline to find that they waived the issue for\n\npurposes of this appeal.\n\n      We also reject Cates, Industrial, and GTS’s waiver argument because Cates\n\nhimself seeks to enforce the April 12 document as a contract and would have us\n\nhold that he was entitled to the jury’s award of damages for Bergin and Jacquin’s\n\nbreach of the parties’ agreement. Cates, Industrial, and GTS base their argument\n\nin part on whether the jury found a material breach of the agreement and on\n\nwhether Bergin and Jacquin demanded performance after Cates’s breach. These\n\narguments necessarily require us to determine what responsibilities, if any, the\n\nparties bore under the purported agreement.\n\n      Finally, throughout trial and in their appellate briefs, the parties have pointed\n\nto the April 12 document as defining their respective rights and responsibilities.\n\nThese rights and responsibilities touch on numerous other issues raised on appeal,\n\n\n\n                                          15\n\fincluding the existence of fiduciary duties, conversion of property, rights to the\n\nPRIHouston.com domain name and associated assets, and whether Industrial had\n\nprospective contracts with which PRI could have tortiously interfered. We cannot\n\naddress those issues without first determining whether the April 12 document is a\n\nlegally-binding contract.\n\nC.    Enforceability of the April 12 document\n\n      Having held that the issue of whether the April 12 document is a contract is\n\nproperly before us, we turn to the merits. Whether the April 12 document itself\n\nwas an enforceable contract is a question of law, not a question of fact. See\n\nChapman, 781 S.W.2d at 316.\n\n      “Parties form a binding contract when the following elements are present:\n\n(1) an offer, (2) an acceptance in strict compliance with the terms of the offer,\n\n(3) meeting of the minds, (4) each party’s consent to the terms, and (5) execution\n\nand delivery of the contract with the intent that it be mutual and binding.”\n\nWinchek v.

For example, in\n\nseveral places, “spin-off” is crossed out, and “reorg” is written in. In another, the\n\n\n\n                                          17\n\fhandwritten words “1.5 yr max” appear next to the statement that Cates would sell\n\nhis existing shares “once the Bank of America Loan is paid off, and within 1 year,”\n\nbut immediately above the statement, “Power Reps, Inc. continues as normal until\n\neffective date of spin-off reorg.”     We cannot ascertain which statement the\n\nhandwritten term modifies. In other places, the handwritten comments include\n\nstatements such as “Bob and Jeff Take Wells Fargo Note. Cy [indecipherable]\n\nBOA Note.” 3\n\n      In two places, the April 12 document indicates that the parties contemplated\n\na formal “letter of intent” before proceeding with the spin-off or reorganization of\n\nPRI. First, the typed text of the email chain includes the statements:\n\n      A letter of intent is necessary to proceed with the spin-off. This letter\n      of intent will be signed by each of the stockholders.\n\nSecond, immediately above the principals’ signatures appear the handwritten\n\nwords, “Letter of intent to follow,” although “to follow” is crossed out and\n\n“Follow” is written in.\n\n      The document’s material terms are incomplete or, in some instances, wholly\n\nabsent. For example, the document explicitly states that a letter of intent signed by\n\nall shareholders “is necessary to proceed” with the division of PRI’s business, but\n\nit does not state what terms such a letter of intent must contain. The parties agree\n\n\n3\n      There is no testimony in the record clarifying this statement.\n\n\n                                         18\n\fthat no such letter was ever signed. The document includes broad and vague\n\nstatements that “Expenses (including employees) are split,” “Income is split,” and\n\n“Power Reps, Utility and Industrial must settle the debt to GTS.” It is silent as to\n\nhow such amounts were to be “split” and as to the amount and nature of the debt in\n\nquestion. One comment in the document refers to how expenses could be split\n\n“[i]f we use 60/40,” but there is no indication that the parties actually agreed to that\n\nproportion, nor is it clear who would bear each share of such a split. Rather, the\n\ndocument leaves open the possibility that the parties eventually decided to split\n\nincome and expenses equally into halves, in proportion to each shareholder’s stake\n\nin the company, in proportion to the relative contributions of the utility and\n\nindustrial customers, or in any number of other ways. But the division of income\n\nand expenses is an essential term of the proposed agreement.\n\n          The April 12 document also includes multiple statements contemplating\n\nfurther discussion of material terms. For example, the sixth numbered paragraph\n\nstates,\n\n          [Typed:] There is a Wells Fargo note from the Buy Out of\n          Westmoreland Engineering in the amount of about $70,000 that will\n          need to be discussed. I am not sure whose name is on it. I don’t\n          think I have signed any personal guarantee. My paying the BOA\n          note off is enough – I think. [Handwritten:] Bob & Jeff Take Wells\n          Fargo Note. Cy [indecipherable] BOA Note.\n\n\n\n\n                                          19\n\f(emphasis in original). The parties disputed responsibility for the Bank of America\n\nnote in question, but the parties have not identified any evidence from which we\n\nmight determine the meaning of the indecipherable portion of the handwriting.\n\n      Regarding payment of an unspecified “debt to GTS,” the document is\n\nsimilarly imprecise. Its ninth numbered paragraph reads, in full:\n\n      9. Power Reps, Utility and Industrial must settle the debt to GTS.\n      ******* 4 We will need to discuss this one also. I am willing to look\n      at possibly removing Cy’s name from #6 above in exchange for\n      removing PRI Utility from [indecipherable] OR we combined [sic] the\n      two and split 3 ways[.]\n      We have been through this several times and you know my feelings\n      on this[.] I am willing to look at some type of compromise but I still\n      feel this debt is no different [than] monies owed to me[.]\n\n(emphasis in original).    In this paragraph, in particular, we cannot say with\n\ncertainty who wrote which words, much less which terms, if any, the parties\n\nintended to be binding. On the contrary, the final statement indicates no more than\n\nan agreement to “look at some type of compromise.” 5 In addition, this paragraph\n\nimplies that the parties contemplated combining responsibility for the Bank of\n\n\n4\n      The document contains a series of dots or asterisks of uneven shape and\n      positioning. Based on the document in the record, we cannot tell whether\n      these dots are typed or handwritten, nor can we determine their original\n      color. Similar dots appear in several of the paragraphs in the document, but\n      it is not clear from the record what they signify, if anything.\n5\n      The only reference to this term that we have found in the record is Jacquin’s\n      testimony that Cates “believed that monies were owed to GTS from Power\n      Reps. . . . [b]ecause that’s what he felt.”\n\n\n                                         20\n\fAmerica loan with responsibility for other debts, casting further doubt on who bore\n\nresponsibility for the former.\n\n       Likewise, the parties discussed the question, “How will we split data\n\ninformation or programs?” The response to that question, printed in bold font,\n\nwas,\n\n       I’m discussing the options with programmers. I suggest we operate 2\n       separate databases. Migrating data to each. The existing server\n       should handle both. Password protection will control access to each.\n       We can determine what data to migrate examples: (all customer TEC,\n       all customer Centerpoint, etc.) This could apply to contacts and\n       transactions. Another possibility is we each sign a confidentiality\n       agreement and migrate all data to both databases. All new\n       information will be limited.\n\nAgain, we cannot determine what the parties agreed to with respect to data or\n\nsoftware ownership, if anything. But the division of these assets was a material\n\nterm of the proposed agreement; the document itself reflects that the parties held\n\nsignificant concerns about access and confidentiality, and even the parties’\n\nappellate briefs reflect a focus on ownership and confidentiality of data.\n\n       Because the April 12 document does not contain essential terms of the\n\nparties’ purported agreement, it is unenforceable as a matter of law. See Fort\n\nWorth Indep. Sch. Dist., 22 S.W.3d at 846; Oakrock Exploration Co., 87 S.W.3d at\n\n691. The document is not legally binding for the additional reason that it is not\n\nsufficiently definite to enable us to understand what each party promised to do.\n\nT.O. Stanley Boot Co., 847 S.W.2d at 221.           Finally, the parties’ signatures\n\n\n                                         21\n\fnotwithstanding, the document reflects that there was no “acceptance in strict\n\ncompliance with the terms of the offer” because the responses expressed ongoing\n\ndisagreement and uncertainty regarding various terms. See Winchek, 232 S.W.3d\n\nat 202. The document does not evince a “meeting of the minds” as to numerous\n\nmaterial terms because the text of the document contains incompatible proposals,\n\nwith no indication of which terms form the parties’ agreement. Id. For each of\n\nthese reasons, the document is not enforceable as a contract. See id. We therefore\n\nsustain Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s first issue and hold that the trial court erred in\n\nentering judgment on the jury’s answer to Question 1, rather than disregarding it as\n\nan immaterial finding on a question of law. 6\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s second issue addresses whether the trial court\n\nshould have determined the amount of damages due for Cates’s breach of the\n\n6\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue in a footnote, “Should this Court find error,\n      [Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI] fail to demonstrate reversible error,” citing Texas\n      Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.1(a)(1). They reiterate this same argument,\n      always in footnotes and using exactly the same language, regarding each of\n      the eleven issues raised by Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI. They do not elaborate\n      on these arguments with any citations to other authority, the record, or any\n      briefing whatsoever. Cates, Industrial, and GTS have thus not raised any\n      particular issue or argument with respect to reversible error. See TEX. R.\n      APP. P. 38.1(i) (“The [appellant’s] brief must contain a clear and concise\n      argument for the contentions made, with appropriate citations to authorities\n      and to the record.”), 38.2(a)(1) (“An appellee’s brief must conform to the\n      requirements of Rule 38.1,” with exceptions not relevant here.). We have,\n      however, considered and applied the reversibility requirements set forth in\n      Rule of Appellate Procedure 44.1 to each issue raised by the parties. See\n      TEX. R. APP.

No evidence indicates that he did. Rather, the three men\n\noperated somewhat independently, and it was Cates, not the others, who eventually\n\nopted to leave PRI and operate his business independently. This second factor\n\ndoes not support the existence of a fiduciary relationship. The absence of support\n\nfor this factor also renders the third factor—whether Cates’s reliance is\n\njustifiable—inapplicable.\n\n      Finally, we note that “the special relationship of trust and confidence must\n\nexist prior to, and apart from, the agreement made the basis of the suit.” Meyer,\n\n167 S.W.3d at 331; see Schlumberger, 959 S.W.2d at 177. No evidence indicates\n\nthat the parties had such a special relationship that pre-dated the purported\n\nagreements at issue in this suit.\n\n      We hold that, as a matter of law, the evidence does not support the jury’s\n\nfinding that Bergin and Jacquin were fiduciaries of Cates. 8 We sustain Bergin,\n\n\n\n\n8\n      We note that the jury awarded damages to PRI for Cates’s breach of a\n      fiduciary duty. No party challenges that award or the jury’s liability findings\n      underlying the award. We note, however, that the award to PRI is based on\n      a different theory—Cates’s relationship to PRI—than that supporting\n      Cates’s recovery against Bergin and Jacquin and is therefore not affected by\n      our holding here.\n\n\n                                         31\n\fJacquin, and PRI’s third issue 9 and reverse the trial court’s awards of damages for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duties by Bergin and Jacquin. 10\n\nC.

Therefore, according to Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI, the\n\ntrial court should have disregarded the jury’s findings relevant to that claim.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not cite any authority in connection with their\n\nfourth issue.

In paragraph 13 of the judgment, it awarded $281,000, the amount\n      found by the jury, against “Bergin . . . jointly and severally with . . .\n      Jacquin.” Then, in paragraph 14 of the judgment, it awarded 40% of that\n      amount to “Jacquin, jointly and severally with . . . Bergin.” We reverse both\n      awards, as both depend on the same liability findings.\n11\n      We also note that, contrary to PRI’s position, a claim for tortious\n      interference with prospective business relations does not necessarily require\n      proof of a prospective contract; it may instead involve interference with a\n      continuing relationship that has not been reduced to a formal contract.

Commission-split and rent agreement\n\n      In their fifth issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue that the trial court should\n\nhave disregarded the jury’s findings regarding the purported 70-30 commission-\n\nsplit and rent agreement.      In support, they make two arguments: (1) “any\n\nagreement relating to commission split and payment of rent was subsumed in the\n\nincomplete April 12, 2010 agreement draft which the jury found Defendant Cates\n\nbreached first,” and (2) there is no evidence or legally insufficient evidence that\n\nPRI did not comply with its obligations “under an alleged agreement to make\n\ncommission payments.”\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI again cite no legal authority in connection with this\n\nissue. They do cite to the record, but their record references do not support their\n\nargument that the parties intended that the April 12 document would supersede the\n\npurported commission-split and rent agreement, nor do they demonstrate that Cates\n\nreceived all monies that he claimed under that agreement. We also note that their\n\n\n\n                                         34\n\fbriefing regarding the purported commission-split and rent agreement in the trial\n\ncourt, like their briefing here, fails to cite any legal authorities supporting the\n\nargument that the agreement had been superseded or subsumed into any other\n\nagreement. Finally, we note that the April 12 document—which we have already\n\nheld was not a binding contract—does not contain a merger clause or other\n\nindication that the parties intended it to supersede any prior agreements. Bergin,\n\nJacquin, and PRI do not articulate any argument as to why we should construe it as\n\nhaving such an effect, even assuming that it was binding.\n\n      Because Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not cite legal authority or evidence to\n\nsupport their fifth issue, we overrule it as inadequately briefed.

But “[w]hen an indebtedness can be discharged by payment of\n\n\n\n\n                                          36\n\fmoney generally, an action in conversion is inappropriate.” Id. (quoting Eckman,\n\n757 S.W.2d at 398).\n\n      Jury Question 34 asked whether “[PRI], Bergin, and/or Jacquin convert[ed]\n\nproperty belonging to Cy Cates individually, [Industrial], and/or [GTS].” The\n\naccompanying instructions properly instructed the jury regarding the elements of\n\nconversion, although they did not distinguish between personal property and\n\nmoney. Instead, the instructions defined “personal property” to include “items\n\nordinarily considered to be personal property (e.g. cars, jewelry), in addition to\n\nconfidential information, such as customer lists and trade secrets, and money,\n\nincluding bank deposits and rental proceeds.” They did not define “confidential\n\ninformation” or “trade secrets.”\n\n      The record does not contain any evidence that Cates, Industrial, or GTS had\n\nany right to computer and phone equipment or confidential information that they\n\nobtained from PRI. Rather, their claims to such equipment and information are\n\npremised on the purported terms of the parties’ agreement to split PRI into two\n\nentities. But, as we have already held, no legally-binding agreement exists. As for\n\ncommissions that Cates and Industrial earned, the parties make no attempt to\n\nidentify that money as associated with a particular chattel.       An action for\n\nconversion of that money is therefore inappropriate. See Edlund, 842 S.W.2d at\n\n727 (quoting Eckman, 757 S.W.2d at 398).\n\n\n\n                                        37\n\f      We hold that the record contains legally insufficient evidence that PRI\n\nconverted any property of Cates, Industrial, or GTS. We therefore sustain Bergin,\n\nJacquin, and PRI’s sixth issue.\n\nF.    Oppressive conduct\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI contend in their seventh issue that there is no or\n\ninsufficient evidence to support the jury’s liability finding and damages award for\n\nBergin and Jacquin’s oppressive conduct against Cates. They contend that they\n\ntook all of the allegedly oppressive actions in their capacities as officers and\n\ndirectors of PRI, not as individuals, and that such actions were proper.\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI failed to raise\n\nthis issue in the trial court and thus did not preserve it for appeal. Although PRI’s\n\ninitial motion for new trial challenged the sufficiency of the evidence regarding\n\noppressive conduct, Bergin and Jacquin did not join that motion.           They did,\n\nhowever, join PRI’s amended motion for new trial after the trial court amended its\n\njudgment.   They have therefore preserved their legal-sufficiency argument on\n\noppressive conduct for purposes of appeal. See TEX. R. CIV. P. 324(b); T.O.\n\nStanley Boot Co., 847 S.W.2d at 220.\n\n      On appeal, however, they have waived this issue by inadequate briefing.\n\nBergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not cite any evidence in support of their argument\n\nother than testimony that PRI held a board meeting to which Cates was invited.\n\n\n\n                                         38\n\fThey cite only three cases in support of their arguments, all of which have been\n\noverruled or disapproved by the Supreme Court of Texas.

Moreover, these cases do not support the proposition for which\n\nBergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue: that, as a matter of law, a shareholder of a closely-\n\nheld entity does not oppress another shareholder, so long as he acts solely in an\n\nofficial capacity to carry out the allegedly oppressive acts.\n\n      We hold that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have waived their seventh issue.\n\nG.    Employment agreement\n\n      In their ninth issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI argue that no or insufficient\n\nevidence supports the jury’s award of zero damages for Cates’s breach of his\n\nemployment agreement with PRI and that the trial court therefore erred in denying\n\nPRI attorney’s fees on that claim.        The jury found that Cates breached his\n\nemployment agreement, but it awarded no damages for that breach. Although the\n\njury awarded attorney’s fees to PRI, the trial court did not award those fees in the\n\n\n\n\n                                          39\n\fjudgment because PRI did not recover damages on its breach-of-contract claim\n\nrelated to the employment agreement.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not cite to any authority in support of their\n\nargument. More significantly, they also do not cite to any relevant evidence. In\n\nfact, they do not cite to or identify the employment agreement or its terms. Rather,\n\nthey cite only to expert testimony regarding damages caused by Cates’s actions\n\ngenerally. They do not explain how any action by Cates breached any term of the\n\nalleged employment agreement or explain what damages suffered by PRI are\n\nattributable to any such breach.\n\n      Given their failure to identify the employment agreement, its terms, or any\n\nrelevant authority, we hold that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have waived their ninth\n\nissue by inadequately briefing it. See TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i); Tesoro Petroleum,\n\n106 S.W.3d at 128.\n\n                                   Attorney’s Fees\n\n      In their eighth issue, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI challenge the trial court’s\n\naward of attorney’s fees to Cates, Industrial, and GTS. They contend that (1) the\n\nfee amounts awarded by the jury were unreasonable and excessive; (2) Cates,\n\nIndustrial, and GTS did not segregate their attorney’s fees between claims for\n\nwhich fees are recoverable and those for which they are not; and (3) Cates either\n\ndid not recover or should not have recovered on each claim for which fees are\n\n\n\n                                         40\n\frecoverable.     Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI\n\nwaived this issue by failing to raise it in the charge conference or when the\n\nevidence of fees was presented.\n\n      The following comprises the entirety of the briefing on Bergin, Jacquin, and\n\nPRI’s first two arguments:\n\n      The Court erred in failing to disregard the jury’s answers to Question\n      No 54 and in awarding attorney fees to Defendants Cates, Power Reps\n      Industrial, LLC, (now Cy Cates Energy Reps, LLC) and Global\n      Transformer Specialists, Inc. for the reasons that\n\n      (a)      the fee amounts found by the jury were unreasonable and\n               excessive relative to any respective claims upon which\n               Defendants could have been entitled to recover attorney fees;\n               [and]\n\n      (b)      Defendants’ [sic] failed to segregate its [sic] claims for attorney\n               fees for any respective claim on which Defendants sought to\n               recover attorney fees[.]\n\nBergin, Jacquin, and PRI do not cite or refer to any authority or evidence to\n\nsupport these arguments. We therefore hold that they have waived these points.\n\nSee TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1(i); Tesoro Petroleum, 106 S.W.3d at 128.\n\n      In their third argument, Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI attack each basis on which\n\nCates, Industrial, and GTS could have recovered attorney’s fees. Specifically, they\n\ncontend that the jury’s finding that Cates breached the April 12 “agreement”\n\nundermines recovery on that basis. They also insist that the trial court should have\n\ndisregarded the jury’s finding on Cates, Industrial, and GTS’s theft claim because\n\n\n\n                                            41\n\fthe only evidence of any theft was that Cates stole property from PRI. Finally,\n\nthey assert that the trial court should have disregarded the jury’s finding that PRI\n\nbreached the purported 70-30 commission-split and rent agreement.\n\n       Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have waived this third argument, as well. They\n\nagain fail to cite any authority in support of their contentions. Their only citations\n\nto the record are to demonstrate purported bad acts by Cates, not to demonstrate\n\nthe absence of evidence supporting any portion of the judgment regarding a cause\n\nof action for which fees are recoverable. We therefore hold that they have waived\n\ntheir third attack on the attorney’s fees award by inadequately briefing it. See TEX.\n\nR. APP. P. 38.1(i); Tesoro Petroleum, 106 S.W.3d at 128.\n\n       Because Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have waived their eighth issue, we\n\noverrule it.12\n\n\n12\n       We note that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI raise a fourth argument under the\n       heading of “Argument on Point of Error Eight:” that the trial court should\n       have disregarded the jury’s award of zero damages for Cates’s breach of his\n       employment agreement. This point, however, has nothing to do with the\n       trial court’s award of attorney’s fees to Cates, Industrial, and GTS, as those\n       parties cannot recover fees in connection with that claim.

Indeed, Bergin,\n       Jacquin, and PRI do not mention fees in connection with this point. Rather,\n       the argument focuses entirely on damages connected to the employment\n       agreement.

We\n\nagree with Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI that the April 12 document does not mention\n\nthe PRIHouston.com domain name or associated assets and that the document is\n\nnot enforceable as a contract. It therefore does not explicitly confer upon Cates\n\nany ownership or rights to control the assets at stake.\n\n\n\n                                          45\n\f      Our inquiry does not end there, however, as the rights conferred by the\n\nApril 12 document are not the only bases upon which the trial court could have\n\nrendered its judgment. Jury Question 55 asked:\n\n      Do you find that the April 12, 2010 agreement, if any, permitted Cy\n      Cates to operate and market his business as Power Reps Industrial\n      (now Cy Cates Energy Reps, LLC) and Cy Cates purchased the\n      internet domain “PRIHouston.com” and developed the website with\n      Cy Cates’ funds in furtherance of that agreement[?]\n\nThe judgment stated simply, “Cy Cates is awarded full and exclusive right,\n\ncustody, use, and control of [the] PRIHouston.com website, domain, webpage, and\n\nassociated email accounts.”\n\n      In other words, neither Question 55 nor the judgment depended on rights\n\nexpressly conferred by the April 12, 2010 document. Rather, the jury was asked\n\nwhether it “permitted” Cates to take certain actions, including purchasing the\n\nPRIHouston.com domain name and developing the associated website.\n\n      It is undisputed that Cates purchased the PRIHouston.com domain name,\n\nusing his personal credit card, in August 2010, months after execution of the April\n\n12, 2010 document. The document does not mention that domain name, nor does\n\nit prohibit Cates from using any particular names or marks in marketing and\n\npromoting Industrial. The jury’s finding thus is compatible with the evidence: in\n\nthe absence of an enforceable agreement in the April 12 document prohibiting\n\nCates’s actions, and given testimony that Cates attempted to act consistently with\n\n\n\n                                        46\n\fthat document in registering the domain name, there is evidence that the document\n\n“permitted” his actions and that he acted “in furtherance of” the purported\n\nagreement.\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI make no attempt to show that the trial court abused\n\nits discretion by granting declaratory relief.    They do not cite the Uniform\n\nDeclaratory Judgments Act or any standard of review. Instead, they simply argue\n\nthat (1) the April 12 document does not support the declaration and (2) the\n\ndeclaration will promote unfair competition. But as we have already observed,\n\nneither jury Question 55 nor the trial court’s judgment was expressly based on\n\nrights conferred by the April 12 document. Rather, the question posed to the jury\n\nwas whether the document “permitted” his actions, and the jury’s affirmative\n\nfinding is not inconsistent with the evidence. As to the second argument, unfair\n\ncompetition was not a cause of action or defense in this case, and the trial court\n\nwas not required to address questions of unfair competition in order to enter\n\njudgment on the jury’s verdict regarding ownership of the disputed assets.\n\n      We hold that Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI have failed to show that the trial\n\ncourt abused its discretion in granting declaratory relief to Cates. We therefore\n\noverrule their tenth issue.\n\n\n\n\n                                        47\n\f                   Cates, Industrial, and GTS’s Cross-Appeal\n\nA.    Damages for breach of the April 12 agreement\n\n      Cates, Industrial, and GTS argue in their first issue on cross-appeal that the\n\ntrial court erred by failing to award damages of $283,000 for Bergin and Jacquin’s\n\nbreach of the April 12, 2010 document, as found by the jury in response to\n\nQuestion 5. They contend that, because Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI did not raise\n\nCates’s prior material breach of that document as an affirmative defense, it was\n\nerror for the trial court to apply that breach as a bar to recovery. We do not reach\n\nthose arguments because the April 12, 2010 document is not an enforceable\n\ncontract. We therefore overrule the first cross-issue as moot.\n\nB.    Expert witness fees and costs related to special master\n\n      We now turn to Cates, Industrial, and GTS’s second and final issue, which\n\nhas the potential to affect the amounts recoverable under the judgment, before\n\nturning to the calculation of interest on those amounts. First, Cates, Industrial, and\n\nGTS argue that the trial court erred in refusing to award as costs their accountant’s\n\nfees, to which they claim they were entitled for “good cause” shown under Rule of\n\nCivil Procedure 141 by virtue of a pair of Rule 11 agreements. Second, they argue\n\nthat they were entitled to an award of expenses related to the discovery special\n\nmaster. Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI respond to both arguments that such costs were\n\n\n\n\n                                         48\n\fnot recoverable and, to the extent that the trial court had discretion to award them,\n\nit did not abuse that discretion.\n\n      “The successful party to a suit shall recover of his adversary all costs\n\nincurred therein, except where otherwise provided.” TEX.

The trial court’s judgment awarded damages to PRI and against Cates for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty and conversion. Moreover, Cates, Industrial, and GTS do\n\nnot attempt to link the costs of the financial audit to any particular claim or\n\ndefense, nor did they attempt to do so in their motion for costs in the trial court.\n\nThey complain that the costs were necessary and assert that they prevailed, but the\n\nrecord does not support their assertions. On the contrary, to the extent that the\n\nfinancial audits were relevant to the claims that Cates breached a fiduciary duty or\n\nconverted property of PRI, those are claims on which Cates lost. We cannot say,\n\nbased on this record, that the trial court abused its discretion in allowing each party\n\nto bear its own costs in connection with the first accounting audit and report.\n\n       The second agreement, made under Rule of Civil Procedure 11, governed a\n\nsubsequent report. It provides, “Each accountant[’s] costs in complying with this\n\nRule 11 and issuance of the amended/supplemental report shall be totaled, then\n\nsplit equally between the parties.” According to Cates, Industrial, and GTS, in this\n\ndocument “the parties agreed on a way to treat these costs in this enforceable court\n\norder, which constitutes sufficient ‘good cause’ to tax at least half of the total cost\n\nof the Supplemental Joint Report against PRI, Bergin and Jacquin.”                They\n\n\n\n                                          52\n\fconclude that the trial court “erred in not taxing them as such,” relying on Rule 11\n\nand Eaton Metal Products, L.L.C. v.

Further, the Rule 11 agreement did not require\n\nthe trial court to do anything with respect to the costs of the supplemental report.\n\nInstead, it provided merely that the costs “shall be totaled, then split equally.” It\n\nmade no mention of court costs, Rule 131, Rule 141, or any other basis for the trial\n\ncourt to award the expenses in question as costs, which the trial court otherwise\n\nhas no authority to do.

Cates, Industrial, and GTS\n\nrespond that each portion of the trial court’s calculations and interest award was\n\nsupported by the evidence and controlling or persuasive authority.\n\n      The trial court’s judgment first awarded $351,000 to PRI against Cates for\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty and conversion. It then awarded $200,000 to Cates,\n\n\n\n                                          55\n\fIndustrial, and GTS against PRI for tortious interference, conversion, and breach of\n\nthe commission-split and rent agreement. The trial court offset these amounts and\n\nadded to the result $682,000 in attorney’s fees, which it awarded to Cates,\n\nIndustrial, and GTS. The trial court concluded that this resulted in a net judgment\n\nto Cates, Industrial, and GTS against PRI in the amount of $531,000. The trial\n\ncourt awarded prejudgment interest on this amount.\n\n      The trial court then proceeded to award $283,000 to Cates, against Bergin\n\nand Jacquin, jointly and severally, for breach of fiduciary duty and oppressive\n\nbehavior, along with prejudgment interest on that amount. It then awarded 40% of\n\nthat same amount, or $113,200, to Cates, against Bergin and Jacquin, jointly and\n\nseverally, for the same claims, and further prejudgment interest on that amount. 15\n\n      Although we reverse portions of the trial court’s judgment today, numerous\n\nawards of fees and damages remain undisturbed: (1) the award to Cates, Industrial,\n\nand GTS for tortious interference with prospective contracts, (2) the award to Cates\n\nfor oppressive conduct, (3) the award to Cates, Industrial, and GTS for breach of\n\nthe commission-split and rent agreement, (4) the award to PRI for Cates’s breach\n\n\n15\n      In our holding on Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s third issue, however, we\n      determined that no evidence supported the jury’s finding that Bergin and\n      Jacquin breached a fiduciary duty owed to Cates. These awards are\n      therefore reversed to the extent that they reflect damages for Cates’s breach\n      of fiduciary duty claim, and we mention them here only to explain the trial\n      court’s calculations relevant to prejudgment interest.\n\n\n                                         56\n\fof fiduciary duties, (5) the award to PRI for conversion, and (6) the attorney’s fees\n\nawarded to each party. We therefore consider whether the trial court’s judgment\n\ncontains error in its award of prejudgment interest on these amounts.\n\nA.    Prejudgment interest on attorney’s fees\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI first argue that the effect of the trial court’s\n\njudgment was to award prejudgment interest on attorney’s fees and that this\n\nconstitutes error. We agree.\n\n      Generally speaking, prejudgment interest is not available on attorney’s fees.\n\nSee Hervey v.

We\n\ndisagree that this case calls for any special consideration or novel analysis with\n\nrespect to interest calculations. Applying the prejudgment interest rate to the\n\ncombined parts of the net judgment has the same effect as applying that rate to\n\neach component of the judgment, assuming the starting dates are chosen correctly.\n\nIn other words, the legal question is simply whether prejudgment interest is\n\navailable on attorney’s fees, not whether it is available on a sum that happens to\n\n\n\n                                           58\n\finvolve attorney’s fees. While this case may present an unusual factual posture, it\n\ndoes not present any legal issues of first impression.\n\n      We hold that the trial court erred by applying prejudgment interest to the\n\nattorney’s fees award to Cates, Industrial, and GTS. We note that the judgment\n\ndoes not identify the dates from which prejudgment interest should run against any\n\nparty, nor does it calculate prejudgment interest up to the date of judgment. We\n\ntherefore remand the case to the trial court for correction of its interest\n\ncalculations. On remand, the trial court should determine the appropriate start date\n\nfor prejudgment interest on each award of damages and calculate that interest\n\nseparately for each award of damages. It should not apply any prejudgment\n\ninterest on attorney’s fees. Only after performing these calculations should the\n\ntrial court consider whether any offsets in the resulting amounts are appropriate.\n\nB.    Prejudgment interest against Bergin and Jacquin\n\n      Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI also argue that the trial court’s award of\n\nprejudgment interest against Bergin and Jacquin constitutes error. They premise\n\nthis argument on two assertions: (1) “the damages found by the jury for breach of\n\nfiduciary duty and oppressive conduct were already considered by the Court in\n\noffsetting the damage awards to arrive at the prejudgment interest on the ‘net’\n\njudgment amount noted in the preceding paragraph;” and (2) once the “excessive\n\nand improper attorney fee award for Cates” is removed from the calculation, there\n\n\n\n                                          59\n\fis no net judgment for Cates, Industrial, and GTS for purposes of prejudgment\n\ninterest calculations. They do not cite to the record or to any authority in support\n\nof these arguments.\n\n       The first argument is factually incorrect.    The offsetting awards in the\n\njudgment are the award to PRI for breach of fiduciary duty and conversion and the\n\naward to Cates, Industrial, and GTS against PRI for tortious interference,\n\nconversion, and breach of the commission-split and rent agreement. The awards to\n\nCates individually for Bergin and Jacquin’s breaches of fiduciary duty—which we\n\nhave reversed—and oppression are not included in the calculation. We therefore\n\nreject the first argument.\n\n       We also reject the second argument—that the “excessive and improper\n\nattorney fee award to Cates” must be removed—because we have already held that\n\nBergin, Jacquin, and PRI waived their attack on the attorney’s fees award itself by\n\ninadequately briefing their eighth issue.\n\n       We sustain Bergin, Jacquin, and PRI’s eleventh issue in part and overrule it\n\nin part.\n\n                                     Conclusion\n\n       We reverse the trial court’s judgment to the extent that it relies on the jury\n\nfinding that the April 12, 2010 document was an enforceable agreement and\n\ndeclare that it is unenforceable. As an unenforceable agreement, that document\n\n\n\n                                            60\n\fcannot serve as a basis for awarding damages or attorney’s fees. We also reverse\n\nthe trial court’s award of damages against Bergin and Jacquin for breach of\n\nfiduciary duties owed to Cates. We further reverse the award against PRI for\n\nconversion and render judgment that Cates take nothing by that claim. Finally, we\n\nreverse the trial court’s inclusion of attorney’s fees in its calculation of\n\nprejudgment interest. We otherwise affirm the judgment of the trial court. We\n\nremand the case to the trial court for calculation of prejudgment interest in\n\naccordance with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                            Harvey Brown\n                                            Justice\n\nPanel consists of Justices Keyes, Higley, and Brown.\n\n\n\n\n                                       61\n\f</pre>",
