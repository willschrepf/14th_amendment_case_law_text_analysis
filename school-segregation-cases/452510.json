United States, 1976, 429 U.S. 990, 97 S.Ct. 517, 50 L.Ed.2d 603, we have reconsidered the Austin School case, United States v. Texas Education Agency, 5 Cir. 1976, 532 F.2d 380 (Austin II ), in light of Washington v. Davis, 1976, 426 U.S. 229, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 48 L.Ed.2d 597.  We reaffirm our reversal of the district court's judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After restudy of our two earlier decisions and the record, we again hold that the evidence overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that the Austin School Board, Austin Independent School District (AISD), engaged in acts showing a pervasive intent to segregate Mexican-Americans.  Dayton Board of Education v. Brinkman, --- U.S. ----, 97 S.Ct. 2766, 53 L.Ed.2d 851 (1977), however, as we read it, compels the remand of the case for a hearing so that the AISD may submit and the district court approve a tri-ethnic desegregation plan consistent with the decisions of this Court and of the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seven years after the Attorney General of the United States initiated this tri-ethnic school desegregation suit under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000c-6, it comes to this Court for the third time, this time on remand from the Supreme Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Texas Education Agency, 5 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 848 (en banc), Austin I, this Court held, with respect to black students, that \"the AISD has not dismantled the state-imposed (segregated school) system based on race\".  The district court had entered an order approving a plan that closed black secondary schools.  The students in those schools were assigned to Anglo secondary schools.  This plan scattered blacks of secondary school age through the district, but put the entire burden of transportation on blacks.  We held, \"The AISD has not fulfilled its 'affirmative duty to take whatever steps might be necessary to convert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination would be eliminated root and branch' \".  467 F.2d at 870.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Mexican-American students, we held that the district court was clearly erroneous in finding that the AISD had not practiced segregation against that identifiable ethnic minority.  We held that through various actions AISD officials \"caused and perpetuated the segregation of Mexican-American students within the (Austin) school system\".  467 F.2d at 865-866.  We ordered that the school system \"be converted to a unitary system on a tri-ethnic, desegregated basis\".  467 F.2d at 871.  The en banc court of fourteen was unanimous in holding that AISD intentionally discriminated against Mexican-Americans and was divided only as to how desegregation should be accomplished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court was at a disadvantage in carrying out the mandate in Austin I in view of the decision of a majority of our Court rejecting a motion to clarify the remedy (the vote was nine to five).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  5 Cir., 470 F.2d 1001.  The district court also had to consider the Supreme Court's supervening decision in Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 1973, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548.  The district court reiterated its earlier holding that \"the AISD . . .  has engaged in discriminatory assignment of black students to promote segregation\".  The court ordered the black high school and junior high school closed, again throwing the burden of busing only on the blacks.  The district court held that its finding of past intentional segregation of blacks constituted a prima facie case of intentional segregation of Mexican-Americans.  It concluded, however, that the AISD had rebutted this prima facie case by demonstrating that there was no intentional discrimination against Mexican-American students.  Nevertheless, the court included them in the limited desegregation remedy it approved for blacks.  That remedy was to desegregate one grade in the black elementary schools the sixth leaving segregation untouched in the district's other grades and schools.  Mexican-American children were left in their segregated facilities, except for those who attended the Sixth Grade Center.  The district court approved certain worthy bilingual and bicultural programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unique limitation on desegregation to the sixth grade in black schools, which the AISD proposed and was approved by the district court, raises a fair inference that the AISD intended to continue extensive segregation of Mexican-Americans.  The AISD suggests that the 1974 Education Amendments,20 U.S.C. &#167; 1701 et seq.  (1976 Supp.), somehow support this blanket exclusion.  There are two answers to this contention.  First, as the AISD in its own brief correctly observes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>\"the provisions of this chapter are not intended to modify or diminish the authority of the courts of the United States to enforce fully the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\"  20 U.S.C. &#167; 1702(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the 1974 amendments do not support the wholesale exclusion of entire grades from a desegregation plan.  They merely \"find\" that \"the risks and harms created by excessive transportation are particularly great for children enrolled in the first six grades\".  20 U.S.C. &#167; 1702(a)(5) (emphasis added).  This legislation does not purport to prohibit desegregation of children at such grade levels, but points out the obvious; as the Supreme Court said in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., 402 U.S. 1, 31, 91 S.Ct. 1267, 28 L.Ed.2d 554, age is one factor in evaluating the \"practicalities\" of a transportation plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In United States v. Texas Education Agency, 5 Cir. 1976, 532 F.2d 380 (Austin II ), the district court's finding of de jure discrimination against blacks was not appealed.  We again reversed the district court's holding that the AISD had not subjected Mexican-American students to intentional discrimination.  We held that the plaintiffs had made out an unrebutted prima facie case of segregation of Mexican-American students.  We further held that the Sixth Grade Plan part time desegregation for some was \"constitutionally insufficient\".  We instructed the district court to \"draft a comprehensive tri-ethnic desegregation plan\" that would \"conform to one of the approaches outlined by Dr. Finger in his written submission of August 14, 1972, and in his testimony\".  532 F.2d at 399.  (Dr. Finger was the court-appointed expert in Swann.)  The Finger Plan, submitted by the Mexican-American intervenors, envisioned the conversion of the Austin school system to a 4-4-4 or a 5-3-4 grade structure in which all students \"in elementary schools that are over 50 percent minority would be bused to elementary schools that are over 90 percent Anglo\", and middle school students \"in schools that are over 90 percent Anglo would be bused to schools that are over 50 percent minority\".  532 F.2d at 395.  High school integration would be accomplished \"by selecting, for each high school, feeder schools that would maximize the integration of that high school\".  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The AISD petitioned for a writ of certiorari.  The United States, in its brief on certiorari, had doubts about this Court's rationale in Austin II, but contended that the judgment was correct in holding \"that the AISD engaged in pervasive acts of discrimination against Mexican-Americans\".  The Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacated our decision, and remanded the case to us \"for reconsideration in light of Washington v. Davis.\"  We now review our decision in Austin II in light of this mandate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note at the outset, our determination that the AISD practiced intentional discrimination against black students is not in issue; the AISD did not appeal the district court's finding to this effect in Austin II.  532 F.2d at 392.  Moreover, because Washington v. Davis is concerned with the evidentiary showing necessary to establish an equal protection violation in those situations where there has been no law specifically requiring segregation, that decision is inapplicable \"where a statutory dual system has ever existed\", Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 1973, 413 U.S. 189, 201, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 2694, 37 L.Ed.2d 548, 559.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  Our concern here, therefore, is with the effect of Washington v. Davis on our holding that the AISD unconstitutionally discriminated against Mexican-American students.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Washington v. Davis the Supreme Court held that otherwise neutral state action does not violate the fourteenth amendment's equal protection clause \"solely\" because it has a disproportionate impact on a racial minority.  Instead, courts must \"adhere to the basic equal protection principle that the invidious quality of a law claimed to be racially discriminatory must ultimately be traced to a racially discriminatory purpose<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>\".  426 U.S. at 240, 96 S.Ct. at 2048.  The use of the word \"solely\" was clarified by Mr. Justice White, organ of the Court.  He was careful to point out that a racially disproportionate effect may be an important evidentiary consideration in evaluating whether state action was discriminatorially motivated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p>Necessarily, an invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the fact, if it is true, that the law bears more heavily on one race than another.  It is also not infrequently true that the discriminatory impact . . .  may for all practical purposes demonstrate unconstitutionality because in various circumstances the discrimination is very difficult to explain on nonracial grounds.  . . .  Disproportionate impact is not irrelevant, but it is not the sole touchstone of invidious racial discrimination forbidden by the Constitution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">426 U.S. at 242, 96 S.Ct. at 2049.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More recently, in Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 1977, 429 U.S. 252, 97 S.Ct. 555, 50 L.Ed.2d 450, upholding the constitutionality of a local zoning decision that had a disproportionate effect on blacks, the Supreme Court elaborated upon its holding in Washington v. Davis by detailing evidentiary guidelines under which the discriminatory intent requirement of Washington v. Davis could be satisfied.  Mr. Justice Powell, for the Court, carefully noted that Washington v. Davis \"does not require a plaintiff to prove that the challenged action rested solely on racially discriminatory purposes\".  (Emphasis added).  429 U.S. at 97 S.Ct. at 563.  In his opinion he stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p>The impact of the official action whether it 'bears more heavily on one race than another,' Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. at 242 (96 S.Ct. 2040) may provide an important starting point.  Sometimes a clear pattern, unexplainable on grounds other than race, emerges from the effect of the state action even when the governing legislation appears neutral on its face.  . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p>The historical background of the decision is (another) evidentiary source, particularly if it reveals a series of official actions taken for invidious purposes.  . . .  The specific sequence of events leading up the challenged decision also may shed some light on the decisionmaker's purposes.  . . .  Departures from the normal procedural sequence also might afford evidence that improper purposes are playing a role.  Substantive departures too may be relevant, particularly if the factors usually considered important by the decisionmaker strongly favor a decision contrary to the one reached.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">429 U.S. at 266-67, 97 S.Ct. at 564.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Austin II, as will be discussed more fully, we referred to the neighborhood assignment system as neutral on its face, but observed that all of the evidence showed that the AISD resorted to that system only when it would produce the maximum feasible separation of Anglos from Mexican-Americans.  When it did not, the AISD resorted to gerrymandering, dual-overlapping zones, discriminatory school siting and capacity decision (tailoring the design, location, and size of a school to fit only a racial or ethnic group), and other discriminatory devices.  The package demonstrated a pervasive intent to discriminate against Mexican-Americans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The principle that plaintiffs challenging official action as racially or ethnically discriminatory must show the existence of a purpose or intent to discriminate was foreshadowed in Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 1973, 413 U.S. 189, 93 S.Ct. 2686, 37 L.Ed.2d 548, three years before our decision in Austin II.  In writing Austin II we were conscious of the Court's statement in Keyes, \"We emphasize that the differentiating factor between de jure segregation and so-called de facto segregation . . .  is purpose or intent to segregate.\"  (Emphasis in original.) 413 U.S. at 208, 93 S.Ct. at 2697.  The essential element of de jure segregation is \"a current condition of segregation resulting from intentional state action\".  413 U.S. at 205, 93 S.Ct. at 2696.  The Court in Keyes, however, did not explicate whether the discriminatory intent necessary to make out an equal protection violation in school desegregation cases was to be determined (a) under a subjective standard, which would require a court to determine whether the official decisionmakers harbored a subjective desire to segregate or discriminate<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> or (b) under an objective standard, by which the official decisionmakers would be held to have intended the reasonably foreseeable consequences of their decisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We understand the difficulties inherent in employing a subjective intent test to determine whether school board authorities practiced impermissible de jure segregation against minority students.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  In Austin II, therefore, we adopted an objective test for ascertaining discriminatory intent and \"incorporat(ed) in school segregation law the ordinary rule of tort law that a person intends the natural and foreseeable consequences of his actions\".  532 F.2d at 388.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> In reading the \"natural and foreseeable consequences\" test into the necessary requirement of segregative intent (Washington v. Davis ), this Circuit stands not alone, but in company with four other circuits.  Hart v. Community School Board of Education, New York School District # 21, 2 Cir. 1975, 512 F.2d 37, 50-51 (a well articulated decision); Morgan v. Kerrigan, 1 Cir. 1974, 509 F.2d 580, 588, affirming Morgan v. Hennigan, D.Mass.1974, 379 F.Supp. 410, 478, cert. denied, 1975, 421 U.S. 963, 95 S.Ct. 1950, 44 L.Ed.2d 449; Oliver v.

Milliken, 6th Cir. 1973, 484 F.2d 215, 222, aff'd in relevant part, 1974, 418 U.S. 717, 738 n. 18, 94 S.Ct. 3112, 41 L.Ed.2d 1069, 1087 n. 18 (adopting district court's reliance on \"natural and predictable effect\" school board policies).  Cf. United States v. Board of School Commissioners of Indianapolis, Ind., 7 Cir. 1973, 474 F.2d 81, 84-85, cert. denied, 1973, 413 U.S. 920, 93 S.Ct. 3066, 37 L.Ed.2d 1041.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In neither Washington v. Davis nor Arlington Heights did the Supreme Court directly confront the issue of what type of official intent subjective or objective a plaintiff must show to present a prima facie case of impermissible racial or ethnic discrimination or segregation under the fourteenth amendment's equal protection clause.  Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights did establish that the disproportionate racial impact of the neutral application of a long-standing neutral policy, by itself, will rarely constitute a constitutional violation.  Those decisions thus partly answered in the affirmative, one of the questions left open in Keyes \"whether a neighborhood school policy of itself will justify racial or ethnic concentrations, in the absence of a finding that school authorities have committed acts constituting de jure segregation\".<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We are well aware that some official actions on which a plaintiff hinges an allegation of unconstitutional discrimination have historically been motivated by racially and ethnically neutral bona fide concerns, such as the desire to have children attend the school closest to their home, and no showing is made that those concerns were actually subordinate to, or a subterfuge for, unconstitutional discrimination.  In those circumstances, that a discriminatory result was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the actions is insufficient to infuse the challenged acts with the type of discriminatory intent required by Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights.  Nevertheless, we emphasize that we do not read Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights as banishing from the law of racial and ethnic discrimination the venerable common law tort principle that a person intends the natural and foreseeable consequences of his actions.  When the official actions challenged as discriminatory include acts and decisions that do not have a firm basis in well accepted and historically sound non-discriminatory social policy, discriminatory intent may be inferred from the fact that those acts had foreseeable discriminatory consequences.  As a practical matter, in school desegregation cases we can envision few official actions, other than the decision to use a neighborhood school policy for student assignment, that would not be subject to the \"natural foreseeable consequences\" rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The presumption is especially probative in assessing the official intent behind such affirmative school board decisions as those concerning school locations, the construction and renovation of schools, the closing of schools, the drawing of student attendance zones, and the assignment of faculty and staff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is language in our Austin II opinion that an official discriminatory intent adequate to support a finding of de jure segregation could be inferred solely from the school board's use of a neighborhood school policy for student assignment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  To the extent that Austin II can be so read, it is inconsistent with Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights.  The Supreme Court recognized this ambiguity in vacating our decision and remanding the case to us.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Austin II, however, we analyzed the cause and effect test used in Austin I, which was the same test applied in our earlier decision in Cisneros v. Corpus Christi Independent School District, 5 Cir. 1972, 467 F.2d 142 (en banc), cert. denied, 1973, 413 U.S. 920, 93 S.Ct. 3053, 37 L.Ed.2d 1041.  In light of Keyes, we expressly rejected the argument of the Mexican-American intervenors that Keyes did not establish that segregative intent is a necessary element of unconstitutional school segregation.  We held, quoting from Morales v. Shannon, 5 Cir. 1975, 516 F.2d 411, 412-13, cert. denied, 1975, 423 U.S. 1034, 96 S.Ct. 566, 46 L.Ed.2d 408, that \"(W)ith respect to the first issue, segregatory intent, we are governed by Keyes . . .  which supervenes our holding in Cisneros . . .  to the extent that Keyes requires as a prerequisite to a decree to desegregate a de facto system, . . .  proof of segregatory intent as a part of state action\".  Austin II, 532 F.2d 380, 387.  But it was apparent to us in both Austin I and Austin II that the AISD historically had used neighborhood schools to accentuate and to perpetuate segregation of blacks and Mexican-Americans, and that it was attempting now to absolve itself of responsibility for increasing segregation by taking shelter in a supposed neutral policy of assigning students to neighborhood schools.  As the United States argued, \"When (a neighborhood school) policy has been used in concert with obvious tools of discrimination, it may come to partake of a discriminatory quality and to be an instrument of discrimination itself.\"  Brief for the United States, p. 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our finding of discriminatory intent in Austin II was not predicated \"solely\" on the AISD's use of a neighborhood student assignment policy.

Of the 58,664 students attending all of Austin's schools, 60 percent (35,342) are Anglo, 16 percent (9,378) are black, and 24 percent (13,933) are Mexican-American.  Almost 40 percent of the AISD's Mexican-American students attend schools that have a minority enrollment of greater than 90 percent.  On the high school level, 65.2 percent of the district's 17,973 students are Anglo, 14.4 percent (2,584) are black, and 20.4 percent (3,668) are Mexican-American.  While 54 percent of the Mexican-American high school students attend schools that are greater than 58 percent minority, nearly two-thirds of the Anglo high school students attend schools that are greater than 78 percent Anglo.  Mexican-American students fare no better in the junior high schools.  Forty-seven percent of them attend either Allan Jr. High or Martin Jr. High, which are 99 percent minority and 97 minority respectively.  Of the AISD's 30,275 elementary school students, 58 percent (17,692) are Anglo, 17 percent (5,122) are black, and 25 percent (7,461) are Mexican-American.  Over 46 percent of the Mexican-American elementary school children attend elementary schools that have minority enrollments ranging from 91 to 100 percent; and 55 percent of the Anglo elementary school children attend schools that are over four-fifths Anglo.  Of the school district's 61 elementary schools, only 23 have enrollments that are not over 80 percent Anglo or 80 percent minority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the AISD's neighborhood school policy played no small part in creating and maintaining this pattern of Mexican-American segregation in the Austin schools.

The AISD now says that Mexicans are whites and, of course, they usually are.  But the Mexican schools had all Mexican-American enrollments; few Mexican-Americans were assigned to Anglo schools.  The AISD maintained the segregated identity of the schools through the use of dual-overlapping attendance zones, student assignment policies, teacher assignment policies, school site selection, and gerrymandering.  The evidence clearly showed the school board's intent to segregate Mexican-American students.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  In dual-overlapping zones Anglos attended Anglo schools; Mexican-Americans attended Mexican schools.  The AISD built new schools deep inside Mexican-American neighborhoods, with a capacity keyed to serving only the Mexican-Americans.

West Avenue shared a dual-overlapping zone with Pease, an all-white school.  Whites within the zone went to Pease, and Mexican-Americans attended West Avenue.  West Avenue continued to operate as a Mexican-American school until it was closed in 1947.  Canal (Comal) Street School was opened in 1924.  School Board minutes reflect that the school was built to accommodate Mexican-American students attending three other schools.  These three schools were the only schools in the district with more than twenty Mexican-Americans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>In 1934, West Avenue and Canal (Comal) Street enrolled 45 percent of the district's Mexican-American students; Bickler had about 25 percent and Metz about 15 percent.  After the passage of a bond issue Zavala school opened.  The site for the new school was three blocks from the Mexican-American Canal (Comal) Street school which was then closed.  Zavala shared a dual-overlapping zone with Metz, one of two predominately white schools with significant numbers of Mexican-American students.  Mexican-Americans were expected to and did attend Zavala; whites attended Metz.  This is unadulterated segregation.  West Avenue and Zavala, predominately Mexican-American, were the only schools in the district which shared zones with other schools.  By 1940, West Avenue and Zavala enrolled 56 percent of the AISD's Mexican-American students.  Also at the time Zavala was built in 1935, Bickler, the other predominately white school with a significant number of Mexican-American students, was discontinued as an elementary school, and Bickler students were sent to other schools.  It is unclear as to where these students went, although some were reassigned to Winn, Palm, and Metz (Zavala).  In 1939, a committee from Winn complained of the assignment of Mexican-American students from Bickler to Winn.  Soon thereafter, some of these students were reassigned to Bickler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>467 F.2d at 866-867 (footnote omitted).

At that time the zone line for Allan Junior High School, a predominately Mexican-American facility, was moved so that many whites were zoned out of Allan and into O'Henry.  In 1956, Allan Junior High burned down.  The new Allan Junior High School was built on the same site as the old school and opened in 1957 with 75 percent Mexican-American enrollment.  In addition, the Allan Zone line was moved so that fewer whites were included in the new zone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p>In 1960, the new Johnston High School was opened in East Austin (the predominately Mexican-American section of Austin).  The suggestion for a central location for this facility was rejected, and the school was built deep in a Mexican-American area.  It opened with a 78 percent Mexican-American enrollment.  In 1967, University Junior High School was closed because the University of Texas reclaimed the property where the school was located.  Martin Junior High School was built in the heart of the Mexican-American community.  Again, centrally-located sites for the new facility were considered and rejected.  Martin opened with 77 percent Mexican-American enrollment.

In Swann, the Supreme Court cautioned that, \"(i)ndependent of student assignment, where it is possible to identify a 'white school' or a 'Negro school' simply by reference to the racial composition of teachers and staff . . .  a prima facie case of violation of substantive constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause is shown\".  402 U.S. at 18, 91 S.Ct. at 1277.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We found in Austin I that, in 1971, \"(s)ixty-five percent of the Mexican-American high school teachers, 36 percent of the Mexican-American junior high school teachers, and 77 percent of the Mexican-American elementary teachers (were) assigned to predominately Mexican-American schools\".  467 F.2d at 868.  Although no Austin school had a majority of Mexican-American faculty members, and these figures would not, by themselves, suffice to prove the AISD's intent to discriminate, they constitute another stroke in an evidentiary picture that all too clearly shows the school board's intent to discriminate against Mexican-Americans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plans adopted in 1955 and in the 1960's for the desegregation of black schools primarily allowed black students to transfer to Mexican-American schools but not to Anglo schools.

Ironically, the AISD argues that this policy was benign; it was to allow Mexican-Americans to be with their Spanish-speaking friends and their neighbors.

In Deal v.

This is so because it is acknowledged to have several valuable aspects which are an aid to education, such as minimization of safety hazards to children in reaching school, economy of cost in reducing transportation needs, ease of pupil placement and administration through the use of neutral, easily determined standards, and better home-school communication.</p>\n        <p>In his separate opinion in Keyes v.

Public schools have been a traditional source of strength to our Nation, and that strength may derive in part from the identification of many schools with the personal features of the surrounding neighborhood.  Community support, interest, and dedication to public schools may well run higher with a neighborhood attendance pattern: distance may encourage disinterest.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Nothing in Washington v.

A segregated school system is the foreseeable and inevitable result of such an assignment policy.  When this policy is used, we may infer that the school authorities have acted with segregative intent.</p>\n        <p>532 F.2d at 392.  We also said:</p>\n        <p>It has been the AISD's policy to assign students to the schools closest to their homes.  The City of Austin, with the exception of the strip between East and West Austin, has ethnically segregated housing patterns.  Hence, the natural, foreseeable, and inevitable result of the AISD's student assignment policy has been segregated schools throughout most of the city.  Moreover, as we found in Austin I, \"(a)ffirmative action to the contrary would have resulted in desegregation\".  467 F.2d at 863.  The inference is inescapable: the AISD has intended, by its continued use of the neighborhood assignment policy, to maintain segregated schools in East and West Austin.  The plaintiffs have therefore established a prima facie case of de jure segregation of Mexican-Americans in all portions of the school district except the residentially integrated central city area.</p>\n        <p>532 F.2d at 390 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> We held (the en banc decision)</p>\n        <p>\"that the AISD has, in its choice of school site locations, construction and renovation of schools, drawing of attendance zones, student assignment and transfer policies, and faculty and staff assignments, caused and perpetuated the segregation of Mexican-American students within the school system.\"</p>\n        <p>467 F.2d at 865-66.  We also found that \"(t)he natural and foreseeable consequence of these actions was segregation of Mexican-Americans.\"  467 F.2d at 863.  The Supreme Court inferred segregative intent from the same kind of circumstantial evidence in Keyes.  See 413 U.S. at 192, 93 S.Ct. 2686.  The inference of segregative intent that the Supreme Court made regarding the Denver school authorities is equally applicable to their counterparts in Austin.  In its memorandum opinion and order of February 2, 1976, the district court, citing Justice Powell's separate opinion in Keyes, 413 U.S. at 226 and 240-41, 93 S.Ct. 2686, declined to approve the construction of the proposed Southwest High School and Northeast Junior High School because the proposed schools would accentuate the desegregation problems in the district.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn13\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13_ref\">13</a>\n        <p> In so finding, we confirmed the district court's finding that there was substantial segregation of Mexican-Americans in the Austin school system, Austin II, 532 F.2d at 389.

The district court, however, erred in assuming that there could be no discriminatory intent where segregative actions were prompted by what at the time was thought to be benign motive.  As we held in Austin I, 467 F.2d at 869, and reiterated in Austin II, 532 F.2d at 391,</p>\n        <p>we are not convinced that, to meet the special educational needs of Mexican-American children, the AISD had to keep these children in separate schools, isolate them in Mexican-American neighborhoods, or prevent them from sharing in the educational, social, and psychological benefits of an integrated education.  . . .

See McNeal v. Tate County School District, 5 Cir. 1975, 508 F.2d 1017, disapproving ability groupings within schools that result in segregated classrooms where ability groupings are a product of a previously segregated school system.  Furthermore, as the Mexican-American and black intervenors assert, \"(i)t is difficult . . .  to see how the segregation of Spanish-speaking children into schools and classrooms where teachers were forbidden by (Texas state) law to speak Spanish and instruction was provided in English only could have resulted from 'benign' motivation\".

Manning v. M/V \"Sea Road\", 5 Cir. 1969, 417 F.2d 603, 607.

In tri-ethnic school districts such as Austin's, proof that one minority group was subject to statutorily enforced segregation will thus support a presumption that the other minority group was also subject to the same dual school system.  The school board can overcome this presumption by showing that \"the geographical structure of, or the natural boundaries within, a school district may have the effect of dividing the district into separate, identifiable and unrelated units\".  Id. The second presumption is that \"even if it is determined that different areas of the school district should be viewed independently of each other\", \"a finding of intentionally segregative school board actions in a meaningful portion of a school system . . .  creates a presumption that other segregated schooling within the system is not adventitious\".  413 U.S. at 208, 93 S.Ct. at 2697.  In a tri-ethnic setting, this means that a finding that intentional segregation was practiced against one minority group raises the presumption that any segregation suffered by the second minority group was intentional</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> --- U.S. at ----, 97 S.Ct. at 2770</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> The standard set by Swann is \"that the scope of the remedy is determined by the nature and extent of the constitutional violation.\"  402 U.S. at 16.

The district court reiterated its earlier holding that \"the AISD . . .  has engaged in discriminatory assignment of black students to promote segregation\".  The court ordered the black high school and junior high school closed, again throwing the burden of busing only on the blacks.  The district court held that its finding of past intentional segregation of blacks constituted a prima facie case of intentional segregation of Mexican-Americans.  It concluded, however, that the AISD had rebutted this prima facie case by demonstrating that there was no intentional discrimination against Mexican-American students.  Nevertheless, the court included them in the limited desegregation remedy it approved for blacks.  That remedy was to desegregate one grade in the black elementary schools the sixth leaving segregation untouched in the district's other grades and schools.  Mexican-American children were left in their segregated facilities, except for those who attended the Sixth Grade Center.  The district court approved certain worthy bilingual and bicultural programs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unique limitation on desegregation to the sixth grade in black schools, which the AISD proposed and was approved by the district court, raises a fair inference that the AISD intended to continue extensive segregation of Mexican-Americans.  The AISD suggests that the 1974 Education Amendments,20 U.S.C. &#167; 1701 et seq.  (1976 Supp.), somehow support this blanket exclusion.  There are two answers to this contention.  First, as the AISD in its own brief correctly observes:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p>\"the provisions of this chapter are not intended to modify or diminish the authority of the courts of the United States to enforce fully the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\"  20 U.S.C. &#167; 1702(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the 1974 amendments do not support the wholesale exclusion of entire grades from a desegregation plan.  They merely \"find\" that \"the risks and harms created by excessive transportation are particularly great for children enrolled in the first six grades\".  20 U.S.C. &#167; 1702(a)(5) (emphasis added).  This legislation does not purport to prohibit desegregation of children at such grade levels, but points out the obvious; as the Supreme Court said in Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Bd. of Ed., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108316\"><a href=\"/opinion/108316/swann-v-charlotte-mecklenburg-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We again reversed the district court's holding that the AISD had not subjected Mexican-American students to intentional discrimination.  We held that the plaintiffs had made out an unrebutted prima facie case of segregation of Mexican-American students.  We further held that the Sixth Grade Plan part time desegregation for some was \"constitutionally insufficient\".  We instructed the district court to \"draft a comprehensive tri-ethnic desegregation plan\" that would \"conform to one of the approaches outlined by Dr. Finger in his written submission of August 14, 1972, and in his testimony\".  532 F.2d at 399.  (Dr. Finger was the court-appointed expert in Swann.)  The Finger Plan, submitted by the Mexican-American intervenors, envisioned the conversion of the Austin school system to a 4-4-4 or a 5-3-4 grade structure in which all students \"in elementary schools that are over 50 percent minority would be bused to elementary schools that are over 90 percent Anglo\", and middle school students \"in schools that are over 90 percent Anglo would be bused to schools that are over 50 percent minority\".  532 F.2d at 395.

Davis nor Arlington Heights did the Supreme Court directly confront the issue of what type of official intent subjective or objective a plaintiff must show to present a prima facie case of impermissible racial or ethnic discrimination or segregation under the fourteenth amendment's equal protection clause.  Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights did establish that the disproportionate racial impact of the neutral application of a long-standing neutral policy, by itself, will rarely constitute a constitutional violation.  Those decisions thus partly answered in the affirmative, one of the questions left open in Keyes \"whether a neighborhood school policy of itself will justify racial or ethnic concentrations, in the absence of a finding that school authorities have committed acts constituting de jure segregation\".<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a>  We are well aware that some official actions on which a plaintiff hinges an allegation of unconstitutional discrimination have historically been motivated by racially and ethnically neutral bona fide concerns, such as the desire to have children attend the school closest to their home, and no showing is made that those concerns were actually subordinate to, or a subterfuge for, unconstitutional discrimination.  In those circumstances, that a discriminatory result was the natural and foreseeable consequence of the actions is insufficient to infuse the challenged acts with the type of discriminatory intent required by Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights.  Nevertheless, we emphasize that we do not read Washington v. Davis and Arlington Heights as banishing from the law of racial and ethnic discrimination the venerable common law tort principle that a person intends the natural and foreseeable consequences of his actions.  When the official actions challenged as discriminatory include acts and decisions that do not have a firm basis in well accepted and historically sound non-discriminatory social policy, discriminatory intent may be inferred from the fact that those acts had foreseeable discriminatory consequences.  As a practical matter, in school desegregation cases we can envision few official actions, other than the decision to use a neighborhood school policy for student assignment, that would not be subject to the \"natural foreseeable consequences\" rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> The presumption is especially probative in assessing the official intent behind such affirmative school board decisions as those concerning school locations, the construction and renovation of schools, the closing of schools, the drawing of student attendance zones, and the assignment of faculty and staff.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is language in our Austin II opinion that an official discriminatory intent adequate to support a finding of de jure segregation could be inferred solely from the school board's use of a neighborhood school policy for student assignment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a>  To the extent that Austin II can be so read, it is inconsistent with Washington v.

But it was apparent to us in both Austin I and Austin II that the AISD historically had used neighborhood schools to accentuate and to perpetuate segregation of blacks and Mexican-Americans, and that it was attempting now to absolve itself of responsibility for increasing segregation by taking shelter in a supposed neutral policy of assigning students to neighborhood schools.

Of the 58,664 students attending all of Austin's schools, 60 percent (35,342) are Anglo, 16 percent (9,378) are black, and 24 percent (13,933) are Mexican-American.  Almost 40 percent of the AISD's Mexican-American students attend schools that have a minority enrollment of greater than 90 percent.  On the high school level, 65.2 percent of the district's 17,973 students are Anglo, 14.4 percent (2,584) are black, and 20.4 percent (3,668) are Mexican-American.  While 54 percent of the Mexican-American high school students attend schools that are greater than 58 percent minority, nearly two-thirds of the Anglo high school students attend schools that are greater than 78 percent Anglo.  Mexican-American students fare no better in the junior high schools.  Forty-seven percent of them attend either Allan Jr. High or Martin Jr. High, which are 99 percent minority and 97 minority respectively.  Of the AISD's 30,275 elementary school students, 58 percent (17,692) are Anglo, 17 percent (5,122) are black, and 25 percent (7,461) are Mexican-American.  Over 46 percent of the Mexican-American elementary school children attend elementary schools that have minority enrollments ranging from 91 to 100 percent; and 55 percent of the Anglo elementary school children attend schools that are over four-fifths Anglo.  Of the school district's 61 elementary schools, only 23 have enrollments that are not over 80 percent Anglo or 80 percent minority.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the AISD's neighborhood school policy played no small part in creating and maintaining this pattern of Mexican-American segregation in the Austin schools.

The AISD now says that Mexicans are whites and, of course, they usually are.  But the Mexican schools had all Mexican-American enrollments; few Mexican-Americans were assigned to Anglo schools.  The AISD maintained the segregated identity of the schools through the use of dual-overlapping attendance zones, student assignment policies, teacher assignment policies, school site selection, and gerrymandering.  The evidence clearly showed the school board's intent to segregate Mexican-American students.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn17\" id=\"fn17_ref\">17</a>  In dual-overlapping zones Anglos attended Anglo schools; Mexican-Americans attended Mexican schools.  The AISD built new schools deep inside Mexican-American neighborhoods, with a capacity keyed to serving only the Mexican-Americans.

West Avenue shared a dual-overlapping zone with Pease, an all-white school.  Whites within the zone went to Pease, and Mexican-Americans attended West Avenue.  West Avenue continued to operate as a Mexican-American school until it was closed in 1947.  Canal (Comal) Street School was opened in 1924.  School Board minutes reflect that the school was built to accommodate Mexican-American students attending three other schools.  These three schools were the only schools in the district with more than twenty Mexican-Americans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>In 1934, West Avenue and Canal (Comal) Street enrolled 45 percent of the district's Mexican-American students; Bickler had about 25 percent and Metz about 15 percent.  After the passage of a bond issue Zavala school opened.  The site for the new school was three blocks from the Mexican-American Canal (Comal) Street school which was then closed.  Zavala shared a dual-overlapping zone with Metz, one of two predominately white schools with significant numbers of Mexican-American students.  Mexican-Americans were expected to and did attend Zavala; whites attended Metz.  This is unadulterated segregation.  West Avenue and Zavala, predominately Mexican-American, were the only schools in the district which shared zones with other schools.  By 1940, West Avenue and Zavala enrolled 56 percent of the AISD's Mexican-American students.  Also at the time Zavala was built in 1935, Bickler, the other predominately white school with a significant number of Mexican-American students, was discontinued as an elementary school, and Bickler students were sent to other schools.  It is unclear as to where these students went, although some were reassigned to Winn, Palm, and Metz (Zavala).  In 1939, a committee from Winn complained of the assignment of Mexican-American students from Bickler to Winn.  Soon thereafter, some of these students were reassigned to Bickler.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p>467 F.2d at 866-867 (footnote omitted).

At that time the zone line for Allan Junior High School, a predominately Mexican-American facility, was moved so that many whites were zoned out of Allan and into O'Henry.  In 1956, Allan Junior High burned down.  The new Allan Junior High School was built on the same site as the old school and opened in 1957 with 75 percent Mexican-American enrollment.

The suggestion for a central location for this facility was rejected, and the school was built deep in a Mexican-American area.  It opened with a 78 percent Mexican-American enrollment.  In 1967, University Junior High School was closed because the University of Texas reclaimed the property where the school was located.  Martin Junior High School was built in the heart of the Mexican-American community.  Again, centrally-located sites for the new facility were considered and rejected.

In Swann, the Supreme Court cautioned that, \"(i)ndependent of student assignment, where it is possible to identify a 'white school' or a 'Negro school' simply by reference to the racial composition of teachers and staff . . .  a prima facie case of violation of substantive constitutional rights under the Equal Protection Clause is shown\".  402 U.S. at 18, 91 S.Ct. at 1277.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn19\" id=\"fn19_ref\">19</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We found in Austin I that, in 1971, \"(s)ixty-five percent of the Mexican-American high school teachers, 36 percent of the Mexican-American junior high school teachers, and 77 percent of the Mexican-American elementary teachers (were) assigned to predominately Mexican-American schools\".  467 F.2d at 868.  Although no Austin school had a majority of Mexican-American faculty members, and these figures would not, by themselves, suffice to prove the AISD's intent to discriminate, they constitute another stroke in an evidentiary picture that all too clearly shows the school board's intent to discriminate against Mexican-Americans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plans adopted in 1955 and in the 1960's for the desegregation of black schools primarily allowed black students to transfer to Mexican-American schools but not to Anglo schools.

Ironically, the AISD argues that this policy was benign; it was to allow Mexican-Americans to be with their Spanish-speaking friends and their neighbors.

Similarly, the Court held that proof of segregative intent with respect to one area of Denver left the school authorities with the burden of showing that their actions in other areas of the city 'were not also motivated by segregative intentions'.</p>\n        <p>Note, Reading the Mind of the School Board: Segregative Intent and the De Facto/De Jure Distinction, 86 Yale L.J. 317, 321-322 (1976) (emphasis in original ).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The principle that an actor is held to intend the reasonably foreseeable results of his actions is firmly rooted in the common law of torts.

Justice Stevens, in his concurring opinion in Washington v.

For normally the actor is presumed to have intended the natural consequences of his deeds.  This is particularly true in the case of governmental action which is frequently the product of compromise, of collective decisionmaking, and of mixed motivation.  It is unrealistic, on the one hand, to require the victim of alleged discrimination to uncover the actual subjective intent of the decisionmaker or, conversely, to invalidate otherwise legitimate action simply because an improper motive affected the deliberation of a participant in the decisional process.

Public schools have been a traditional source of strength to our Nation, and that strength may derive in part from the identification of many schools with the personal features of the surrounding neighborhood.  Community support, interest, and dedication to public schools may well run higher with a neighborhood attendance pattern: distance may encourage disinterest.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Nothing in Washington v. Davis or Arlington Heights is inconsistent with inferring a discriminatory intent from a school board's refusal to take action to ameliorate segregation.  See Austin II, 532 F.2d at 389</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> We had in mind the misuse of a neighborhood school policy:</p>\n        <p>At least in the Texas schools, where we have held that Mexican-American students are entitled to the same benefits of Brown as are blacks, school authorities may not constitutionally use a neighborhood assignment policy that creates segregated schools in a district with ethnically segregated residential patterns.  A segregated school system is the foreseeable and inevitable result of such an assignment policy.  When this policy is used, we may infer that the school authorities have acted with segregative intent.</p>\n        <p>532 F.2d at 392.  We also said:</p>\n        <p>It has been the AISD's policy to assign students to the schools closest to their homes.  The City of Austin, with the exception of the strip between East and West Austin, has ethnically segregated housing patterns.  Hence, the natural, foreseeable, and inevitable result of the AISD's student assignment policy has been segregated schools throughout most of the city.  Moreover, as we found in Austin I, \"(a)ffirmative action to the contrary would have resulted in desegregation\".  467 F.2d at 863.  The inference is inescapable: the AISD has intended, by its continued use of the neighborhood assignment policy, to maintain segregated schools in East and West Austin.  The plaintiffs have therefore established a prima facie case of de jure segregation of Mexican-Americans in all portions of the school district except the residentially integrated central city area.</p>\n        <p>532 F.2d at 390 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> We held (the en banc decision)</p>\n        <p>\"that the AISD has, in its choice of school site locations, construction and renovation of schools, drawing of attendance zones, student assignment and transfer policies, and faculty and staff assignments, caused and perpetuated the segregation of Mexican-American students within the school system.\"</p>\n        <p>467 F.2d at 865-66.  We also found that \"(t)he natural and foreseeable consequence of these actions was segregation of Mexican-Americans.\"  467 F.2d at 863.

As we held in Austin I, 467 F.2d at 869, and reiterated in Austin II, 532 F.2d at 391,</p>\n        <p>we are not convinced that, to meet the special educational needs of Mexican-American children, the AISD had to keep these children in separate schools, isolate them in Mexican-American neighborhoods, or prevent them from sharing in the educational, social, and psychological benefits of an integrated education.  . . .  A benign motive will not excuse the discriminatory effects of the school board's actions.</p>\n        <p>Accord: Keyes v.

Keyes v. School District No. 1, Denver, Colorado, 1973, 413 U.S. at 197, 93 S.Ct. at 2691.  We believe that faculty segregation is especially probative of a school board's intent to discriminate because of the high degree of control school boards exercise over such matters as faculty placement.

In tri-ethnic school districts such as Austin's, proof that one minority group was subject to statutorily enforced segregation will thus support a presumption that the other minority group was also subject to the same dual school system.  The school board can overcome this presumption by showing that \"the geographical structure of, or the natural boundaries within, a school district may have the effect of dividing the district into separate, identifiable and unrelated units\".  Id. The second presumption is that \"even if it is determined that different areas of the school district should be viewed independently of each other\", \"a finding of intentionally segregative school board actions in a meaningful portion of a school system . . .  creates a presumption that other segregated schooling within the system is not adventitious\".  413 U.S. at 208, 93 S.Ct. at 2697.  In a tri-ethnic setting, this means that a finding that intentional segregation was practiced against one minority group raises the presumption that any segregation suffered by the second minority group was intentional</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn21\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21_ref\">21</a>\n        <p> --- U.S. at ----, 97 S.Ct. at 2770</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn22\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22_ref\">22</a>\n        <p> The standard set by Swann is \"that the scope of the remedy is determined by the nature and extent of the constitutional violation.\"  402 U.S. at 16.

What we said in Jefferson about blacks applies equally to Mexican-Americans in certain states: \"Negroes collectively are harmed when the state, by law or custom, operates segregated schools or a school system with uncorrected effects of segregation.  Denial of access to the dominant culture, lack of opportunity in any meaningful way to participate in political and other public activities, the stigma of apartheid condemned in the Thirteenth Amendment are concomitants of the dual educational system.  The unmalleable fact transcending in importance the harm to individual Negro children is that the separate school system was an integral element in the Southern State's general program to restrict Negroes as a class from participation in the life of the community, the affairs of the State, and the mainstream of American life: Negroes must keep their place.\"  United States v.
