On February 23, 2005, Owens filed\n\nan amended charge adding that on February 15, 2005, despite satisfactorily performing his duties,\n\nhe received a second written reprimand because of his race (count C) and age (count D), in\n\nviolation of section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)), and\n\nfurther in retaliation for filing the subject discrimination charge (count E), in violation of section\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n6-101(A) of the Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101(A) (West 2004)). On June 27, 2005, Owens filed a\n\nsecond amended charge, adding that on or about April 12, 2005, Exxon Mobil subjected him to\n\nunequal terms and conditions of employment when it refused to grant his request for tuition\n\nreimbursement based upon his race (count F), his age (count G), and in retaliation for his filing\n\nthe subject charge (count H).\n\n       After conducting an initial investigation, on August 3, 2007, the Department of Human\n\nRights issued a notice of dismissal for lack of substantial evidence as to all eight counts of\n\npetitioner’s charge. On January 22, 2009, however, the chief legal counsel of the Department of\n\nHuman Rights vacated the dismissal order and reversed for further investigation into all counts.\n\nUpon further investigation, the Department of Human Rights issued a second order of dismissal,\n\nagain finding that Owens had failed to present substantial evidence in support of his charge. This\n\ntime, the chief legal counsel agreed with the findings of the Department and sustained the\n\ndecision of the Department to dismiss petitioner’s charge. Owens now appeals.\n\n       On appeal, Owens contends that the chief legal counsel of the Department of Human\n\nRights abused his discretion when he sustained the decision of the Department to dismiss his\n\ndiscrimination charge, since he presented substantial evidence of discrimination. Owens also\n\ncontends that the substantial evidence standard as articulated under section 7A-102(D)(2) of the\n\nHuman Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004)) is unconstitutionally vague. For the\n\nreasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The undisputed facts establish that Owens has been employed by Exxon Mobil’s Cicero\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nRegional Distribution Center since 1977 and that at the time of the incident he was employed as\n\na warehouse operator.\n\n                                A. Owens’ Discrimination Charge\n\n       On February 2, 2005, Owens filed a two count charge of discrimination with the\n\nDepartment. In count A, Owens alleged that on December 13, 2004, he was subjected to\n\ndiscrimination by Exxon Mobil on the basis of his race (African American), in violation of\n\nsection 2-102(A) the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)). In count B,\n\nOwens alleged that on that same date, he was subjected to discrimination by Exxon Mobil on the\n\nbasis of his age (55 years old) violation of section 2-102(A) the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS\n\n5/2-102(A) (West 2004)). In support of both counts A and B, Owens stated that although on the\n\ndate in question he had been performing his duties in a satisfactory manner, his shift supervisor,\n\nMelvin Koziol, issued a written reprimand to him for “excessive loading time and loading\n\nerrors.” Owens further stated that although two similarly situated younger, white employees,\n\nCarl Pratscher, and Bryan Wright, had been cited for excessive loading time and loading errors,\n\nthey were not given written reprimands for their conduct.\n\n       On February 23, 2005, Owens filed an amended charged, reiterating his earlier claims,\n\nbut adding three more counts, C, D, and E. In count C, Owens alleged that on February 15,\n\n2005, he was discriminated against on the basis of his race when he was issued a second written\n\nreprimand by shift supervisor Koziol in violation of section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act\n\n(775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)). In count D, Owens alleged that this same incident was a\n\nresult of age discrimination, and violated section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n5/2-102(A) (West 2004)). Finally, in Count E, Owens alleged a claim of retaliatory\n\ndiscrimination pursuant to section 6-101(A) of the Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101(A) (West 2004)),\n\ncontending that the February 15, 2005, written reprimand was issued to him in retaliation for his\n\nfiling of the subject charge.\n\n       In support of counts C through E, Owens alleged the following facts. According to the\n\nsecond written reprimand, Owens had failed to perform his job duties by failing to include eight\n\ndrums of “Telura 622” when loading a customer order on January 7, 2005. Owens, however,\n\ndenied failing to perform his job duties on that date and explained that the eight drums of “Telura\n\n622 ” “may have been added to [his] order after [he] had gotten [his] shipping notice.” Owens\n\naverred that in the past there had been instances where subsequent changes made to a shipment\n\norder were not reflected on the copy of the shipping notice given to a warehouse operator.\n\nOwens further alleged that two similarly situated younger white employees, Pratscher and\n\nWright, had been treated differently under similar circumstances. Owens further alleged that on\n\nFebruary 15, 2002, he engaged in a protected activity by filing a discrimination charge with the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights and that the issuing of the second written reprimand followed this\n\nprotected activity “within such a period of time so as to raise an inference of retaliatory motive.”\n\nOn March 25, 2005, Exxon Mobil filed a verified response denying the material allegations of\n\nOwens’ charge.\n\n       On June 27, 2005, Owens filed a second amended charge, realleging counts A through E\n\nof his earlier charges, but adding three more counts, F, G, and H. In count F, Owens alleged that\n\non or about April 12, 2005, Exxon Mobil subjected him to unequal terms and conditions of\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nemployment when it refused to grant his request for tuition reimbursement based upon his race,\n\nin violation of section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)).\n\nIn count G, Owens alleged that, since at the time of this request, he was 55 years old, the denial\n\nof tuition reimbursement was also a result of age discrimination, in violation of section 2-102(A)\n\nof the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)). Finally, in count H, Owens\n\nalleged a claim of retaliatory discrimination pursuant to section 6-101(A) of the Act (775 ILCS\n\n5/6-101(A) (West 2004)) claiming that Exxon Mobil refused to grant him tuition reimbursement\n\nin retaliation for his filing of the subject discrimination charge. In support of these additional\n\nclaims, Owens alleged that although on April 12, 2005, he submitted a request for tuition\n\nreimbursement to his shift supervisor, Koziol, since then “no action has been taken on his\n\nrequest.” Owens further stated that he “believe[s]” that other similarly situated, non-African-\n\nAmerican employees under the age of 40, namely Wright, Gary Wantroba and others, have been\n\ngranted tuition reimbursements. On August 10, 2005, Exxon Mobil filed a verified response to\n\nOwens’ amended charge denying the material allegations.\n\n                      B. The Department’s First Investigation and Dismissal\n\n       The Department of Human Rights conducted an investigation and based on its findings,\n\non August 3, 2007, dismissed all counts of Owens’ charge for lack of substantial evidence. In\n\nsupport of its dismissal, the Department of Human Rights attached voluminous records of its\n\ninvestigation. Those records reveal that during its investigation, an investigator for the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights interviewed several witnesses, including (1) the petitioner, Owens,\n\n(2) two retired Exxon Mobil employees (Mike Sanders and Ernest Hampton); (3) one current\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nExxon Mobil employee (mechanic Jessee Thomas): (4) two members of Exxon Mobil\n\nmanagement at the Cicero Regional Distribution Center (shift supervisor Melvin Koziol, and\n\noperations manager, Patrick O’Reilly); and (5) Exxon Mobil’s in-house attorney, Judith Jansen.\n\nThe investigator also reviewed voluminous documents provided by the parties, including: (1) a\n\nletter of reprimand from Koziol to Owens dated February 15, 2005; (2) a group of loading error\n\ninvestigation reports; and (3) a group of general disciplinary documents for Exxon Mobil\n\nemployees at the Cicero Regional Distribution Plant.\n\n        With respect to counts A and B of Owens’ charge, the Department’s investigator\n\nreported the following evidence. When interviewed, Owens stated that on December 13, 2004,\n\nhis shift supervisor Koziol issued a written warning to him for “working too slow and making\n\nexcessive errors.” Although Owens admitted that he sometimes works slower than other\n\nemployees, he explained that he does so because “he is checking to make sure he is not making\n\nerrors.” Owens further stated that he believes his work performance is the same as that of other\n\nsimilarly situated warehouse operators, namely Wright (non-African-American, 23 year old),\n\nSteven Johnson (non-African-American, 49 years old), Michael Panozzo (non-African-\n\nAmerican, 26 years old), Pratscher (non-African-American, 47 years old) and Daniel Hanson\n\n(non-African- American, 44 years old). According to Owens, however, these other employees\n\nhave not received written reprimands for errors in their performance. Owens also stated that he\n\nbelieves that he was discriminated against because of his age as Exxon Mobil has a policy under\n\nwhich an employee may retire when he or she turns 55 and accumulates 15 years of service with\n\nthe company. Owens stated that one month after he turned 55 years old, he was issued a written\n\n\n                                                6\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nwarning.\n\n       According to the Department’s investigator, Owens allegations were corroborated by\n\nstatements from two retired and one current Exxon Mobil employee. Specifically, during an\n\ninterview with the Department’s investigator, retired filler1, Mike Sanders (African American, 60\n\nyears old) stated that “race discrimination was going on” at the plant. Sanders explained that\n\noperations manager Patrick O’Reilly (non-African-American, 48 years old) “is a racist,” who\n\ntreats African American employees “unfairly” and likes to discipline them when they should not\n\nbe disciplined.\n\n       Retired forklift driver2, Ernest Hampton (African American, 68 years old) similarly told\n\nthe Department’s investigator that he believed that “race discrimination and a whole bunch of\n\nother things [were] going on” at the plant, but he did not elaborate.\n\n       Finally, mechanic Jesse Thomas (African American, 43 years old), told the Department’s\n\ninvestigator that O’Reilly was “a racist,” and that he referred to African Americans as “niggers”\n\nand Mexican employees as “wetbacks.” Thomas also stated that O’Reilly was always\n\ndisciplining African American individuals for things they “did and did not do,” commenting\n\n“I’m going to get that nigger.” According to Thomas, several individuals complained to\n\nmanagement and human resources about O’Reilly’s racial slurs. As a result, between 2001 and\n\n2004, Exxon Mobil conducted an investigation into allegations of racial discrimination.\n\nAlthough during this investigation several managers initially attested to O’Reilly’s\n\n\n       1\n           The record reveals that Sanders retired three years prior to the instant litigation.\n       2\n           The record reveals that Hampton retired from Exxon Mobil in May 1995.\n\n                                                     7\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\ndiscrimination against African American employees, according to Thomas, after upper\n\nmanagement spoke to them, they were “scared off” and they refused to testify about O’Reilly’s\n\nconduct.\n\n       On the other hand, the Department’s investigator reported that contrary to Owens’\n\nallegations, management at Exxon Mobil’s Cicero plant denied having disciplined Owens\n\nbecause of his race and/or age. First, shift supervisor Koziol (non-African-American, 54) told\n\nthe Department investigator that on December 13, 2004, he issued Owens a “written counseling”\n\nand not a “written reprimand,” and that there is a difference between the two. Koziol explained\n\nthat he issued the “written counseling” to Owens because Exxon Mobil received several\n\ncomplaints on an order that Owens loaded on August 5, 2004. Specifically, Koziol stated that\n\nwhile the customer ordered 26 cases of “Mobil 1\" products, 11 pails of “Mobilux EP2,” 5 pails\n\nof “Mobil ShC 632\" and 4 pails of Vacuoline, it received 25 cases of “Mobil 1” products; 12\n\npails of “Mobilux EP2,” 4 pails of “Mobil ShC 632,” 3 pails of Vacuoline, and 1 pail of\n\n“something without a label.”\n\n       In addition, operations manager, Patrick O’Reilly told the Department investigator that\n\nOwens had made several mistakes on his orders prior to being issued the December 13, 2004,\n\n“written counseling.” O’Reilly explained Exxon Mobil’s procedure with issuing “written\n\ncounseling” to its employees. According to O’Reilly, anytime Exxon Mobil receives a customer\n\ncomplaint, it investigates to determine whether the complaint is legitimate. If the company\n\ndetermines that the complaint is legitimate, the employee receives a “loading error” in his or her\n\npersonnel file. Once an employee has three errors in his or her file, the employee receives a\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nrecord of “counseling.”\n\n       With respect to the other similarly situated employees that Owens alleged were treated\n\ndifferently from him, O’Reilly explained that: (1) Wright and Johnson had not been issued any\n\n“counseling” or warnings because they had no loading errors; (2) Panozzo had been issued a\n\nwarning for unsafe conduct on a forklift and ordered to participate in one loading error coaching\n\nsession but had not been given “written counseling” since his file did not contain three loading\n\nerrors; (3) Pratscher received a coaching session for a loading error, but no “counseling” since he\n\ndid not commit three loading errors; and (4) Hanson received reprimands “for other things.”\n\n       The Department’s investigator further reported that Exxon Mobil’s counsel, Judith Jansen\n\n(a non-African-American, 63 years old), confirmed that if an Exxon Mobil employee has\n\ncompleted 15 years of service by the time he or she reaches the age of 55, that employee can\n\nretire. Jansen explained, however, that this is a benefit plan and not a company policy and that,\n\nas such, it had nothing to do with Owens’ “written counseling” record.\n\n       In addition, the Department’s investigator reported that Exxon Mobil’s disciplinary\n\ndocuments disclosed that similarly situated employees had also been issued “counseling,”\n\nreprimands, warnings and suspensions, and that they had not been treated differently than\n\nOwens. The investigator summarized his analysis of these disciplinary documents in two charts:\n\n(1) the first chart showing all the disciplinary actions taken against Owens and his coworkers in\n\nthe two years prior to his filing of the instant charge, and (2) the second chart summarizing all\n\nloading error investigation reports at the plant since 1999.\n\nCHART 1:\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n Date       Name           Discipline    Reason                 Age   Race\n 08/28/03   Novakowski     Counseling    Failure to wear ppe    47    White\n 08/29/03   M Panozzo      Letter of     Unsafe operation of    26    White\n                           Reprimand     forklift\n 08/29/03   Wantroba       Suspension    Truck spillage         36    White\n 09/15/03   T Panozzo      Counseling    Unproductive           50    White\n                                         insubordination\n 12/15/03   Solis          Letter of     Absenteeism            25    Hispanic\n                           Warning\n 02/96/04   Pollack        Counseling    Absenteeism            54    White\n 03/23/04   Whittier       Counseling    Loading Errors         37    African\n                                                                      America\n                                                                      n\n 04/13/04   Washington     Suspension    Dishonesty related     36    African\n                                         to absence                   America\n                                                                      n\n 04/22/04   Drada          Counseling    Unacceptable           55    White\n                                         absence\n 05/03/04   Bustos         Letter of     Product                47    Hispanic\n                           Reprimand     contamination\n 08/13/04   Pollack        Counseling    Unacceptable           54    White\n                                         absenteeism\n 10/21/04   Hansen         Suspension    Refusal to report to   45    White\n                                         work\n 12/07/04   Owens          Counseling    Loading errors         55    African\n            (petitioner)                                              America\n                                                                      n\n\n\nCHART 2:\n\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n Date        Name                Discipline       Reason                 Age        Race\n 11/16/05    Hanson              Coached          Load error             44         White\n 10/28/04    M.

Owens averred that he could not be certain\n\nwhether he failed to include those drums in the customer order or whether the customer made\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nchanges to the order after he had already loaded it.\n\n        On the other hand, Koziol denied Owens’ claim that he had been issued this second\n\nwritten reprimand as a result of his age or race or in retaliation for his filing the instant\n\ndiscrimination charge. In fact, Koziol averred that he was not even aware that Owens had filed a\n\ndiscrimination charge against Exxon Mobil. Rather, Koziol told the investigator that he issued\n\nOwens a “written warning” for his poor performance. Koziol explained that after Owens loaded\n\nan order for a customer on January 7, 2005, that customer contacted Exxon Mobil and indicated\n\nthat it had not received any of the eight drums it had ordered. According to Koziol, after the\n\nwarehouse supervisor counted the drums in the warehouse, he discovered that the warehouse had\n\neight additional drums, which verified that Owens, who was the warehouse operator that day,\n\nhad failed to ship them to the customer.\n\n        According to the Department’s investigator, Koziol’s statement was corroborated by a\n\nletter from Koziol to Owens dated February 15, 2005, in which Koziol informed Owens that he\n\nwas being issued a “letter of reprimand” as a “disciplinary measure” for his “failure to perform\n\n[his] job duties.” That letter states that Owens’ lack of attention to his assigned job task resulted\n\nin “customer services failures” and “monetary loss” to Exxon Mobil. The letter specifically\n\nnotes that Owens was being reprimanded because in filling a customer order on January 7, 2005,\n\nhe failed to put eight drums of “Telura 622\" in that order. The letter also notes that Owens has\n\npreviously received a record for “counseling,” on June 25, 2004, for doing a product conversion\n\nthat converted inventory to an incorrect product name, and subsequently on January 25, 2004, for\n\nmultiple loading errors on four different customer orders. The letter further states that in the past\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nyear, Koziol had attempted to coach Owens on several occasions regarding his work\n\nperformance, lack of productivity, poor loading technique, loading errors and unsafe practices.\n\nThe letter further advised Owens:\n\n       “It is your responsibility to follow supervisor instruction, safe work practices and job\n\n       procedures, as well as completing assignments in a timely order. Failure to meet these\n\n       requirements will result in further disciplinary action, up to and including termination of\n\n       your employment from [Exxon Mobil.]”\n\n       Based on the foregoing investigation report, the Department of Human Rights\n\nrecommended that counts C, D, and E of Owens’ charge be dismissed.\n\n       With respect to counts F, G, and H, wherein Owens alleged that on or about April 12,\n\n2005, he was denied equal terms and conditions of employment when Koziol failed to honor his\n\nrequest for tuition reimbursement for several classes, later determined to be air conditioning,\n\nheating and ventilation classes, he had taken at a local community college, the Department’s\n\ninvestigator reported the following facts. Owens stated that after he submitted his request to\n\nExxon Mobil for reimbursement of his tuition on January 27, 2005, he was denied that request\n\nwithout any written explanation, while, he believes, other similarly situated employees, including\n\nWright and Wantroba, were granted similar requests. Owens admitted that he does not know for\n\ncertain whether Wright and Wantroba were in fact reimbursed.\n\n       When questioned about this incident by the Department investigator, Koziol admitted that\n\nOwens requested and was denied tuition reimbursement, but he stated that the reason was\n\nnondiscriminatory. Koziol explained that Owens was denied reimbursement because his\n\n\n                                                13\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\napplication did not meet Exxon Mobil’s tuition reimbursement policy, which requires that an\n\nemployee be preapproved for tuition reimbursement before taking the classes. According to\n\nKoziol, Owens submitted a request for tuition reimbursement after already having taken the\n\nclasses.\n\n          According to the Department’s investigator, Koziol’s statements were corroborated by\n\nthe receipts for those classes submitted by Owens to Exxon Mobil, which reveal that the classes\n\nwere taken over a year before Owens filed his request for reimbursement. They were also\n\ncorroborated by Exxon Mobil’s written tuition reimbursement policy. Under that policy Exxon\n\nMobil promised to “reimburse employees for actual cost for registration, tuition, regular\n\ninstruction fees and required textbooks,” if the employees qualified for reimbursement. To\n\nqualify for reimbursement, the courses taken must have been “designed to maintain or improve\n\nthe employee’s job skills and increase work related competencies or capabilities,” and must have\n\nbeen taken at an “accredited university, college or vocational institution for a grade.” Most\n\nimportantly, the policy mandated that “management *** approve the employee’s application for\n\na specific course of study and the educational institution before each enrollment.” (Emphasis\n\nadded.)\n\n          Koziol also stated that contrary to Owens’ allegations, Wright and Wantroba were not\n\nreimbursed tuition for classes they had taken. In fact, Koziol stated that Exxon Mobil has not\n\nreimbursed anyone for tuition expenses at the plant in the past three years. Wright and Wantroba\n\ncorroborated Koziol’s statements. While Wright indicated that he had never requested or\n\nreceived tuition reimbursement from Exxon Mobil, Wantroba stated that although he had\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nrequested reimbursement on one occasion, that reimbursement was not granted because the class\n\nWantroba took did not qualify for tuition reimbursement.\n\n        Based on the aforementioned investigation, the Department of Human Rights found that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to permit Owens to proceed with counts F, G and H of his\n\ndiscrimination charge. Accordingly, the Department recommended that Owens charge be\n\ndismissed in its entirety.\n\n             C. The Chief Legal Counsel’s Reversal of the Department’s Dismissal\n\n        On January 22, 2008, the chief legal counsel of the Department of Human Rights entered\n\nan order vacating the Department’s dismissal of the charge and remanding the matter to the\n\nDepartment for further investigation. With respect to counts A, B, C, D, and E of the charge, the\n\nchief legal counsel directed the Department to determine the following: (1) Exxon Mobil’s\n\nwritten discipline policy; (2) the difference between a “written counseling” and a “written\n\nwarning” and/or “written reprimand”; and (3) specifically, what Exxon Mobil’s discipline policy\n\nstates are the consequences of loading errors.\n\n        With respect to counts F, G, and H, the chief legal counsel directed the Department to\n\ndetermine: (1) the date Owens submitted his application for tuition reimbursement; (2) Exxon\n\nMobil’s criteria in determining whether courses can be reimbursed; (3) the exact dates Owens’\n\ncourses started and whether the list of those courses was submitted to Exxon Mobil prior to the\n\ntuition reimbursement application process; and (4) the exact date when Owens’ request for\n\ntuition reimbursement was denied.\n\n                     D. The Department’s Second Investigation and Dismissal\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       On July 10, 2008, the Department completed an addendum investigation report, based\n\nupon which it again dismissed all counts of Owens’ discrimination charge. In conducting its\n\nsecond investigation, the Department investigator reinterviewed Owens and Koziol, as well as\n\nreviewed several additional documents provided by the parties, including, inter alia: (1) an\n\nexcerpt from Exxon Mobil’s plant rules; (2) a letter from Exxon Mobil to the Department of\n\nHuman Rights; (3) a group of loading error investigation reports for Owens; and (4) Owens’\n\ntuition refund application together with a group of verification for tuition payment forms.\n\n       With respect to counts A through E, the Department’s addendum investigation report\n\ndisclosed the following evidence pertinent to the Department’s dismissal of those counts. When\n\nreinterviewed regarding Exxon Mobil’s disciplinary policy, shift supervisor Koziol stated that\n\nboth the terms of Owens’ employment and any disciplinary actions to be taken against him are\n\ngoverned by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, as well as the Cicero plant’s\n\ndisciplinary rules.\n\n       In a letter to the Department dated February 13, 2008, Exxon Mobil explained the\n\ncontents of the collective bargaining agreement as well as the Cicero plant’s disciplinary rules.\n\nAccording to the bargaining agreement, with respect to discipline, if an “employee alleges his/her\n\ndischarge was unjust,” he or she has 10 working days to file a grievance regarding the discharge.\n\nAfter the employee files a grievance, the company must inform the union within three working\n\ndays of the reason for a disciplinary suspension or a discharge and if the union feels there was no\n\njust cause for the company’s action, the case may be processed under the grievance and\n\narbitration procedure. In addition, according to the collective bargaining agreement, the\n\n\n                                                16\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\ncompany and the union agree to “abide by all valid and applicable non-discrimination laws.”\n\nFinally, under the agreement “[t]he company retains all rights of management resulting from the\n\nownership of the plant or pertaining to the operation of the business, except to the extent that\n\nsuch rights are limited by the provisions of this Agreement.” According to Exxon Mobil, under\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement, with respect to discipline, the agreement provides only that\n\nif the employee believes a suspension or discharge is without “just cause,” that employee can file\n\na grievance, and if the grievance is not resolved, the union can request arbitration. The\n\nagreement places no other limitations on management’s right to operate the business, which\n\nincludes the right to set standards for work performance and work place behavior and to\n\nadminister discipline where employees fail to meet standards of performance and behavior.\n\n       In this vein, according to Exxon Mobil, the Cicero Regional Distribution Center\n\nmanagement has issued plant disciplinary rules. Those plant rules first state that because\n\n“personal discipline and proper standards of conduct are necessary to protect the health and\n\nsafety of all employees,” any employee “who fails to maintain at all times proper standards of\n\nconduct or who violates any of the plant rules shall subject [himself or herself] to appropriate\n\ndisciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.” Although the plant rules\n\nspecify certain standards of conduct, such as procedures for reporting injuries or excusing\n\nabsences, and the ban on “horseplay,” sexual harassment, and the use of cell phones inside the\n\nplant, they do not include or elaborate on the disciplinary procedure or consequences resulting\n\nfrom loading errors. The plant rules do, however, end with the following statement:\n\n       “These rules are not intended to be all inclusive, the Company may establish additional\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       rules, and supervisors may set up rules deemed necessary by operational requirements.\n\n       Any employee who fails to maintain, at all times, proper standards of conduct, or who\n\n       violates any of the [above] rules, may be subjected to disciplinary action, which may\n\n       include termination.”\n\n       In its letter to the Department, Exxon Mobil also responded to the chief legal counsel’s\n\nrequest that Exxon Mobil explain that the difference between a “written counseling” and a\n\n“written warning.” According to Exxon Mobil, “the difference between ‘counseling’ and\n\n‘warning’ is a universally understood concept in labor relations,” under which the “objective of\n\n‘counseling’ is to change an employee’s behavior,” while the “objective of ‘warning’ is\n\ndiscipline.”\n\n       According to Exxon Mobil, “counseling” or “coaching” an employee on his performance\n\nis not a disciplinary action. A “counseling” may or may not be reported in the employee’s\n\npersonnel file. Often it consists merely of informal discussions between supervisor and\n\nemployee wherein “the employee is advised that certain behavior does not meet the employer’s\n\nstandards and that specified remedial actions are needed.” Since most employees respond\n\nfavorably to informal “counseling” and are fully capable of avoiding or correcting their errors,\n\n“verbal counseling” is generally not considered discipline. However, should “verbal counseling”\n\nprove ineffective, a formal counseling (i.e., “written counseling”) session may follow. When a\n\nwritten memo detailing a “counseling” session is placed in an employee’s personnel file, it is\n\nintended to provide the employee with “fair notice of the employer’s specific requirements,” as\n\nwell as to lend “formality to the session, thereby increasing its significance to the employee.”\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       On the other hand, according to Exxon Mobil, a “letter of reprimand” or a “written\n\nwarning,” is a “disciplinary document that informs the employee that he has failed to make the\n\nnecessary improvements in performance or behavior and that if he continues to perform\n\nunsatisfactorily he may be subject to more severe discipline, up to and including discharge.”\n\n       According to Exxon Mobil’s letter to the Department, on December 13, 2004, Owens was\n\ngiven a “written reprimand” because he had accumulated three prior loading errors for poor\n\nperformance.3 In support of this contention, Exxon Mobil provided the Department with a copy\n\n\n       3\n           We note that the record is somewhat unclear as to what type of document Owens was\n\nissued on December 13, 2004. While Owens alleged that he was given a “written reprimand,”\n\nboth shift supervisor Koziol and operations manager O’Reilly initially told the Department’s\n\ninvestigator that Owens was merely issued a “written counseling.” The record also reveals that\n\nin its initial response to the Department’s investigator Exxon Mobil explained that while Owens\n\nwas given a “written reprimand” on December 13, 2004, that reprimand was later reduced to a\n\n“written counseling” after Owens filed a grievance with Exxon Mobil and prior to his filing of\n\nthe instant discrimination charge with the Department of Human Rights. However, during the\n\nDepartment’s second investigation, in a letter to the Department, Exxon Mobil apparently\n\nconceded that Owens was given a “written reprimand” on December 13, 2004. In that vein,\n\nduring this second investigation, shift supervisor Koziol changed his prior statement to the\n\nDepartment’s investigator now admitting that Owens was in fact given a “written reprimand,”\n\nand not a “written counseling.” Since the Department’s investigator, the chief legal counsel and\n\nboth parties on appeal seem to agree that on December 13, 2004, Owens was a “written\n\n                                                19\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nof several documents related to these three loading error investigation reports, dated November\n\n1, 2004, October 12, 2004, and December 7, 2004. Those documents revealed that Owens first\n\nreceived “verbal counseling” for a loading error on June 25, 2004, as a result of his failure to add\n\na pallet onto his loading truck and as a result of his inability to fill the order in the requisite\n\namount of time. Owens next received “verbal counseling” in October, after his failure to fill a\n\ncustomer order dated October 7, 2004. That order requested five cases of “Mobil Grease CM-S,”\n\nbut the customer received none. The reports further revealed that Owens received another\n\n“verbal coaching session” in November as a result of his failure to properly load a customer\n\norder dated October 29, 2004. Although in that order the customer requested 1,092 cases of\n\n“Mobil 1 5W30,” it received only 936 of those cases.\n\n        As a result of these three prior loading errors, which were followed by “verbal\n\ncounseling” sessions, Owens was given a “written reprimand” on December 13, 2004, after a\n\ncustomer complained regarding an order he loaded on August 5, 2004. While that customer\n\norder requested 26 cases of “Mobil 1\" products, 11 pails of “Mobilux EP2,” 5 pails of “Mobil\n\nShC 632” and 4 pails of Vacuoline, the customer received 25 cases of “Mobil 1” products; 12\n\npails of “Mobilux EP2,” 4 pails of “Mobil ShC 632,” 3 pails of Vacuoline; and 1 pail of\n\n“something without a label.”\n\n        Based upon the aforementioned additional evidence, as well as the information gathered\n\nduring its initial investigation, the Department found that Owens had not presented substantial\n\n\nreprimand,” we have no reason to deviate from this conclusion and therefore treat the “written\n\nreprimand” as such.\n\n                                                   20\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nevidence so as to support the allegations in counts A through E of his charge.\n\n       With respect to counts F, G, and H, wherein Owens alleged he had been denied equal\n\nterms and conditions of employment when Exxon Mobil refused to grant him tuition\n\nreimbursement on the basis of his race, age and in retaliation for his filing of the instant charge,\n\nthe Department’s addendum investigation report revealed the following additional evidence.\n\nUpon being reinterviewed, Owens stated that in 2005 he submitted his paperwork requesting to\n\nbe reimbursed for air conditioning, heating and ventilation classes that he completed in 2002,\n\n2003, and 2004.4 Owens stated that he did not request tuition reimbursement on those classes\n\nearlier because prior to taking them he was told that he would not be reimbursed, since those\n\nclasses were not related to his job duties as a forklift driver. Owens explained, however, that he\n\ntook the classes anyway, paying for them out of pocket because in the future, he planned to bid\n\non a maintenance position at the plant. That position involved work with boilers.\n\n       Upon being reinterviewed, shift supervisor Koziol stated that Exxon Mobil does not keep\n\na record of denied requests for tuition reimbursement and does not have a record of the specific\n\ndate on which Owens requested reimbursement. Koziol reiterated that the reason for the denial\n\nof Owens tuition reimbursement request was nondiscriminatory. According to Koziol, Owens\n\nwas denied reimbursement because the courses were not preapproved and because they did not\n\nmeet the criteria of the program, i.e., they were unrelated to his Owens’ job duties.\n\n\n       4\n           A group of verification for tuition payment forms along with an educational refund\n\napplication for approval form for Owens indicates that Owens took classes during the years 2002\n\nthrough 2004, which totaled $3,352.\n\n                                                 21\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       Based upon the foregoing, the Department dismissed counts F, G, and H of Owens’\n\ncharge. Owens subsequently filed a request for review by the chief legal counsel of the\n\nDepartment.\n\n                       E. The Chief Legal Counsel Affirms the Dismissal\n\n       On March 9, 2009, the chief legal counsel entered an order sustaining the dismissal of all\n\neight counts of Owens’ charge for lack of substantial evidence supporting claims of\n\ndiscrimination. With respect to counts A and B, wherein Owens alleged that on December 13,\n\n2004, he received a written reprimand on the basis of his race and age, the chief legal counsel\n\nfirst found that such a “written reprimand” did not constitute an adverse employment action,\n\nsince Owens did and could not allege that this reprimand somehow “detrimentally affected” his\n\nemployment, such as through “loss of pay, loss of benefits, suspension, discharge etc.” Citing to\n\nMattern v. Eastern Kodak Co., 104 F.3d 702 (5th Cir. 1997), the chief legal counsel therefore\n\nfound that a claim of discrimination based upon the December 13, 2004, written reprimand was\n\nnot actionable under the Illinois Human Rights Act.\n\n       The chief legal counsel next found that even if this written reprimand could somehow\n\nconstitute an adverse employment action, the investigation failed to reveal substantial evidence\n\nof a nexus between the written reprimand and Owens’ age/and or race. Rather, according to the\n\nchief legal counsel, the Department’s investigation established that Owens had a history of\n\nperformance problems related to loading errors prior to December 13, 2004, and that he was\n\nissued the written reprimand as a result of this history of poor performance. In addition, the chief\n\nlegal counsel noted that contrary to Owens’ allegations the Department’s investigation disclosed\n\n\n                                                22\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nthat Exxon Mobil issued discipline to other employees for their poor performance. Among those\n\nemployees disciplined, the chief legal counsel noted: Hanson (white, 44), who received coaching\n\nfor loading errors; Panozzo (white, 26), who was coached and then suspended for loading errors;\n\nWright (white, 23), who was given a written error report in his personnel file for loading errors;\n\nJohnson (white, 49), who was given a written warning and then suspended for product mix\n\nerrors; and Pratscher (white, 47), who was coached for not following loading procedures.\n\n       The chief legal counsel similarly found with respect to counts C, D, and E, that Owens\n\nhad failed to provide substantial evidence that he was issued the second written reprimand on\n\nFebruary 15, 2005, because of his race or age or in retaliation for filing the instant charge.\n\nRather, the Department’s investigation revealed that on or about January 7, 2005, Owens loaded\n\nan order, the customer reported that it did not receive the complete order and Exxon Mobil\n\nissued Owens the written reprimand for this error. Referring to its rationale with respect to\n\ncounts A and B, the chief legal counsel reiterated that the Department’s investigation disclosed\n\nthat Exxon Mobil similarly disciplined several warehouse operators not in Owens’ protected age\n\nand/or race classes.\n\n       Finally, with respect to counts F, G, and H, the chief legal counsel found that the\n\ninvestigation did not reveal substantial evidence that Exxon Mobil subjected Owens to unequal\n\nterms and conditions of employment because of his age, race or in retaliation for filing the\n\nsubject charge when it refused to refund his tuition. Specifically, the chief counsel noted that the\n\ntuition policy clearly states that management must approve the tuition reimbursement prior to\n\neach enrollment in a class.\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n        Owens now appeals, contending that the chief legal counsel’s decision to sustain the\n\ndismissal of his charge constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n                                            II. ANALYSIS\n\n        We begin by noting the well-established principles regarding discrimination charges\n\nbrought under the Illinois Human Rights Act (Act) (775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq. (West 2004)). This\n\nAct prohibits “unlawful discrimination,” i.e., discrimination against a person on the basis of,\n\ninter alia, his or her race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, marital status, or\n\nhandicap. 775 ILCS 5/1-102 (West 2004). The Act specifically defines the following conduct as\n\na civil rights violation in the employment context:\n\n                 “For any employer to refuse to hire, to segregate, or to act with respect to\n\n        recruitment, hiring, promotion, renewal of employment, selection for training or\n\n        apprenticeship, discharge, discipline, tenure or terms, privileges or conditions of\n\n        employment on the basis of unlawful discrimination ***.” 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West\n\n        2004).\n\nThe Act also defines retaliation as a civil rights violation, noting:\n\n                 “It is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more persons to conspire,\n\n        to:\n\n                 *** Retaliate against a person because he or she has opposed that which he or she\n\n        reasonably and in good faith believes to be unlawful discrimination, sexual harassment in\n\n        employment or sexual harassment in higher education, discrimination based on\n\n\n                                                   24\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       citizenship status in employment, or because he or she has made a charge, filed a\n\n       complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\n\n       under this Act[.]” 775 ILCS 5/6-101(A) (West 2004).\n\n       When an employee files a discrimination charge against the employer pursuant to the\n\nIllinois Human Rights Act with the Department of Human Rights, the Department must conduct\n\na full investigation of the allegations set forth in the charge and provide a written report of such\n\nan investigation. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(C)(1), (D)(1) (West 2004). After reviewing the\n\ninvestigation report, the Department must determine whether there is substantial evidence that\n\nthe alleged civil rights violation has been committed. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004).\n\nUnder the Act, substantial evidence is defined as evidence “which a reasonable mind accepts as\n\nsufficient to support a particular conclusion and which consists of more than a mere scintilla but\n\nmay be somewhat less than a preponderance.” 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004). If the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights determines that there is no substantial evidence, the charge is\n\ndismissed. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2)(a) (West 2004). If the charge is dismissed by the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights, petitioner may seek review by filing a request for review with the\n\nchief legal counsel of the Department. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2)(a) (West 2004).\n\n       The chief legal counsel’s order reviewing the dismissal is a final and appealable order\n\n(775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2)(a) (West 2004)), and petitioner may seek review of the chief legal\n\ncounsel’s order in the appellate court (775 ILCS 5/8-111(A)(1) (West 2004)). The standard of\n\nreview on appeal is whether the Department’s chief legal counsel abused his discretion.\n\nAnderson v. Chief Legal Counsel, 334 Ill. App. 3d 630, 634 (2002); see also Welch v. Hoeh, 314\n\n\n                                                 25\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nIll. App. 3d 1027, 1034 (2000) (“we may not reweigh the evidence or substitute our judgment for\n\nthat of the Department. [Citation.] Our review is limited to deciding whether the chief legal\n\ncounsel's *** decision dismissing the claim *** is ‘arbitrary and capricious or an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.’ [Citation.]”). A decision is arbitrary and capricious only if it “contravenes the\n\nlegislature’s intent, fails to consider a crucial aspect of the problem, or offers an impossible\n\nexplanation contrary to agency expertise.” Allen v. Lieberman, 359 Ill. App. 3d 1170, 1177\n\n(2005); see also Deen v. Lustig, 337 Ill. App. 3d 294, 302 (2003), quoting LaSalle National Bank\n\nv. City Suites, Inc., 325 Ill. App. 3d 780, 786 (2001), and citing Bodine Electric of Champaign,\n\nv. City of Champaign, 305 Ill. App. 3d 431, 435 (1999) (“[a]n abuse of discretion is found when\n\na decision is reached without employing conscientious judgment or when the decision is clearly\n\nagainst logic”).\n\n       Turning to the merits of the cause at bar, we initially note that on appeal Owens does not\n\nchallenge the dismissal of counts E through H of his discrimination charge. Owens only argues\n\nthat the chief legal counsel abused his discretion in finding that there was no substantial evidence\n\nto support his claims of age and race discrimination based on the December 13, 2004, and\n\nFebruary15, 2005, written reprimands (counts A, B, C, and D).\n\n       Since Owens does not argue that the chief legal counsel erred in finding that there was a\n\nlack of substantial evidence to support the claim that he was issued the February 15, 2005\n\nreprimand in retaliation for filing the subject charge (count E) or the claim that Exxon Mobil\n\nsubsequently refused to grant his tuition reimbursement request because of his race or age or in\n\nretaliation for filing the subject charge (counts F, G, H), he has forfeited his right to challenge the\n\n                                                  26\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\ndismissal of counts E through H. See 210 Ill. 2d R. 341(h)(7) (“Points not argued [in the\n\nopening appellant’s brief] are waived and shall not be raised in the reply brief, in oral argument,\n\nor on petition for rehearing”); see also In re K.T., 361 Ill. App. 3d 187, 206 (2005) (holding that\n\narguments not raised in appellant’s brief are forfeited); see also City of Grantie City v. House of\n\nPrayers, Inc., 333 Ill. App. 3d 452, 462 (2002) (holding that “a court of review is entitled to have\n\nthe issues clearly defined with pertinent authority cited,” and “is not simply a depository in which\n\nan appealing party may dump the burden of argument and research”). Therefore, by reason of\n\nsuch forfeiture, any contention that by the denial of tuition reimbursement Exxon Mobil\n\nsomehow subjected Owens to unequal terms and conditions of employment can play no further\n\npart in this appeal.\n\n        Accordingly, we turn to the Department’s dismissal of counts A through D of Owens’\n\ncharge. Owens first contends that the chief legal counsel erred in sustaining the Department’s\n\ndismissal of counts A and B of his discrimination charge, wherein he alleged that shift supervisor\n\nKoziol issued him a written warning on December 13, 2004, on the basis of his age and race.\n\nOwens specifically argues that the chief legal counsel erred when it found that: (1) Exxon\n\nMobil’s written reprimand to him issued on December 13, 2004, did not constitute a cognizable\n\nadverse employment action and (2) that Owens failed to present substantial evidence that other\n\nsimilarly situated younger and white workers were treated differently. For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we disagree.\n\n        We first note that in Zaderaka v. Illinois Human Rights Comm’n, 131 Ill. 2d 172, 178-79\n\n(1989), our supreme court recognized that in evaluating charges of discriminatory practices\n\n                                                 27\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nbrought under the Illinois Human Rights Act (now see 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)), the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights and the Illinois appellate courts have adopted the three-part test\n\nemployed by the federal courts in actions for employment discrimination brought under title VII\n\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq. (1982)) and the Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act of 1967 (AEDA) (29 U.S.C. §621 et seq. (1982)), as articulated by the United\n\nStates Supreme Court in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802, 36 L. Ed. 2d\n\n668, 677, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 1824 (1973).\n\n        Under this three-prong test, the petitioner must first establish by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence a prima facie case of unlawful discrimination. Zaderaka, 131 Ill. 2d at 179-80. If a\n\nprima facie case is established, a rebuttable presumption arises that the employer unlawfully\n\ndiscriminated against the plaintiff. Zaderaka, 131 Ill. 2d at 178-79. Second, to rebut the\n\npresumption, the employer must articulate, not prove, a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for\n\nits decision. Zaderaka, 131 Ill. 2d at 179. Third, if the employer articulates such a reason, the\n\nplaintiff must prove, again by a preponderance of the evidence, that the employer’s reason was\n\nuntrue and was a pretext for discrimination. Zaderaka, 131 Ill. 2d at 179. Under this test, the\n\nultimate burden of persuasion remains on the plaintiff throughout the proceedings. Zaderaka,\n\n131 Ill. 2d at 179.\n\n        To establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination, the petitioner must first\n\nshow that (1) he is a member of a protected class; (2) he was meeting his employer’s legitimate\n\nbusiness expectations; (3) he suffered an adverse employment action; and (4) the employer\n\ntreated similarly situated employees outside the class more favorably. Owens v. Department of\n\n                                                 28\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nHuman Rights, 356 Ill. App. 3d 46, 52 (2005).\n\n       To show that he suffered an adverse employment action, an employee must establish that\n\nthe employment action was “materially adverse” and not a “ ‘ “mere inconvenience or an\n\nalteration of job responsibilities.” ’ ” Hoffelte v. Department of Human Rights., 367 Ill. App. 3d\n\n628, 633 (2006), quoting Traylor v. Brown, 295 F.3d 783, 788 (7th Cir. 2002), quoting\n\nRabinovitz v. Pena, 89 F.3d 482, 488 (7th Cir. 1996). A materially adverse employment action\n\nis “one that significantly alters the terms and conditions of the employee’s job.” Griffin v. Potter,\n\n356 F.3d 824, 829 (7th Cir. 2004); see also Rhodes v. Illinois Department of Transportation, 359\n\nF.3d 498, 504 (7th Cir. 2004) (“an adverse employment action is a significant change in the\n\nclaimant’s employment status”); Johnson v. Cambridge Industries, Inc., 325 F. 3d 829, 901, 902\n\n(7th Cir. 2003) (noting that to establish an adverse employment action an employee “must show\n\nsome quantitative or qualitative change in the terms or conditions of his employment” or some\n\nsort of “real harm”). Adverse employment actions include things such as hiring, denial of\n\npromotion, reassignment to a position with significantly different job responsibilities, or an\n\naction that causes a substantial change in benefits. See Rhodes, 359 F.3d at 504; see also\n\nHoffelte, 367 Ill. App.3d at 633, quoting Traylor, 295 F.3d at 788 (“ ‘ “[a] materially adverse\n\nchange might be indicated by a termination of employment, a demotion evidenced by a decrease\n\nin wage or salary, a less distinguished title, a material loss of benefits, significantly diminished\n\nmaterial responsibilities, or other indices that might be unique to a particular situation” ’\n\n[Citation]”). However, “not everything that makes an employee unhappy is an actionable\n\nadverse action. Otherwise, minor and even trivial employment actions that ‘an *** employee did\n\n\n                                                  29\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nnot like would form the basis of a discrimination suit.’ ” Smart v. Ball State University, 89 F.3d\n\n473, 441 (7th Cir. 1996), quoting Williams v. Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co., 85 F.3d 270, 274 (7th\n\nCir. 1993).\n\n       Accordingly, it has repeatedly been held that oral and written reprimands alone do not\n\nalter an employee’s terms or conditions of employment to such an extent so as to constitute an\n\nadverse employment action for purposes of establishing a prima facie case of employment\n\ndiscrimination. See, e.g., Lloyd v. Swifty Transportation , Inc., 552 F.3d 594, 602 (7th Cir.\n\n2009) (“written reprimands without any changes in the terms and conditions of *** employment\n\nare not adverse employment actions”); see also Atanus v. Perry, 520 F.3d 662, 675 (7th Cir.\n\n2008) (holding that “letter or instruction” which admonished the employee that she was not\n\nfollowing guidelines did not rise to the level of adverse employment action where the employee\n\ndid not show any job consequences such as termination, demotion, or change in responsibilities);\n\nsee also Oest v. Illinois Department of Corrections, 240 F.3d 605, 613 (7th Cir. 2001) (holding\n\nthat oral and written reprimands received under progressive discipline system did not constitute\n\nadverse employment action where they did not implicate any tangible job consequences); Grube\n\nv. Lau Industries, Inc., 257 F.3d 723, 729 (7th Cir. 2001) (“unfair reprimands or negative\n\nperformance evaluations, unaccompanied by some tangible job consequence, do not constitute\n\nadverse employment actions”); Krause v. City of La Crosse, 246 F.3d 995, 1000 (7th Cir. 2001)\n\n(same); Sweeney v. West, 149 F.3d 550, 556-57 (7th Cir. 1998) (holding that “two counseling\n\nstatements” which admonished the employee to improve did not constitute adverse employment\n\naction since employee failed to point to any immediate consequences of the reprimands, such as\n\n\n                                                30\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nchange in an eligibility for promotion, denial of advantageous increase in responsibilities or\n\nsimilar benefits); cf., Coolidge v. Consolidated City of Indianapolis, 505 F.3d 731, 735 (7th Cir.\n\n2007) (explaining that two reprimands followed by termination constituted an employment\n\naction).\n\n       In the present case, Owens nowhere alleged and the Department’s investigation nowhere\n\nrevealed any evidence suggesting that the December 13, 2004, “written reprimand” had any\n\nsignificant effect on the terms or conditions of his employment, so as to constitute an adverse\n\nemployment action. In its letter to the Department, Exxon Mobil explained that a written\n\nreprimand is a disciplinary document that merely tells an employee that he has failed to make the\n\nnecessary improvements in performance or behavior and that if he continues to perform\n\nunsatisfactorily he may be subject to more severe discipline, up to and including discharge.\n\nConsistent with this assertion, the December 13, 2004, written reprimand served only to warn\n\nOwens about his unsatisfactory work performance. In this respect, in his own discrimination\n\ncharge, Owens asserted only that he was issued the reprimand for “working too slowly and for\n\nmaking excessive errors.” Shift supervisor Koziol similarly stated that he issued the written\n\nreprimand to Owens because of his poor performance. Accordingly, there was no evidence that\n\nthe written reprimand had any significant effect on the terms and conditions of Owens’ job, such\n\nas the amount of his pay, his benefits or his work responsibilities. Therefore, Owens failed in his\n\nburden to establish that the written reprimand constituted an adverse employment action. See,\n\ne.g., Lloyd, 552 F.3d at 602 (holding that a loading driver who received two written reprimands\n\nfor loading gas from the wrong supplier failed to establish a prima facie case of employment\n\n\n                                                31\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\ndiscrimination since “written reprimands without any changes in the terms and conditions of his\n\nemployment are not adverse employment actions”); see also Atanus, 520 F.3d at 675 (holding\n\nthat employee had failed to establish that a “letter or instruction” which admonished her that she\n\nwas not following company guidelines constituted an adverse employment action where the\n\nemployee did not show that the letter was followed by any significant consequences to her\n\nemployment, such as termination, demotion, or change in responsibilities): see also Sweeney,\n\n149 F.3d at 556-57 (holding that employee failed to establish that “two counseling statements”\n\nwhich admonished him to improve constituted an adverse employment action since employee\n\nfailed to point to any immediate consequences of the reprimands, such as change in an eligibility\n\nfor promotion, denial of advantageous increase in responsibilities or similar benefits).\n\n       Owens nevertheless argues on appeal that in finding that the written reprimand did not\n\nconstitute an adverse employment action, the chief legal counsel erroneously relied on Mattern v.\n\nEastern Kodak Co., 104 F.3d 702 (5th Cir. 1997). Owens argues that while in Mattern, the Fifth\n\nCircuit held that only “ultimate employment decisions” are actionable adverse acts, the United\n\nStates Supreme Court invalidated that ruling in Burlington Northern & Santa Fe R.y. Co. v.\n\nWhite, 548 U.S. 53, 165 L. Ed. 2d 345, 126 S. Ct. 2405 (2006). Owens, however,\n\nmisunderstands both the chief legal counsel’s decision as well as the decision in Burlington\n\nNorthern.\n\n       First, contrary to Owens’ assertion, the chief legal counsel did not cite Mattern for the\n\nproposition that only “ultimate employment decisions” are to be considered actionable adverse\n\nacts for purposes of discrimination claims. Rather, the chief legal counsel relied on Mattern for\n\n                                                32\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nthe principle that to constitute an adverse employment action, the employer’s action must have\n\nsomehow “detrimentally affected” the employee. The chief legal counsel then found that the\n\nDepartment’s investigation disclosed no evidence that the December 13, 2004, written reprimand\n\nsomehow detrimentally affected Owens, such as by way of “loss of pay, loss of benefits,\n\nsuspension, discharge, etc.” Based on the aforementioned, the chief legal counsel found that\n\nOwens had failed to present a prima facie case of an actionable adverse employment action.\n\n       Moreover, Owens’ citation to Burlington Northern is entirely misplaced. In that case, the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court held that claims of retaliation are not limited to actions that affect\n\nthe employee’s terms and conditions of employment. Burlington Northern, 548 U.S. at 63-67,\n\n165 L. Ed. 2d at 357-59, 126 S. Ct. at 2412-15. In doing so, however, the Supreme Court\n\nexpressly distinguished claims of substantive employment discrimination, such as the one here,\n\nfrom claims of retaliation, explaining that substantive discrimination claims are limited to\n\nactions that affect the employee’s terms and conditions of employment. Burlington Northern,\n\n548 U.S. at 64-67, 165 L. Ed. 2d at 357-59, 126 S. Ct. at 2412-15. As the Court in Burlington\n\nNorthern explained:\n\n       “The antidiscrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not\n\n       discriminated against because of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status.\n\n       See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 800-801, [36 L. Ed.2d 668, 93 S.\n\n       Ct. 18117] (1973). The antiretaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by\n\n       preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee’s efforts\n\n       to secure or advance enforcement of the Act’s basic guarantees. The substantive\n\n                                                33\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, i.e., their status.\n\n       The antiretaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do,\n\n       i.e., their conduct.\n\n                To secure the first objective, Congress did not need to prohibit anything other\n\n       than employment-related discrimination. The substantive provision’s basic objective of\n\n       ‘equality of employment opportunities’ and the elimination of practices that tend to bring\n\n       about ‘stratified job environments,’ [citation] would be achieved were all\n\n       employment-related discrimination miraculously eliminated.\n\n                But one cannot secure the second objective by focusing only upon employer\n\n       actions and harm that concern employment and the workplace. Were all such actions and\n\n       harms eliminated, the antiretaliation provision’s objective would not be achieved. An\n\n       employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly\n\n       related to his employment or by causing him harm outside the workplace.” (Emphasis\n\n       omitted.) Burlington Northern, 548 U.S. at 63, 165 L. Ed. 2d at 356-57, 126 S. Ct. at\n\n       2412.\n\nAccordingly, Owens’ citation to Burlington Northern in support of his substantive discrimination\n\nclaim is without merit.\n\n       In any event, even if we were to hold that the December 13, 2004, written reprimand was\n\nan adverse employment action, a review of the record below reveals that contrary to Owens’\n\ncontention, the chief legal counsel did not abuse his discretion in finding that this reprimand was\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nnot related to Owens race or age.\n\n        In that respect, we note that the record below reveals that Exxon Mobil issued Owens the\n\nwritten reprimand in accordance with Exxon Mobil’s disciplinary policies because Owens had\n\naccumulated a history of loading errors. The Department’s investigation report revealed that\n\nExxon Mobil’s plant rules provide that an employee who fails to maintain proper standards of\n\nconduct or who violates any of the plant rules will be subject to appropriate discipline up to and\n\nincluding termination. The rules further state that supervisors may establish additional rules\n\ndeemed necessary by operational requirements.\n\n        The Department’s investigation further revealed that prior to the December 13, 2004,\n\nOwens had accumulated a history of performance problems related to loading. The\n\nDepartment’s investigation disclosed that Exxon Mobil received and investigated several\n\ncomplaints on orders loaded by Owens beginning in June 2004. Specifically the investigation\n\nrevealed that Owens first received “verbal counseling” for a loading error on June 25, 2004, as a\n\nresult of his failure to add a pallet onto his loading truck and as a result of his inability to fill the\n\norder in the requisite amount of time. Owens next received a “verbal counseling” session in\n\nOctober 2004, after his failure to fill a customer order dated October 7, 2004. That order\n\nrequested five cases of “Mobil Grease CM-S,” but the customer received none. Owens received\n\nanother verbal coaching session in November 2004 as a result of his failure to properly load a\n\ncustomer order dated October 29, 2004. Although in that order, the customer requested 1,092\n\ncases of “Mobil 1 5W30,” it received only 936 of those cases. Following these three loading\n\nerrors, Owens was issued the written reprimand on December 13, 2004, after an investigation\n\n                                                   35\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\ninto a customer’s complaint regarding an order dated August 5, 2004, revealed that Owens had\n\nfailed to properly load that order. While that customer order requested 26 cases of “Mobil 1\"\n\nproducts, 11 pails of “Mobilux EP2,” 5 pails of “Mobil ShC 632\" and 4 pails of Vacuoline, the\n\ncustomer received 25 cases of “Mobil 1” products, 12 pails of “Mobilux EP2,” 4 pails of “Mobil\n\nShC 632,” 3 pails of Vacuoline, and 1 pail of “something without a label.” Accordingly, the\n\nDecember 13, 2004, written reprimand was intended to warn Owens that he had failed to make\n\nthe necessary improvements in his performance and that if he continued to perform\n\nunsatisfactorily he could be subject to more severe discipline.\n\n       Moreover, the Department’s investigation disclosed no evidence at all that similarly\n\nsituated employees outside Owens’ protected class were not similarly disciplined for similar\n\nconduct. In fact, Exxon Mobil’s disciplinary records for the employees at the Cicero plant\n\nrevealed that Exxon Mobil issued written reprimands, “counseling,” and even suspensions to\n\nyounger, white employees in the plant for their poor work performance. For example, on August\n\n29, 2003, Panozzo (white, 26 years old) received a letter of reprimand for operating a forklift\n\ntruck in an unsafe manner on company property. Similarly, on August 29, 2003, Wantroba\n\n(white, 36) was suspended for truck spillage, and on August 28, 2003, Novakowksi (white, 47)\n\nreceived “counseling” for failure to wear proper attire at the plant.\n\n       More importantly, Exxon Mobil’s loading error investigation reports disclosed that other\n\nemployees were disciplined for their poor performance in loading orders. For example, those\n\nreports showed that in 2004 and 2005 both Hansen (white, 44 years old) and Panozzo (white, 26\n\nyears old) were “coached” for loading errors. Similarly, in 2004 both Wright (white, 23 years\n\n                                                 36\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nold) and Pratscher (white, 47 years old) were given errors in their personnel files for loading\n\nerrors. In 2005, Pratscher was subsequently coached for not following loading procedures. In\n\naddition, the reports reveals that both Panozzo and Johnson (white, 49 years old) received letters\n\nof reprimand in 2003 and 2001, respectively, the first for unsafe use of a forklift and the latter for\n\na product mix error in loading. Both Panozzo and Johnson were also suspended for poor\n\nperformance (Johnson in 2002 for a product mix error, and Panozzo in 2001 for an error loading\n\nthe forklift). Accordingly, Owens cannot contend that other, younger and white employees\n\nescaped discipline at the plant.\n\n       Owens nevertheless argues that he presented sufficient evidence of race- and age-based\n\ndiscrimination because the reports from Exxon Mobil reveal that while younger white employees\n\nwere disciplined, unlike him, they were not given letters of reprimand for loading errors. Owens\n\nspecifically points out that Pratscher, Hanson and Panozzo only received coaching for their\n\nloading errors, and Wright only had an error reported in his file for a loading error. For the\n\nreasons that follow, we find this argument without merit.\n\n       We first note that when interviewed by the Department’s investigator, operations\n\nmanager O’Reilly explained that an employee would receive a “written counseling” followed by\n\na “written reprimand” or written warning only after he or she accumulated more than three\n\nloading errors. In that respect O’Reilly stated that, contrary to Owens’ contention, Wright was\n\nonly given a loading error in his file, instead of a “counseling” or a warning, because prior to that\n\nhe had made no loading errors. O’Reilly also explained that Pratscher and Panozzo had not been\n\ncounseled or given written warnings with respect to loading errors since neither had committed\n\n                                                 37\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nthree such errors.\n\n       More importantly, Owens himself fails to allege that anyone of the aforementioned\n\nemployees was in fact similarly situated to him. As explained above, the record demonstrates\n\nthat Owens had a history of loading errors and had received “verbal counseling” and “coaching”\n\nfor these errors before his December 13, 2004, “written reprimand.” However, in arguing that\n\nthe other employees did not receive “written reprimands,” Owens does not show or even allege\n\nthat they had a similar history concerning loading errors.\n\n       Accordingly, under the record below, it is apparent that the chief legal counsel did not\n\nabuse his discretion in finding that there was a lack of substantial evidence showing that Exxon\n\nMobil issued Owens the December 13, 2004, reprimand on the basis of his age or his race.\n\n       Owens next contends that the chief legal counsel erred in sustaining the Department’s\n\ndismissal of counts C and D of his discrimination charge because there was substantial evidence\n\nthat shift supervisor Koziol issued him a second “written reprimand” on February 15, 2005, on\n\nthe basis of his age and race. We disagree.\n\n       We initially note that for those same reasons already articulated above in the context of\n\nthe December 13, 2004, “written reprimand,” Owens has failed to show that the February 15,\n\n2004, “written reprimand” standing alone sufficiently affected the terms and conditions of his\n\nemployment so as to constitute an adverse employment action. As with the December 13, 2004,\n\nreprimand, here again, Owens presented no evidence to show that the second written reprimand\n\nhad any significant effect on the terms and conditions of his employment, such as his pay,\n\n\n\n                                                38\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nbenefits or work responsibility. See, e.g., Lloyd, 552 F.3d at 602; Atanus, 520 F.3d at 675;\n\nSweeney, 149 F.3d at 556-57.\n\n        More overridingly, even if the second “written reprimand” constituted an adverse\n\nemployment action, a review of the record below reveals that the chief legal counsel did not\n\nabuse his discretion in finding that there was no evidence that the decision to issue the reprimand\n\nwas not related to Owens’ race or age. In fact, the Department’s investigation revealed that\n\nOwens was issued the February 15, 2005, reprimand after committing a loading error on January\n\n7, 2005, by failing to load any of the eight drums of “Telura 622” requested by the customer and\n\nas a result of having committed numerous loading errors in the past. The customer order dated\n\nJanuary 7, 2005, showed that the customer did in fact order eight drums of “Telura 622.” Shift\n\nsupervisor Koziol told the Department investigator that after receiving and investigating the\n\ncustomer’s complaint, the warehouse supervisor found that its inventory was over by eight drums\n\nand that Owens was the warehouse operator in charge of loading that order. More importantly,\n\nOwens himself never denied making the error, but simply stated that he did not know whether he\n\nfailed to include the drum in the order, explaining that the customer could have changed the\n\norder after he loaded it.\n\n        In addition, the Department’s investigation revealed no evidence that similarly situated\n\nemployees outside of Owens’ protected class were not similarly disciplined for similar conduct.\n\nAs already articulated above, Exxon Mobil issued “written reprimands,” “counseling,” and\n\nsuspensions to numerous other employees for poor work performance. Accordingly, for all of\n\nthe aforementioned reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in the chief legal counsel’s dismissal\n\n                                                39\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nof counts C and D of Owens’ discrimination charge.            On appeal, Owens next contends that\n\nthe substantial evidence standard as articulated under section 7A-102(D)(2) of the Illinois\n\nHuman Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004)) violates the requirements of due\n\nprocess because it is unconstitutionally vague. Although not clearly explained in his brief,\n\nOwens appears to argue that the statute is unconstitutional on its face as well as applied to him\n\nbecause under the Act’s definition of “substantial evidence,” a petitioner does not know what\n\nlevel of proof is necessary to sustain a charge of discrimination, and because it gives the chief\n\nlegal counsel unbridled discretion. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n       At the outset, we note that Owens has waived his right to raise this issue on appeal by\n\nfailing to raise it in the administrative proceedings below. In that respect, we note that “[i]n\n\ngeneral, issues or defenses not placed before the administrative agency will not be considered for\n\nthe first time on administrative review.” Texaco-Cities Service Pipeline Co. v. McGaw, 182 Ill.\n\n2d 262, 278-79 (1998). Our supreme court has held that this general waiver principle applies to\n\nconstitutional challenges to a statute not raised before an administrative agency, unless the issue\n\nbeing raised for the first time on appeal is a facial challenge to the statute. See Texaco-Cites\n\nService Pipeline Co., 182 Ill. 2d at 278-79, Carpetland U.S.A., Inc. v. Illinois Department of\n\nEmployment Security, 201 Ill. 2d 351, 396-97 (2002); cf., Arvia v. Madigan, 209 Ill. 2d 520,\n\n527-28 (2004) (“A principal reason underlying this court’s preference that litigants assert a\n\nconstitutional challenge before the agency-notwithstanding the agency’s inability to rule on the\n\nmatter–is that it allows opposing parties a full opportunity to present evidence to refute the\n\nconstitutional challenge. Such an evidentiary record is indispensable because administrative\n\n\n                                                 40\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nreview is confined to the record created before the agency. [Citation.] A facial challenge to a\n\nstatute, however, presents an entirely legal question that does not require fact-finding by the\n\nagency or application of the agency’s particular expertise”).\n\n       With respect to a vagueness challenge to a statute, our supreme court has made clear that\n\na petitioner will have standing to challenge the constitutionality of a statute on its face only if the\n\nchallenged language implicates first amendment rights. See People v. Jihan, 127 Ill. 2d 379,\n\n385-86 (1989); see also People v. Ryan, 117 Ill. 2d 28, 34, (1987), quoting United States v.\n\nMazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 550, 42 L. Ed. 2d 706, 713, 95 S. Ct. 710, 714 (1975). Since here,\n\nOwens does not allege nor could he that the “substantial evidence” standard as articulated in\n\nsection 7A-102 of the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004))\n\nimplicates any first amendment concerns, he does not have standing to argue that the Act is\n\nfacially unconstitutional. See, e.g., Jihan, 127 Ill. 2d at 386 (holding that because no first\n\namendment issue was involved with respect to the constitutionality of the now repealed medical\n\npractice act provisions making it a crime to practice midwifery without a license, defendant did\n\nnot have standing to argue that the statute might be vague as applied to someone else).\n\nAccordingly, since Owens has no standing to make a facial challenge to the statute, and since he\n\nhas failed to argue before the Department that the statute is vague as applied to him, he has\n\nwaived his right altogether to address the vagueness issue on appeal. See Texaco-Cities Service\n\nPipeline Co., 182 Ill. 2d at 278-79; Carpetland U.S.A., Inc., 201 Ill. 2d at 396-97.\n\n       Nevertheless, even if we were to consider the merits of Owens’ vagueness contention, for\n\nthe reasons that follow, we would find that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague, either on\n\n                                                  41\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nits face or as applied to Owens.\n\n        It is well established that there is a strong presumption that a statute is constitutional and\n\nthat the party challenging its validity will bear the burden of clearly establishing that the statute is\n\nunconstitutional. People v. Sharpe, 216 Ill. 2d 481, 486-87 (2005); see also Morgan v.\n\nDepartment of Financial & Professional Regulation, 374 Ill. App. 3d 275, 292 (2007).\n\n        A vagueness challenge is a due process challenge focusing on the specificity of the\n\nlanguage of a statute. East St. Louis Federation of Teachers v. East St. Louis School District,\n\n178 Ill. 2d 399, 424-26 (1997). A statute is unconstitutionally vague and violates due process if\n\nit fails to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is\n\nforbidden by the statute or if there is an absence of standards restricting the discretion of\n\ngovernmental authorities who apply the law. East St. Louis Federation of Teachers, 178 Ill. 2d at\n\n424-26. The terms of a statute cannot be “ ‘so ill-defined that their meaning may be determined\n\nat whim rather than by objective criteria.’ ” East St. Louis Federation of Teachers, 178 Ill. 2d at\n\n425-26, quoting People v. Burpo, 164 Ill. 2d 261, 266 (1995); see also Morgan, 374 Ill. App. 3d\n\nat 292-93. Rather, the statute’s terms must be explicit enough to serve as a guide to those who\n\nmust comply with it. East St. Louis Federation of Teachers, 178 Ill. 2d at 425; see also Morgan,\n\n374 Ill. App. 3d at 292-93. However, mathematical certainty in the language is not required.\n\nEast St. Louis Federation of Teachers, 178 Ill. 2d at 424-25; see also Morgan, 374 Ill. App. 3d at\n\n292-93. Moreover, a statute will not be considered unconstitutionally vague “ ‘merely because\n\none could imagine hypothetical situations in which the meaning of some terms might be called\n\ninto question.’ ” Morgan, 374 Ill. App. 3d at 292, quoting Maun v. Department of Professional\n\n                                                  42\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nRegulation, 299 Ill. App. 3d 388, 397 (1998).\n\n       In the present case, the Act specifically defines “substantial evidence” and Owens has\n\nfailed to show that this definition was not sufficiently precise to guide the parties or the agency.\n\nAs already noted above, the Act defines “substantial evidence” as “evidence which a reasonable\n\nmind accepts as sufficient to support a particular conclusion and which consists of more than a\n\nmere scintilla but may be somewhat less than a preponderance.” (Emphasis added.) 775 ILCS\n\n5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004). Contrary to Owens’ assertion that the phrase “may be somewhat\n\nless than a preponderance” does not permit a party filing a discrimination charge to know\n\nwhether his or her claim must be supported by more than a preponderance of the evidence or less\n\nthan a preponderance of the evidence, the term “may” has clearly been defined as connoting only\n\npermission. See Cook County Board of Review v. Property Tax Appeal Board, 334 Ill. App. 3d\n\n56, 59 (2002) (“use of the word ‘may’ is construed as permissive, not mandatory”); see also New\n\nAmerican Webster Dictionary (1972) (defining “may” as “have the ability to” or “have\n\npermission to” or “be free to;” noting that the term is used to indicate probability and possibility).\n\nMoreover, those Illinois cases that have addressed the substantial evidence standard have made\n\nclear that substantial evidence does not require more than a preponderance of evidence. See, e.g.,\n\nStone v. Department of Human Rights, 299 Ill. App. 3d 306, 314-15 (1998) (“Substantial\n\nevidence means more than a mere scintilla but less than a preponderance of the evidence.\n\n[Citations.] Substantial evidence is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as\n\nadequate to support a conclusion”); see also Sanders v. United Parcel Service, 142 Ill. App. 3d\n\n362, 364 (1986) (noting that the substantial evidence standard “was deliberately left vague to\n\n\n                                                 43\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\npermit the [Department of Human Rights] some degree of discretion in ascertaining and\n\nevaluating the facts”). Accordingly, we find that the substantial evidence standard is not\n\nunconstitutionally vague.\n\n       Furthermore, Owens has specifically failed to show that the substantial evidence standard\n\nis vague as applied to him. Vagueness is an elastic concept, and just because a term is vague to\n\none person, does not necessarily mean that it will be vague to another. See City of Chicago v.\n\nPooh Bah Enterprises, Inc., 224 Ill. 2d 390, 441-42 (2006). Accordingly, where a party raises a\n\nvagueness challenge by arguing that a statute is vague as applied, a reviewing court must\n\n“evaluate a statute in the context of the specific circumstances in which it was applied to the\n\nlitigant who contests its validity.” Pooh Bah Enterprises., 224 Ill. 2d at 442; see also People v.\n\nRyan, 117 Ill. 2d 28, 34 (1987), quoting United States v. Mazurie, 419 U.S. 544, 550, 42 L. Ed.\n\n2d 706, 713, 95 S. Ct. 710, 714 (1975) (“ ‘[v]agueness challenges to statutes which do not\n\ninvolve First Amendment freedoms must be examined in the light of the facts of the case at\n\nhand’ ”). In the present case, we have already held that the mere issuance of two written\n\nreprimands did not constitute an adverse employment action. The sparsity of evidence offered by\n\nOwens to support the existence of an adverse employment action is therefore outside the\n\nconfines of the “substantial evidence standard” so that the term, even if otherwise unclear, would\n\nat least have sufficient clarity to denote an amount of evidence in excess of that which was\n\nprovided by Owens. Accordingly, under these circumstances Owens cannot complain that the\n\nAct is vague as applied to him. See Parker v. Levy, 417 U.S. 733, 756, 41 L. Ed. 2d 439, 458, 94\n\nS.

On February 23, 2005, Owens filed\n\nan amended charge adding that on February 15, 2005, despite satisfactorily performing his duties,\n\nhe received a second written reprimand because of his race (count C) and age (count D), in\n\nviolation of section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)), and\n\nfurther in retaliation for filing the subject discrimination charge (count E), in violation of section\n\n\n                                                  1\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n6-101(A) of the Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101(A) (West 2004)). On June 27, 2005, Owens filed a\n\nsecond amended charge, adding that on or about April 12, 2005, Exxon Mobil subjected him to\n\nunequal terms and conditions of employment when it refused to grant his request for tuition\n\nreimbursement based upon his race (count F), his age (count G), and in retaliation for his filing\n\nthe subject charge (count H).\n\n       After conducting an initial investigation, on August 3, 2007, the Department of Human\n\nRights issued a notice of dismissal for lack of substantial evidence as to all eight counts of\n\npetitioner’s charge. On January 22, 2009, however, the chief legal counsel of the Department of\n\nHuman Rights vacated the dismissal order and reversed for further investigation into all counts.\n\nUpon further investigation, the Department of Human Rights issued a second order of dismissal,\n\nagain finding that Owens had failed to present substantial evidence in support of his charge. This\n\ntime, the chief legal counsel agreed with the findings of the Department and sustained the\n\ndecision of the Department to dismiss petitioner’s charge. Owens now appeals.\n\n       On appeal, Owens contends that the chief legal counsel of the Department of Human\n\nRights abused his discretion when he sustained the decision of the Department to dismiss his\n\ndiscrimination charge, since he presented substantial evidence of discrimination. Owens also\n\ncontends that the substantial evidence standard as articulated under section 7A-102(D)(2) of the\n\nHuman Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004)) is unconstitutionally vague. For the\n\nreasons that follow, we affirm.\n\n                                        I. BACKGROUND\n\n       The undisputed facts establish that Owens has been employed by Exxon Mobil’s Cicero\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nRegional Distribution Center since 1977 and that at the time of the incident he was employed as\n\na warehouse operator.\n\n                                A. Owens’ Discrimination Charge\n\n       On February 2, 2005, Owens filed a two count charge of discrimination with the\n\nDepartment. In count A, Owens alleged that on December 13, 2004, he was subjected to\n\ndiscrimination by Exxon Mobil on the basis of his race (African American), in violation of\n\nsection 2-102(A) the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)). In count B,\n\nOwens alleged that on that same date, he was subjected to discrimination by Exxon Mobil on the\n\nbasis of his age (55 years old) violation of section 2-102(A) the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS\n\n5/2-102(A) (West 2004)). In support of both counts A and B, Owens stated that although on the\n\ndate in question he had been performing his duties in a satisfactory manner, his shift supervisor,\n\nMelvin Koziol, issued a written reprimand to him for “excessive loading time and loading\n\nerrors.” Owens further stated that although two similarly situated younger, white employees,\n\nCarl Pratscher, and Bryan Wright, had been cited for excessive loading time and loading errors,\n\nthey were not given written reprimands for their conduct.\n\n       On February 23, 2005, Owens filed an amended charged, reiterating his earlier claims,\n\nbut adding three more counts, C, D, and E. In count C, Owens alleged that on February 15,\n\n2005, he was discriminated against on the basis of his race when he was issued a second written\n\nreprimand by shift supervisor Koziol in violation of section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act\n\n(775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)). In count D, Owens alleged that this same incident was a\n\nresult of age discrimination, and violated section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS\n\n\n                                                 3\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n5/2-102(A) (West 2004)). Finally, in Count E, Owens alleged a claim of retaliatory\n\ndiscrimination pursuant to section 6-101(A) of the Act (775 ILCS 5/6-101(A) (West 2004)),\n\ncontending that the February 15, 2005, written reprimand was issued to him in retaliation for his\n\nfiling of the subject charge.\n\n       In support of counts C through E, Owens alleged the following facts. According to the\n\nsecond written reprimand, Owens had failed to perform his job duties by failing to include eight\n\ndrums of “Telura 622” when loading a customer order on January 7, 2005. Owens, however,\n\ndenied failing to perform his job duties on that date and explained that the eight drums of “Telura\n\n622 ” “may have been added to [his] order after [he] had gotten [his] shipping notice.” Owens\n\naverred that in the past there had been instances where subsequent changes made to a shipment\n\norder were not reflected on the copy of the shipping notice given to a warehouse operator.\n\nOwens further alleged that two similarly situated younger white employees, Pratscher and\n\nWright, had been treated differently under similar circumstances. Owens further alleged that on\n\nFebruary 15, 2002, he engaged in a protected activity by filing a discrimination charge with the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights and that the issuing of the second written reprimand followed this\n\nprotected activity “within such a period of time so as to raise an inference of retaliatory motive.”\n\nOn March 25, 2005, Exxon Mobil filed a verified response denying the material allegations of\n\nOwens’ charge.\n\n       On June 27, 2005, Owens filed a second amended charge, realleging counts A through E\n\nof his earlier charges, but adding three more counts, F, G, and H. In count F, Owens alleged that\n\non or about April 12, 2005, Exxon Mobil subjected him to unequal terms and conditions of\n\n\n                                                 4\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nemployment when it refused to grant his request for tuition reimbursement based upon his race,\n\nin violation of section 2-102(A) of the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)).\n\nIn count G, Owens alleged that, since at the time of this request, he was 55 years old, the denial\n\nof tuition reimbursement was also a result of age discrimination, in violation of section 2-102(A)\n\nof the Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)). Finally, in count H, Owens\n\nalleged a claim of retaliatory discrimination pursuant to section 6-101(A) of the Act (775 ILCS\n\n5/6-101(A) (West 2004)) claiming that Exxon Mobil refused to grant him tuition reimbursement\n\nin retaliation for his filing of the subject discrimination charge. In support of these additional\n\nclaims, Owens alleged that although on April 12, 2005, he submitted a request for tuition\n\nreimbursement to his shift supervisor, Koziol, since then “no action has been taken on his\n\nrequest.” Owens further stated that he “believe[s]” that other similarly situated, non-African-\n\nAmerican employees under the age of 40, namely Wright, Gary Wantroba and others, have been\n\ngranted tuition reimbursements. On August 10, 2005, Exxon Mobil filed a verified response to\n\nOwens’ amended charge denying the material allegations.\n\n                      B. The Department’s First Investigation and Dismissal\n\n       The Department of Human Rights conducted an investigation and based on its findings,\n\non August 3, 2007, dismissed all counts of Owens’ charge for lack of substantial evidence. In\n\nsupport of its dismissal, the Department of Human Rights attached voluminous records of its\n\ninvestigation. Those records reveal that during its investigation, an investigator for the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights interviewed several witnesses, including (1) the petitioner, Owens,\n\n(2) two retired Exxon Mobil employees (Mike Sanders and Ernest Hampton); (3) one current\n\n\n                                                  5\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nExxon Mobil employee (mechanic Jessee Thomas): (4) two members of Exxon Mobil\n\nmanagement at the Cicero Regional Distribution Center (shift supervisor Melvin Koziol, and\n\noperations manager, Patrick O’Reilly); and (5) Exxon Mobil’s in-house attorney, Judith Jansen.\n\nThe investigator also reviewed voluminous documents provided by the parties, including: (1) a\n\nletter of reprimand from Koziol to Owens dated February 15, 2005; (2) a group of loading error\n\ninvestigation reports; and (3) a group of general disciplinary documents for Exxon Mobil\n\nemployees at the Cicero Regional Distribution Plant.\n\n        With respect to counts A and B of Owens’ charge, the Department’s investigator\n\nreported the following evidence. When interviewed, Owens stated that on December 13, 2004,\n\nhis shift supervisor Koziol issued a written warning to him for “working too slow and making\n\nexcessive errors.” Although Owens admitted that he sometimes works slower than other\n\nemployees, he explained that he does so because “he is checking to make sure he is not making\n\nerrors.” Owens further stated that he believes his work performance is the same as that of other\n\nsimilarly situated warehouse operators, namely Wright (non-African-American, 23 year old),\n\nSteven Johnson (non-African-American, 49 years old), Michael Panozzo (non-African-\n\nAmerican, 26 years old), Pratscher (non-African-American, 47 years old) and Daniel Hanson\n\n(non-African- American, 44 years old). According to Owens, however, these other employees\n\nhave not received written reprimands for errors in their performance. Owens also stated that he\n\nbelieves that he was discriminated against because of his age as Exxon Mobil has a policy under\n\nwhich an employee may retire when he or she turns 55 and accumulates 15 years of service with\n\nthe company. Owens stated that one month after he turned 55 years old, he was issued a written\n\n\n                                                6\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nwarning.\n\n       According to the Department’s investigator, Owens allegations were corroborated by\n\nstatements from two retired and one current Exxon Mobil employee. Specifically, during an\n\ninterview with the Department’s investigator, retired filler1, Mike Sanders (African American, 60\n\nyears old) stated that “race discrimination was going on” at the plant. Sanders explained that\n\noperations manager Patrick O’Reilly (non-African-American, 48 years old) “is a racist,” who\n\ntreats African American employees “unfairly” and likes to discipline them when they should not\n\nbe disciplined.\n\n       Retired forklift driver2, Ernest Hampton (African American, 68 years old) similarly told\n\nthe Department’s investigator that he believed that “race discrimination and a whole bunch of\n\nother things [were] going on” at the plant, but he did not elaborate.\n\n       Finally, mechanic Jesse Thomas (African American, 43 years old), told the Department’s\n\ninvestigator that O’Reilly was “a racist,” and that he referred to African Americans as “niggers”\n\nand Mexican employees as “wetbacks.” Thomas also stated that O’Reilly was always\n\ndisciplining African American individuals for things they “did and did not do,” commenting\n\n“I’m going to get that nigger.” According to Thomas, several individuals complained to\n\nmanagement and human resources about O’Reilly’s racial slurs. As a result, between 2001 and\n\n2004, Exxon Mobil conducted an investigation into allegations of racial discrimination.\n\nAlthough during this investigation several managers initially attested to O’Reilly’s\n\n\n       1\n           The record reveals that Sanders retired three years prior to the instant litigation.\n       2\n           The record reveals that Hampton retired from Exxon Mobil in May 1995.\n\n                                                     7\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\ndiscrimination against African American employees, according to Thomas, after upper\n\nmanagement spoke to them, they were “scared off” and they refused to testify about O’Reilly’s\n\nconduct.\n\n       On the other hand, the Department’s investigator reported that contrary to Owens’\n\nallegations, management at Exxon Mobil’s Cicero plant denied having disciplined Owens\n\nbecause of his race and/or age. First, shift supervisor Koziol (non-African-American, 54) told\n\nthe Department investigator that on December 13, 2004, he issued Owens a “written counseling”\n\nand not a “written reprimand,” and that there is a difference between the two. Koziol explained\n\nthat he issued the “written counseling” to Owens because Exxon Mobil received several\n\ncomplaints on an order that Owens loaded on August 5, 2004. Specifically, Koziol stated that\n\nwhile the customer ordered 26 cases of “Mobil 1\" products, 11 pails of “Mobilux EP2,” 5 pails\n\nof “Mobil ShC 632\" and 4 pails of Vacuoline, it received 25 cases of “Mobil 1” products; 12\n\npails of “Mobilux EP2,” 4 pails of “Mobil ShC 632,” 3 pails of Vacuoline, and 1 pail of\n\n“something without a label.”\n\n       In addition, operations manager, Patrick O’Reilly told the Department investigator that\n\nOwens had made several mistakes on his orders prior to being issued the December 13, 2004,\n\n“written counseling.” O’Reilly explained Exxon Mobil’s procedure with issuing “written\n\ncounseling” to its employees. According to O’Reilly, anytime Exxon Mobil receives a customer\n\ncomplaint, it investigates to determine whether the complaint is legitimate. If the company\n\ndetermines that the complaint is legitimate, the employee receives a “loading error” in his or her\n\npersonnel file. Once an employee has three errors in his or her file, the employee receives a\n\n\n                                                 8\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nrecord of “counseling.”\n\n       With respect to the other similarly situated employees that Owens alleged were treated\n\ndifferently from him, O’Reilly explained that: (1) Wright and Johnson had not been issued any\n\n“counseling” or warnings because they had no loading errors; (2) Panozzo had been issued a\n\nwarning for unsafe conduct on a forklift and ordered to participate in one loading error coaching\n\nsession but had not been given “written counseling” since his file did not contain three loading\n\nerrors; (3) Pratscher received a coaching session for a loading error, but no “counseling” since he\n\ndid not commit three loading errors; and (4) Hanson received reprimands “for other things.”\n\n       The Department’s investigator further reported that Exxon Mobil’s counsel, Judith Jansen\n\n(a non-African-American, 63 years old), confirmed that if an Exxon Mobil employee has\n\ncompleted 15 years of service by the time he or she reaches the age of 55, that employee can\n\nretire. Jansen explained, however, that this is a benefit plan and not a company policy and that,\n\nas such, it had nothing to do with Owens’ “written counseling” record.\n\n       In addition, the Department’s investigator reported that Exxon Mobil’s disciplinary\n\ndocuments disclosed that similarly situated employees had also been issued “counseling,”\n\nreprimands, warnings and suspensions, and that they had not been treated differently than\n\nOwens. The investigator summarized his analysis of these disciplinary documents in two charts:\n\n(1) the first chart showing all the disciplinary actions taken against Owens and his coworkers in\n\nthe two years prior to his filing of the instant charge, and (2) the second chart summarizing all\n\nloading error investigation reports at the plant since 1999.\n\nCHART 1:\n\n\n                                                 9\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n Date       Name           Discipline    Reason                 Age   Race\n 08/28/03   Novakowski     Counseling    Failure to wear ppe    47    White\n 08/29/03   M Panozzo      Letter of     Unsafe operation of    26    White\n                           Reprimand     forklift\n 08/29/03   Wantroba       Suspension    Truck spillage         36    White\n 09/15/03   T Panozzo      Counseling    Unproductive           50    White\n                                         insubordination\n 12/15/03   Solis          Letter of     Absenteeism            25    Hispanic\n                           Warning\n 02/96/04   Pollack        Counseling    Absenteeism            54    White\n 03/23/04   Whittier       Counseling    Loading Errors         37    African\n                                                                      America\n                                                                      n\n 04/13/04   Washington     Suspension    Dishonesty related     36    African\n                                         to absence                   America\n                                                                      n\n 04/22/04   Drada          Counseling    Unacceptable           55    White\n                                         absence\n 05/03/04   Bustos         Letter of     Product                47    Hispanic\n                           Reprimand     contamination\n 08/13/04   Pollack        Counseling    Unacceptable           54    White\n                                         absenteeism\n 10/21/04   Hansen         Suspension    Refusal to report to   45    White\n                                         work\n 12/07/04   Owens          Counseling    Loading errors         55    African\n            (petitioner)                                              America\n                                                                      n\n\n\nCHART 2:\n\n\n\n\n                                        10\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n Date        Name                Discipline       Reason                 Age        Race\n 11/16/05    Hanson              Coached          Load error             44         White\n 10/28/04    M.

Owens averred that he could not be certain\n\nwhether he failed to include those drums in the customer order or whether the customer made\n\n\n                                                 11\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nchanges to the order after he had already loaded it.\n\n        On the other hand, Koziol denied Owens’ claim that he had been issued this second\n\nwritten reprimand as a result of his age or race or in retaliation for his filing the instant\n\ndiscrimination charge. In fact, Koziol averred that he was not even aware that Owens had filed a\n\ndiscrimination charge against Exxon Mobil. Rather, Koziol told the investigator that he issued\n\nOwens a “written warning” for his poor performance. Koziol explained that after Owens loaded\n\nan order for a customer on January 7, 2005, that customer contacted Exxon Mobil and indicated\n\nthat it had not received any of the eight drums it had ordered. According to Koziol, after the\n\nwarehouse supervisor counted the drums in the warehouse, he discovered that the warehouse had\n\neight additional drums, which verified that Owens, who was the warehouse operator that day,\n\nhad failed to ship them to the customer.\n\n        According to the Department’s investigator, Koziol’s statement was corroborated by a\n\nletter from Koziol to Owens dated February 15, 2005, in which Koziol informed Owens that he\n\nwas being issued a “letter of reprimand” as a “disciplinary measure” for his “failure to perform\n\n[his] job duties.” That letter states that Owens’ lack of attention to his assigned job task resulted\n\nin “customer services failures” and “monetary loss” to Exxon Mobil. The letter specifically\n\nnotes that Owens was being reprimanded because in filling a customer order on January 7, 2005,\n\nhe failed to put eight drums of “Telura 622\" in that order. The letter also notes that Owens has\n\npreviously received a record for “counseling,” on June 25, 2004, for doing a product conversion\n\nthat converted inventory to an incorrect product name, and subsequently on January 25, 2004, for\n\nmultiple loading errors on four different customer orders. The letter further states that in the past\n\n\n                                                   12\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nyear, Koziol had attempted to coach Owens on several occasions regarding his work\n\nperformance, lack of productivity, poor loading technique, loading errors and unsafe practices.\n\nThe letter further advised Owens:\n\n       “It is your responsibility to follow supervisor instruction, safe work practices and job\n\n       procedures, as well as completing assignments in a timely order. Failure to meet these\n\n       requirements will result in further disciplinary action, up to and including termination of\n\n       your employment from [Exxon Mobil.]”\n\n       Based on the foregoing investigation report, the Department of Human Rights\n\nrecommended that counts C, D, and E of Owens’ charge be dismissed.\n\n       With respect to counts F, G, and H, wherein Owens alleged that on or about April 12,\n\n2005, he was denied equal terms and conditions of employment when Koziol failed to honor his\n\nrequest for tuition reimbursement for several classes, later determined to be air conditioning,\n\nheating and ventilation classes, he had taken at a local community college, the Department’s\n\ninvestigator reported the following facts. Owens stated that after he submitted his request to\n\nExxon Mobil for reimbursement of his tuition on January 27, 2005, he was denied that request\n\nwithout any written explanation, while, he believes, other similarly situated employees, including\n\nWright and Wantroba, were granted similar requests. Owens admitted that he does not know for\n\ncertain whether Wright and Wantroba were in fact reimbursed.\n\n       When questioned about this incident by the Department investigator, Koziol admitted that\n\nOwens requested and was denied tuition reimbursement, but he stated that the reason was\n\nnondiscriminatory. Koziol explained that Owens was denied reimbursement because his\n\n\n                                                13\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\napplication did not meet Exxon Mobil’s tuition reimbursement policy, which requires that an\n\nemployee be preapproved for tuition reimbursement before taking the classes. According to\n\nKoziol, Owens submitted a request for tuition reimbursement after already having taken the\n\nclasses.\n\n          According to the Department’s investigator, Koziol’s statements were corroborated by\n\nthe receipts for those classes submitted by Owens to Exxon Mobil, which reveal that the classes\n\nwere taken over a year before Owens filed his request for reimbursement. They were also\n\ncorroborated by Exxon Mobil’s written tuition reimbursement policy. Under that policy Exxon\n\nMobil promised to “reimburse employees for actual cost for registration, tuition, regular\n\ninstruction fees and required textbooks,” if the employees qualified for reimbursement. To\n\nqualify for reimbursement, the courses taken must have been “designed to maintain or improve\n\nthe employee’s job skills and increase work related competencies or capabilities,” and must have\n\nbeen taken at an “accredited university, college or vocational institution for a grade.” Most\n\nimportantly, the policy mandated that “management *** approve the employee’s application for\n\na specific course of study and the educational institution before each enrollment.” (Emphasis\n\nadded.)\n\n          Koziol also stated that contrary to Owens’ allegations, Wright and Wantroba were not\n\nreimbursed tuition for classes they had taken. In fact, Koziol stated that Exxon Mobil has not\n\nreimbursed anyone for tuition expenses at the plant in the past three years. Wright and Wantroba\n\ncorroborated Koziol’s statements. While Wright indicated that he had never requested or\n\nreceived tuition reimbursement from Exxon Mobil, Wantroba stated that although he had\n\n\n                                                 14\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nrequested reimbursement on one occasion, that reimbursement was not granted because the class\n\nWantroba took did not qualify for tuition reimbursement.\n\n        Based on the aforementioned investigation, the Department of Human Rights found that\n\nthere was insufficient evidence to permit Owens to proceed with counts F, G and H of his\n\ndiscrimination charge. Accordingly, the Department recommended that Owens charge be\n\ndismissed in its entirety.\n\n             C. The Chief Legal Counsel’s Reversal of the Department’s Dismissal\n\n        On January 22, 2008, the chief legal counsel of the Department of Human Rights entered\n\nan order vacating the Department’s dismissal of the charge and remanding the matter to the\n\nDepartment for further investigation. With respect to counts A, B, C, D, and E of the charge, the\n\nchief legal counsel directed the Department to determine the following: (1) Exxon Mobil’s\n\nwritten discipline policy; (2) the difference between a “written counseling” and a “written\n\nwarning” and/or “written reprimand”; and (3) specifically, what Exxon Mobil’s discipline policy\n\nstates are the consequences of loading errors.\n\n        With respect to counts F, G, and H, the chief legal counsel directed the Department to\n\ndetermine: (1) the date Owens submitted his application for tuition reimbursement; (2) Exxon\n\nMobil’s criteria in determining whether courses can be reimbursed; (3) the exact dates Owens’\n\ncourses started and whether the list of those courses was submitted to Exxon Mobil prior to the\n\ntuition reimbursement application process; and (4) the exact date when Owens’ request for\n\ntuition reimbursement was denied.\n\n                     D. The Department’s Second Investigation and Dismissal\n\n\n                                                 15\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       On July 10, 2008, the Department completed an addendum investigation report, based\n\nupon which it again dismissed all counts of Owens’ discrimination charge. In conducting its\n\nsecond investigation, the Department investigator reinterviewed Owens and Koziol, as well as\n\nreviewed several additional documents provided by the parties, including, inter alia: (1) an\n\nexcerpt from Exxon Mobil’s plant rules; (2) a letter from Exxon Mobil to the Department of\n\nHuman Rights; (3) a group of loading error investigation reports for Owens; and (4) Owens’\n\ntuition refund application together with a group of verification for tuition payment forms.\n\n       With respect to counts A through E, the Department’s addendum investigation report\n\ndisclosed the following evidence pertinent to the Department’s dismissal of those counts. When\n\nreinterviewed regarding Exxon Mobil’s disciplinary policy, shift supervisor Koziol stated that\n\nboth the terms of Owens’ employment and any disciplinary actions to be taken against him are\n\ngoverned by the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, as well as the Cicero plant’s\n\ndisciplinary rules.\n\n       In a letter to the Department dated February 13, 2008, Exxon Mobil explained the\n\ncontents of the collective bargaining agreement as well as the Cicero plant’s disciplinary rules.\n\nAccording to the bargaining agreement, with respect to discipline, if an “employee alleges his/her\n\ndischarge was unjust,” he or she has 10 working days to file a grievance regarding the discharge.\n\nAfter the employee files a grievance, the company must inform the union within three working\n\ndays of the reason for a disciplinary suspension or a discharge and if the union feels there was no\n\njust cause for the company’s action, the case may be processed under the grievance and\n\narbitration procedure. In addition, according to the collective bargaining agreement, the\n\n\n                                                16\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\ncompany and the union agree to “abide by all valid and applicable non-discrimination laws.”\n\nFinally, under the agreement “[t]he company retains all rights of management resulting from the\n\nownership of the plant or pertaining to the operation of the business, except to the extent that\n\nsuch rights are limited by the provisions of this Agreement.” According to Exxon Mobil, under\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement, with respect to discipline, the agreement provides only that\n\nif the employee believes a suspension or discharge is without “just cause,” that employee can file\n\na grievance, and if the grievance is not resolved, the union can request arbitration. The\n\nagreement places no other limitations on management’s right to operate the business, which\n\nincludes the right to set standards for work performance and work place behavior and to\n\nadminister discipline where employees fail to meet standards of performance and behavior.\n\n       In this vein, according to Exxon Mobil, the Cicero Regional Distribution Center\n\nmanagement has issued plant disciplinary rules. Those plant rules first state that because\n\n“personal discipline and proper standards of conduct are necessary to protect the health and\n\nsafety of all employees,” any employee “who fails to maintain at all times proper standards of\n\nconduct or who violates any of the plant rules shall subject [himself or herself] to appropriate\n\ndisciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.” Although the plant rules\n\nspecify certain standards of conduct, such as procedures for reporting injuries or excusing\n\nabsences, and the ban on “horseplay,” sexual harassment, and the use of cell phones inside the\n\nplant, they do not include or elaborate on the disciplinary procedure or consequences resulting\n\nfrom loading errors. The plant rules do, however, end with the following statement:\n\n       “These rules are not intended to be all inclusive, the Company may establish additional\n\n\n                                                 17\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       rules, and supervisors may set up rules deemed necessary by operational requirements.\n\n       Any employee who fails to maintain, at all times, proper standards of conduct, or who\n\n       violates any of the [above] rules, may be subjected to disciplinary action, which may\n\n       include termination.”\n\n       In its letter to the Department, Exxon Mobil also responded to the chief legal counsel’s\n\nrequest that Exxon Mobil explain that the difference between a “written counseling” and a\n\n“written warning.” According to Exxon Mobil, “the difference between ‘counseling’ and\n\n‘warning’ is a universally understood concept in labor relations,” under which the “objective of\n\n‘counseling’ is to change an employee’s behavior,” while the “objective of ‘warning’ is\n\ndiscipline.”\n\n       According to Exxon Mobil, “counseling” or “coaching” an employee on his performance\n\nis not a disciplinary action. A “counseling” may or may not be reported in the employee’s\n\npersonnel file. Often it consists merely of informal discussions between supervisor and\n\nemployee wherein “the employee is advised that certain behavior does not meet the employer’s\n\nstandards and that specified remedial actions are needed.” Since most employees respond\n\nfavorably to informal “counseling” and are fully capable of avoiding or correcting their errors,\n\n“verbal counseling” is generally not considered discipline. However, should “verbal counseling”\n\nprove ineffective, a formal counseling (i.e., “written counseling”) session may follow. When a\n\nwritten memo detailing a “counseling” session is placed in an employee’s personnel file, it is\n\nintended to provide the employee with “fair notice of the employer’s specific requirements,” as\n\nwell as to lend “formality to the session, thereby increasing its significance to the employee.”\n\n\n                                                 18\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       On the other hand, according to Exxon Mobil, a “letter of reprimand” or a “written\n\nwarning,” is a “disciplinary document that informs the employee that he has failed to make the\n\nnecessary improvements in performance or behavior and that if he continues to perform\n\nunsatisfactorily he may be subject to more severe discipline, up to and including discharge.”\n\n       According to Exxon Mobil’s letter to the Department, on December 13, 2004, Owens was\n\ngiven a “written reprimand” because he had accumulated three prior loading errors for poor\n\nperformance.3 In support of this contention, Exxon Mobil provided the Department with a copy\n\n\n       3\n           We note that the record is somewhat unclear as to what type of document Owens was\n\nissued on December 13, 2004. While Owens alleged that he was given a “written reprimand,”\n\nboth shift supervisor Koziol and operations manager O’Reilly initially told the Department’s\n\ninvestigator that Owens was merely issued a “written counseling.” The record also reveals that\n\nin its initial response to the Department’s investigator Exxon Mobil explained that while Owens\n\nwas given a “written reprimand” on December 13, 2004, that reprimand was later reduced to a\n\n“written counseling” after Owens filed a grievance with Exxon Mobil and prior to his filing of\n\nthe instant discrimination charge with the Department of Human Rights. However, during the\n\nDepartment’s second investigation, in a letter to the Department, Exxon Mobil apparently\n\nconceded that Owens was given a “written reprimand” on December 13, 2004. In that vein,\n\nduring this second investigation, shift supervisor Koziol changed his prior statement to the\n\nDepartment’s investigator now admitting that Owens was in fact given a “written reprimand,”\n\nand not a “written counseling.” Since the Department’s investigator, the chief legal counsel and\n\nboth parties on appeal seem to agree that on December 13, 2004, Owens was a “written\n\n                                                19\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nof several documents related to these three loading error investigation reports, dated November\n\n1, 2004, October 12, 2004, and December 7, 2004. Those documents revealed that Owens first\n\nreceived “verbal counseling” for a loading error on June 25, 2004, as a result of his failure to add\n\na pallet onto his loading truck and as a result of his inability to fill the order in the requisite\n\namount of time. Owens next received “verbal counseling” in October, after his failure to fill a\n\ncustomer order dated October 7, 2004. That order requested five cases of “Mobil Grease CM-S,”\n\nbut the customer received none. The reports further revealed that Owens received another\n\n“verbal coaching session” in November as a result of his failure to properly load a customer\n\norder dated October 29, 2004. Although in that order the customer requested 1,092 cases of\n\n“Mobil 1 5W30,” it received only 936 of those cases.\n\n        As a result of these three prior loading errors, which were followed by “verbal\n\ncounseling” sessions, Owens was given a “written reprimand” on December 13, 2004, after a\n\ncustomer complained regarding an order he loaded on August 5, 2004. While that customer\n\norder requested 26 cases of “Mobil 1\" products, 11 pails of “Mobilux EP2,” 5 pails of “Mobil\n\nShC 632” and 4 pails of Vacuoline, the customer received 25 cases of “Mobil 1” products; 12\n\npails of “Mobilux EP2,” 4 pails of “Mobil ShC 632,” 3 pails of Vacuoline; and 1 pail of\n\n“something without a label.”\n\n        Based upon the aforementioned additional evidence, as well as the information gathered\n\nduring its initial investigation, the Department found that Owens had not presented substantial\n\n\nreprimand,” we have no reason to deviate from this conclusion and therefore treat the “written\n\nreprimand” as such.\n\n                                                   20\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nevidence so as to support the allegations in counts A through E of his charge.\n\n       With respect to counts F, G, and H, wherein Owens alleged he had been denied equal\n\nterms and conditions of employment when Exxon Mobil refused to grant him tuition\n\nreimbursement on the basis of his race, age and in retaliation for his filing of the instant charge,\n\nthe Department’s addendum investigation report revealed the following additional evidence.\n\nUpon being reinterviewed, Owens stated that in 2005 he submitted his paperwork requesting to\n\nbe reimbursed for air conditioning, heating and ventilation classes that he completed in 2002,\n\n2003, and 2004.4 Owens stated that he did not request tuition reimbursement on those classes\n\nearlier because prior to taking them he was told that he would not be reimbursed, since those\n\nclasses were not related to his job duties as a forklift driver. Owens explained, however, that he\n\ntook the classes anyway, paying for them out of pocket because in the future, he planned to bid\n\non a maintenance position at the plant. That position involved work with boilers.\n\n       Upon being reinterviewed, shift supervisor Koziol stated that Exxon Mobil does not keep\n\na record of denied requests for tuition reimbursement and does not have a record of the specific\n\ndate on which Owens requested reimbursement. Koziol reiterated that the reason for the denial\n\nof Owens tuition reimbursement request was nondiscriminatory. According to Koziol, Owens\n\nwas denied reimbursement because the courses were not preapproved and because they did not\n\nmeet the criteria of the program, i.e., they were unrelated to his Owens’ job duties.\n\n\n       4\n           A group of verification for tuition payment forms along with an educational refund\n\napplication for approval form for Owens indicates that Owens took classes during the years 2002\n\nthrough 2004, which totaled $3,352.\n\n                                                 21\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       Based upon the foregoing, the Department dismissed counts F, G, and H of Owens’\n\ncharge. Owens subsequently filed a request for review by the chief legal counsel of the\n\nDepartment.\n\n                       E. The Chief Legal Counsel Affirms the Dismissal\n\n       On March 9, 2009, the chief legal counsel entered an order sustaining the dismissal of all\n\neight counts of Owens’ charge for lack of substantial evidence supporting claims of\n\ndiscrimination. With respect to counts A and B, wherein Owens alleged that on December 13,\n\n2004, he received a written reprimand on the basis of his race and age, the chief legal counsel\n\nfirst found that such a “written reprimand” did not constitute an adverse employment action,\n\nsince Owens did and could not allege that this reprimand somehow “detrimentally affected” his\n\nemployment, such as through “loss of pay, loss of benefits, suspension, discharge etc.” Citing to\n\nMattern v. Eastern Kodak Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733271\"><a href=\"/opinion/733271/jean-g-mattern-v-eastman-kodak-company-and-eastman-chemical-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1997), the chief legal counsel therefore\n\nfound that a claim of discrimination based upon the December 13, 2004, written reprimand was\n\nnot actionable under the Illinois Human Rights Act.\n\n       The chief legal counsel next found that even if this written reprimand could somehow\n\nconstitute an adverse employment action, the investigation failed to reveal substantial evidence\n\nof a nexus between the written reprimand and Owens’ age/and or race. Rather, according to the\n\nchief legal counsel, the Department’s investigation established that Owens had a history of\n\nperformance problems related to loading errors prior to December 13, 2004, and that he was\n\nissued the written reprimand as a result of this history of poor performance. In addition, the chief\n\nlegal counsel noted that contrary to Owens’ allegations the Department’s investigation disclosed\n\n\n                                                22\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nthat Exxon Mobil issued discipline to other employees for their poor performance. Among those\n\nemployees disciplined, the chief legal counsel noted: Hanson (white, 44), who received coaching\n\nfor loading errors; Panozzo (white, 26), who was coached and then suspended for loading errors;\n\nWright (white, 23), who was given a written error report in his personnel file for loading errors;\n\nJohnson (white, 49), who was given a written warning and then suspended for product mix\n\nerrors; and Pratscher (white, 47), who was coached for not following loading procedures.\n\n       The chief legal counsel similarly found with respect to counts C, D, and E, that Owens\n\nhad failed to provide substantial evidence that he was issued the second written reprimand on\n\nFebruary 15, 2005, because of his race or age or in retaliation for filing the instant charge.\n\nRather, the Department’s investigation revealed that on or about January 7, 2005, Owens loaded\n\nan order, the customer reported that it did not receive the complete order and Exxon Mobil\n\nissued Owens the written reprimand for this error. Referring to its rationale with respect to\n\ncounts A and B, the chief legal counsel reiterated that the Department’s investigation disclosed\n\nthat Exxon Mobil similarly disciplined several warehouse operators not in Owens’ protected age\n\nand/or race classes.\n\n       Finally, with respect to counts F, G, and H, the chief legal counsel found that the\n\ninvestigation did not reveal substantial evidence that Exxon Mobil subjected Owens to unequal\n\nterms and conditions of employment because of his age, race or in retaliation for filing the\n\nsubject charge when it refused to refund his tuition. Specifically, the chief counsel noted that the\n\ntuition policy clearly states that management must approve the tuition reimbursement prior to\n\neach enrollment in a class.\n\n\n                                                 23\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n        Owens now appeals, contending that the chief legal counsel’s decision to sustain the\n\ndismissal of his charge constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n                                            II. ANALYSIS\n\n        We begin by noting the well-established principles regarding discrimination charges\n\nbrought under the Illinois Human Rights Act (Act) (775 ILCS 5/1-101 et seq. (West 2004)). This\n\nAct prohibits “unlawful discrimination,” i.e., discrimination against a person on the basis of,\n\ninter alia, his or her race, color, religion, national origin, ancestry, age, sex, marital status, or\n\nhandicap. 775 ILCS 5/1-102 (West 2004). The Act specifically defines the following conduct as\n\na civil rights violation in the employment context:\n\n                 “For any employer to refuse to hire, to segregate, or to act with respect to\n\n        recruitment, hiring, promotion, renewal of employment, selection for training or\n\n        apprenticeship, discharge, discipline, tenure or terms, privileges or conditions of\n\n        employment on the basis of unlawful discrimination ***.” 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West\n\n        2004).\n\nThe Act also defines retaliation as a civil rights violation, noting:\n\n                 “It is a civil rights violation for a person, or for two or more persons to conspire,\n\n        to:\n\n                 *** Retaliate against a person because he or she has opposed that which he or she\n\n        reasonably and in good faith believes to be unlawful discrimination, sexual harassment in\n\n        employment or sexual harassment in higher education, discrimination based on\n\n\n                                                   24\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       citizenship status in employment, or because he or she has made a charge, filed a\n\n       complaint, testified, assisted, or participated in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing\n\n       under this Act[.]” 775 ILCS 5/6-101(A) (West 2004).\n\n       When an employee files a discrimination charge against the employer pursuant to the\n\nIllinois Human Rights Act with the Department of Human Rights, the Department must conduct\n\na full investigation of the allegations set forth in the charge and provide a written report of such\n\nan investigation. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(C)(1), (D)(1) (West 2004). After reviewing the\n\ninvestigation report, the Department must determine whether there is substantial evidence that\n\nthe alleged civil rights violation has been committed. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004).\n\nUnder the Act, substantial evidence is defined as evidence “which a reasonable mind accepts as\n\nsufficient to support a particular conclusion and which consists of more than a mere scintilla but\n\nmay be somewhat less than a preponderance.” 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004). If the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights determines that there is no substantial evidence, the charge is\n\ndismissed. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2)(a) (West 2004). If the charge is dismissed by the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights, petitioner may seek review by filing a request for review with the\n\nchief legal counsel of the Department. 775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2)(a) (West 2004).\n\n       The chief legal counsel’s order reviewing the dismissal is a final and appealable order\n\n(775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2)(a) (West 2004)), and petitioner may seek review of the chief legal\n\ncounsel’s order in the appellate court (775 ILCS 5/8-111(A)(1) (West 2004)). The standard of\n\nreview on appeal is whether the Department’s chief legal counsel abused his discretion.\n\nAnderson v.

Owens only argues\n\nthat the chief legal counsel abused his discretion in finding that there was no substantial evidence\n\nto support his claims of age and race discrimination based on the December 13, 2004, and\n\nFebruary15, 2005, written reprimands (counts A, B, C, and D).\n\n       Since Owens does not argue that the chief legal counsel erred in finding that there was a\n\nlack of substantial evidence to support the claim that he was issued the February 15, 2005\n\nreprimand in retaliation for filing the subject charge (count E) or the claim that Exxon Mobil\n\nsubsequently refused to grant his tuition reimbursement request because of his race or age or in\n\nretaliation for filing the subject charge (counts F, G, H), he has forfeited his right to challenge the\n\n                                                  26\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\ndismissal of counts E through H.

Therefore, by reason of\n\nsuch forfeiture, any contention that by the denial of tuition reimbursement Exxon Mobil\n\nsomehow subjected Owens to unequal terms and conditions of employment can play no further\n\npart in this appeal.\n\n        Accordingly, we turn to the Department’s dismissal of counts A through D of Owens’\n\ncharge. Owens first contends that the chief legal counsel erred in sustaining the Department’s\n\ndismissal of counts A and B of his discrimination charge, wherein he alleged that shift supervisor\n\nKoziol issued him a written warning on December 13, 2004, on the basis of his age and race.\n\nOwens specifically argues that the chief legal counsel erred when it found that: (1) Exxon\n\nMobil’s written reprimand to him issued on December 13, 2004, did not constitute a cognizable\n\nadverse employment action and (2) that Owens failed to present substantial evidence that other\n\nsimilarly situated younger and white workers were treated differently. For the reasons that\n\nfollow, we disagree.\n\n        We first note that in Zaderaka v. Illinois Human Rights Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2065590\"><a href=\"/opinion/2065590/zaderaka-v-ill-human-rights-commn/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">172</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 178-79\n\n(1989), our supreme court recognized that in evaluating charges of discriminatory practices\n\n                                                 27\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nbrought under the Illinois Human Rights Act (now see 775 ILCS 5/2-102(A) (West 2004)), the\n\nDepartment of Human Rights and the Illinois appellate courts have adopted the three-part test\n\nemployed by the federal courts in actions for employment discrimination brought under title VII\n\nof the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §2000e et seq.

Zaderaka, 131 Ill. 2d at 178-79. Second, to rebut the\n\npresumption, the employer must articulate, not prove, a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for\n\nits decision.

In its letter to the Department, Exxon Mobil explained that a written\n\nreprimand is a disciplinary document that merely tells an employee that he has failed to make the\n\nnecessary improvements in performance or behavior and that if he continues to perform\n\nunsatisfactorily he may be subject to more severe discipline, up to and including discharge.\n\nConsistent with this assertion, the December 13, 2004, written reprimand served only to warn\n\nOwens about his unsatisfactory work performance. In this respect, in his own discrimination\n\ncharge, Owens asserted only that he was issued the reprimand for “working too slowly and for\n\nmaking excessive errors.” Shift supervisor Koziol similarly stated that he issued the written\n\nreprimand to Owens because of his poor performance. Accordingly, there was no evidence that\n\nthe written reprimand had any significant effect on the terms and conditions of Owens’ job, such\n\nas the amount of his pay, his benefits or his work responsibilities. Therefore, Owens failed in his\n\nburden to establish that the written reprimand constituted an adverse employment action. See,\n\ne.g., Lloyd, 552 F.3d at 602 (holding that a loading driver who received two written reprimands\n\nfor loading gas from the wrong supplier failed to establish a prima facie case of employment\n\n\n                                                31\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\ndiscrimination since “written reprimands without any changes in the terms and conditions of his\n\nemployment are not adverse employment actions”); see also Atanus, 520 F.3d at 675 (holding\n\nthat employee had failed to establish that a “letter or instruction” which admonished her that she\n\nwas not following company guidelines constituted an adverse employment action where the\n\nemployee did not show that the letter was followed by any significant consequences to her\n\nemployment, such as termination, demotion, or change in responsibilities): see also Sweeney,\n\n149 F.3d at 556-57 (holding that employee failed to establish that “two counseling statements”\n\nwhich admonished him to improve constituted an adverse employment action since employee\n\nfailed to point to any immediate consequences of the reprimands, such as change in an eligibility\n\nfor promotion, denial of advantageous increase in responsibilities or similar benefits).\n\n       Owens nevertheless argues on appeal that in finding that the written reprimand did not\n\nconstitute an adverse employment action, the chief legal counsel erroneously relied on Mattern v.\n\nEastern Kodak Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"733271\"><a href=\"/opinion/733271/jean-g-mattern-v-eastman-kodak-company-and-eastman-chemical-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">702</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 1997).

Co. v.\n\nWhite, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">548</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145636\"><a href=\"/opinion/145636/burlington-n-sfr-co-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2405</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2006). Owens, however,\n\nmisunderstands both the chief legal counsel’s decision as well as the decision in Burlington\n\nNorthern.\n\n       First, contrary to Owens’ assertion, the chief legal counsel did not cite Mattern for the\n\nproposition that only “ultimate employment decisions” are to be considered actionable adverse\n\nacts for purposes of discrimination claims. Rather, the chief legal counsel relied on Mattern for\n\n                                                32\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nthe principle that to constitute an adverse employment action, the employer’s action must have\n\nsomehow “detrimentally affected” the employee. The chief legal counsel then found that the\n\nDepartment’s investigation disclosed no evidence that the December 13, 2004, written reprimand\n\nsomehow detrimentally affected Owens, such as by way of “loss of pay, loss of benefits,\n\nsuspension, discharge, etc.” Based on the aforementioned, the chief legal counsel found that\n\nOwens had failed to present a prima facie case of an actionable adverse employment action.\n\n       Moreover, Owens’ citation to Burlington Northern is entirely misplaced. In that case, the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court held that claims of retaliation are not limited to actions that affect\n\nthe employee’s terms and conditions of employment. Burlington Northern, 548 U.S. at 63-67,\n\n165 L. Ed. 2d at 357-59, 126 S. Ct. at 2412-15. In doing so, however, the Supreme Court\n\nexpressly distinguished claims of substantive employment discrimination, such as the one here,\n\nfrom claims of retaliation, explaining that substantive discrimination claims are limited to\n\nactions that affect the employee’s terms and conditions of employment. Burlington Northern,\n\n548 U.S. at 64-67, 165 L. Ed. 2d at 357-59, 126 S. Ct. at 2412-15. As the Court in Burlington\n\nNorthern explained:\n\n       “The antidiscrimination provision seeks a workplace where individuals are not\n\n       discriminated against because of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status.\n\n       See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 800-801, [</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93 S.\n\n       Ct. 18117] (1973). The antiretaliation provision seeks to secure that primary objective by\n\n       preventing an employer from interfering (through retaliation) with an employee’s efforts\n\n       to secure or advance enforcement of the Act’s basic guarantees. The substantive\n\n                                                33\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\n       provision seeks to prevent injury to individuals based on who they are, i.e., their status.\n\n       The antiretaliation provision seeks to prevent harm to individuals based on what they do,\n\n       i.e., their conduct.\n\n                To secure the first objective, Congress did not need to prohibit anything other\n\n       than employment-related discrimination. The substantive provision’s basic objective of\n\n       ‘equality of employment opportunities’ and the elimination of practices that tend to bring\n\n       about ‘stratified job environments,’ [citation] would be achieved were all\n\n       employment-related discrimination miraculously eliminated.\n\n                But one cannot secure the second objective by focusing only upon employer\n\n       actions and harm that concern employment and the workplace. Were all such actions and\n\n       harms eliminated, the antiretaliation provision’s objective would not be achieved. An\n\n       employer can effectively retaliate against an employee by taking actions not directly\n\n       related to his employment or by causing him harm outside the workplace.” (Emphasis\n\n       omitted.) Burlington Northern, 548 U.S. at 63, 165 L. Ed. 2d at 356-57, 126 S. Ct. at\n\n       2412.\n\nAccordingly, Owens’ citation to Burlington Northern in support of his substantive discrimination\n\nclaim is without merit.\n\n       In any event, even if we were to hold that the December 13, 2004, written reprimand was\n\nan adverse employment action, a review of the record below reveals that contrary to Owens’\n\ncontention, the chief legal counsel did not abuse his discretion in finding that this reprimand was\n\n\n\n                                                 34\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nnot related to Owens race or age.\n\n        In that respect, we note that the record below reveals that Exxon Mobil issued Owens the\n\nwritten reprimand in accordance with Exxon Mobil’s disciplinary policies because Owens had\n\naccumulated a history of loading errors. The Department’s investigation report revealed that\n\nExxon Mobil’s plant rules provide that an employee who fails to maintain proper standards of\n\nconduct or who violates any of the plant rules will be subject to appropriate discipline up to and\n\nincluding termination. The rules further state that supervisors may establish additional rules\n\ndeemed necessary by operational requirements.\n\n        The Department’s investigation further revealed that prior to the December 13, 2004,\n\nOwens had accumulated a history of performance problems related to loading. The\n\nDepartment’s investigation disclosed that Exxon Mobil received and investigated several\n\ncomplaints on orders loaded by Owens beginning in June 2004. Specifically the investigation\n\nrevealed that Owens first received “verbal counseling” for a loading error on June 25, 2004, as a\n\nresult of his failure to add a pallet onto his loading truck and as a result of his inability to fill the\n\norder in the requisite amount of time. Owens next received a “verbal counseling” session in\n\nOctober 2004, after his failure to fill a customer order dated October 7, 2004. That order\n\nrequested five cases of “Mobil Grease CM-S,” but the customer received none. Owens received\n\nanother verbal coaching session in November 2004 as a result of his failure to properly load a\n\ncustomer order dated October 29, 2004. Although in that order, the customer requested 1,092\n\ncases of “Mobil 1 5W30,” it received only 936 of those cases. Following these three loading\n\nerrors, Owens was issued the written reprimand on December 13, 2004, after an investigation\n\n                                                   35\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\ninto a customer’s complaint regarding an order dated August 5, 2004, revealed that Owens had\n\nfailed to properly load that order. While that customer order requested 26 cases of “Mobil 1\"\n\nproducts, 11 pails of “Mobilux EP2,” 5 pails of “Mobil ShC 632\" and 4 pails of Vacuoline, the\n\ncustomer received 25 cases of “Mobil 1” products, 12 pails of “Mobilux EP2,” 4 pails of “Mobil\n\nShC 632,” 3 pails of Vacuoline, and 1 pail of “something without a label.” Accordingly, the\n\nDecember 13, 2004, written reprimand was intended to warn Owens that he had failed to make\n\nthe necessary improvements in his performance and that if he continued to perform\n\nunsatisfactorily he could be subject to more severe discipline.\n\n       Moreover, the Department’s investigation disclosed no evidence at all that similarly\n\nsituated employees outside Owens’ protected class were not similarly disciplined for similar\n\nconduct. In fact, Exxon Mobil’s disciplinary records for the employees at the Cicero plant\n\nrevealed that Exxon Mobil issued written reprimands, “counseling,” and even suspensions to\n\nyounger, white employees in the plant for their poor work performance. For example, on August\n\n29, 2003, Panozzo (white, 26 years old) received a letter of reprimand for operating a forklift\n\ntruck in an unsafe manner on company property. Similarly, on August 29, 2003, Wantroba\n\n(white, 36) was suspended for truck spillage, and on August 28, 2003, Novakowksi (white, 47)\n\nreceived “counseling” for failure to wear proper attire at the plant.\n\n       More importantly, Exxon Mobil’s loading error investigation reports disclosed that other\n\nemployees were disciplined for their poor performance in loading orders. For example, those\n\nreports showed that in 2004 and 2005 both Hansen (white, 44 years old) and Panozzo (white, 26\n\nyears old) were “coached” for loading errors. Similarly, in 2004 both Wright (white, 23 years\n\n                                                 36\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nold) and Pratscher (white, 47 years old) were given errors in their personnel files for loading\n\nerrors. In 2005, Pratscher was subsequently coached for not following loading procedures. In\n\naddition, the reports reveals that both Panozzo and Johnson (white, 49 years old) received letters\n\nof reprimand in 2003 and 2001, respectively, the first for unsafe use of a forklift and the latter for\n\na product mix error in loading. Both Panozzo and Johnson were also suspended for poor\n\nperformance (Johnson in 2002 for a product mix error, and Panozzo in 2001 for an error loading\n\nthe forklift). Accordingly, Owens cannot contend that other, younger and white employees\n\nescaped discipline at the plant.\n\n       Owens nevertheless argues that he presented sufficient evidence of race- and age-based\n\ndiscrimination because the reports from Exxon Mobil reveal that while younger white employees\n\nwere disciplined, unlike him, they were not given letters of reprimand for loading errors. Owens\n\nspecifically points out that Pratscher, Hanson and Panozzo only received coaching for their\n\nloading errors, and Wright only had an error reported in his file for a loading error. For the\n\nreasons that follow, we find this argument without merit.\n\n       We first note that when interviewed by the Department’s investigator, operations\n\nmanager O’Reilly explained that an employee would receive a “written counseling” followed by\n\na “written reprimand” or written warning only after he or she accumulated more than three\n\nloading errors. In that respect O’Reilly stated that, contrary to Owens’ contention, Wright was\n\nonly given a loading error in his file, instead of a “counseling” or a warning, because prior to that\n\nhe had made no loading errors. O’Reilly also explained that Pratscher and Panozzo had not been\n\ncounseled or given written warnings with respect to loading errors since neither had committed\n\n                                                 37\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nthree such errors.\n\n       More importantly, Owens himself fails to allege that anyone of the aforementioned\n\nemployees was in fact similarly situated to him. As explained above, the record demonstrates\n\nthat Owens had a history of loading errors and had received “verbal counseling” and “coaching”\n\nfor these errors before his December 13, 2004, “written reprimand.” However, in arguing that\n\nthe other employees did not receive “written reprimands,” Owens does not show or even allege\n\nthat they had a similar history concerning loading errors.\n\n       Accordingly, under the record below, it is apparent that the chief legal counsel did not\n\nabuse his discretion in finding that there was a lack of substantial evidence showing that Exxon\n\nMobil issued Owens the December 13, 2004, reprimand on the basis of his age or his race.\n\n       Owens next contends that the chief legal counsel erred in sustaining the Department’s\n\ndismissal of counts C and D of his discrimination charge because there was substantial evidence\n\nthat shift supervisor Koziol issued him a second “written reprimand” on February 15, 2005, on\n\nthe basis of his age and race. We disagree.\n\n       We initially note that for those same reasons already articulated above in the context of\n\nthe December 13, 2004, “written reprimand,” Owens has failed to show that the February 15,\n\n2004, “written reprimand” standing alone sufficiently affected the terms and conditions of his\n\nemployment so as to constitute an adverse employment action. As with the December 13, 2004,\n\nreprimand, here again, Owens presented no evidence to show that the second written reprimand\n\nhad any significant effect on the terms and conditions of his employment, such as his pay,\n\n\n\n                                                38\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nbenefits or work responsibility. See, e.g., Lloyd, 552 F.3d at 602; Atanus, 520 F.3d at 675;\n\nSweeney, 149 F.3d at 556-57.\n\n        More overridingly, even if the second “written reprimand” constituted an adverse\n\nemployment action, a review of the record below reveals that the chief legal counsel did not\n\nabuse his discretion in finding that there was no evidence that the decision to issue the reprimand\n\nwas not related to Owens’ race or age. In fact, the Department’s investigation revealed that\n\nOwens was issued the February 15, 2005, reprimand after committing a loading error on January\n\n7, 2005, by failing to load any of the eight drums of “Telura 622” requested by the customer and\n\nas a result of having committed numerous loading errors in the past. The customer order dated\n\nJanuary 7, 2005, showed that the customer did in fact order eight drums of “Telura 622.” Shift\n\nsupervisor Koziol told the Department investigator that after receiving and investigating the\n\ncustomer’s complaint, the warehouse supervisor found that its inventory was over by eight drums\n\nand that Owens was the warehouse operator in charge of loading that order. More importantly,\n\nOwens himself never denied making the error, but simply stated that he did not know whether he\n\nfailed to include the drum in the order, explaining that the customer could have changed the\n\norder after he loaded it.\n\n        In addition, the Department’s investigation revealed no evidence that similarly situated\n\nemployees outside of Owens’ protected class were not similarly disciplined for similar conduct.\n\nAs already articulated above, Exxon Mobil issued “written reprimands,” “counseling,” and\n\nsuspensions to numerous other employees for poor work performance. Accordingly, for all of\n\nthe aforementioned reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in the chief legal counsel’s dismissal\n\n                                                39\n\fNo. 1-09-0908\n\nof counts C and D of Owens’ discrimination charge.            On appeal, Owens next contends that\n\nthe substantial evidence standard as articulated under section 7A-102(D)(2) of the Illinois\n\nHuman Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004)) violates the requirements of due\n\nprocess because it is unconstitutionally vague. Although not clearly explained in his brief,\n\nOwens appears to argue that the statute is unconstitutional on its face as well as applied to him\n\nbecause under the Act’s definition of “substantial evidence,” a petitioner does not know what\n\nlevel of proof is necessary to sustain a charge of discrimination, and because it gives the chief\n\nlegal counsel unbridled discretion. For the reasons that follow, we disagree.\n\n       At the outset, we note that Owens has waived his right to raise this issue on appeal by\n\nfailing to raise it in the administrative proceedings below. In that respect, we note that “[i]n\n\ngeneral, issues or defenses not placed before the administrative agency will not be considered for\n\nthe first time on administrative review.” Texaco-Cities Service Pipeline Co. v.

Since here,\n\nOwens does not allege nor could he that the “substantial evidence” standard as articulated in\n\nsection 7A-102 of the Illinois Human Rights Act (775 ILCS 5/7A-102(D)(2) (West 2004))\n\nimplicates any first amendment concerns, he does not have standing to argue that the Act is\n\nfacially unconstitutional. See, e.g., Jihan, 127 Ill. 2d at 386 (holding that because no first\n\namendment issue was involved with respect to the constitutionality of the now repealed medical\n\npractice act provisions making it a crime to practice midwifery without a license, defendant did\n\nnot have standing to argue that the statute might be vague as applied to someone else).\n\nAccordingly, since Owens has no standing to make a facial challenge to the statute, and since he\n\nhas failed to argue before the Department that the statute is vague as applied to him, he has\n\nwaived his right altogether to address the vagueness issue on appeal.

East St. Louis Federation of Teachers, 178 Ill. 2d at\n\n424-26. The terms of a statute cannot be “ ‘so ill-defined that their meaning may be determined\n\nat whim rather than by objective criteria.’ ” East St. Louis Federation of Teachers, 178 Ill. 2d at\n\n425-26, quoting People v.

Contrary to Owens’ assertion that the phrase “may be somewhat\n\nless than a preponderance” does not permit a party filing a discrimination charge to know\n\nwhether his or her claim must be supported by more than a preponderance of the evidence or less\n\nthan a preponderance of the evidence, the term “may” has clearly been defined as connoting only\n\npermission. See Cook County Board of Review v. Property Tax Appeal Board, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2047185\"><a href=\"/opinion/2047185/county-bd-of-rev-v-prop-tax-appeal-bd/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

See, e.g.,\n\nStone v. Department of Human Rights, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2083544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2083544/stone-v-department-of-human-rights/\"><span class=\"volume\">299</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill.

Accordingly, we find that the substantial evidence standard is not\n\nunconstitutionally vague.\n\n       Furthermore, Owens has specifically failed to show that the substantial evidence standard\n\nis vague as applied to him. Vagueness is an elastic concept, and just because a term is vague to\n\none person, does not necessarily mean that it will be vague to another.

Accordingly, where a party raises a\n\nvagueness challenge by arguing that a statute is vague as applied, a reviewing court must\n\n“evaluate a statute in the context of the specific circumstances in which it was applied to the\n\nlitigant who contests its validity.” Pooh Bah Enterprises., 224 Ill. 2d at 442; see also People v.\n\nRyan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2079625\"><a href=\"/opinion/2079625/people-v-ryan/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Ill. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 34 (1987), quoting United States v.

In the present case, we have already held that the mere issuance of two written\n\nreprimands did not constitute an adverse employment action. The sparsity of evidence offered by\n\nOwens to support the existence of an adverse employment action is therefore outside the\n\nconfines of the “substantial evidence standard” so that the term, even if otherwise unclear, would\n\nat least have sufficient clarity to denote an amount of evidence in excess of that which was\n\nprovided by Owens. Accordingly, under these circumstances Owens cannot complain that the\n\nAct is vague as applied to him. See Parker v.
