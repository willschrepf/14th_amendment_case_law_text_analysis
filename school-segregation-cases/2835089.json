Plaintiff Gerald William Cardinal appeals the\ndistrict court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of the defendant Linda Metrish, the\nwarden where he was incarcerated. The district court dismissed plaintiff’s claims\n\n\n        *\n        The Honorable William O. Bertelsman, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of\nKentucky, sitting by designation.\n\n\n                                                 1\n\fNo. 08-1562           Cardinal v.

We AFFIRM.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n         The plaintiff was an inmate confined at the Hiawatha Correctional Facility and\na participant in the kosher meal program. On March 2, 2005, the plaintiff received\nseveral misconduct charges and was placed in temporary segregation. Because the\nHiawatha facility could only house inmates in temporary segregation for eight hours, the\nplaintiff was transferred to the Kinross Correctional Facility. Kinross, however, does not\nserve kosher meals.\n\n         While at the Kinross facility, the plaintiff refused the non-kosher meals. On\nSaturday, March 5, 2005, after the plaintiff refused to eat for 72 hours, the staff\ncontacted Health Services, as required by Michigan Department of Corrections policy.\nOn Monday, March 7, 2005, Defendant Metrish, the warden of both facilities, learned\nthat the plaintiff was refusing non-kosher meals. On March 8, 2005, the defendant\ntransferred the plaintiff to Chippewa Correctional Facility, which provides both kosher\nmeals and temporary segregation.\n\n         The plaintiff filed a pro se complaint in the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Michigan asserting a § 1983 claim against the defendant, in her\nindividual capacity, for a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights, and asserting a\nviolation of RLUIPA against the defendant in her official capacity. The plaintiff sought\ndamages in excess of $10,000 on each claim for the defendant’s failure to provide him\nwith kosher food, which resulted in his not eating for eight days.1 The defendant filed\na motion for summary judgment.                  The district court adopted the report and\n\n\n\n\n         1\n          In his amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges that he was denied kosher food for six days at\nthe Kinross facility and that it took another two days to get kosher meals at the new facility. (District\nCourt Docket Entry 20, ¶ 16).\n\fNo. 08-1562              Cardinal v. Metrish                                         Page 3\n\n\nrecommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge and granted summary judgment\nto the defendant. The plaintiff appeals.2\n\n                                               ANALYSIS\n\n        The District Court did not Abuse its Discretion in Denying Discovery.\n\n        We review for an abuse of discretion a district court’s decision to enter summary\njudgment without permitting discovery. Short v. Oaks Corr. Facility, 129 F. App’x 278,\n280 (6th Cir. 2005). Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides the\n“mechanism for a plaintiff and the courts to give effect to the well-established principle\nthat ‘the plaintiff must receive “a full opportunity to conduct discovery” to be able to\nsuccessfully defeat a motion for summary judgment.’” Id. at 281 (quoting Ball v. Union\nCarbide Corp., 385 F.3d 713, 719 (6th Cir. 2004)). Rule 56(f) provides that the plaintiff\nis required to file an affidavit or motion explaining what material facts he hopes to\nuncover by the requested discovery. Id. If the plaintiff makes only general and\nconclusory statements in his affidavit regarding the needed discovery, lacks any details\nor specificity, it is not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the request.\nId.\n\n        Here, the plaintiff argues that the district court erred in not permitting him to\nobtain the requested discovery, i.e., production of entries in the Kinross segregation log\nbook from March 2, 2005 through March 8, 2005. The defendant introduced portions\nof the log book as exhibits in support of her motion for summary judgment. Upon\nreceipt of these materials, the plaintiff filed a Rule 56(f) affidavit with his response to\nthe motion for summary judgment, explaining that he did not know that a log book\nexisted and requesting that the district court order the disclosure of the missing pages.\nThe plaintiff’s Rule 56(f) affidavit explained that through the additional discovery he\nhoped to discover:\n\n        (1) that a staff member logged in an earlier date, reporting to Defendant\n        Metrish that Plaintiff was going without food, (2) to see if Defendant, or\n\n        2\n            The defendant did not file an appellate brief in this matter.\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                                Page 4\n\n\n       someone in her office, contacted segregation staff about Plaintiff, (3) to\n       see if staff logged in how many meals plaintiff didn’t have, and (4) to see\n       if segregation staff logged in when they were informed about Plaintiff’s\n       kosher food needs.\n(District Court Docket Entry 28, ex. 2).\n\n       The issue of whether the defendant was notified that the plaintiff was going\nwithout food prior to March 7, 2005 goes to the heart of the defendant’s defense. Even\nif there were additional entries in the segregation staff’s log book regarding plaintiff’s\nrefusal to eat, these entries would not establish that the defendant had been informed of\nplaintiff’s situation. Accordingly, we hold that the district court’s order denying the\nplaintiff’s request for additional discovery was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n       The Defendant is Entitled to Eleventh Amendment Immunity on the\n       RLUIPA Claim.\n       Plaintiff seeks monetary damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief,\nasserting that the defendant violated RLUIPA by not providing him with kosher meals\nwhile he was incarcerated at the Kinross facility. RLUIPA provides:\n\n       [n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious\n       exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution . . . even if\n       the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the\n       government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person - -\n       (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the\n       least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental\n       interest.\n42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc-1(a). RLUIPA defines “government” as including States and their\nagencies and departments, as well as persons acting under color of State law. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000cc-5(4)(A). Plaintiff’s RLUIPA claim against the defendant, a State official, in\nher official capacity is considered a claim against the State of Michigan. See Hafer v.\nMelo, 502 U.S. 21, 25 (1991). Accordingly, any immunity available to the State is\navailable to the defendant in her official capacity. Id.\n\n       The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the defendant for the\nalleged RLUIPA violation. The plaintiff, however, has been transferred from the\nKinross facility to a facility that offers kosher meals. In addition, the Hiawatha facility\n\fNo. 08-1562         Cardinal v. Metrish                                           Page 5\n\n\nhas since changed its policy to preclude transferring participants in the kosher meal\nprogram to the Kinross facility. Therefore, we find that the plaintiff’s request for\ndeclaratory and injunctive relief is rendered moot. Kensu v. Haigh, 87 F.3d 172, 175\n(6th Cir. 1996) (holding prisoner’s claim for injunctive and declaratory relief mooted by\nhis transfer to new facility).\n\n        The district court found that the plaintiff’s claim for monetary damages against\nthe defendant in her official capacity should be dismissed because the State of Michigan\nhas not waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity to claims for damages under\nRLUIPA. The plaintiff argues that, by accepting federal funds for its prisons, the State\nwaived its immunity for RLUIPA claims.\n\n        By accepting federal prison funds, States consent to provide “appropriate relief”\nto prisoners who suffer a RLUIPA violation. 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc-2(a), 2000cc-1(b)(1)\n(requiring all states that receive federal prison funds to comply with RLUIPA). RLUIPA\nprovides that “[a] person may assert a violation of this chapter as a claim or defense in\na judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000cc-2(a). The issue before us is whether monetary damages are “appropriate relief”\nfor violations of RLUIPA.\n\n        Neither the United States Supreme Court nor this court has ruled on the issue.\nThere is also no consensus among the other Circuits as to whether a State’s acceptance\nof federal prison funds constitutes a waiver of its sovereign immunity as to RLUIPA\nclaims for damages. The Courts of Appeals for the Third, Fourth and Fifth Circuits,\nalong with a district court from this Circuit, have concluded that the States are immune\nfrom claims for monetary damages under RLUIPA. See Sossamon v. Lone Star State\nof Texas, No. 07-50632, 2009 WL 382260, at *7-8 (5th Cir. Feb. 17, 2009) (designated\nfor publication); Scott v. Beard, 252 F. App’x 491, 492-93 (3d Cir. 2007); Madison v.\nVirginia, 474 F.3d 118, 122-23 (4th Cir. 2006); Porter v. Caruso, No. 1:05-cv-562, 2008\nWL 3978972, at *3-7 (W.D. Mich. Aug. 22, 2008), appeal docketed, No. 08-2314 (6th\nCir. Oct. 14, 2008). See also Webman v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 441 F.3d 1022, 1026\n(D.C. Cir. 2006) (holding language in Religious Freedom Restoration Act, similar to that\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                               Page 6\n\n\nin RLUIPA, permitting suit for “appropriate relief,” did not waive federal government’s\nimmunity to suits for damages). The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit,\nhowever, takes the opposite view and ruled that a State’s receipt of federal prison funds\nconstitutes a waiver of its sovereign immunity for suits seeking monetary damages under\nRLUIPA. Smith v. Allen, 502 F.3d 1255, 1271 (11th Cir. 2007).\n\n       In Madison v. Virginia, the plaintiff sued the Commonwealth of Virginia,\nalleging it violated RLUIPA by denying him kosher meals. Madison, 474 F.3d at 122-\n23. The district court held that by accepting federal prison funds, the Commonwealth\nof Virginia had waived its sovereign immunity for RLUIPA claims, including those for\nmonetary damages. Id. at 123. The Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit disagreed,\nstating that, although Virginia consented, by accepting federal prison funds, to be subject\nto the substantive requirements of RLUIPA, the language of RLUIPA did not expressly\nand unequivocally extend its waiver of sovereign immunity to suits seeking monetary\ndamages. Id. at 129-33. The court explained:\n\n       State sovereign immunity is among the Constitution’s most foundational\n       principles, see, e.g., Brown v. N .C. Div. of Motor Vehicles, 166 F.3d 698,\n       704 (4th Cir. 1999), and we may not “infer that a State's immunity from\n       suit in the federal courts has been negated,” Pennhurst State Sch. &\n       Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 99, 104 S. Ct. 900, 79 L. Ed. 2d 67\n       (1984). “[T]here can be no consent by implication or by use of\n       ambiguous language.” Library of Congress v. Shaw, 478 U.S. 310, 318,\n       106 S. Ct. 2957, 92 L. Ed. 2d 250 (1986) (quoting United States v. N.Y.\n       Rayon Importing Co., 329 U.S. 654, 659, 67 S. Ct. 601, 91 L. Ed. 577\n       (1947)). A waiver must be “unequivocally expressed in statutory text.”\n       See Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192, 116 S. Ct. 2092, 135 L. Ed. 2d 486\n       (1996). For this reason, general participation in a federal program or the\n       receipt of federal funds is insufficient to waive sovereign immunity. See\n       Atascadero [State Hosp.v. Scanlon], 473 U.S. [234,] 246-47, 105 S. Ct.\n       3142 [(1985)]. Rather, “Congress must make its intention unmistakably\n       clear in the language of the statute.” Hoffman v. Conn. Dep’t of Income\n       Maintenance, 492 U.S. 96, 101, 109 S. Ct. 2818, 106 L. Ed. 2d 76 (1989)\n       (plurality) (internal quotation omitted).\nId. at 129-30.\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                           Page 7\n\n\n       The Fourth Circuit concluded that “a waiver of sovereign immunity for some\ntype of remedy does not necessarily extend to suits for damages.” Id. at 131 (quoting\nWebman, 441 F.3d at 1025). For a waiver of sovereign immunity to extend to claims for\nmonetary damages, the waiver must “unambiguously” extend to such claims. Id.\n(quoting Lane v. Pena, 518 U.S. 187, 192 (1996)). Any purported waiver of sovereign\nimmunity will be “strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.”\nLane, 518 U.S. at 192. See also Gomez-Perez v. Potter, 128 S. Ct. 1931 (2008)\n(considering waiver of federal government’s sovereign immunity).\n\n       Thus, the Fourth Circuit held that RLUIPA’s “appropriate relief” language did\nnot unequivocally waive the State’s immunity from suit for monetary damages.\nRLUIPA “makes no reference to monetary relief - or even to sovereign immunity\ngenerally.” Madison, 474 F.3d at 131. Thus, the court concluded that acceptance of\nfederal prison funds under RLUIPA does not waive a State’s immunity from suits for\nmonetary damages. Id.\n\n       Similarly, the Fifth Circuit, finding the Fourth’s Circuit’s reasoning in Madison\npersuasive, recently held that the “appropriate relief” language contained in RLUIPA\nwas “not sufficiently clear in light of the [Supreme] Court’s sovereign-immunity\njurisprudence.” Sossamon, 2009 WL 382260 at *7. Accordingly, the court held that any\nclaim under RLUIPA for monetary damages against the defendants in their official\ncapacity was barred by the State’s sovereign immunity. Id. at *8.\n\n       The plaintiff argues that the Sixth Circuit should adopt the reasoning of the\nEleventh Circuit found in Smith v. Allen. In Smith, the court held that RLUIPA created\na private cause of action for “appropriate relief” against a State that accepted federal\nprison funds. Smith, 502 F.3d at 1269. The Eleventh Circuit, relying on Franklin v.\nGwinnett County Pub. Sch., 503 U.S. 60 (1992), stated that “where Congress ha[s] not\ngiven any guidance or clear indication of its purpose with respect to remedies, federal\ncourts should presume the availability of all appropriate remedies.” Smith, 502 F.3d at\n1270. Thus, the Smith court concluded that the phrase “appropriate relief” as used in\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                                Page 8\n\n\nRLUIPA “is broad enough to encompass the right to monetary damages.” Smith, 502\nF.3d at 1270.\n\n       We disagree with the Eleventh Circuit’s holding that Franklin is applicable to a\nclaim against a State for money damages under RLUIPA. Franklin did not involve a\nclaim of sovereign immunity. The Supreme Court has recognized that Franklin is not\nper se applicable to all claims against a State, but only to claims in which a State has\nexpressly waived its sovereign immunity. Lane, 518 U.S. at 196-97 (finding Congress\ndid not waive federal government’s sovereign immunity for monetary damages for\nclaims against it for violations of § 504(a) of Rehabilitation Act of 1973). In Lane, the\nSupreme Court explained:\n\n       Petitioner’s reliance on Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503\n       U.S. 60, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1992), . . . is misplaced. In\n       Franklin, we held only that the implied private right of action under Title\n       IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 supports a claim for monetary\n       damages. “[A]bsent clear direction to the contrary by Congress,” we\n       stated, “the federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief\n       in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute.” Id.,\n       at 70-71, 112 S. Ct., at 1035. Franklin, however, involved an action\n       against nonfederal defendants under Title IX. Although the Government\n       does not contest the propriety of the injunctive relief Lane obtained, the\n       Federal Government’s sovereign immunity prohibits wholesale\n       application of Franklin to actions against the Government to enforce\n       § 504(a). As the Government puts it, “[w]here a cause of action is\n       authorized against the federal government, the available remedies are not\n       those that are ‘appropriate,’ but only those for which sovereign immunity\n       has been expressly waived.”\nId.\n\n       As discussed above, a finding that a State has waived its sovereign immunity by\naccepting federal funds must be based on unequivocal language in the statute that makes\nthe waiver unambiguous. Here, RLUIPA does not contain a clear indication that\nCongress unambiguously conditioned receipt of federal prison funds on a State’s consent\nto suit for monetary damages.\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                             Page 9\n\n\n       We find the reasoning of the Fourth and Fifth Circuits consistent with the current\nSupreme Court case law requiring waivers of sovereign immunity to be “unequivocally\nexpressed.” See, e.g., Gomez-Perez, 128 S. Ct. at 1942-43; Lane, 518 U.S. at 192;\nUnited States v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 33-34, 37 (1992). We hold that,\nbecause RLUIPA’s “appropriate relief” language does not clearly and unequivocally\nindicate that the waiver extends to monetary damages, the Eleventh Amendment bars\nplaintiff’s claim for monetary relief under RLUIPA.\n\n       Defendant was Entitled to Summary Judgment on the § 1983 Claim Alleging\n       an Eighth Amendment Violation.\n       The plaintiff asserted a § 1983 claim against the defendant in her individual\ncapacity for violations of his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual\npunishment for not providing him with kosher food, which resulted in his not eating for\neight days. The Sixth Circuit has held that the deliberate and unnecessary withholding\nof food that is essential to normal health can constitute the deliberate indifference to\nmedical needs that violates the Eighth Amendment. See Cunningham v. Jones, 567 F.2d\n653, 656 (6th Cir. 1977).\n\n       To establish an Eighth Amendment violation, the plaintiff must show that the\ndefendant acted with deliberate indifference to his basic needs. The Sixth Circuit\nrecently explained:\n\n       In order to hold a prison official liable for an Eighth Amendment\n       violation, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the official acted with\n       “deliberate indifference” to the inmate’s safety. See Watkins v. City of\n       Battle Creek, 273 F.3d 682 (6th Cir. 2001) (citing Estelle v. Gamble, 429\n       U.S. 97, 97 S. Ct. 285, 50 L. Ed. 2d 251 (1976)). Deliberate indifference\n       is comprised of both an objective and a subjective component. Farmer\n       v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 835-57, 114 S. Ct. 1970, 128 L. Ed. 2d 811\n       (1994). The objective component requires that the deprivation alleged\n       be “sufficiently serious,” while the subjective component requires a\n       plaintiff to establish that the government officials had a “sufficiently\n       culpable state of mind.” Id. at 834, 114 S. Ct. 1970.\nFarah v. Wellington, 295 F. App’x 743, 749 (6th Cir. 2008). See also Harrison v. Ash,\n539 F.3d 510, 517-18 (6th Cir. 2008). To establish the subjective component, the\n\fNo. 08-1562         Cardinal v. Metrish                                              Page 10\n\n\nplaintiff must establish that “the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to\ninmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference\ncould be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the\ninference.” Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825, 837 (1994). “[A]n official’s failure to\nalleviate a significant risk that he should have perceived but did not, while no cause for\ncommendation, cannot under our cases be condemned as the infliction of punishment.”\nId. at 838.\n\n        The case at bar is not a case in which the plaintiff was deliberately denied food.\nInstead, based upon an apparent administrative error, the plaintiff had been transferred\nto a facility that did not offer a kosher diet. The plaintiff does not allege that he was\ndenied food, but that he was denied kosher food. The evidence establishes that the\ndefendant was first made aware of the plaintiff’s situation on Monday, March 7, 2005.\nIn response, she transferred the plaintiff to a facility that provided kosher meals.\n\n        The district court correctly held that the plaintiff had not pointed to any evidence\nthat the defendant knew and disregarded an excessive risk to his health or safety.\nInstead, the evidence established that as soon as the defendant was made aware of the\nplaintiff’s situation, she instituted a transfer to a facility that could accommodate\nplaintiff’s kosher needs and security level. Thus, the plaintiff did not demonstrate that\nthe defendant failed to act after being made aware of the facts. We hold that the district\ncourt correctly granted summary judgment to the defendant on plaintiff’s § 1983 claim\nalleging a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights.\n\n        Plaintiff has not Established a First Amendment Violation.\n\n        The plaintiff argues that, even though he did not specifically allege such a\nviolation in his complaint, the district court was required, by his pro se status, to consider\na § 1983 claim for the violation of his First Amendment rights since the facts alleged\nwere sufficient to assert such a claim. In its April 24, 2008 Order, the district court\nconsidered this argument in ruling on plaintiff’s motion to amend the court’s order\nentering summary judgment. (District Court Docket Entry 39). The district court found\nthat, even if the plaintiff had asserted a § 1983 claim for a First Amendment violation,\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                           Page 11\n\n\nthe defendant would have been entitled to summary judgment because the defendant was\nnot actively involved in denying the plaintiff kosher meals.\n\n       We have held that, even if a plaintiff can prove a violation of his constitutional\nrights, his § 1983 claim must fail against a supervisory official unless “the supervisor\nencouraged the specific incident of misconduct or in some other way directly\nparticipated in it.” Combs v. Wilkinson, 315 F.3d 548, 558 (6th Cir. 2002) (quoting\nBellamy v. Bradley, 729 F.2d 416, 421 (6th Cir. 1984)). See also Copeland v. Machulis,\n57 F.3d 476, 481 (6th Cir. 1995). “At a minimum a plaintiff must show that the official\nat least implicitly authorized, approved, or knowingly acquiesced in the unconstitutional\nconduct of the offending officers.” Combs, 315 F.3d at 558 (quoting Hays v. Jefferson\nCounty, Ky., 668 F.2d 869, 874 (6th Cir. 1982)).\n\n       Here, the evidence established that upon learning of the plaintiff’s situation, the\ndefendant began procedures to transfer the defendant to a facility that could\naccommodate his needs. Since the plaintiff does not allege that the defendant was\nactively involved in the denial of kosher food, we find that the district court’s analysis\nof the issue was correct.\n\n       For the reasons discussed above, the judgment of the district court is\nAFFIRMED.\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                            Page 12\n\n\n              _______________________________________________\n\n               CONCURRING IN PART, DISSENTING IN PART\n              _______________________________________________\n\n       CLAY, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in the\nmajority’s holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying further\ndiscovery and that Defendant was entitled to summary judgment on Cardinal’s § 1983\nclaims. I also agree that Cardinal’s claims for declaratory or injunctive relief are moot\nbecause Cardinal has been transferred to a different facility which provides kosher\nmeals, and because the Michigan Department of Corrections has changed its policy to\npreclude transferring participants in the kosher meal program to facilities that have no\nsuch program. I write separately, however, because I do not believe that this is a case\nin which this Court should decide whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars a\nplaintiff from recovering monetary damages under the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et seq.\n\n       As the majority indicates, RLUIPA states that “[a] person may assert a violation\nof this Act as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief\nagainst a government[,]” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc, but courts are split on the issue of whether\n“appropriate relief” encompasses monetary relief. Compare Smith v. Allen, 502 F.3d\n1255, 1271 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that the phrase “appropriate relief” in RLUIPA\nencompasses monetary as well as injunctive relief), and Price v. Caruso, 451 F. Supp.\n2d 889, 895 (E.D. Mich. 2006) (holding that a plaintiff “may have a cognizable claim\nfor monetary damages . . . under RLUIPA”), with Madison v. Virginia, 474 F.3d 118,\n131 (4th Cir. 2006) (concluding that RLUIPA’s “appropriate relief against a\ngovernment” language “falls short of the unequivocal textual expression necessary to\nwaive State immunity from suits for damages”). Prior to today’s decision, this Court,\nlike the Supreme Court, had not expressed an opinion on the matter.\n\n       This is not a suitable case for resolving the issue of what constitutes “appropriate\nrelief” under the statute, or more specifically, whether “appropriate relief” should be\nheld to encompass money damages. This is because the factual record is woefully\n\fNo. 08-1562         Cardinal v. Metrish                                           Page 13\n\n\nunderdeveloped and the briefing of the legal issues is completely inadequate–\nundoubtedly due in large measure to the fact that Plaintiff is proceeding pro se without\nthe benefit of legal representation, and Defendant has failed in its professional\nresponsibilities to this Court by declining to file the requisite brief on appeal.\nInexcusably, the defense’s only filing before this Court was a one-page letter brief\nstating that Defendant would rely upon the district court’s decision and the briefs filed\nbefore the district court. Cardinal, proceeding pro se, attempted to address the sovereign\nimmunity issue in his appellate brief, but his arguments are less than a picture of clarity\nand Plaintiff acknowledges that he “is substantially limited in law and he has had\nproblems with law library access.” (Cardinal’s Br. at 1.) The case was submitted on the\nbriefs without oral argument, and this Court was left with little, if any, developed\nargument as to the propriety of applying the doctrine of sovereign immunity to RLUIPA\nclaims.\n\n          Perhaps more importantly, it is not clear to me that Cardinal has raised a\ncognizable claim under RLUIPA, which states that “no government shall impose a\nsubstantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an\ninstitution . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 2000 cc-1(a). Beyond asserting that he required and was\ndenied a kosher diet, Cardinal does not describe with any particularity his religious\ndietary needs, the actual food that was provided to him, and what injuries he actually\nsuffered. The record is devoid of any explanation as to whether some of the food served\nto Plaintiff in the non-kosher prison environment, especially vegetables, might have been\nconsumed by him without violating his kosher dietary restrictions. Nor is it al all clear\nwhether Plaintiff, operating pursuant to the doctrine of “necessity,” would have been\npermitted, in the interest of preserving his health and welfare, to consume non-kosher\nfood products, where no kosher food was available, without violating his religious tenets.\nIn other words, the record below is woefully underdeveloped. While we are to construe\npro se petitions liberally in favor of the plaintiff, see Boswell v. Mayer, 169 F.3d 384,\n387 (6th Cir. 1999), this record offers very little to support Cardinal’s RLUIPA claim\nor to justify the need to resolve on behalf of the circuit the availability of money\ndamages under the statute.\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                          Page 14\n\n\n       In view of the constraints presented by the instant case, I would be inclined to\ninstruct the court below to dismiss Cardinal’s RLUIPA claim without prejudice and to\nrefrain from addressing whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars a plaintiff from\nrecovering monetary relief under RLUIPA. I therefore respectfully dissent with regard\nto that portion of the majority opinion.\n\f",

We AFFIRM.\n\n                                         BACKGROUND\n\n         The plaintiff was an inmate confined at the Hiawatha Correctional Facility and\na participant in the kosher meal program. On March 2, 2005, the plaintiff received\nseveral misconduct charges and was placed in temporary segregation. Because the\nHiawatha facility could only house inmates in temporary segregation for eight hours, the\nplaintiff was transferred to the Kinross Correctional Facility. Kinross, however, does not\nserve kosher meals.\n\n         While at the Kinross facility, the plaintiff refused the non-kosher meals. On\nSaturday, March 5, 2005, after the plaintiff refused to eat for 72 hours, the staff\ncontacted Health Services, as required by Michigan Department of Corrections policy.\nOn Monday, March 7, 2005, Defendant Metrish, the warden of both facilities, learned\nthat the plaintiff was refusing non-kosher meals. On March 8, 2005, the defendant\ntransferred the plaintiff to Chippewa Correctional Facility, which provides both kosher\nmeals and temporary segregation.\n\n         The plaintiff filed a pro se complaint in the United States District Court for the\nWestern District of Michigan asserting a § 1983 claim against the defendant, in her\nindividual capacity, for a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights, and asserting a\nviolation of RLUIPA against the defendant in her official capacity. The plaintiff sought\ndamages in excess of $10,000 on each claim for the defendant’s failure to provide him\nwith kosher food, which resulted in his not eating for eight days.1 The defendant filed\na motion for summary judgment.                  The district court adopted the report and\n\n\n\n\n         1\n          In his amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges that he was denied kosher food for six days at\nthe Kinross facility and that it took another two days to get kosher meals at the new facility. (District\nCourt Docket Entry 20, ¶ 16).\n\fNo. 08-1562              Cardinal v. Metrish                                         Page 3\n\n\nrecommendation of the United States Magistrate Judge and granted summary judgment\nto the defendant. The plaintiff appeals.2\n\n                                               ANALYSIS\n\n        The District Court did not Abuse its Discretion in Denying Discovery.\n\n        We review for an abuse of discretion a district court’s decision to enter summary\njudgment without permitting discovery. Short v. Oaks Corr. Facility, 129 F. App’x 278,\n280 (6th Cir. 2005). Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides the\n“mechanism for a plaintiff and the courts to give effect to the well-established principle\nthat ‘the plaintiff must receive “a full opportunity to conduct discovery” to be able to\nsuccessfully defeat a motion for summary judgment.’” Id. at 281 (quoting Ball v. Union\nCarbide Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787980\"><a href=\"/opinion/787980/fannie-ball-02-6289-stephen-heiser-02-6311-v-union-carbide-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719 (6th Cir. 2004)). Rule 56(f) provides that the plaintiff\nis required to file an affidavit or motion explaining what material facts he hopes to\nuncover by the requested discovery. Id. If the plaintiff makes only general and\nconclusory statements in his affidavit regarding the needed discovery, lacks any details\nor specificity, it is not an abuse of discretion for the district court to deny the request.\nId.\n\n        Here, the plaintiff argues that the district court erred in not permitting him to\nobtain the requested discovery, i.e., production of entries in the Kinross segregation log\nbook from March 2, 2005 through March 8, 2005. The defendant introduced portions\nof the log book as exhibits in support of her motion for summary judgment. Upon\nreceipt of these materials, the plaintiff filed a Rule 56(f) affidavit with his response to\nthe motion for summary judgment, explaining that he did not know that a log book\nexisted and requesting that the district court order the disclosure of the missing pages.\nThe plaintiff’s Rule 56(f) affidavit explained that through the additional discovery he\nhoped to discover:\n\n        (1) that a staff member logged in an earlier date, reporting to Defendant\n        Metrish that Plaintiff was going without food, (2) to see if Defendant, or\n\n        2\n            The defendant did not file an appellate brief in this matter.\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                                Page 4\n\n\n       someone in her office, contacted segregation staff about Plaintiff, (3) to\n       see if staff logged in how many meals plaintiff didn’t have, and (4) to see\n       if segregation staff logged in when they were informed about Plaintiff’s\n       kosher food needs.\n(District Court Docket Entry 28, ex. 2).\n\n       The issue of whether the defendant was notified that the plaintiff was going\nwithout food prior to March 7, 2005 goes to the heart of the defendant’s defense. Even\nif there were additional entries in the segregation staff’s log book regarding plaintiff’s\nrefusal to eat, these entries would not establish that the defendant had been informed of\nplaintiff’s situation. Accordingly, we hold that the district court’s order denying the\nplaintiff’s request for additional discovery was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n       The Defendant is Entitled to Eleventh Amendment Immunity on the\n       RLUIPA Claim.\n       Plaintiff seeks monetary damages, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief,\nasserting that the defendant violated RLUIPA by not providing him with kosher meals\nwhile he was incarcerated at the Kinross facility. RLUIPA provides:\n\n       [n]o government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious\n       exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution . . . even if\n       the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the\n       government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person - -\n       (1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the\n       least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental\n       interest.\n42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc-1(a). RLUIPA defines “government” as including States and their\nagencies and departments, as well as persons acting under color of State law. 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000cc-5(4)(A). Plaintiff’s RLUIPA claim against the defendant, a State official, in\nher official capacity is considered a claim against the State of Michigan. See Hafer v.\nMelo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112657\"><a href=\"/opinion/112657/hafer-v-melo/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 25 (1991). Accordingly, any immunity available to the State is\navailable to the defendant in her official capacity. Id.\n\n       The plaintiff seeks declaratory and injunctive relief against the defendant for the\nalleged RLUIPA violation. The plaintiff, however, has been transferred from the\nKinross facility to a facility that offers kosher meals. In addition, the Hiawatha facility\n\fNo. 08-1562         Cardinal v.

The plaintiff argues that, by accepting federal funds for its prisons, the State\nwaived its immunity for RLUIPA claims.\n\n        By accepting federal prison funds, States consent to provide “appropriate relief”\nto prisoners who suffer a RLUIPA violation. 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000cc-2(a), 2000cc-1(b)(1)\n(requiring all states that receive federal prison funds to comply with RLUIPA). RLUIPA\nprovides that “[a] person may assert a violation of this chapter as a claim or defense in\na judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 2000cc-2(a). The issue before us is whether monetary damages are “appropriate relief”\nfor violations of RLUIPA.\n\n        Neither the United States Supreme Court nor this court has ruled on the issue.\nThere is also no consensus among the other Circuits as to whether a State’s acceptance\nof federal prison funds constitutes a waiver of its sovereign immunity as to RLUIPA\nclaims for damages.

Thus, the court concluded that acceptance of\nfederal prison funds under RLUIPA does not waive a State’s immunity from suits for\nmonetary damages. Id.\n\n       Similarly, the Fifth Circuit, finding the Fourth’s Circuit’s reasoning in Madison\npersuasive, recently held that the “appropriate relief” language contained in RLUIPA\nwas “not sufficiently clear in light of the [Supreme] Court’s sovereign-immunity\njurisprudence.” Sossamon, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">382260</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at *7.

In Smith, the court held that RLUIPA created\na private cause of action for “appropriate relief” against a State that accepted federal\nprison funds. Smith, 502 F.3d at 1269. The Eleventh Circuit, relying on Franklin v.\nGwinnett County Pub. Sch., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112696\"><a href=\"/opinion/112696/franklin-v-gwinnett-county-public-schools/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1992), stated that “where Congress ha[s] not\ngiven any guidance or clear indication of its purpose with respect to remedies, federal\ncourts should presume the availability of all appropriate remedies.” Smith, 502 F.3d at\n1270. Thus, the Smith court concluded that the phrase “appropriate relief” as used in\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                                Page 8\n\n\nRLUIPA “is broad enough to encompass the right to monetary damages.” Smith, 502\nF.3d at 1270.\n\n       We disagree with the Eleventh Circuit’s holding that Franklin is applicable to a\nclaim against a State for money damages under RLUIPA. Franklin did not involve a\nclaim of sovereign immunity. The Supreme Court has recognized that Franklin is not\nper se applicable to all claims against a State, but only to claims in which a State has\nexpressly waived its sovereign immunity. Lane, 518 U.S. at 196-97 (finding Congress\ndid not waive federal government’s sovereign immunity for monetary damages for\nclaims against it for violations of § 504(a) of Rehabilitation Act of 1973).

In\n       Franklin, we held only that the implied private right of action under Title\n       IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 supports a claim for monetary\n       damages. “[A]bsent clear direction to the contrary by Congress,” we\n       stated, “the federal courts have the power to award any appropriate relief\n       in a cognizable cause of action brought pursuant to a federal statute.” Id.,\n       at 70-71, 112 S. Ct., at 1035. Franklin, however, involved an action\n       against nonfederal defendants under Title IX. Although the Government\n       does not contest the propriety of the injunctive relief Lane obtained, the\n       Federal Government’s sovereign immunity prohibits wholesale\n       application of Franklin to actions against the Government to enforce\n       § 504(a). As the Government puts it, “[w]here a cause of action is\n       authorized against the federal government, the available remedies are not\n       those that are ‘appropriate,’ but only those for which sovereign immunity\n       has been expressly waived.”\nId.\n\n       As discussed above, a finding that a State has waived its sovereign immunity by\naccepting federal funds must be based on unequivocal language in the statute that makes\nthe waiver unambiguous. Here, RLUIPA does not contain a clear indication that\nCongress unambiguously conditioned receipt of federal prison funds on a State’s consent\nto suit for monetary damages.\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                             Page 9\n\n\n       We find the reasoning of the Fourth and Fifth Circuits consistent with the current\nSupreme Court case law requiring waivers of sovereign immunity to be “unequivocally\nexpressed.” See, e.g., Gomez-Perez, 128 S. Ct. at 1942-43; Lane, 518 U.S. at 192;\nUnited States v.

We hold that,\nbecause RLUIPA’s “appropriate relief” language does not clearly and unequivocally\nindicate that the waiver extends to monetary damages, the Eleventh Amendment bars\nplaintiff’s claim for monetary relief under RLUIPA.\n\n       Defendant was Entitled to Summary Judgment on the § 1983 Claim Alleging\n       an Eighth Amendment Violation.\n       The plaintiff asserted a § 1983 claim against the defendant in her individual\ncapacity for violations of his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual\npunishment for not providing him with kosher food, which resulted in his not eating for\neight days. The Sixth Circuit has held that the deliberate and unnecessary withholding\nof food that is essential to normal health can constitute the deliberate indifference to\nmedical needs that violates the Eighth Amendment. See Cunningham v. Jones, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"351737\"><a href=\"/opinion/351737/alford-lee-cunningham-v-russell-jones-jailer/\"><span class=\"volume\">567</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">653</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 656 (6th Cir. 1977).\n\n       To establish an Eighth Amendment violation, the plaintiff must show that the\ndefendant acted with deliberate indifference to his basic needs.

The plaintiff does not allege that he was\ndenied food, but that he was denied kosher food. The evidence establishes that the\ndefendant was first made aware of the plaintiff’s situation on Monday, March 7, 2005.\nIn response, she transferred the plaintiff to a facility that provided kosher meals.\n\n        The district court correctly held that the plaintiff had not pointed to any evidence\nthat the defendant knew and disregarded an excessive risk to his health or safety.\nInstead, the evidence established that as soon as the defendant was made aware of the\nplaintiff’s situation, she instituted a transfer to a facility that could accommodate\nplaintiff’s kosher needs and security level. Thus, the plaintiff did not demonstrate that\nthe defendant failed to act after being made aware of the facts. We hold that the district\ncourt correctly granted summary judgment to the defendant on plaintiff’s § 1983 claim\nalleging a violation of his Eighth Amendment rights.\n\n        Plaintiff has not Established a First Amendment Violation.\n\n        The plaintiff argues that, even though he did not specifically allege such a\nviolation in his complaint, the district court was required, by his pro se status, to consider\na § 1983 claim for the violation of his First Amendment rights since the facts alleged\nwere sufficient to assert such a claim. In its April 24, 2008 Order, the district court\nconsidered this argument in ruling on plaintiff’s motion to amend the court’s order\nentering summary judgment. (District Court Docket Entry 39). The district court found\nthat, even if the plaintiff had asserted a § 1983 claim for a First Amendment violation,\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                           Page 11\n\n\nthe defendant would have been entitled to summary judgment because the defendant was\nnot actively involved in denying the plaintiff kosher meals.\n\n       We have held that, even if a plaintiff can prove a violation of his constitutional\nrights, his § 1983 claim must fail against a supervisory official unless “the supervisor\nencouraged the specific incident of misconduct or in some other way directly\nparticipated in it.” Combs v.

Jefferson\nCounty, Ky., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398831\"><a href=\"/opinion/398831/donald-l-hays-jr-and-michael-c-potter-cross-appellants-v-jefferson/\"><span class=\"volume\">668</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 874 (6th Cir. 1982)).\n\n       Here, the evidence established that upon learning of the plaintiff’s situation, the\ndefendant began procedures to transfer the defendant to a facility that could\naccommodate his needs. Since the plaintiff does not allege that the defendant was\nactively involved in the denial of kosher food, we find that the district court’s analysis\nof the issue was correct.\n\n       For the reasons discussed above, the judgment of the district court is\nAFFIRMED.\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                            Page 12\n\n\n              _______________________________________________\n\n               CONCURRING IN PART, DISSENTING IN PART\n              _______________________________________________\n\n       CLAY, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur in the\nmajority’s holding that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying further\ndiscovery and that Defendant was entitled to summary judgment on Cardinal’s § 1983\nclaims. I also agree that Cardinal’s claims for declaratory or injunctive relief are moot\nbecause Cardinal has been transferred to a different facility which provides kosher\nmeals, and because the Michigan Department of Corrections has changed its policy to\npreclude transferring participants in the kosher meal program to facilities that have no\nsuch program. I write separately, however, because I do not believe that this is a case\nin which this Court should decide whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars a\nplaintiff from recovering monetary damages under the Religious Land Use and\nInstitutionalized Persons Act (“RLUIPA”), 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc et seq.\n\n       As the majority indicates, RLUIPA states that “[a] person may assert a violation\nof this Act as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief\nagainst a government[,]” 42 U.S.C. § 2000cc, but courts are split on the issue of whether\n“appropriate relief” encompasses monetary relief. Compare Smith v. Allen, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77840\"><a href=\"/opinion/77840/smith-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">502</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1255</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1271 (11th Cir. 2007) (holding that the phrase “appropriate relief” in RLUIPA\nencompasses monetary as well as injunctive relief), and Price v. Caruso, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2574619\"><a href=\"/opinion/2574619/price-v-caruso/\"><span class=\"volume\">451</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">2d</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> 889, 895 (E.D. Mich. 2006) (holding that a plaintiff “may have a cognizable claim\nfor monetary damages . . . under RLUIPA”), with Madison v. Virginia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796536\"><a href=\"/opinion/796536/ira-w-madison-and-united-states-of-america-intervenor-plaintiff-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n131 (4th Cir. 2006) (concluding that RLUIPA’s “appropriate relief against a\ngovernment” language “falls short of the unequivocal textual expression necessary to\nwaive State immunity from suits for damages”). Prior to today’s decision, this Court,\nlike the Supreme Court, had not expressed an opinion on the matter.\n\n       This is not a suitable case for resolving the issue of what constitutes “appropriate\nrelief” under the statute, or more specifically, whether “appropriate relief” should be\nheld to encompass money damages. This is because the factual record is woefully\n\fNo. 08-1562         Cardinal v. Metrish                                           Page 13\n\n\nunderdeveloped and the briefing of the legal issues is completely inadequate–\nundoubtedly due in large measure to the fact that Plaintiff is proceeding pro se without\nthe benefit of legal representation, and Defendant has failed in its professional\nresponsibilities to this Court by declining to file the requisite brief on appeal.\nInexcusably, the defense’s only filing before this Court was a one-page letter brief\nstating that Defendant would rely upon the district court’s decision and the briefs filed\nbefore the district court. Cardinal, proceeding pro se, attempted to address the sovereign\nimmunity issue in his appellate brief, but his arguments are less than a picture of clarity\nand Plaintiff acknowledges that he “is substantially limited in law and he has had\nproblems with law library access.” (Cardinal’s Br. at 1.) The case was submitted on the\nbriefs without oral argument, and this Court was left with little, if any, developed\nargument as to the propriety of applying the doctrine of sovereign immunity to RLUIPA\nclaims.\n\n          Perhaps more importantly, it is not clear to me that Cardinal has raised a\ncognizable claim under RLUIPA, which states that “no government shall impose a\nsubstantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an\ninstitution . . . .” 42 U.S.C. § 2000 cc-1(a). Beyond asserting that he required and was\ndenied a kosher diet, Cardinal does not describe with any particularity his religious\ndietary needs, the actual food that was provided to him, and what injuries he actually\nsuffered. The record is devoid of any explanation as to whether some of the food served\nto Plaintiff in the non-kosher prison environment, especially vegetables, might have been\nconsumed by him without violating his kosher dietary restrictions. Nor is it al all clear\nwhether Plaintiff, operating pursuant to the doctrine of “necessity,” would have been\npermitted, in the interest of preserving his health and welfare, to consume non-kosher\nfood products, where no kosher food was available, without violating his religious tenets.\nIn other words, the record below is woefully underdeveloped. While we are to construe\npro se petitions liberally in favor of the plaintiff, see Boswell v. Mayer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762143\"><a href=\"/opinion/762143/stanley-l-boswell-v-robert-mayer-and-melinda-cieslinski/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">384</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n387 (6th Cir. 1999), this record offers very little to support Cardinal’s RLUIPA claim\nor to justify the need to resolve on behalf of the circuit the availability of money\ndamages under the statute.\n\fNo. 08-1562        Cardinal v. Metrish                                          Page 14\n\n\n       In view of the constraints presented by the instant case, I would be inclined to\ninstruct the court below to dismiss Cardinal’s RLUIPA claim without prejudice and to\nrefrain from addressing whether the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars a plaintiff from\nrecovering monetary relief under RLUIPA. I therefore respectfully dissent with regard\nto that portion of the majority opinion.\n\f</pre>",
