Code §§ 2-1401.01(a)(1), 2-\n\n1402.11(a)(1), and 2-1402.61(a) & (b) (2006), when it allegedly discriminated against her based\n\non race during her employment at Covington and then retaliated against her based on her\n\ncomplaints about the alleged discrimination, which culminated in her termination. First\n\nAmended Complaint (\"Am. Compl.\") ¶¶ 1-4. This matter is currently before the Court on\n\nCovington’s motion to dismiss Counts II and VII of the plaintiff’s amended complaint pursuant\n\nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Counts II and VII\n\nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (\"Def.’s Mot.\"), which alleges that Covington's job-assignment\n\nand non-promotion policies adversely impact blacks, including the plaintiff, a black female, and\n\nthat Covington did not take appropriate steps to address the racial discrimination that permeated\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\fthe firm. The plaintiff opposes Covington’s motion. 1 Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant’s\n\nSecond Motion to Dismiss (\"Pl.’s Opp’n\"). For the following reasons, the Court must grant in\n\npart and deny in part Covington’s motion.\n\n                                             I. BACKGROUND\n\n        The plaintiff, who is black, graduated from the Georgetown Law Center in 1995 and\n\nworked as a staff attorney at Covington from February 2005 through August 2007. Am. Compl.\n\n¶¶ 7, 32, 34, 112. According to the plaintiff, Covington created the position of staff attorney in\n\n2005 for \"licensed, experienced attorneys who . . . primarily perform online document review,\n\nbut . . . [who also perform] in a variety of ways as practicing attorneys.\" Id. ¶ 18. She further\n\ncontends that in 2006, Covington \"implemented a policy[,] in [its] Washington [office,] banning\n\nthe promotion of all staff attorneys.\" Id. ¶ 21. Additionally, she asserts, staff attorneys' salaries\n\ndo not increase with seniority, while in comparison, attorneys hired to the positions of associate,\n\ncounsel, and partner, enjoy significantly higher salaries that increases with seniority, and who\n\nalso benefit from the prospect of promotion 2 from associate to counsel, and then, eventually, to\n\npartner. Id. ¶ 19.\n\n        The plaintiff alleges that in the course of her employment at Covington, she observed her\n\nwhite male supervisor communicate, socialize, and take a more active interest in cultivating the\n\ncareers of white staff attorneys. Id. ¶¶ 35(a)-(c). The plaintiff further alleges that she\n\nexperienced an environment fraught with racial discrimination and hostility against her and other\n\nblacks. Id. ¶¶ 35(d)-(m). The plaintiff alerted her supervisor of her concerns, but claims that\n\n1\n         The Court also considered the following documents in resolving this motion: Memorandum in Support of\nDefendant's Motion to Dismiss Counts II and VII Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (\"Def.'s Mem.\") and Reply\nMemorandum in Further Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Counts II and VII Under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6) (\"Def.'s Reply\").\n2\n       The plaintiff represents that \"[a] promotion meant a more diverse set of legal responsibilities and more\nmoney.\" Am. Compl. ¶ 19.\n\n\n\n                                                         2\n\fthey were met with indifference. Id. ¶¶ 35(l), 75. The plaintiff further points to a discrepancy\n\nbetween her 2006 and 2007 performance evaluations, the latter which was noticeably more\n\nnegative and critical. Id. ¶ 90. The plaintiff also received a reduced bonus in 2007, which\n\namounted to $5,000, \"barely more than half the $9,000 she had received the previous, partial\n\nyear and well below the $15,000 maximum given that year.\" Id. ¶ 93. Given that she maintained\n\nhigh billable hours and had previously been evaluated positively, the plaintiff asserts that there\n\n\"was no apparent, lawful explanation for [her] receiving a lower bonus.\" Id. ¶¶ 90, 93, 94. And\n\nthe plaintiff represents that several months after receiving her 2007 performance evaluation,\n\n\"[o]n August 14, 2007, [the d]efendant informed [the p]laintiff that it was terminating her\"\n\nwithout any explanation. Id. ¶ 112.\n\n        The plaintiff alleges that the data that she has compiled indicates that blacks are\n\ndisproportionately and overly represented as staff attorneys. See generally id. She further\n\nalleges that \"[t]he number of black staff attorneys employed by [Covington] increased\n\ndramatically when it started the staff[]attorney program.\" Id. ¶ 27. Furthermore, according to\n\nthe plaintiff, “[o]ne in two black attorneys at [the Covington] is a staff attorney[, while only] . . .\n\none in fifteen white attorneys\" have this status. Id. ¶ 28. Therefore, calculates the plaintiff, \"[a]\n\nblack staff attorney is 7.5 times more likely to be assigned to the staff[]attorney position than a\n\nwhite attorney.” Id.\n\n        The plaintiff also proffers that her data indicates that at least \"[s]ome of the black\n\nattorneys could have qualified for an associate position with [Covington].\" Id. ¶ 30. According\n\nto the plaintiff, \"[b]lack practicing attorneys, as a group, typically graduated from higher ranked\n\nlaw schools than their white colleagues.\" Id. ¶ 16. The plaintiff further alleges that a\n\ncomparison of the credentials of black and white attorneys at Covington, based on a\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f\"combination of law school grades, journal membership, and clerkship experience,\" indicates\n\nthat Covington's \"job-assignment criteria requires that black staff attorneys graduate from higher\n\nranked schools than its white staff attorneys.\" Id. ¶¶ 15, 17. As a result, the plaintiff claims that\n\n\"black lawyers have less opportunity to become partner, counsel, or associate at\" Covington,\n\nwith the benefits commensurate with those positions. Id. ¶ 31. Essentially, the plaintiff argues\n\nthat Covington's \"non-promotion policy disproportionately impacts blacks.\" Id. ¶ 29.\n\n       Based on these allegations, the plaintiff filed an administrative charge with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the District of Columbia Human Rights\n\nCommission on June 13, 2008. Id. ¶ 9. On December 16, 2008, the EEOC notified the plaintiff\n\nof her right to sue the defendant for the allegations advanced in her administrative charge of\n\ndiscrimination. Id. ¶ 10. The plaintiff then filed her complaint in this action asserting claims of\n\n(1) \"[d]iscriminatory [j]ob assignment and [p]romotion\" (Count I), (2) \"[a]dverse [i]mpact and\n\n[e]ffect of [j]ob [a]ssignment [p]olicy and [n]o-[p]romotion [p]olicies\" (Count II), (3)\n\n\"[d]iscriminatory [t]reatment and [h]arassment\" (Count III), (4) \"[r]etaliation\" (Count IV), (5)\n\n\"[w]rongful [t]ermination\" (Count V), (6) \"[d]iscriminatory [s]ubterfuge\" (Count VI), and (7)\n\n\"[n]egligent [s]upervision\" (Count VII). See generally id.\n\n                                 II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n       A motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) tests whether the\n\nplaintiff has properly stated a claim upon which relief may be granted. Woodruff v. DiMario,\n\n197 F.R.D. 191, 193 (D.D.C. 2000). For a complaint to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, it need\n\nonly provide “a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to\n\n       relief,” Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2), in order to “give the defendant fair notice of what the\n\nclaim is and the grounds on which it rests,” Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555\n\n\n\n\n                                                  4\n\f(2007) (citation omitted). “Although detailed factual allegations are not necessary to withstand a\n\nRule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, to provide the grounds of entitlement to relief, a plaintiff must\n\nfurnish more than labels and conclusions or a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of\n\naction.” Hinson ex rel N.H. v. Merritt Educ. Ctr., 521 F. Supp. 2d 22, 27 (D.D.C. 2007) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555). Or, as the Supreme Court more\n\nrecently stated, “[t]o survive a motion to dismiss, a complaint must contain sufficient factual\n\nmatter, accepted as true, to ‘state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.’” Ashcroft v.\n\nIqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). A claim is facially\n\nplausible “when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable\n\ninference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged.” Id. (quoting Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. at 556). A complaint alleging facts which are “‘merely consistent with’ a defendant's\n\nliability . . . ‘stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of ‘entitlement to relief.’”\n\nId. (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557) (brackets omitted). Moreover, “[a] dismissal with\n\nprejudice is warranted only when a trial court determines that the allegation of other facts\n\nconsistent with the challenged pleading could not possibly cure the deficiency.” Firestone v.\n\nFirestone, 76 F.3d 1205, 1209 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)\n\n(emphasis in original). Finally, in evaluating a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, “[t]he complaint must be\n\nliberally construed in favor of the plaintiff, who must be granted the benefit of all inferences that\n\ncan be derived from the facts alleged,” Schuler v. United States, 617 F.2d 605, 608 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1979) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted), and the Court “may consider only the\n\nfacts alleged in the complaint, any documents either attached to or incorporated in the complaint\n\nand matters of which [the Court] may take judicial notice[,]” E.E.O.C. v. St. Francis Xavier\n\nParochial Sch., 117 F.3d 621, 624 (D.C. Cir. 1997) (footnote omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                    5\n\f                                     III. LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nA.     Count II (Adverse Impact and Effect of Job-Assignment Policy and Non-Promotion\n       Policies)\n\n       Count II of the plaintiff's complaint alleges that (1) Covington's \"policies[,] practices[,]\n\nand . . . criteria it uses in assigning attorneys to positions within the firm have an adverse impact\n\non black attorneys in violation of Title VII and have the effect of violating the provisions of the\n\n[Human Rights Act],\" Am. Compl. ¶ 125; (2) Covington's \"policy and practice of banning the\n\npromotion of staff attorneys has an adverse impact on black attorneys in violation of Title VII\n\nand has the effect of violating the provisions of the [Human Rights Act],\" id. ¶ 126; (3)\n\nCovington \"can accomplish the goals of its job-assignment and no[n]-promotion policies by\n\nusing policies or practices that do not have, or have less of, an adverse impact or effect on black\n\nattorneys,\" id. ¶ 127; (4) \"it would have been futile for [the p]laintiff and others similarly situated\n\nto her to apply for an associate position with [the d]efendant because of their awareness and [the\n\nd]efendant's enforcement of the job-assignment and no[n]-promotion policies,\" id. ¶ 128; and (4)\n\nCovington's \"employment policies and practices directly and proximately caused [the p]laintiff\n\nphysical, psychic [sic], reputational, and monetary injury,\" id. ¶ 129.\n\n       Covington argues that the Court should dismiss the plaintiff's disparate-impact claims\n\nbecause (1) the plaintiff failed to make such a charge in her administrative complaint \"filed with\n\nthe EEOC and thus failed to exhaust her administrative remedies as required by law[;]\" (2) the\n\nplaintiff's \"complaint makes clear that she cannot prove that she would have been 'assigned' or\n\npromoted to the position of partner, counsel, or associate at Covington but for any facially-\n\nneutral policies that she now seeks to challenge[;]\" and (3) \"insofar as [the plaintiff] makes a\n\ndisparate[-]impact claim with respect to her 'assignment' to a staff attorney position at the time of\n\nher hire, her claim is time-barred.\" See Def.'s Mem. at 4.\n\n\n\n                                                  6\n\f       1.      The Defendant's Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies Challenge\n\n       Covington argues that the plaintiff's administrative charge filed with the EEOC did not\n\nallege any disparate-impact claim arising from a facially non-discriminatory policy. Def.'s Mem.\n\nat 5-6. Specifically, Covington contends that the plaintiff's administrative charge did \"not make\n\nany specific factual allegations relating to her promotion claim or her hiring/assignment claim,\"\n\nnor did it \"challenge any facially non-discriminatory policy regarding the assignment or\n\npromotion of attorneys.\" Id. at 6. Thus, it is Covington's position that \"the disparate[-]impact\n\nallegations now included in Count II [of the amended complaint filed in this Court] were neither\n\nreferenced in the EEOC charge nor reasonably related to the allegations in [that] charge.\" Id. In\n\nresponse, the plaintiff argues that her administrative complaint \"plainly alleges that the\n\ndisproportionate racial makeup of the staff attorneys resulted in black staff attorneys not being\n\npromoted.\" Pl.’s Opp’n at 6. And underlying this charge, she contends, are the premises that\n\nblacks are disproportionately assigned to staff attorney positions and that Covington \"will not\n\nconsider staff attorneys for promotion, which results in a disproportionate number of blacks\n\n[being] ineligible for promotion.\" Id.\n\n       \"A Title VII lawsuit following the EEOC charge is limited in scope to claims that are\n\n'like or reasonably related to the allegations of the charge and growing out of such allegations.'\"\n\nPark v. Howard Univ., 71 F.3d 904, 907 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (quoting Cheek v. W. & S. Life Ins.\n\nCo., 31 F.3d 497, 500 (7th Cir. 1994)). \"Title VII claims must arise from 'the administrative\n\ninvestigation that can reasonably be expected to follow the charge of discrimination.'\" Id.\n\n(quoting Chisholm v. U.S. Postal Serv., 665 F.2d 482, 491 (4th Cir. 1981)). However, the\n\npurpose of an administrative charge is to \"giv[e] the charged party notice of the claim and\n\nnarrow[] the issues for prompt adjudication and decision.\" Id. (internal quotations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 7\n\fAccordingly, \"[a] court cannot allow liberal interpretation of an administrative charge to permit a\n\nlitigant to bypass the Title VII administrative process.\" Id.\n\n       In Park v. Howard University, a case relied upon by Covington, Def.'s Mem. at 7, the\n\nCourt eventually dismissed a plaintiff's hostile work environment claim because it found that the\n\nplaintiff's previously filed EEOC \"charge [had] contained no claims or factual allegations that\n\ncould reasonably be expected upon investigation to lead to a hostile work environment claim.\"\n\n71 F.3d 904, 909 (D.C. Cir. 1995); see also Marshall v. Fed. Express Corp., 130 F.3d 1095, 1098\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1997) (finding that \"[t]he commission could not reasonably be expected to investigate\n\n[the plaintiff's] firing based on the allegations in the charge\" when \"the charge filed by [the\n\nplaintiff] with the EEOC made no mention of her termination\"). The Court arrived at this\n\nconclusion based on\n\n               Title VII['s] require[ment] that a person complaining of a violation\n               file an administrative charge with the EEOC and allow the agency\n               time to act on the charge. Only after the EEOC has notified the\n               aggrieved person of its decision to dismiss or its inability to bring a\n               civil action within the requisite time period can that person bring a\n               civil action herself.\n\nId. at 907 (citing 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(f)(1)).\n\n       In this case, the only allegation in plaintiff’s EEOC charge relating to assignments or\n\npromotions states, in relevant part:\n\n               Staff attorneys are comprised of a population of approximately\n               30% Blacks and 30% other minorities. Due to this race\n               composition, Staff Attorneys are subjected to the following\n               conditions that other positions, comprised of low minority\n               populations, are not: segregated, unfavorable work spaces, denial\n               of maternity and jury leave, lack of promotional consideration and\n               exclusion from retreats and office events. Since my employment\n               began, I was subjected to these disparate conditions.\n\n\n\n\n                                                  8\n\fDef.'s Mem., Ex. 1 at 3 (June 5, 2008 Charge of Discrimination). Because the plaintiff's\n\nadministrative charge does not directly assert any complaint against Covington's non-promotion\n\npolicy or the method of \"assigning attorneys to positions within the firm,\" Am. Compl. ¶ 125, it\n\nmight at first blush appear that the plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with\n\nrespect to her disparate treatment claim because she did not identify and expressly challenge the\n\nnon-promotion or assignment policies in her administrative charge. However, countervailing\n\nstandards must also guide the Court's consideration, and in this case, command a different result.\n\n       When considering a motion to dismiss, \"[t]he nonmoving party is entitled to all\n\nreasonable inferences that can be drawn in her favor.\" Artis v. Greenspan, 158 F.3d 1301, 1306\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1998) (emphasis in original). Here, the plaintiff prefaced her administrative charge\n\nstating that the conditions to which she was allegedly subjected were \"due to [the] race\n\ncomposition\" of Covington's staff attorneys. Def.'s Mem., Ex. 1 at 2 (June 5, 2008 Charge of\n\nDiscrimination). The Court can easily infer from this language that the plaintiff's administrative\n\ncharge was challenging Covington's policies, which she contends resulted in disproportionate\n\nrepresentation of minorities in staff attorney positions, as she also alleges that attorneys in these\n\npositions \"lack of promotional consideration.\" Id. Although not articulated with precision, this\n\nadministrative complaint was clearly sufficient to put both the EEOC and Covington on notice\n\nthat a disparate-impact charge was being asserted. Def.'s Mem., Ex. 1 at 3 (June 5, 2008 Charge\n\nof Discrimination). While the plaintiff is not correct that her \"[disparate]-impact claim appears\n\nplainly on the face of [her] charge of discrimination,\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 7, her assertion regarding the\n\ndisproportionate racial composition of blacks in staff attorney positions adequately raised the\n\ninference that Covington's policies were driving the racial demographic of attorneys in those\n\npositions, which resulted in the plaintiff being denied certain benefits and promotional\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fopportunities. The Court must then reasonably infer that the plaintiff was attacking Covington's\n\nnon-promotion policies in her administrative charge. Accordingly, because the plaintiff's\n\nchallenge to Covington's job assignment and non-promotion policies in this Court are\n\n\"reasonably related to the allegations of the [administrative] charge,\" Park, 71 F.3d at 907\n\n(citation omitted), the Court must conclude that the plaintiff adequately exhausted her\n\nadministrative remedies and therefore Count II cannot be dismissed on this basis.\n\n        2.      The Defendant's Standing Challenge\n\n        Covington further argues that Count II should be dismissed because \"[the plaintiff] lacks\n\nstanding to assert claims regarding Covington's purported assignment and promotions policies.\"\n\nDef.'s Reply at 6. Covington argues that the plaintiff failed to allege that \"she was personally\n\nharmed by either policy,\" id., and also that she would have actually been qualified for a higher\n\nposition, id. at 9. In response, the plaintiff argues that she was presumptively unqualified by\n\nCovington because its non-promotion \"policy . . . disqualifie[d] her and all other staff attorneys\n\nwithout any business necessity,\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 9, while in reality she was \"objectively qualified\n\nto perform the job of associate, of counsel, or partner in absence of the policy ban\" considering\n\nher \"graduation from a law school approved by the American Bar Association, passage of a bar\n\nexam . . . , receipt of a license to practice law . . . , and number of years of practice,\" id. at 9-10.\n\n        Anyone who has Article III standing has standing to bring an action under Title VII.

See Douglas v. Preston, 559 F.3d\n\n549, 554 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (The \"failure to be promoted categorically is an adverse employment\n\naction.\" (emphasis in original)); Phillips v.

While a finding that\n\nCovington's policies violated anti-discrimination laws will not make the plaintiff eligible for a\n\npromotion from a job that she has already lost, an award of damages would at least to some\n\ndegree redress the injuries allegedly sustained by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff therefore has\n\nstanding to maintain her Title VII disparate-impact claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f         3.       The Defendant's Statute of Limitations Challenge\n\n         Covington argues that the plaintiff \"was required to file her charge [of disparate impact]\n\nwithin 300 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred\" under Title VII or\n\n\"within one year under the [Human Rights Act].\" Def.'s Mem. at 11. Because Covington hired\n\nthe plaintiff in 2005 and the non-promotion policy went into effect in 2006, Covington argues\n\nthat the plaintiff's disparate-impact claim is now time-barred since she did not file her EEOC\n\nchange until 2008. Id. The plaintiff predicates her disparate-impact claim on both Covington's\n\njob-assignment and its non-promotion policies, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 124-28, and in response to its\n\nstatutes of limitations challenges argues that she was evaluated \"at least three times during her\n\ntenure[, which] . . . reinforced and capitulated the adverse job-assignment criteria and policy that\n\nCovington used for initial job assignments,\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 11. The plaintiff therefore claims that\n\nbecause her last evaluation was within 300 days of her charge filing, her claim is not time-barred\n\nby either Title VII or the Human Rights Act. Id.\n\n         It is apparent that Covington's position is that the operative date from which the start of\n\nthe statute of limitations period for both Title VII and the Human Rights Act should commence\n\nis the date when the plaintiff was hired, Def.'s Mem. at 11, while the plaintiff maintains that each\n\ntime Covington evaluated her performance, it \"reinforced and recapitulated the adverse job-\n\nassignment criteria and policy that [it] used for initial job assignments,\" and therefore, effectively\n\ncommitted anew an adverse employment action, extending the life of the statutory limitations\n\nperiod, 3 Pl.'s Opp'n at 11. Thus, it appears that the plaintiff concedes that if the controlling date\n\n\n\n3\n         The plaintiff's 2007 bonus falls within both the statutes of limitations periods, as it was received in\nFebruary 2007. Am. Compl. ¶ 92. However, the date of the plaintiff's 2007 evaluation is not specified in her\namended complaint. The Court will therefore assume for the purposes of this decision, based on the information\nprovided, that the plaintiff's position is correct that her \"last evaluation, which resulted in her termination, occurred\nwithin 300 days of her charge filing date.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 11.\n\n\n\n                                                           13\n\ffor statute of limitations purposes is when she was initially hired, her challenge to Covington's\n\njob assignment and non-promotion policies is barred by the statute of limitations periods of both\n\nTitle VII and the Human Rights Act. It is the plaintiff's position, however, that Covington's\n\npolicies amounted to a continuing violation (i.e., later occurring acts that relate back to the date\n\nwhen she was hired), resulting in her disparate-impact claim not being barred by the applicable\n\nstatutes of limitations. See Palmer v. Kelly, 17 F.3d 1490, 1496 (D.C. Cir. 1994) (\"[T]o recover\n\nfor violations occurring outside limitations period, [the] plaintiff must prove either a 'series of\n\nrelated acts, one or more of which falls within the limitations period, or the maintenance of a\n\ndiscriminatory system both before and during the statutory period.'\" (quoting Berger v. Iron\n\nWorkers Reinforced Rodmen Local 201, 843 F.2d 1395, 1422 (D.C. Cir. 1988))).\n\n       In assessing whether a continuing violation has been properly pled, the Court must\n\nanalyze first, \"whether an actual violation of Title VII [or the Human Rights Act] occurred\n\nduring the statutory period\" and second, \"whether this discriminatory act either was part of a\n\nseries of related discriminatory acts or was caused by a discriminatory system in effect both\n\nbefore and during the limitations period.\" Id. (applying this analysis to a Title VII claim); see\n\nalso Lempres v. CBS Inc., 916 F. Supp. 15, 21 (D.D.C. 1996) (applying this analysis to a Human\n\nRights Act claim). The first prong of the continuing violation theory requires the occurrence of a\n\ndiscrete adverse act within the statute of limitations period. See United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans,\n\n431 U.S. 553, 558 (1977) (\"[T]he emphasis should not be placed on mere continuity; the critical\n\nquestion is whether any present violation exists.\"). \"Because 'significant' and 'objectively\n\ntangible' harm is required, performance evaluations ordinarily are not actionable under Title\n\nVII,\" id.; see Russell v. Principi, 257 F.3d 815, 818 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (\"The result of an\n\nevaluation is often speculative, making it difficult to remedy.\"); see also Taylor v. Small, 350\n\n\n\n\n                                                  14\n\fF.3d 1286, 1293 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (\"Formal criticism or poor performance evaluations are not\n\nnecessarily adverse actions and they should not be considered as such if they did not affect the\n\nemployee's grade or salary.\" (quoting Brown v. Brody, 199 F.3d 446, 457-58 (D.C. Cir. 1999))\n\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)), nor the Human Rights Act, cf. Thong v. Andre\n\nChreky Salon, 634 F. Supp. 2d 40, 44 n.2 (D.D.C. 2009) (observing that the standards applied to\n\nTitle VII and the Human Rights Act \"are the same, with D.C. courts consistently adopting Title\n\nVII decisions [when analyzing] the [Human Rights Act]\"). However, the plaintiff's termination\n\nis certainly a significant and objectively tangible harm, and similarly, \"the loss of a bonus can\n\nconstitute an adverse employment action under Title VII [and the Human Rights Act].\" Russell,\n\n257 F.3d at 818. And affording all reasonable inferences to the plaintiff at this stage in the case,\n\nas the Court is required, it must be presumed from the plaintiff's allegations that her negative\n\nevaluation in 2007, her reduced bonus, and her eventual termination were carried out with\n\ndiscriminatory intent. Cf. Pryor v. NCAA, 288 F.3d 548, 565 (3d Cir. 2002) (“issues including\n\nstate of mind (e.g., intent) are often unsuitable for a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss”).\n\nAccordingly, the Court finds that the plaintiff has alleged at least one occurrence of racial\n\ndiscrimination that fell within the statute of limitations period of both Title VII and the Human\n\nRights Act.\n\n       The remaining question then is whether the discriminatory acts the plaintiff alleged were\n\npart of a larger \"series of related discriminatory acts or was caused by a discriminatory system in\n\neffect both before and during the limitations period.\" Palmer, 17 F.3d at 1496. It appears from\n\nhow the plaintiff incorporated references to two polices in one disparate-impact claim that she\n\nhinges Count II on two distinct policies or theories of liability, i.e. that Covington's job-\n\nassignment policy and its non-promotion policy had an adverse impact on black attorneys hired\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fby the firm. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 124-129. In Lorance v. AT&T Techs., Inc., 4 the Supreme\n\nCourt noted that there is a distinction between a facially discriminatory system or policy, which\n\n\"by definition discriminates each time it is applied,\" from a facially neutral system or policy,\n\nwherein \"each application is nondiscriminatory.\" 490 U.S. 900, 912 n.5 (1989); see also Shea,\n\n409 F.3d at 452 (finding that each paycheck was an unlawful application of a racially\n\ndiscriminatory pay system); Anderson v. Zubieta, 180 F.3d 329, 337 (D.C. Cir. 1999) (finding\n\nthat each paycheck was an unlawful application of a policy that paid lower wages on the basis of\n\ncitizenship); Palmer, 17 F.3d at 1496 (finding that a supervisor's failure to inform the white\n\nplaintiff of his promotion, so as to allow a black employee to assume the position upon the\n\nplaintiff's retirement, was an unlawful application of a discriminatory policy to equalize the\n\nnumber of blacks and whites promoted to higher level positions). Accordingly, the Lorance\n\nCourt held that \"when a seniority system is nondiscriminatory in form and application, it is the\n\nallegedly discriminatory adoption which triggers the limitations period.\" 490 U.S. at 911\n\n(emphasis in original). The Lorance Court's holding teaches that a discriminatory policy\n\ndiscriminates each time it is applied, and therefore, the continuing violation theory reinvigorates\n\nthe claim for statue of limitations purposes, each time the policy is applied; but by contrast, the\n\ncontinuing violation theory is inapplicable to a facially neutral policy because \"allowing a\n\nfacially neutral system to be challenged, and entitlements under it to be altered, many years after\n\nits adoption would disrupt those valid reliance interests . . . .\" Id. at 912. Here, the job-\n\n4\n          Although the Lorance Court was specifically reviewing the \"special treatment\" of facially neutral seniority\nsystems, 490 U.S. at 904, and its analysis has since been abrogated by 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(e)(2) with respect to the\ndiscriminatory application of seniority systems, \"its reasoning remains persuasive outside of the Title\nVII/intentionally discriminatory seniority system context\" because it \"merely . . . appl[ies] . . . the traditional\ndistinction between a continuing violation and the present consequences of a one-time past act of discrimination.\"\nHuels v. Exxon Coal USA, Inc., 121 F.3d 1047, 1050 n.1 (7th Cir. 1997) (quoting Knight v. City of Columbus, 19\nF.3d 579, 585 n. 4 (11th Cir. 1994); Ross v. Buckeye Cellulose Corp., 980 F.2d 648, 659 n.18 (11th Cir. 1993)\n(internal quotations omitted)); see, e.g., Shea v. Rice, 409 F.3d 448, 452 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (observing that the\nanalysis of Lorance still applies to a facially neutral system).\n\n\n\n                                                         16\n\fassignment and non-promotion policies do not constitute one overall system, as the plaintiff has\n\nframed Count II, see Am. Compl. ¶¶ 124-29; rather, they are discrete – and at least so far as the\n\nnon-promotion policy is concerned, isolated – and therefore should have been assessed\n\nindividually. While the plaintiff alleges that the non-promotion and job-assignment policies\n\ninvolve the same type of racial discrimination, it is readily apparent that Covington's non-\n\npromotion policy did not result in a series of recurring events. See, e.g., Albritton v. Kantor, 944\n\nF. Supp. 966, 971 (D.D.C. 1996) (analyzing whether alleged discriminatory acts were part of a\n\nseries by assessing if the alleged discrimination occurred more than once, if each occurrence was\n\nof the same type of discrimination, and if they lacked a degree of finality so as to \"alert an\n\nemployee of a need to assert his or her rights\"). Indeed, the non-promotion policy was an\n\nisolated act, as compared to the job-assignment policy, because the non-promotion policy\n\nresulted in a final decision that Covington staff attorneys would have no prospect of career\n\nadvancement at the time of its creation. Accordingly, no reassessment of any staff attorney's\n\nposition could breathe new life into the policy and the non-promotion policy is best viewed as a\n\nfacially neutral policy that had its impact on the date of its adoption. Lorance, 490 U.S. at 912.\n\nTherefore, whether the plaintiff can assert her challenges against Covington's job-assignment and\n\nnon-promotion policies on the basis of a continuing violation theory depends upon the individual\n\nnature of the policies and whether each policy, in turn, relates to an adverse employment action\n\nthat occurred within the applicable statute of limitations periods.\n\n                a.      The Plaintiff's Challenge of the Job-Assignment Policy Claim Is Not\n                        Barred by the Statutes of Limitations\n\n        The exact nature of the job-assignment policy being challenged by the plaintiff is unclear,\n\nas she essentially presumes some race-based criteria was employed when she was hired. For\n\ninstance, the plaintiff challenges Covington's \"policies . . .[,] practices[,] and . . . criteria it uses in\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n\fassigning attorneys to positions within the firm,\" and argues that, based \"[o]n information and\n\nbelief, [Covington] relies on job-assignment criteria that are not related to or predictive of job\n\nperformance,\" including \"a combination of law school grades, journal membership, and clerkship\n\nexperience.\" Am. Compl. ¶ 125. The plaintiff bases her conclusion on statistics that she\n\ncompiled, which allegedly indicate that lawyers hired as staff attorneys had credentials and\n\ngraduated from law schools at least as good as or better than those lawyers hired as associates or\n\npartners. Id. ¶¶ 16-17. The plaintiff further maintains that \"it appears that [Covington's] job-\n\nassignment criteria requires that black staff attorneys graduate from higher ranked schools than\n\nits white staff attorneys.\" Id. ¶ 17. Assuming that all of these allegations are true, as the Court\n\nmust at this stage, it is reasonable to infer that Covington's job-assignment policy discriminates\n\nbased on race. Therefore, the issue then becomes whether, as the plaintiff argues, Covington's\n\napplication of its performance evaluation criteria to her employment was an unlawful application\n\nof Covington's discriminatory job-assignment policy.\n\n       It is unclear at this juncture, not only what are Covington's initial job-assignment criteria,\n\nbut whether its subsequent employee performance evaluations assess criteria which replicates\n\nthat criteria used at the time of the initial job-assignment or is discriminatory in some other\n\nmanner. Nonetheless, it is the plaintiff's position that the initial assignment criteria are replicated\n\nbecause \"[e]ach evaluation reinforced and recapitulated the adverse job-assignment criteria and\n\npolicy that Covington used for initial job assignments.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 11. In fact, it would seem\n\nonly logical to conclude that the initial job-assignment criteria alleged by the plaintiff (i.e. law\n\nschool grades, journal membership, and clerkship experience) is relevant only at the time of the\n\njob-assignment, when an employee's actual job performance and demonstrated skill are merely\n\nspeculative, but lose their importance once actual job performance and demonstrated skill\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fbecome first known by an employer. However, again at this stage in the case, the benefit of all\n\nreasonable inferences must be construed in favor of the plaintiff and because it is at least\n\nplausible, even if only minimally, that Covington utilized discriminatory criteria as part of its\n\nannual performance evaluations of its attorneys, the plaintiff is entitled to benefit of that doubt.\n\nTherefore, the Court cannot dismiss the plaintiff's disparate-impact claim as untimely because it\n\nis based upon the theory that Covington's initial job-assignment policy was racially\n\ndiscriminatory and that she was subjected to it each time her job performance was evaluated, the\n\nlast evaluation having occurred within the governing status of limitation periods.\n\n                b.      The Plaintiff's Challenge of the Non-Promotion Policy Is Barred by\n                        the Statutes of Limitations\n\n        The plaintiff alleges that Covington's non-promotion policy categorically prohibits the\n\npromotion of staff attorneys. Am. Compl. ¶ 21. Because that categorization does not have\n\nfacially discriminatory implications, it is facially race-neutral; however, it can still be subject to\n\nan actionable discrimination claim if the policy has a \"disparate impact on the basis of race.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). But, even where a policy or practice has a disparate impact on a\n\nprotected class, \"[a]n employer may defend against liability by demonstrating that the practice is\n\n'job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.'\" Ricci v.\n\nDeStefano, __ U.S. __, __, 129 S. Ct. 2658, 2673 (2009). And unless the plaintiff can then\n\n\"show[] that the employer refuses to adopt an available alternative employment practice that has\n\nless disparate impact and serves the employer's legitimate needs,\" the policy need not be\n\nabandoned. Id. However, with respect to whether a claim based on the continuing violation\n\ntheory can be maintained, the alleged violation must be \"caused by a discriminatory system in\n\neffect both before and during the limitations period.\" Palmer, 17 F.3d 1496 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  19\n\f        It appears that the non-promotion policy was implemented in 2006, after the plaintiff was\n\nhired, Am. Compl. ¶¶ 20-21, but she does not allege that she attempted to acquire a promotion or\n\napplied for one of the associate positions at Covington at any time during her employment.\n\nBecause the statute of limitations would bar recovery for this alleged 2006 transgression – the\n\nadoption of the non-promotion policy – since the plaintiff did not file a complaint of\n\ndiscrimination until 2008, id. ¶ 9, the plaintiff relies upon the doctrine of futility and the\n\ncontinuing violation theory in her attempt to preserve the claim, id. ¶¶ 45 & 128 (indicating that\n\nthe plaintiff \"expressed her desire to be promoted,\" but \"[i]t would have been futile for [her] . . .\n\nto apply for an associate position\"). Regarding the doctrine of futility, it \"is reserved for only\n\n'the most invidious effects of employment discrimination,'\" Youssef v. F.B.I., 541 F. Supp. 2d\n\n121, 153 (D.D.C. 2008) (quoting Int'l Brotherhood of Teamsters v. United States, 431 U.S. 324,\n\n365-67 (1977)), and the lack of upward mobility from a staff attorney position to any other\n\nattorney position at Covington is a proscription that applied to all staff attorneys regardless of\n\nrace. This reality does not easily lend itself to the conclusion of continuing racial discrimination\n\nby Covington as the plaintiff alleges here. Asserting futility in the absence of any effort to obtain\n\nanother attorney position at Covington fails to support the existence of a continuing violation\n\nbecause individuals allegedly subject to the policy, such as the plaintiff, must be able to assert\n\n\"that [t]he[y] would have applied but for discrimination and that [t]he[y] would have been\n\ndiscriminatorily rejected had [t]he[y] applied.\" Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 368 n.52\n\n(emphasis added). The plaintiff has not met the burden of alleging that she and all similarly\n\nsituated black attorneys would have been rejected because of their race; all the Court can glean\n\nfrom her complaint is that they would have been denied a promotion because they held the\n\npositions of staff attorneys. Accepting the plaintiff's allegations as true, as the Court must\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fpresume at this stage, she has merely asserted that after the non-promotion policy was instituted\n\nin 2006 the number of black staff attorneys increased in 2007 and 2008, while the number of\n\nblacks in associate, of counsel, or partnership positions decreased in those years and the number\n\nof white attorneys in all three categories experienced little variation. Am. Compl. ¶ 27. The\n\nproblem is that the plaintiff does not allege that any exceptions to the non-promotion policy were\n\nmade for any staff attorney, regardless of race. It would not be reasonable for the Court to infer\n\nfutility under these circumstances, as the doctrine has no appropriate application. Essentially,\n\nwith respect to the non-promotion policy, the plaintiff is asking the Court to infer that because\n\nthere was an increase in the number of black staff attorneys at Covington from 2005 until 2008,\n\nwhile the number of black attorneys did not increase in other attorney positions within the firm,\n\nthat Covington had an ongoing policy that adversely impacted black attorneys. Yet, there is no\n\nallegation that any staff attorney was transferred or promoted to a different attorney position or\n\nthat the number of non-black attorneys in non-staff attorney positions increased; in fact, the\n\nnumber of white non-staff attorneys varies throughout 2006-08 by only one or two in every\n\ncategory except for the position of partner, which actually decreased by three attorneys. Id. The\n\nevidence proffered by the plaintiff therefore fails to support the inference that a continuing\n\nviolation occurred for statute of limitations purposes.\n\n        With respect to the plaintiff's employment specifically, \"[m]ere continuity of\n\nemployment, without more, is insufficient to prolong the life of a cause of action for employment\n\ndiscrimination.\" Delaware State College v. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980) (\"It is simply\n\ninsufficient for [the plaintiff] to allege that [the] termination 'gives present effect to the past\n\nillegal act and therefore perpetuates the consequences of forbidden discrimination.'\" (citation\n\nomitted)). In other words, the fact that the plaintiff was employed by Covington during the\n\n\n\n\n                                                   21\n\flimitation periods is insufficient to save her disparate-impact claim based on her non-promotion\n\ncontinuing violation theory. As with the seniority system in Lorance, the proper time within\n\nwhich the plaintiff should have submitted her administrative claim was therefore 300 days after\n\nthe implementation of Covington's non-promotion policy to satisfy statute of limitation of Title\n\nVII and one year to satisfy the statute of limitation of the Human Rights Act. See Lorance, 490\n\nU.S. at 913 (\"With a facially neutral system the discriminatory act occurs only at the time of\n\nadoption, for each application is nondiscriminatory.\"). Nor are Covington's job-assignment and\n\nnon-promotion policies sufficiently related to view them as all part of one overall continuing\n\nscheme designed to discriminate against its black attorneys. Palmer, 17 F.3d at 1496. Whether\n\nblack and non-black attorneys are provided with different work assignments and positions is\n\ndistinguishable from whether staff attorneys as a whole may be transferred or promoted to other\n\nattorney positions at Covington. The fact that the staff attorney position is not a pathway to\n\npartnership is not a discriminatory policy that is reinvigorated each time a new staff attorney is\n\nhired or evaluated. Indeed, the plaintiff continued to work under the non-promotion staff\n\nattorney policy, and she made no complaint within the requisite statutory timeframe after the\n\npolicy was initiated. While her ultimate administrative complaint can be construed as having\n\nraised a disparate-impact claim, to the extent that that claim is based on the non-promotion\n\npolicy, the complaint was untimely. Therefore, to the extent that the plaintiff's disparate-impact\n\nclaim is premised on Covington's non-promotion policy, it is time-barred.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fB.      Count VII (Negligent Supervision)\n\n        Despite the plaintiff's contention that the defendant was bound to abide by\n\nantidiscrimination laws in accordance with \"an employer's common law duty to keep the\n\nworkplace safe,\" and that the defendant's failure to keep confidential the plaintiff's allegations\n\nregarding violations of antidiscrimination laws \"could [have] result[ed] in violence,\" Pl.'s Opp'n\n\nat 12, Covington correctly argues that under Griffin v. Acacia Life Ins. Co., 925 A.2d 564, 576\n\n(D.C. 2007), \"a common law claim of negligent supervision may be predicated only on common\n\nlaw causes of action or duties otherwise imposed by the common law.\" 5 As no common law\n\nclaim or duty has been alleged in this case, the plaintiff's negligent supervision claim must be\n\ndismissed.\n\n        In Griffin, the plaintiff predicated her negligent supervision claim on the failure of her\n\nsupervisor to prevent sexual harassment. The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary\n\njudgment against the plaintiff, concluding that \"the common law did not recognize an employer's\n\nduty to prevent the sort of sexual harassment alleged.\" Griffin, 925 A.2d at 576. \"To hold\n\notherwise,\" the court held, \"'would be to impose liability on employers for failing to prevent a\n\nharm that is not a cognizable injury under the common law.\" Id. at 577. Accordingly the Griffin\n\ncourt, unless the act manifests itself \"by other actionable wrongful conduct, e.g., assault and\n\nbattery[,] . . . respect for the legislature . . . requires that the rights of a victim of non-physical\n5\n          A cause of action for the common law tort of negligent supervision arises from the employer's breach of\nduty to the employee, classified as:\n\n                 1.   The duty to provide a safe place to work.\n                 2.   The duty to provide safe appliances, tools, and equipment for the work.\n                 3.   The duty to give warning of dangers of which the employee might\n                      reasonably be expected to remain in ignorance.\n                 4.   The duty to provide a sufficient number of suitable fellow servants.\n                 5.   The duty to promulgate and enforce rules for the conduct of employees\n                      which would make the work safe.\n\nGriffin, 925 A.2d at 576 (quoting Prosser & Keeton on Torts § 80, at 569 (5th ed.1984) (footnotes omitted)).\n\n\n\n                                                        23\n\fsexual harassment be limited by the remedies which the legislature has provided in the [Human\n\nRights Act],\" id., and by the same reasoning, this Court holds that the same is true under Title\n\nVII. Thus, the Griffin court held that \"a negligent supervision claim cannot be predicated on the\n\n[Human Rights Act].\" 925 A.2d at 577. And again, this Court concludes, the same reasoning\n\nequally applies in the Title VII context.\n\n       Here, the plaintiff predicates her negligent supervision claim precisely on the failure to\n\nabide by Title VII and the Human Rights Act. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 152-156. Specifically, she\n\nclaims that (1) Covington \"owed [her] a duty to ensure [that] its managers complied with and\n\nenforced federal and local antidiscriminatory law\" id. ¶ 153; (2) her supervisor \"failed to address\n\n[her] complaints of discrimination, failed to take appropriate steps to address the discriminatory\n\nconduct of the employee's [sic] he managed, and failed to protect [the p]laintiff from retaliation\n\nby his subordinates,\" id. ¶ 154; (3) the defendant \"breached its duty to [her] by negligently,\n\nrecklessly, or indifferently supervising [her supervisor's] management of the staff attorneys and\n\ntheir work environment,\" id. ¶ 155; and (4) Covington's \"supervision of or failure to supervise\n\n[her supervisor] directly and proximately caused [her] physical, psychic [sic], reputational, and\n\nmonetary injury,\" id. ¶ 156. The prevention of racial discrimination in the workplace is not a\n\ncommon law duty upon which a claim of negligent supervision may be based. Accord Griffin,\n\n925 A.2d at 576 (\"[T]he common law did not recognize an employer's duty to prevent the sort of\n\nsexual harassment alleged in the appellant's complaint.\"). Therefore, because her complaint does\n\nnot allege that the defendant breached any common law duty, the plaintiff's claim of negligent\n\nsupervision must be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f                                           IV. CONCLUSION\n\n         For foregoing reasons, Covington's motion to dismiss must be granted in part and denied\n\nin part. 6\n\n                                                           _____/s/________________\n                                                           Reggie B.

Code §§ 2-1401.01(a)(1), 2-\n\n1402.11(a)(1), and 2-1402.61(a) & (b) (2006), when it allegedly discriminated against her based\n\non race during her employment at Covington and then retaliated against her based on her\n\ncomplaints about the alleged discrimination, which culminated in her termination. First\n\nAmended Complaint (\"Am. Compl.\") ¶¶ 1-4. This matter is currently before the Court on\n\nCovington’s motion to dismiss Counts II and VII of the plaintiff’s amended complaint pursuant\n\nto Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss Counts II and VII\n\nUnder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (\"Def.’s Mot.\"), which alleges that Covington's job-assignment\n\nand non-promotion policies adversely impact blacks, including the plaintiff, a black female, and\n\nthat Covington did not take appropriate steps to address the racial discrimination that permeated\n\n\n\n\n                                                1\n\fthe firm. The plaintiff opposes Covington’s motion. 1 Plaintiff’s Opposition to Defendant’s\n\nSecond Motion to Dismiss (\"Pl.’s Opp’n\"). For the following reasons, the Court must grant in\n\npart and deny in part Covington’s motion.\n\n                                             I. BACKGROUND\n\n        The plaintiff, who is black, graduated from the Georgetown Law Center in 1995 and\n\nworked as a staff attorney at Covington from February 2005 through August 2007. Am. Compl.\n\n¶¶ 7, 32, 34, 112. According to the plaintiff, Covington created the position of staff attorney in\n\n2005 for \"licensed, experienced attorneys who . . . primarily perform online document review,\n\nbut . . . [who also perform] in a variety of ways as practicing attorneys.\" Id. ¶ 18. She further\n\ncontends that in 2006, Covington \"implemented a policy[,] in [its] Washington [office,] banning\n\nthe promotion of all staff attorneys.\" Id. ¶ 21. Additionally, she asserts, staff attorneys' salaries\n\ndo not increase with seniority, while in comparison, attorneys hired to the positions of associate,\n\ncounsel, and partner, enjoy significantly higher salaries that increases with seniority, and who\n\nalso benefit from the prospect of promotion 2 from associate to counsel, and then, eventually, to\n\npartner. Id. ¶ 19.\n\n        The plaintiff alleges that in the course of her employment at Covington, she observed her\n\nwhite male supervisor communicate, socialize, and take a more active interest in cultivating the\n\ncareers of white staff attorneys. Id. ¶¶ 35(a)-(c). The plaintiff further alleges that she\n\nexperienced an environment fraught with racial discrimination and hostility against her and other\n\nblacks. Id. ¶¶ 35(d)-(m). The plaintiff alerted her supervisor of her concerns, but claims that\n\n1\n         The Court also considered the following documents in resolving this motion: Memorandum in Support of\nDefendant's Motion to Dismiss Counts II and VII Under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) (\"Def.'s Mem.\") and Reply\nMemorandum in Further Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Counts II and VII Under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n12(b)(6) (\"Def.'s Reply\").\n2\n       The plaintiff represents that \"[a] promotion meant a more diverse set of legal responsibilities and more\nmoney.\" Am. Compl. ¶ 19.\n\n\n\n                                                         2\n\fthey were met with indifference. Id. ¶¶ 35(l), 75. The plaintiff further points to a discrepancy\n\nbetween her 2006 and 2007 performance evaluations, the latter which was noticeably more\n\nnegative and critical. Id. ¶ 90. The plaintiff also received a reduced bonus in 2007, which\n\namounted to $5,000, \"barely more than half the $9,000 she had received the previous, partial\n\nyear and well below the $15,000 maximum given that year.\" Id. ¶ 93. Given that she maintained\n\nhigh billable hours and had previously been evaluated positively, the plaintiff asserts that there\n\n\"was no apparent, lawful explanation for [her] receiving a lower bonus.\" Id. ¶¶ 90, 93, 94. And\n\nthe plaintiff represents that several months after receiving her 2007 performance evaluation,\n\n\"[o]n August 14, 2007, [the d]efendant informed [the p]laintiff that it was terminating her\"\n\nwithout any explanation. Id. ¶ 112.\n\n        The plaintiff alleges that the data that she has compiled indicates that blacks are\n\ndisproportionately and overly represented as staff attorneys. See generally id. She further\n\nalleges that \"[t]he number of black staff attorneys employed by [Covington] increased\n\ndramatically when it started the staff[]attorney program.\" Id. ¶ 27. Furthermore, according to\n\nthe plaintiff, “[o]ne in two black attorneys at [the Covington] is a staff attorney[, while only] . . .\n\none in fifteen white attorneys\" have this status. Id. ¶ 28. Therefore, calculates the plaintiff, \"[a]\n\nblack staff attorney is 7.5 times more likely to be assigned to the staff[]attorney position than a\n\nwhite attorney.” Id.\n\n        The plaintiff also proffers that her data indicates that at least \"[s]ome of the black\n\nattorneys could have qualified for an associate position with [Covington].\" Id. ¶ 30. According\n\nto the plaintiff, \"[b]lack practicing attorneys, as a group, typically graduated from higher ranked\n\nlaw schools than their white colleagues.\" Id. ¶ 16. The plaintiff further alleges that a\n\ncomparison of the credentials of black and white attorneys at Covington, based on a\n\n\n\n\n                                                   3\n\f\"combination of law school grades, journal membership, and clerkship experience,\" indicates\n\nthat Covington's \"job-assignment criteria requires that black staff attorneys graduate from higher\n\nranked schools than its white staff attorneys.\" Id. ¶¶ 15, 17. As a result, the plaintiff claims that\n\n\"black lawyers have less opportunity to become partner, counsel, or associate at\" Covington,\n\nwith the benefits commensurate with those positions. Id. ¶ 31. Essentially, the plaintiff argues\n\nthat Covington's \"non-promotion policy disproportionately impacts blacks.\" Id. ¶ 29.\n\n       Based on these allegations, the plaintiff filed an administrative charge with the Equal\n\nEmployment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the District of Columbia Human Rights\n\nCommission on June 13, 2008. Id. ¶ 9. On December 16, 2008, the EEOC notified the plaintiff\n\nof her right to sue the defendant for the allegations advanced in her administrative charge of\n\ndiscrimination. Id. ¶ 10. The plaintiff then filed her complaint in this action asserting claims of\n\n(1) \"[d]iscriminatory [j]ob assignment and [p]romotion\" (Count I), (2) \"[a]dverse [i]mpact and\n\n[e]ffect of [j]ob [a]ssignment [p]olicy and [n]o-[p]romotion [p]olicies\" (Count II), (3)\n\n\"[d]iscriminatory [t]reatment and [h]arassment\" (Count III), (4) \"[r]etaliation\" (Count IV), (5)\n\n\"[w]rongful [t]ermination\" (Count V), (6) \"[d]iscriminatory [s]ubterfuge\" (Count VI), and (7)\n\n\"[n]egligent [s]upervision\" (Count VII).

The Defendant's Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies Challenge\n\n       Covington argues that the plaintiff's administrative charge filed with the EEOC did not\n\nallege any disparate-impact claim arising from a facially non-discriminatory policy. Def.'s Mem.\n\nat 5-6. Specifically, Covington contends that the plaintiff's administrative charge did \"not make\n\nany specific factual allegations relating to her promotion claim or her hiring/assignment claim,\"\n\nnor did it \"challenge any facially non-discriminatory policy regarding the assignment or\n\npromotion of attorneys.\" Id. at 6. Thus, it is Covington's position that \"the disparate[-]impact\n\nallegations now included in Count II [of the amended complaint filed in this Court] were neither\n\nreferenced in the EEOC charge nor reasonably related to the allegations in [that] charge.\" Id. In\n\nresponse, the plaintiff argues that her administrative complaint \"plainly alleges that the\n\ndisproportionate racial makeup of the staff attorneys resulted in black staff attorneys not being\n\npromoted.\" Pl.’s Opp’n at 6. And underlying this charge, she contends, are the premises that\n\nblacks are disproportionately assigned to staff attorney positions and that Covington \"will not\n\nconsider staff attorneys for promotion, which results in a disproportionate number of blacks\n\n[being] ineligible for promotion.\" Id.\n\n       \"A Title VII lawsuit following the EEOC charge is limited in scope to claims that are\n\n'like or reasonably related to the allegations of the charge and growing out of such allegations.'\"\n\nPark v.

Here, the plaintiff prefaced her administrative charge\n\nstating that the conditions to which she was allegedly subjected were \"due to [the] race\n\ncomposition\" of Covington's staff attorneys. Def.'s Mem., Ex. 1 at 2 (June 5, 2008 Charge of\n\nDiscrimination). The Court can easily infer from this language that the plaintiff's administrative\n\ncharge was challenging Covington's policies, which she contends resulted in disproportionate\n\nrepresentation of minorities in staff attorney positions, as she also alleges that attorneys in these\n\npositions \"lack of promotional consideration.\" Id. Although not articulated with precision, this\n\nadministrative complaint was clearly sufficient to put both the EEOC and Covington on notice\n\nthat a disparate-impact charge was being asserted. Def.'s Mem., Ex. 1 at 3 (June 5, 2008 Charge\n\nof Discrimination). While the plaintiff is not correct that her \"[disparate]-impact claim appears\n\nplainly on the face of [her] charge of discrimination,\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 7, her assertion regarding the\n\ndisproportionate racial composition of blacks in staff attorney positions adequately raised the\n\ninference that Covington's policies were driving the racial demographic of attorneys in those\n\npositions, which resulted in the plaintiff being denied certain benefits and promotional\n\n\n\n\n                                                  9\n\fopportunities.

Compl. ¶¶ 124-29; rather, they are discrete – and at least so far as the\n\nnon-promotion policy is concerned, isolated – and therefore should have been assessed\n\nindividually. While the plaintiff alleges that the non-promotion and job-assignment policies\n\ninvolve the same type of racial discrimination, it is readily apparent that Covington's non-\n\npromotion policy did not result in a series of recurring events. See, e.g., Albritton v. Kantor, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1485863\"><a href=\"/opinion/1485863/albritton-v-kantor/\"><span class=\"volume\">944</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.

Indeed, the non-promotion policy was an\n\nisolated act, as compared to the job-assignment policy, because the non-promotion policy\n\nresulted in a final decision that Covington staff attorneys would have no prospect of career\n\nadvancement at the time of its creation. Accordingly, no reassessment of any staff attorney's\n\nposition could breathe new life into the policy and the non-promotion policy is best viewed as a\n\nfacially neutral policy that had its impact on the date of its adoption. Lorance, 490 U.S. at 912.\n\nTherefore, whether the plaintiff can assert her challenges against Covington's job-assignment and\n\nnon-promotion policies on the basis of a continuing violation theory depends upon the individual\n\nnature of the policies and whether each policy, in turn, relates to an adverse employment action\n\nthat occurred within the applicable statute of limitations periods.\n\n                a.      The Plaintiff's Challenge of the Job-Assignment Policy Claim Is Not\n                        Barred by the Statutes of Limitations\n\n        The exact nature of the job-assignment policy being challenged by the plaintiff is unclear,\n\nas she essentially presumes some race-based criteria was employed when she was hired. For\n\ninstance, the plaintiff challenges Covington's \"policies . . .[,] practices[,] and . . . criteria it uses in\n\n\n\n                                                    17\n\fassigning attorneys to positions within the firm,\" and argues that, based \"[o]n information and\n\nbelief, [Covington] relies on job-assignment criteria that are not related to or predictive of job\n\nperformance,\" including \"a combination of law school grades, journal membership, and clerkship\n\nexperience.\" Am. Compl. ¶ 125. The plaintiff bases her conclusion on statistics that she\n\ncompiled, which allegedly indicate that lawyers hired as staff attorneys had credentials and\n\ngraduated from law schools at least as good as or better than those lawyers hired as associates or\n\npartners. Id. ¶¶ 16-17. The plaintiff further maintains that \"it appears that [Covington's] job-\n\nassignment criteria requires that black staff attorneys graduate from higher ranked schools than\n\nits white staff attorneys.\" Id. ¶ 17. Assuming that all of these allegations are true, as the Court\n\nmust at this stage, it is reasonable to infer that Covington's job-assignment policy discriminates\n\nbased on race. Therefore, the issue then becomes whether, as the plaintiff argues, Covington's\n\napplication of its performance evaluation criteria to her employment was an unlawful application\n\nof Covington's discriminatory job-assignment policy.\n\n       It is unclear at this juncture, not only what are Covington's initial job-assignment criteria,\n\nbut whether its subsequent employee performance evaluations assess criteria which replicates\n\nthat criteria used at the time of the initial job-assignment or is discriminatory in some other\n\nmanner. Nonetheless, it is the plaintiff's position that the initial assignment criteria are replicated\n\nbecause \"[e]ach evaluation reinforced and recapitulated the adverse job-assignment criteria and\n\npolicy that Covington used for initial job assignments.\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 11. In fact, it would seem\n\nonly logical to conclude that the initial job-assignment criteria alleged by the plaintiff (i.e. law\n\nschool grades, journal membership, and clerkship experience) is relevant only at the time of the\n\njob-assignment, when an employee's actual job performance and demonstrated skill are merely\n\nspeculative, but lose their importance once actual job performance and demonstrated skill\n\n\n\n\n                                                  18\n\fbecome first known by an employer. However, again at this stage in the case, the benefit of all\n\nreasonable inferences must be construed in favor of the plaintiff and because it is at least\n\nplausible, even if only minimally, that Covington utilized discriminatory criteria as part of its\n\nannual performance evaluations of its attorneys, the plaintiff is entitled to benefit of that doubt.\n\nTherefore, the Court cannot dismiss the plaintiff's disparate-impact claim as untimely because it\n\nis based upon the theory that Covington's initial job-assignment policy was racially\n\ndiscriminatory and that she was subjected to it each time her job performance was evaluated, the\n\nlast evaluation having occurred within the governing status of limitation periods.\n\n                b.      The Plaintiff's Challenge of the Non-Promotion Policy Is Barred by\n                        the Statutes of Limitations\n\n        The plaintiff alleges that Covington's non-promotion policy categorically prohibits the\n\npromotion of staff attorneys. Am. Compl. ¶ 21. Because that categorization does not have\n\nfacially discriminatory implications, it is facially race-neutral; however, it can still be subject to\n\nan actionable discrimination claim if the policy has a \"disparate impact on the basis of race.\" 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-2(k)(1)(A)(i). But, even where a policy or practice has a disparate impact on a\n\nprotected class, \"[a]n employer may defend against liability by demonstrating that the practice is\n\n'job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity.'\" Ricci v.\n\nDeStefano, __ U.S. __, __, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145848\"><a href=\"/opinion/145848/ricci-v-destefano/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This reality does not easily lend itself to the conclusion of continuing racial discrimination\n\nby Covington as the plaintiff alleges here. Asserting futility in the absence of any effort to obtain\n\nanother attorney position at Covington fails to support the existence of a continuing violation\n\nbecause individuals allegedly subject to the policy, such as the plaintiff, must be able to assert\n\n\"that [t]he[y] would have applied but for discrimination and that [t]he[y] would have been\n\ndiscriminatorily rejected had [t]he[y] applied.\" Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 431 U.S. at 368 n.52\n\n(emphasis added). The plaintiff has not met the burden of alleging that she and all similarly\n\nsituated black attorneys would have been rejected because of their race; all the Court can glean\n\nfrom her complaint is that they would have been denied a promotion because they held the\n\npositions of staff attorneys. Accepting the plaintiff's allegations as true, as the Court must\n\n\n\n\n                                                  20\n\fpresume at this stage, she has merely asserted that after the non-promotion policy was instituted\n\nin 2006 the number of black staff attorneys increased in 2007 and 2008, while the number of\n\nblacks in associate, of counsel, or partnership positions decreased in those years and the number\n\nof white attorneys in all three categories experienced little variation. Am. Compl. ¶ 27. The\n\nproblem is that the plaintiff does not allege that any exceptions to the non-promotion policy were\n\nmade for any staff attorney, regardless of race. It would not be reasonable for the Court to infer\n\nfutility under these circumstances, as the doctrine has no appropriate application. Essentially,\n\nwith respect to the non-promotion policy, the plaintiff is asking the Court to infer that because\n\nthere was an increase in the number of black staff attorneys at Covington from 2005 until 2008,\n\nwhile the number of black attorneys did not increase in other attorney positions within the firm,\n\nthat Covington had an ongoing policy that adversely impacted black attorneys. Yet, there is no\n\nallegation that any staff attorney was transferred or promoted to a different attorney position or\n\nthat the number of non-black attorneys in non-staff attorney positions increased; in fact, the\n\nnumber of white non-staff attorneys varies throughout 2006-08 by only one or two in every\n\ncategory except for the position of partner, which actually decreased by three attorneys. Id. The\n\nevidence proffered by the plaintiff therefore fails to support the inference that a continuing\n\nviolation occurred for statute of limitations purposes.\n\n        With respect to the plaintiff's employment specifically, \"[m]ere continuity of\n\nemployment, without more, is insufficient to prolong the life of a cause of action for employment\n\ndiscrimination.\" Delaware State College v. Ricks, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110367\"><a href=\"/opinion/110367/delaware-state-college-v-ricks/\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">250</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257 (1980) (\"It is simply\n\ninsufficient for [the plaintiff] to allege that [the] termination 'gives present effect to the past\n\nillegal act and therefore perpetuates the consequences of forbidden discrimination.'\" (citation\n\nomitted)). In other words, the fact that the plaintiff was employed by Covington during the\n\n\n\n\n                                                   21\n\flimitation periods is insufficient to save her disparate-impact claim based on her non-promotion\n\ncontinuing violation theory. As with the seniority system in Lorance, the proper time within\n\nwhich the plaintiff should have submitted her administrative claim was therefore 300 days after\n\nthe implementation of Covington's non-promotion policy to satisfy statute of limitation of Title\n\nVII and one year to satisfy the statute of limitation of the Human Rights Act. See Lorance, 490\n\nU.S. at 913 (\"With a facially neutral system the discriminatory act occurs only at the time of\n\nadoption, for each application is nondiscriminatory.\"). Nor are Covington's job-assignment and\n\nnon-promotion policies sufficiently related to view them as all part of one overall continuing\n\nscheme designed to discriminate against its black attorneys. Palmer, 17 F.3d at 1496. Whether\n\nblack and non-black attorneys are provided with different work assignments and positions is\n\ndistinguishable from whether staff attorneys as a whole may be transferred or promoted to other\n\nattorney positions at Covington. The fact that the staff attorney position is not a pathway to\n\npartnership is not a discriminatory policy that is reinvigorated each time a new staff attorney is\n\nhired or evaluated. Indeed, the plaintiff continued to work under the non-promotion staff\n\nattorney policy, and she made no complaint within the requisite statutory timeframe after the\n\npolicy was initiated. While her ultimate administrative complaint can be construed as having\n\nraised a disparate-impact claim, to the extent that that claim is based on the non-promotion\n\npolicy, the complaint was untimely. Therefore, to the extent that the plaintiff's disparate-impact\n\nclaim is premised on Covington's non-promotion policy, it is time-barred.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 22\n\fB.      Count VII (Negligent Supervision)\n\n        Despite the plaintiff's contention that the defendant was bound to abide by\n\nantidiscrimination laws in accordance with \"an employer's common law duty to keep the\n\nworkplace safe,\" and that the defendant's failure to keep confidential the plaintiff's allegations\n\nregarding violations of antidiscrimination laws \"could [have] result[ed] in violence,\" Pl.'s Opp'n\n\nat 12, Covington correctly argues that under Griffin v.

The court affirmed the trial court's grant of summary\n\njudgment against the plaintiff, concluding that \"the common law did not recognize an employer's\n\nduty to prevent the sort of sexual harassment alleged.\" Griffin, 925 A.2d at 576. \"To hold\n\notherwise,\" the court held, \"'would be to impose liability on employers for failing to prevent a\n\nharm that is not a cognizable injury under the common law.\" Id. at 577. Accordingly the Griffin\n\ncourt, unless the act manifests itself \"by other actionable wrongful conduct, e.g., assault and\n\nbattery[,] . . . respect for the legislature . . . requires that the rights of a victim of non-physical\n5\n          A cause of action for the common law tort of negligent supervision arises from the employer's breach of\nduty to the employee, classified as:\n\n                 1.

Thus, the Griffin court held that \"a negligent supervision claim cannot be predicated on the\n\n[Human Rights Act].\" 925 A.2d at 577. And again, this Court concludes, the same reasoning\n\nequally applies in the Title VII context.\n\n       Here, the plaintiff predicates her negligent supervision claim precisely on the failure to\n\nabide by Title VII and the Human Rights Act. See Am. Compl. ¶¶ 152-156. Specifically, she\n\nclaims that (1) Covington \"owed [her] a duty to ensure [that] its managers complied with and\n\nenforced federal and local antidiscriminatory law\" id. ¶ 153; (2) her supervisor \"failed to address\n\n[her] complaints of discrimination, failed to take appropriate steps to address the discriminatory\n\nconduct of the employee's [sic] he managed, and failed to protect [the p]laintiff from retaliation\n\nby his subordinates,\" id. ¶ 154; (3) the defendant \"breached its duty to [her] by negligently,\n\nrecklessly, or indifferently supervising [her supervisor's] management of the staff attorneys and\n\ntheir work environment,\" id. ¶ 155; and (4) Covington's \"supervision of or failure to supervise\n\n[her supervisor] directly and proximately caused [her] physical, psychic [sic], reputational, and\n\nmonetary injury,\" id. ¶ 156. The prevention of racial discrimination in the workplace is not a\n\ncommon law duty upon which a claim of negligent supervision may be based. Accord Griffin,\n\n925 A.2d at 576 (\"[T]he common law did not recognize an employer's duty to prevent the sort of\n\nsexual harassment alleged in the appellant's complaint.\"). Therefore, because her complaint does\n\nnot allege that the defendant breached any common law duty, the plaintiff's claim of negligent\n\nsupervision must be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                 24\n\f                                           IV. CONCLUSION\n\n         For foregoing reasons, Covington's motion to dismiss must be granted in part and denied\n\nin part. 6\n\n                                                           _____/s/________________\n                                                           Reggie B.
