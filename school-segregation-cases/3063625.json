The trial court concluded that the County violated Government Code section\n3305 in failing to disclose the memoranda and issued a writ of mandate that, among other\ndirectives, enjoined the County from using the memoranda as a basis for ordering White\nto undergo a medical reevaluation to assess her fitness for duty. The trial court also\nawarded attorney’s fees to White under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. The\nCounty challenges both orders on appeal. We affirm.\n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY2\nI.     White’s Employment as a Senior District Attorney Investigator\n       White was employed as a senior district attorney investigator for the Los Angeles\nCounty District Attorney’s Office (DA) and was assigned to the DA’s Bureau of\nInvestigation in the Major Fraud Section. In that capacity, White was a peace officer\npursuant to Penal Code section 830.1. The essential functions of her position included\npersonally serving arrest warrants, making arrests, interrogating suspects, and booking\nprisoners. During the relevant time period, White’s direct supervisor was Terisa Carver,\n\n\n1     For the sake of convenience, we shall collectively refer to the defendants named in\nWhite’s petition for writ of mandate as “the County.”\n2     White previously filed a petition for writ of mandate against the County, which\nwas the subject of an appeal before Division Three of this court. (White v. County of Los\nAngeles (2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 690 (White I).) A portion of the factual and procedural\nbackground in the present appeal is taken from this prior opinion.\n\n\n                                             2\n\fthe Supervising Investigator in the Major Fraud Section. Carver in turn reported to Kris\nCarter, a Lieutenant in the Major Fraud Section and White’s second-level supervisor.\n       In late 2009, White began experiencing emotional difficulties. She was observed\nby both her supervisors and coworkers acting erratically in the workplace, exhibiting\ndramatic emotional highs and lows. Beginning in April 2010, Carver and Carter\ndocumented their observations and concerns about White’s workplace behavior in a\nseries of confidential memoranda addressed to their superiors—Alan Jarvis, Captain of\nthe Fraud and Corporate Division, and Dominick Rivetti, Chief of the DA’s Bureau of\nInvestigation.3 The memoranda were never placed in White’s personnel file, and she had\nno knowledge of their existence at the time they were prepared by her supervisors and\nsubmitted to upper management at the DA’s Bureau of Investigation.\n       The memoranda set forth specific instances where White had exhibited poor\njudgment or unprofessional conduct in the performance of her job duties. For instance,\nthe memoranda described two incidents where White made poor tactical decisions during\nthe execution of a search warrant by suddenly changing her position without warning to\nher team members, which jeopardized her safety. The memoranda also described an\nincident where White lost her composure and acted unprofessionally while testifying at\ntrial in a criminal case, and was later accused by the defendant’s attorneys of committing\nperjury. In addition, the memoranda detailed many of the personal observations made by\nWhite’s supervisors and coworkers about her behavior. White’s coworkers reported that\nthey had observed her on several occasions crying, shaking uncontrollably, slurring her\nspeech, and appearing to be under the influence of a controlled substance. Carver and\nCarter recounted instances where White reported to work with unexplained physical\ninjuries, exhibited drastic mood swings, and expressed difficulty coping with problems in\n\n\n\n3      These memoranda consisted of the following: (1) an April 21, 2010 memorandum\nfrom Carter to Jarvis, (2) an April 22, 2010 memorandum from Carter to Rivetti, (3) an\nApril 22, 2010 memorandum from Carver to Rivetti, (4) a May 7, 2010 memorandum\nfrom Carter to Rivetti, and (5) a May 31, 2011 memorandum from Carver to Rivetti.\n\n\n                                            3\n\fher personal life. In these memoranda, Carver and Carter advised their superiors that\nthey believed White was experiencing emotional or psychological issues that were\ninterfering with her ability to perform her job duties, and that they were concerned White\ncould pose a risk of harm to herself or others.\n\nII.    The DA’s Efforts to Require White to Appear for a Medical Reevaluation\n       In May 2011, White went on a medical leave of absence under the federal Family\nCare and Medical Leave Act (FMLA; 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.), which grants eligible\nemployees 12 weeks of leave due to a serious health condition that renders the employee\nunable to perform the functions of the job. Upon the expiration of White’s FMLA leave,\nshe was placed on an authorized unpaid medical leave at the request of her treating\nphysician. On September 7, 2011, after White’s physician released her to return to work,\nWhite was placed on a paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation into\nallegations of misconduct. The DA later sought to compel White to submit to a medical\nreevaluation regarding her fitness for duty.\n       Pursuant to Los Angeles County Civil Service Rule 9.07, the DA was required to\nobtain the consent of the Occupational Health Programs (OHP), a division within the\nCounty’s Chief Executive Office, before it could order White to undergo a medical\nreevaluation. On December 7, 2011, George Mueller, Assistant Chief of the Bureau of\nInvestigation, submitted a written request to Dr. Sepideh Souris, Chief of Psychological\nServices at OHP, seeking OHP’s consent for an order compelling White to appear for a\nmedical reevaluation. According to Mueller, beginning in early 2010, he became aware\nof concerns about White’s emotional and psychological condition, including incidents of\nerratic behavior, which he believed affected whether White could safely and effectively\nperform her job duties. Mueller specifically became aware of the memoranda that Carver\nand Carter had submitted to their superiors about White’s behavior. After consulting\nwith Chief Rivetti, Mueller decided to seek a medical reevaluation of White because he\nwas concerned whether White could safely discharge her duties as a peace officer based\non the information he had received. In his request to OHP, Mueller did not attach copies\n\n\n                                               4\n\fof the memoranda prepared by White’s supervisors. However, in a seven-page letter,\nMueller provided a detailed account of White’s workplace behavior over the prior two\nyears, including an almost verbatim description of many of the incidents documented by\nWhite’s supervisors in their memoranda.\n       After reviewing Mueller’s December 7, 2011 letter, Dr. Souris consented to the\nDA’s request for an order compelling White to appear for a medical reevaluation.\nAccording to Dr. Souris, Mueller’s letter detailed the factual basis for the OHP’s decision\nto provide consent for the order. The DA thereafter ordered White to appear for a\nmedical reevaluation scheduled for January 27, 2012, and advised her that if she failed to\nappear, it might be cause for disciplinary action. When White did not appear for the\nappointment, the DA informed her that her failure to appear was an act of insubordination\nthat subjected her to discipline and that her appointment had been rescheduled for\nFebruary 28, 2012. The DA again advised White that a failure to appear might be cause\nfor disciplinary action. White did not, however, intend to appear, believing that the\nmedical reevaluation had been ordered in violation of her rights under the FMLA.\n\nIII.   White Files an Action Under the FMLA Based on the County’s Order for a\n       Medical Reevaluation\n\n       On February 23, 2012, White filed the action in White I, seeking injunctive relief\nor writ of mandate to prohibit the County from requiring her to appear for the medical\nreevaluation, or from disciplining her for failing to appear. White argued that ordering\nher to submit to a medical reevaluation violated her right under the FMLA to be restored\nto employment based solely on her physician’s certification that she was able to return to\nwork. In May 2012, the County filed an opposition to White’s request for a permanent\ninjunction and writ of mandate, and supported its opposition with declarations from\nseveral individuals, including Carver, Carter, Rivetti, and Mueller. The County also\nattached as exhibits to the declarations copies of the memoranda that Carver and Carter\nhad prepared and submitted to their superiors about White’s behavior. Upon receipt of\nthe County’s opposition, White’s counsel provided the documents to White. This was the\n\n\n                                             5\n\ffirst time that White saw the memoranda from her supervisors or became aware of the\nexistence of such documents.\n       The trial court in White I issued a permanent injunction and writ of mandate\nprohibiting the County from requiring a medical reevaluation of White based on her\nconduct prior to September 7, 2011, or from charging White with insubordination for\nfailing to comply with the reevaluation. The trial court also awarded attorney’s fees to\nWhite under the FMLA. The County filed an appeal in White I.\n       In a published decision, the Division Three of this court reversed the judgment and\norder for attorney’s fees in favor of White, and remanded the matter to the trial court with\ndirections to dissolve the injunction, discharge the writ of mandate, and enter judgment in\nfavor of the County. (White I, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 708.) The court held that,\nonce an employee has been returned to work as required by the FMLA, an employer is\nnot prohibited by the FMLA from requiring a medical reevaluation related to the serious\nhealth condition for which the employee was granted FMLA leave. (Id. at p. 701.) The\ncourt concluded that, because White was in fact returned to work and then placed on a\npaid administrative leave, the County did not violate the FMLA in requiring White to\nsubmit to a medical reevaluation regarding her fitness for duty. (Id. at p. 707.)\n\nIV.    White Files The Present Action Under The POBRA Based on the County’s\n       Failure to Disclose Adverse Comments in the Memoranda\n\n       On November 21, 2012, White filed the present action against the County, seeking\na writ of mandate and other relief arising out of the County’s use of the five memoranda\nprepared by Carver and Carter and the December 7, 2011 letter from Mueller to OHP. In\na first amended petition, White alleged that the County’s reliance on the memoranda as a\nbasis for requiring her to submit to a medical reevaluation violated Government Code\nsections 3305, 3306, and 3306.5 because White was never shown the documents or given\nan opportunity to respond to their contents. White sought injunctive relief under\nGovernment Code section 3309.5 and issuance of a writ of mandate under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1085, and specifically requested that the County be ordered to delete\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthe documents from any file used for personnel purposes and to refrain from using any\nadverse comments in the documents for any purpose against her. White also sought\nstatutory penalties for each adverse comment in the documents under Government Code\nsection 3309.5, and requested attorney’s fees under Government Code section 3309.5 and\nCode of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.\n       On October 21, 2013, the County filed an opposition to White’s petition for writ of\nmandate. Among other arguments, the County contended that the only relief afforded\nunder the relevant provisions of the POBRA was the right to obtain disclosure of certain\ndocuments and an opportunity to place responses in the personnel file, and that the\ndocuments at issue in this case were disclosed to White in the prior action and White\nfailed to avail herself of the opportunity to comment on them. The County also argued\nthat the POBRA does not require disclosure of internal confidential communications\namong an employee’s supervisors about the need for the employee to undergo a medical\nreevaluation, and that the documents in this case were not used to determine White’s\nqualifications for employment because OHP, the agency responsible for conducting a\nmedical reevaluation, was never provided with any of the documents.\n       In a supporting declaration, Mueller stated that the memoranda were prepared by\nCarver and Carter as part of their supervisory responsibilities solely “to communicate the\nimportant issue of Ms. White’s psychological status and condition to upper\nmanagement.” Mueller also stated that the memoranda “were used as the factual basis\nfor the DA’s request to [OHP], seeking OHP’s consent for White’s reevaluation,” and\n“were an integral part of the DA’s request.” Mueller asserted that the memoranda were\nnever placed in White’s personnel file, but rather were retained in the “Supervisor’s\nWorking File, which was not used, and was not intended for use, in determining\nMs. White’s qualifications for employment, promotion, additional compensation or\ntermination, or any disciplinary action.”4 Mueller further noted that, since White became\n\n\n\n4      The declarations submitted by Carver, Carter, Rivetti, and Mueller in White I\nsimilarly stated the memoranda were prepared solely for the purpose of communicating\n\n                                             7\n\faware of the memoranda during the prior action, she had not made any request to review\nthe documents or to respond to any comments contained therein.\n      Dr. Souris also submitted a declaration supporting the County’s opposition to the\npetition for writ of mandate. Dr. Souris explained that, in determining whether a peace\nofficer meets the necessary psychological standards of the job position, “OHP considers\nthe department’s request for reevaluation such as that sent by Mr. Mueller as one part of\nits evaluation,” but OHP “makes an independent determination, and it includes the review\nby its own medical professionals.” Dr. Souris also stated that, once a psychological\nreevaluation is completed, OHP “will recommend to the department a variety of possible\nactions,” which “are based solely upon the result of the reevaluation, and may for\ninstance include no action, modification of assignment, or reassignment.” Dr. Souris\nconfirmed that Mueller’s letter requesting consent for a medical reevaluation of White\ndid not include any of the memoranda prepared by her supervisors, and that OHP did not\nreceive or consider such documents in consenting to the reevaluation.\n      On December 3, 2013, the trial court granted White’s petition for writ of mandate.\nThe court concluded that the County had violated Government Code section 3305 in\nfailing to disclose the memoranda to White because the documents contained adverse\ncomments about White’s fitness for duty and were used for personnel purposes when the\nDA requested OHP’s consent to ordering a medical reevaluation for White. The court\nfound that the fact that OHP consents to and conducts the medical reevaluation of an\nemployee did not affect the application of the statute because the DA was the entity\nseeking to require White to submit to a medical reevaluation, and the memoranda formed\nthe factual basis of the DA’s request to OHP for such consent. The court further\nconcluded that White’s available remedies were not limited to reviewing and responding\nto adverse comments in the memoranda within 30 days of their disclosure, and that White\n\nconcerns about White’s psychological condition to superiors within the DA’s Bureau\nof Investigation, and that the memoranda were never used, or intended to be used,\n“to determine Ms. White’s qualifications for employment, promotion, additional\ncompensation, termination, or disciplinary action.”\n\n\n                                            8\n\fwas entitled to seek injunctive relief under Government Code section 3309.5 to remedy\nthe violation and to prevent future violations of a similar nature. The court concluded,\nhowever, that White was not entitled to recover statutory penalties or attorney’s fees\nunder Government Code section 3309.5 because she had not established that the County\nacted with malice in creating and maintaining the memoranda.\n       Based on its findings and conclusions, the trial court issued a peremptory writ of\nmandate that (1) ordered the County to allow White to note her agreement or objection to\nthe comments and memoranda at issue; (2) enjoined the County from requiring White to\nundergo a future medical reevaluation based on the challenged adverse comments and\nmemoranda or White’s responses to them; and (3) enjoined the County from retaliating\nagainst White based on the adverse comments and memoranda or White’s responses to\nthem, unless the responses reflect a danger to White, the County, or members of the\npublic. The court denied White’s request for statutory penalties and attorney’s fees under\nGovernment Code section 3309.5. The court also denied the request for attorney’s fees\nunder Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, but without prejudice to a noticed motion\nfor attorney’s fees being made after judgment was entered.\n       On February 24, 2014, following the entry of judgment, White filed a motion for\nattorney’s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. White sought attorney’s\nfees in the amount of $31,625, asserting that the writ proceeding arose directly from\nWhite’s exercise of her rights under the POBRA, that White had prevailed on the merits\nof the action, and that the trial court’s ruling in the action had conferred a significant\nbenefit on the general public or a large class of persons. On May 13, 2014, the trial court\ngranted White’s motion for attorney’s fees. The court found that the action had enforced\nan important right affecting the public interest because it required interpretation of the\nPOBRA and the Los Angeles County Civil Service Rules regarding the County’s duty to\ndisclose documents that may serve as a basis for affecting a police officer’s employment\nstatus, which was a matter of concern to all peace officers subject to the POBRA or\ndiscipline under the County’s civil service rules. The trial court awarded White $30,845\nin attorney’s fees and $812.50 in costs.\n\n                                               9\n\f       The County filed an appeal from the judgment entered in White’s favor on her\npetition for writ of mandate, and an appeal from the post-judgment order awarding White\nattorney’s fees and costs.5 On July 8, 2014, during the pendency of the appeals, White\nvoluntarily resigned from her employment with the County.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       On appeal, the County challenges the trial court’s order granting White’s petition\nfor writ of mandate, arguing that the County did not violate the POBRA in failing to\ndisclose the memoranda concerning White’s fitness for duty and that the injunctive relief\nordered by the trial court was vague and improper. The County also challenges the trial\ncourt’s order awarding attorney’s fees to White under Code of Civil Procedure section\n1021.5, asserting that White failed to satisfy the criteria for attorney’s fees under the\nstatute and the amount of the award was excessive.\n\nI.     Mootness\n       As a preliminary matter, we address the County’s argument that its appeal from\nthe judgment entered in White’s favor has been rendered moot because White voluntarily\nresigned from her employment with the County while the appeal was pending. The\nCounty has not requested that its appeal be dismissed, but rather urges us to reverse the\njudgment and remand the matter to the trial court with directions to dismiss the action\nfiled by White. White, on the other hand, asserts that the appeal should not be considered\nmoot because the issues raised in the action concern matters of public interest that are\nlikely to recur. White also contends that, if the matter is moot, the proper remedy would\nbe to dismiss the County’s appeal, not the underlying action.\n       As a general rule, an appellate court only decides actual controversies. It is not\nthe function of the appellate court to render opinions “‘“‘upon moot questions or abstract\npropositions, or . . . declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in\n\n\n\n5      At the County’s request, these appeals have been consolidated.\n\n\n                                              10\n\fissue in the case before it.’”’” (Giles v. Horn (2002) 100 Cal.App.4th 206, 227.) “‘“‘It\nnecessarily follows that when, pending an appeal from the judgment of a lower court, and\nwithout any fault of the defendant, an event occurs which renders it impossible for this\ncourt, if it should decide the case in favor of the plaintiff, to grant him any effectual relief\nwhatever, the court will not proceed to a formal judgment, but will dismiss the appeal.’”\n[Citations.]’” (Ibid.; see also Lincoln Place Tenants Assn. v. City of Los Angeles (2007)\n155 Cal.App.4th 425, 454 [“case becomes moot when a court ruling can have no practical\neffect or cannot provide the parties with effective relief”].)\n       The County filed appeals from two separate orders: (1) the judgment entered in\nWhite’s favor on the petition for writ of mandate; and (2) the post-judgment award of\nattorney’s fees to White under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. The trial court\nawarded attorney’s fees to White as the prevailing party in the action, and her subsequent\nresignation does not change that status. Moreover, in reviewing the attorney’s fees\naward, we must address the merits of her writ petition because “‘the propriety of the trial\ncourt’s ruling on the merits of the action determines whether [the plaintiff] was eligible\nfor an award of attorney fees [under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5] as the\nsuccessful party.’” (Indio Police Command Unit Assn. v. City of Indio (2014) 230\nCal.App.4th 521, 534; see also Save Our Residential Environment v. City of West\nHollywood (1992) 9 Cal.App.4th 1745, 1750-1751 [where award of attorney’s fees under\nCode of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 “depends on the propriety of the trial court’s\nruling on the merits of the action, the appeal is not moot”].) In addition, we agree with\nWhite that the question of whether the POBRA requires a law enforcement agency to\ndisclose to a peace officer internal memoranda concerning his or her fitness for duty\nraises an issue of continuing public interest that is likely to recur. (Building a Better\nRedondo, Inc. v. City of Redondo Beach (2012) 203 Cal.App.4th 852, 867 [“[w]hen an\naction involves a matter of continuing public interest that is likely to recur, a court may\nexercise an inherent discretion to resolve that issue, even if an event occurring during the\npendency of the appeal normally would render the matter moot”].)\n\n\n\n                                              11\n\f       However, although we are exercising our discretion to address whether the County\nviolated the POBRA in failing to disclose the challenged memoranda to White, we\ndecline to consider whether the injunctive relief ordered by the trial court to remedy the\nalleged violation was proper. In issuing the writ of mandate, the trial court ordered the\nCounty to allow White to respond to the adverse comments contained in the memoranda,\nenjoined the County from requiring White to undergo a future medical reevaluation based\non the adverse comments in the memoranda or White’s responses to them, and enjoined\nthe County from retaliating against White based on the adverse comments or White’s\nresponses, unless the responses reflected a danger to White, the County, or members of\nthe public. The injunctive relief ordered by the trial court thus related directly to the\nemployment relationship between the County and White going forward. Given that\nWhite is no longer employed by the County, the question of whether the scope of\ninjunctive relief ordered was appropriate has been rendered moot.\n\nII.    Writ of Mandate for Violation of the POBRA\n       A.

Violation of Government Code Section 3305\n       The POBRA provides public safety officers with certain rights concerning their\nemployment, including rights with respect to their personnel files. Government Code\nsection 3305 states, in pertinent part, that “[n]o public safety officer shall have any\ncomment adverse to his interest entered in his personnel file, or any other file used for\nany personnel purposes by his employer, without the public safety officer having first\nread and signed the instrument containing the adverse comment indicating he is aware of\nsuch comment.” Section 3306 provides that “[a] public safety officer shall have 30 days\nwithin which to file a written response to any adverse comment entered in his personnel\nfile,” and that “[s]uch written response shall be attached to, and shall accompany, the\nadverse comment.” Section 3306.5 entitles a public safety officer, upon reasonable\nrequest, “to inspect personnel files that are used or have been used to determine that\nofficer’s qualifications for employment, promotion, additional compensation, or\ntermination or other disciplinary action.”\n       Section 3309.5 of the Government Code sets forth the remedies available to a\npublic safety officer for a violation of one or more of these provisions. Subdivision (c) of\nthe statute provides that “[i]n any case where the superior court finds that a public safety\ndepartment has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, the court shall render\nappropriate injunctive or other extraordinary relief to remedy the violation and to prevent\nfuture violations of a like or similar nature, including, but not limited to, the granting of a\ntemporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction prohibiting\nthe public safety department from taking any punitive action against the public safety\nofficer.” (Gov. Code, § 3309.5, subd. (c).)\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       In County of Riverside v. Superior Court (2002) 27 Cal.4th 793 (Riverside), the\nCalifornia Supreme Court addressed the scope of documents subject to disclosure under\nGovernment Code section 3305. The Court specifically considered whether a law\nenforcement agency must disclose to a probationary peace officer confidential documents\nthat were prepared in the course of a routine background investigation of the officer for\nthe purpose of determining whether to continue his employment. The Court concluded\nthe language of the POBRA should be construed broadly to include any document that\n“‘“may serve as a basis for affecting the status of [a peace officer’s] employment,”’”\nregardless of whether it is kept in a file separate from the officer’s personnel file. (Id. at\np. 802.) In “reject[ing] the assertion that a law enforcement agency’s background\ninvestigation of a peace officer during probationary employment is somehow not a\npersonnel matter subject to the [POBRA],” the Court reasoned that the materials in the\nfile at issue “unquestionably ‘“may serve as a basis for affecting the status of the\nemployee’s employment”’ [citation]; indeed, that is the very purpose of the background\ninvestigation.” (Ibid.) The Court further concluded that where “the adverse comments\narise out of an investigation, the very purpose of which was to assess the employee’s\nqualifications for continued employment, . . . the [POBRA] applies, whether or not the\ncomments are prepared and filed prior to termination.” (Id. at p. 803.)\n       More recently, the California Supreme Court considered the meaning and scope of\nGovernment Code section 3255, a provision in the Firefighters Procedural Bill of Rights\nAct (FBRA; Gov. Code § 3250 et seq.) that is substantially similar to the POBRA\nprovision at issue here.6 (Poole, supra, 61 Cal.4th 1378.) In Poole, the Supreme Court\n\n\n\n6       Government Code section 3255 provides that “[a] firefighter shall not have any\ncomment adverse to his or her interest entered in his or her personnel file, or any other\nfile used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer, without the firefighter\nhaving first read and signed the instrument containing the adverse comment indicating\nhe or she is aware of the comment.” As the Supreme Court observed, this statute “is\nvirtually identical to [the] statute applicable to public safety officers ([Gov. Code,]\n§ 3305), and it establishes rights regarding adverse comments that are very similar\nto those that have been granted to teachers. (Ed. Code, § 44031, subd. (b)(1).)\n\n                                              14\n\faddressed whether Government Code section 3255 provides an employee with “the right\nto review and respond to negative comments in a supervisor’s daily log, consisting of\nnotes that memorialize the supervisor’s thoughts and observations concerning an\nemployee, which the supervisor uses as a memory aid in preparing performance plans\nand reviews.” (Id. at p. 1382.) In that case, the supervisor and author of the daily log\nwas the only person who had access to it. Although the supervisor discussed some of the\nincidents described in the log with his superiors, he did not permit them to review the log\nitself. Additionally, to the extent that the supervisor used any of the adverse comments\ncontained in the log in reviewing the employee’s performance, those comments were\ndisclosed to the employee as part of a performance plan or review before being entered\ninto his personnel file. (Id. at p. 1384.) The question before the Supreme Court was\nwhether “negative comments contained in a document memorializing a supervisor’s own\nthoughts and observations that is not itself made available to or shared with anyone else”\nconstitutes a “file ‘used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer.’” (Ibid.)\n       In construing the scope of Government Code section 3255, the Supreme Court in\nPoole determined that “the Legislature was not concerned with any and all files that\nmight in some sense be connected with personnel matters; the Legislature was, rather,\nspecifically concerned with ‘personnel files that are used or have been used to determine\nth[e] firefighter’s qualifications for employment, promotion, additional compensation, or\ntermination or other disciplinary action.” (Poole, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pp. 1385-1386.)\nThe Court thus concluded that the statutory phrase “‘any other file used for any personnel\npurposes by his or her employer’ . . . should be interpreted to encompass any written or\ncomputerized record that, although not designated a personnel file, . . . may be used by\nthe employer to make decisions about promotion, discipline, compensation, and the like.”\n(Id. at p. 1386.) The Court further concluded that, as recognized in cases applying the\nPOBRA and other similar statutes, “a document containing adverse comments may come\n\n\nConsequently, cases interpreting those statutes are relevant to [the] interpretation\nof [Government Code] section 3255.” (Poole, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1386, fn. 2.)\n\n\n                                             15\n\fwithin the disclosure requirement even if not formally entered into the official personnel\nfile, if the document was either (1) maintained in such a manner that it would be available\nto those making personnel decisions in the future, or (2) was actually used by the\nemployer in making a personnel decision, or both.” (Id. at p. 1387.) Applying this\nstatutory interpretation to the case before it, the Court in Poole held that “because the log\nwas not shared with or available to anyone other than the supervisor who wrote the log, it\ndoes not constitute a file ‘used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer’ and\n[Government Code] section 3255 does not apply.” (Id. at p. 1381.)\n       In reaching its holding in Poole, the Supreme Court found its prior decision in\nMiller v. Chico Unified School Dist. (1979) 24 Cal.3d 703 (Miller) distinguishable. In\nMiller, the Court held that, under Education Code section 44031, a school principal was\nentitled to review and respond to “derogatory written material compiled and maintained\nby a school district even though the material has not been properly placed in his\npersonnel file” because it had been used by the school board in its decision to transfer the\nprincipal to a teaching position. (Id. at p. 707.) The principal’s supervisor had used his\n“‘personal notes and calendar’” to dictate a summary of “‘meetings, contacts,\noccurrences, and events’” involving the principal, which were then transcribed into 20\nmemoranda that were submitted to the school board for its use in deciding whether to\nreassign the principle to a teaching position. (Id. at p. 711.) The school board “received\n[these] confidential memoranda without first allowing [the principal] the opportunity to\ncorrect any inaccurate derogatory information contained therein.” (Id. at p. 714.) The\nCourt in Miller rejected the school board’s argument that these memoranda were never\n“‘entered or filed’” in the principal’s personnel file, concluding that an employer “may\nnot avoid the requirements of the statute by maintaining a ‘personnel file’ for certain\ndocuments relating to an employee,” while “segregating elsewhere under a different\nlabel materials which may serve as a basis for affecting the status of the employee’s\nemployment.” (Id. at pp. 712-713.) In distinguishing Miller, the Court in Poole noted\nthat the adverse comments in Miller were contained in documents available to those\nmaking personnel decisions about the principal. (Poole, supra, at p. 1389.) In contrast,\n\n                                             16\n\fthe supervisor in Poole “did not share his log with anyone; he merely discussed with\nothers some of the incidents that he had observed and also recorded in his log.” (Ibid.)\nBecause “there was no evidence that [the] log would be available to anyone making\npersonnel decisions in the future,” it did not fall within the scope of the statute. (Ibid.)\n       Applying the reasoning in Riverside, Poole, and Miller to the present case, we\nconclude that the memoranda that were prepared by White’s supervisors and submitted to\ntheir superiors regarding their observations and concerns about White’s fitness for duty\nconstituted a file that was “used for any personnel purposes by [the] employer” within the\nmeaning of Government Code section 3305. It is undisputed that the memoranda were\ntransmitted to members of upper management at the DA’s Bureau of Investigation.\nAccordingly, as in Riverside and Miller, the documents were available to individuals with\nthe authority to make personnel decisions about White’s employment status, including\ndecisions about her qualifications for employment, promotion, compensation, and\ndiscipline. It is also undisputed that the memoranda were actually used by management\nin making a formal request to OHP for consent to ordering White to submit to a medical\nreevaluation. Indeed, Mueller specifically stated in his declaration that the memoranda\n“were used as the factual basis for the DA’s request to [OHP]” and “were an integral part\nof the DA’s request.” Dr. Souris likewise stated in a declaration that Mueller’s December\n7, 2011 letter, which summarized the contents of the memoranda, “detail[ed] the factual\nbasis ultimately leading to [Dr. Souris] providing the DA with OHP’s ‘consent’” to order\nWhite’s reevaluation. The fact that Dr. Souris did not receive copies of the memoranda\nwith the DA’s request is not determinative of whether these documents came within the\nscope of Government Code section 3305. The disclosure required by the statute was\ntriggered when White’s supervisors, Carter and Carver, transmitted the memoranda to\nupper management at the Bureau of Investigation, who could then use the memoranda to\nseek consent for ordering a medical reevaluation of White or to make other personnel\ndecisions affecting White’s employment status.\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f       The County argues that the memoranda were not subject to disclosure under\nGovernment Code section 3305 because they were not actually used to determine White’s\nqualifications for employment, promotion, compensation, or disciplinary action, but\nrather were used for the sole purpose of communicating matters of concern about White’s\npsychological condition to upper management. However, the DA based its decision to\nseek a medical reevaluation for White on the information detailed in the memoranda\nabout White’s psychological condition, and as the trial court observed, the results of a\npeace officer’s medical reevaluation can lead to significant changes in his or her\nemployment status. Under the Los Angeles County Civil Service Rules, an employee\nwho is found to be partially or fully incapacitated following a medical reevaluation may\nbe subject to a range of employment actions, including a modification of duties, a change\nof classification or reduction in position, or termination if there is no suitable position\nthat the employee can perform satisfactorily. (L.A. County Civil Service Rules, rule\n9.08.) Because Government Code section 3305 applies to any document that “‘“may\nserve as a basis for affecting the status of [a peace officer’s] employment”’” (Riverside,\nsupra, 27 Cal. 4th at p. 802), White had the right to review and respond to documents that\nformed the basis of the DA’s request for a medical reevaluation.\n       The County also asserts that the memoranda could not have been used to affect\nWhite’s employment status because she failed to comply with the DA’s order to appear\nfor her medical reevaluation. However, even if the reevaluation ordered for White did\nnot result in any change in her employment status due to her refusal to appear, the\nmemoranda would have remained available to upper management at the Bureau of\nInvestigation, and thus, could have been used in future personnel decisions affecting\nWhite’s employment. As the Court of Appeal observed in Sacramento Police Officers\nAssn. v. Venegas (2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 916 (Venegas), “the broad language employed\nby the Legislature in sections 3305 and 3306 does not limit their reach to comments that\nhave resulted in, or will result in, punitive action against an officer. . . . [E]ven though an\nadverse comment does not directly result in punitive action, it has the potential of\ncreating an adverse impression that could influence future personnel decisions concerning\n\n                                              18\n\fan officer, including decisions that do not constitute discipline or punitive action.” (Id. at\np. 926.) Therefore, “regardless of whether the employing agency contemplates or has\nrejected further action regarding an adverse comment made against a peace officer\nemployee, the officer is entitled to disclosure of the comment if it is entered in an\nagency file used for a personnel purpose.” (Ibid.; see also Seligsohn v. Day (2004) 121\nCal.App.4th 518, 530 [in determining whether a document is subject to disclosure under\nGovernment Code section 3305, “what is relevant is not whether the document will serve\nor has served as a basis for disciplinary action but whether it may serve such a\nfunction”].)\n       The County further contends that the memoranda did not fall within the scope of\nGovernment Code section 3305 because the documents were deemed “confidential” and\nmaintained in a separate “Supervisor’s Working File” rather than in White’s personnel\nfile. In support of this claim, the County notes under Government Code section 3303,\nwhich prescribes the protections that apply when a peace officer is subject to certain\nadministrative interrogations, an officer is entitled to “any reports or complaints made\nby investigators or other persons, except those which are deemed by the investigating\nagency to be confidential.” (Gov. Code, § 3303, subd. (g).) However, as the Court of\nAppeal recognized in Venegas, Government Code section 3303, subdivision (g) “does\nnot give [an employer] an absolute right to deem any and all information confidential and\nto assert such confidentiality against any and all requests for access. It applies in the\ncircumstances set forth in [Government Code] section 3303, i.e., with respect to the\ninterrogation of a peace officer under investigation.” (Venegas, supra, 101 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 923.) Because the County did not seek to withhold the memoranda during the\ncourse of an administrative interrogation of White, the confidentiality limitation set forth\nin Government Code section 3303 does not apply. Additionally, the fact that the County\nmaintained the memoranda in a separate file labeled “Supervisor’s Working File” is of no\nimport. As the Supreme Court succinctly stated in Riverside, “the label placed on the . . .\nfile is irrelevant.” (Riverside, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 802; see also Venegas, supra, at\np. 928 [“the law does not permit a law enforcement agency to shield [an adverse]\n\n                                             19\n\fcomment from a peace officer employee by purporting to segregate it from other\npersonnel files”]; Aguilar v. Johnson (1988) 202 Cal.App.3d 241, 251 [“compliance with\nGovernment Code sections 3305 and 3306 is not excused simply because the complaint is\nplaced in a file separate from the personnel file”].) Instead, the relevant inquiry is\nwhether the document “was actually used by the employer in making a personnel\ndecision” or “maintained in such a manner that it would be available to those making\npersonnel decisions in the future.” (Poole, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1387.) Given that the\nmemoranda were prepared for and transmitted to upper management at the DA’s Bureau\nof Investigation, the documents inarguably would be available to those making personnel\ndecisions about White’s employment status in the future.\n       The County claims that, even if the memoranda were subject to disclosure under\nGovernment Code section 3305, White is not entitled to seek any relief under the statute\nbecause she received copies of the memoranda during the course of White I and did not\nfile a response to any adverse comments contained in the documents within 30 days of\nher receipt, as required by Government Code section 3306. This argument is unavailing.\nGovernment Code section 3305 provides an employee with the right to review an adverse\ncomment before that comment is entered into a file used for personnel purposes. (Gov.\nCode, § 3305 [“[n]o public safety officer shall have any comment adverse to his interest\nentered in . . . any other file used for any personnel purposes by his employer, without the\npublic safety officer having first read and signed the instrument containing the adverse\ncomment”]; see also Poole, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1390 [timing requirement in FBRA\nprovision requiring disclosure of adverse comments in file used for personnel purposes\n“is the requirement that the employee have the opportunity to review the adverse\ncomment before it is actually entered into the file”].) In this case, it is undisputed that the\nmemoranda were not disclosed to White before they were placed in the “Supervisor’s\nWorking File,” submitted to upper management at the DA’s Bureau of Investigation,\nor used by the DA as the basis for seeking consent to order a medical reevaluation for\nWhite. As the Supreme Court noted in Riverside, it would “permit an inappropriate end\nrun around the [POBRA]” if a law enforcement agency could withhold disclosure of\n\n                                              20\n\fadverse comments concerning an employee until after those comments were used by the\nagency for personnel purposes. (Riverside, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 803; see also Aguilar\nv. Johnson, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at pp. 250-251 [police chief’s belated compliance with\nGovernment Code sections 3305 and 3306 did not preclude officer from seeking judicial\nrelief based on prior violations of the statutes].) Accordingly, the County’s belated\ndisclosure of the memoranda during the course of White I did not preclude White from\nenforcing her rights under Government Code section 3305 in a court of law.\n       For these reasons, the trial court did not err in concluding that the County violated\nGovernment Code section 3305 in failing to disclose the memoranda to White, and that\nWhite was entitled to seek judicial relief under Government Code section 3309.5 based\non the County’s POBRA violation.\n\nIII.   Attorney’s Fees Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5\n       A.     Standard of Review\n       An award of attorney’s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5\ngenerally is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion. (Indio Police Command Unit\nAssn. v. City of Indio, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th at p. 541.) “‘[W]ith respect to the amount\nof fees awarded, there is no question our review must be highly deferential to the views\nof the trial court.’ [Citations.]” (Concepcion v. Amscan Holdings, Inc. (2014) 223\nCal.App.4th 1309, 1309.) As our Supreme Court has observed, “‘[t]he “experienced trial\njudge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court, and\nwhile his [or her] judgment is of course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless\nthe appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong” -- meaning that it abused its\ndiscretion. [Citations.]’” (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) 22 Cal.4th 1084, 1095.)\n\n       B.     Statutory Criteria for an Attorney’s Fee Award\n       Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 provides in relevant part: “Upon motion,\na court may award attorneys’ fees to a successful party against one or more opposing\nparties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right\naffecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or\n\n                                              21\n\fnonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the\nnecessity and financial burden of private enforcement, or of enforcement by one public\nentity against another public entity, are such as to make the award appropriate, and\n(c) such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any.”\n       Accordingly, “‘[t]o obtain attorney fees under [Code of Civil Procedure] section\n1021.5, the party seeking fees must show that the litigation: “‘“‘(1) served to vindicate an\nimportant public right; (2) conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large\nclass of persons; and (3) [was necessary and] imposed a financial burden on plaintiffs\nwhich was out of proportion to their individual stake in the matter.’ [Citation.]”\n[Citation.]’” [Citations.] Because the statute states the criteria in the conjunctive, each\nmust be satisfied to justify a fee award. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (City of Maywood v.\nLos Angeles Unified School Dist. (2012) 208 Cal.App.4th 362, 429.)\n       With respect to the first element, the California Supreme Court has recognized that\nthe enforcement of procedural rights in the POBRA serves to vindicate an important right\naffecting the public interest. (Baggett v. Gates (1982) 32 Cal.3d 128, 143 (Baggett).) In\nBaggett, four police officers sued the City of Los Angeles and its police chief because\nthey had been reassigned to lower paying positions after an internal investigation into\nalleged misconduct without being given an opportunity for an administrative appeal.\n(Id. at p. 133.) The Supreme Court held that Government Code sections 3303 and 3304\nprovide a right to an administrative appeal to police officers who are reassigned to lower\npaying positions, and the officers who sued to enforce that right were entitled to an award\nof attorney’s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. (Id. at pp. 141-143.) In\nconsidering whether the officer’s action had resulted in the enforcement of an important\npublic right, the Court specifically concluded: “Plaintiffs’ action resulted in securing for\nthemselves and many others the basic rights and protections of the [POBRA]. . . . [T]hese\nrights and protections are matters of statewide concern. It follows that the rights\nvindicated by plaintiffs are sufficiently ‘important’ to justify an attorney fee award.”\n(Id. at p. 143.) Cases following Baggett have similarly concluded that lawsuits enforcing\nprocedural rights in the POBRA enforce important public rights for purposes of awarding\n\n                                              22\n\fattorney’s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. (See, e.g., Robinson v.\nChowchilla (2011) 202 Cal.App.4th 382, 395-396 [enforcement of right to administrative\nappeal prior to punitive action under Government Code section 3304]; Otto v. Los\nAngeles Unified School District (2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 328, 335-336 [same]; Aguilar v.\nJohnson, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 253 [enforcement of right to review and respond to\ncitizen complaints placed in personnel file under Government Code sections 3305 and\n3306]; Riverside Sheriffs’ Assn. v. County of Riverside (2007) 152 Cal.App.4th 414, 422\n[enforcement of procedural protections afforded during interrogation under Government\nCode section 3303]; Mounger v. Gates (1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 1248, 1259 [same].)\n       With respect to the second element, the Supreme Court in Baggett concluded that\nan action to enforce procedural rights under the POBRA also confers a significant benefit\non the general public by helping “to maintain stable relations between peace officers and\ntheir employers and thus to assure effective law enforcement. . . .” (Baggett, supra, 32\nCal.3d at p. 143.) Following Baggett, courts repeatedly have recognized that a significant\nbenefit is conferred on the general public or a large group of persons when the procedural\nprotections contained in the POBRA are enforced. (See, e.g., Robinson v. Chowchilla,\nsupra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 399; Riverside Sheriffs’ Assn. v. County of Riverside, supra,\n152 Cal.App.4th at p. 422; Otto v. Los Angeles Unified School District, supra, 106\nCal.App.4th at pp. 335-336; Aguilar v. Johnson, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 253;\nMounger v. Gates, supra, 193 Cal.App.3d at p. 1259.) Indeed, “‘“[t]he rights and\nprotections afforded by [POBRA] benefit not only public safety officers but the public in\ngeneral. By promoting stable employer-employee relations, [POBRA] fosters a solid and\nsecure public safety work force. [Citation.] It also encourages peace officer cooperation\nin investigations of possible wrongdoing. [Citation.] Alleged violations of [POBRA]\ntherefore implicate duties ‘which inure[] to the benefit of the public at large’ [citation],\ntranscending the employer-employee relationship….” [Citation.]’ [Citations.]”\n(Riverside Sheriffs’ Assn. v. County of Riverside, supra, at p. 422.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\f       With respect to the third element regarding the necessity and financial burden of\nprivate enforcement, the Supreme Court in Baggett stated: “[T]he record before this\ncourt indicates that the financial burden this suit placed on plaintiffs was out of\nproportion to their personal stake in the case. By their action, plaintiffs have secured the\nenforcement of basic procedural rights, . . . However, enforcement of these procedural\nrights may well not result in any pecuniary benefit to plaintiffs themselves. [Citation.]. . .\n[¶] This court is satisfied that plaintiffs’ action meets the requirements of section 1021.5\nof the Code of Civil Procedure.” (Baggett, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 143.) Other courts\nhave likewise held that a plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees for enforcing procedural\nrights under the POBRA where the cost of prevailing in the action ultimately transcends\nthe plaintiff’s personal interest in the litigation. (See, e.g., Riverside Sheriffs’ Assn. v.\nCounty of Riverside, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at pp. 422-433; Otto v. Los Angeles Unified\nSchool District, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at pp. 335-336; Henneberque v. City of Culver\nCity (1985) 172 Cal.App.3d 837, 846-847.)\n       In this case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\ndetermining that White was entitled to an award of attorney’s fees under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1021.5. White’s action to enforce the procedural rights afforded to\npeace officers under the POBRA to review and respond to adverse comments in\npersonnel records served to vindicate an important right affecting the public interest and\nconferred a significant benefit on a large group of persons. Throughout the litigation, the\nCounty maintained that internal memoranda shared among management about a peace\nofficer’s fitness for duty were not subject to disclosure under the POBRA so long as\nthe documents were marked confidential and kept in a separate file from the officer’s\npersonnel file. While the trial court’s ruling that such materials must be disclosed under\nthe POBRA conferred a direct non-pecuniary personal benefit on White, the outcome of\nthe litigation also benefits other peace officers who may be the subject of similar internal\ndocuments containing adverse comments about the officers’ fitness for duty.\n\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\f       Additionally, the trial court reasonably could find that the cost of litigating the\naction to a successful conclusion transcended White’s personal interest in the matter. The\nquestion of whether the County could order White to submit to a medical reevaluation\nbased on the documented concerns about her fitness for duty has now been the subject of\ntwo writ proceedings filed by White and two appeals filed by the County. Although\nWhite successfully enforced the basic procedural rights guaranteed under Government\nCode sections 3305 and 3306 by prosecuting the present action and obtaining injunctive\nrelief, she did not secure any direct pecuniary benefit for herself through such\nenforcement, as her request for statutory penalties under the POBRA was denied. On this\nrecord, the trial court reasonably concluded that White satisfied each of the enumerated\ncriteria in Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and thus, was entitled to an attorney’s\nfee award.\n       In arguing that the trial court erred in awarding attorney’s fees, the County asserts\nthat the litigation did not result in any novel interpretation of the POBRA that could\nbenefit the public at large, but rather in the application of an already existing right under\nGovernment Code section 3305 to documents pertaining to White. However, “‘[t]he fact\nthat litigation enforces existing rights does not mean that a substantial benefit to the\npublic cannot result. Attorney fees have consistently been awarded for the enforcement\nof well-defined, existing obligations. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Otto v. Los Angeles\nUnified School District, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at p. 335.) Because the County\nvigorously denied that the documents were subject to disclosure under Government Code\nsection 3305, White had to file suit to enforce her rights under the statute, which justified\nan attorney’s fee award. (Riverside Sheriffs’ Assn. v. County of Riverside, supra, 152\nCal.App.4th at p. 422.) The County also contends that an award of attorney’s fees was\nnot warranted because the primary effect of the litigation was the vindication of White’s\nown personal rights and economic interests. However, “where each of the criteria is met,\nthe fact the primary effect of the action was to vindicate a plaintiff’s personal economic\ninterests does not foreclose an award of attorney fees” under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1021.5. (Robinson v. Chowchilla, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 399.) In this case,\n\n                                              25\n\fWhite satisfied each of the statutory criteria and there were no special circumstances\nrendering an award of attorney’s fees unjust. (Id. at p. 391 [“attorney fees must be\nawarded when the statutory criteria are met unless special circumstances render such an\naward unjust”].) As the prevailing party in the action, White was therefore entitled to an\nattorney’s fee award under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.\n\n       C.     Amount of Attorney’s Fee Award\n       The County also challenges the amount of attorney’s fees awarded by the trial\ncourt on the ground that White’s request for attorney’s fees was excessive and duplicative\nof work that was performed in litigating the prior action in White I. We see no abuse of\ndiscretion in the trial court’s determination of the attorney’s fee award. The trial court\nawarded White $30,845 in attorney’s fees based on the lodestar method, which was\nslightly less than the amount of fees requested by White. In support of the motion for\nattorney’s fees, White’s counsel submitted a declaration stating that she had reviewed the\nattached attorney’s fees bills, and that “[a]ll the time reflected on the attached bills was\nspent in connection with the present litigation only.” While the County speculates that\nWhite’s attorneys should have spent less time on discovery given the factual similarities\nbetween the present action and White I, the County has failed to demonstrate that the\namount of time expended was unreasonable. The record further reflects that the trial\ncourt carefully reviewed the bills submitted by White’s counsel, reduced the amount\nrequested by $780 for attorney conferences that appeared to be duplicative, and then\ndetermined that, apart from that single reduction, the hourly rates requested and total\nnumber of hours expended were reasonable and necessary. The trial court’s award of\nattorney’s fees based on the hours reasonably spent by White’s attorneys in litigating the\naction to a successful conclusion did not constitute an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n\n      The judgment is affirmed.

The trial court concluded that the County violated Government Code section\n3305 in failing to disclose the memoranda and issued a writ of mandate that, among other\ndirectives, enjoined the County from using the memoranda as a basis for ordering White\nto undergo a medical reevaluation to assess her fitness for duty. The trial court also\nawarded attorney’s fees to White under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. The\nCounty challenges both orders on appeal. We affirm.\n\n           FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY2\nI.     White’s Employment as a Senior District Attorney Investigator\n       White was employed as a senior district attorney investigator for the Los Angeles\nCounty District Attorney’s Office (DA) and was assigned to the DA’s Bureau of\nInvestigation in the Major Fraud Section. In that capacity, White was a peace officer\npursuant to Penal Code section 830.1. The essential functions of her position included\npersonally serving arrest warrants, making arrests, interrogating suspects, and booking\nprisoners. During the relevant time period, White’s direct supervisor was Terisa Carver,\n\n\n1     For the sake of convenience, we shall collectively refer to the defendants named in\nWhite’s petition for writ of mandate as “the County.”\n2     White previously filed a petition for writ of mandate against the County, which\nwas the subject of an appeal before Division Three of this court. (White v. County of Los\nAngeles (2014) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">225</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (White I).) A portion of the factual and procedural\nbackground in the present appeal is taken from this prior opinion.\n\n\n                                             2\n\fthe Supervising Investigator in the Major Fraud Section. Carver in turn reported to Kris\nCarter, a Lieutenant in the Major Fraud Section and White’s second-level supervisor.\n       In late 2009, White began experiencing emotional difficulties. She was observed\nby both her supervisors and coworkers acting erratically in the workplace, exhibiting\ndramatic emotional highs and lows. Beginning in April 2010, Carver and Carter\ndocumented their observations and concerns about White’s workplace behavior in a\nseries of confidential memoranda addressed to their superiors—Alan Jarvis, Captain of\nthe Fraud and Corporate Division, and Dominick Rivetti, Chief of the DA’s Bureau of\nInvestigation.3 The memoranda were never placed in White’s personnel file, and she had\nno knowledge of their existence at the time they were prepared by her supervisors and\nsubmitted to upper management at the DA’s Bureau of Investigation.\n       The memoranda set forth specific instances where White had exhibited poor\njudgment or unprofessional conduct in the performance of her job duties. For instance,\nthe memoranda described two incidents where White made poor tactical decisions during\nthe execution of a search warrant by suddenly changing her position without warning to\nher team members, which jeopardized her safety. The memoranda also described an\nincident where White lost her composure and acted unprofessionally while testifying at\ntrial in a criminal case, and was later accused by the defendant’s attorneys of committing\nperjury. In addition, the memoranda detailed many of the personal observations made by\nWhite’s supervisors and coworkers about her behavior. White’s coworkers reported that\nthey had observed her on several occasions crying, shaking uncontrollably, slurring her\nspeech, and appearing to be under the influence of a controlled substance. Carver and\nCarter recounted instances where White reported to work with unexplained physical\ninjuries, exhibited drastic mood swings, and expressed difficulty coping with problems in\n\n\n\n3      These memoranda consisted of the following: (1) an April 21, 2010 memorandum\nfrom Carter to Jarvis, (2) an April 22, 2010 memorandum from Carter to Rivetti, (3) an\nApril 22, 2010 memorandum from Carver to Rivetti, (4) a May 7, 2010 memorandum\nfrom Carter to Rivetti, and (5) a May 31, 2011 memorandum from Carver to Rivetti.\n\n\n                                            3\n\fher personal life. In these memoranda, Carver and Carter advised their superiors that\nthey believed White was experiencing emotional or psychological issues that were\ninterfering with her ability to perform her job duties, and that they were concerned White\ncould pose a risk of harm to herself or others.\n\nII.    The DA’s Efforts to Require White to Appear for a Medical Reevaluation\n       In May 2011, White went on a medical leave of absence under the federal Family\nCare and Medical Leave Act (FMLA; 29 U.S.C. § 2601 et seq.), which grants eligible\nemployees 12 weeks of leave due to a serious health condition that renders the employee\nunable to perform the functions of the job. Upon the expiration of White’s FMLA leave,\nshe was placed on an authorized unpaid medical leave at the request of her treating\nphysician. On September 7, 2011, after White’s physician released her to return to work,\nWhite was placed on a paid administrative leave pending an internal investigation into\nallegations of misconduct. The DA later sought to compel White to submit to a medical\nreevaluation regarding her fitness for duty.\n       Pursuant to Los Angeles County Civil Service Rule 9.07, the DA was required to\nobtain the consent of the Occupational Health Programs (OHP), a division within the\nCounty’s Chief Executive Office, before it could order White to undergo a medical\nreevaluation. On December 7, 2011, George Mueller, Assistant Chief of the Bureau of\nInvestigation, submitted a written request to Dr. Sepideh Souris, Chief of Psychological\nServices at OHP, seeking OHP’s consent for an order compelling White to appear for a\nmedical reevaluation. According to Mueller, beginning in early 2010, he became aware\nof concerns about White’s emotional and psychological condition, including incidents of\nerratic behavior, which he believed affected whether White could safely and effectively\nperform her job duties. Mueller specifically became aware of the memoranda that Carver\nand Carter had submitted to their superiors about White’s behavior. After consulting\nwith Chief Rivetti, Mueller decided to seek a medical reevaluation of White because he\nwas concerned whether White could safely discharge her duties as a peace officer based\non the information he had received. In his request to OHP, Mueller did not attach copies\n\n\n                                               4\n\fof the memoranda prepared by White’s supervisors. However, in a seven-page letter,\nMueller provided a detailed account of White’s workplace behavior over the prior two\nyears, including an almost verbatim description of many of the incidents documented by\nWhite’s supervisors in their memoranda.\n       After reviewing Mueller’s December 7, 2011 letter, Dr. Souris consented to the\nDA’s request for an order compelling White to appear for a medical reevaluation.\nAccording to Dr. Souris, Mueller’s letter detailed the factual basis for the OHP’s decision\nto provide consent for the order. The DA thereafter ordered White to appear for a\nmedical reevaluation scheduled for January 27, 2012, and advised her that if she failed to\nappear, it might be cause for disciplinary action. When White did not appear for the\nappointment, the DA informed her that her failure to appear was an act of insubordination\nthat subjected her to discipline and that her appointment had been rescheduled for\nFebruary 28, 2012. The DA again advised White that a failure to appear might be cause\nfor disciplinary action. White did not, however, intend to appear, believing that the\nmedical reevaluation had been ordered in violation of her rights under the FMLA.\n\nIII.   White Files an Action Under the FMLA Based on the County’s Order for a\n       Medical Reevaluation\n\n       On February 23, 2012, White filed the action in White I, seeking injunctive relief\nor writ of mandate to prohibit the County from requiring her to appear for the medical\nreevaluation, or from disciplining her for failing to appear. White argued that ordering\nher to submit to a medical reevaluation violated her right under the FMLA to be restored\nto employment based solely on her physician’s certification that she was able to return to\nwork. In May 2012, the County filed an opposition to White’s request for a permanent\ninjunction and writ of mandate, and supported its opposition with declarations from\nseveral individuals, including Carver, Carter, Rivetti, and Mueller. The County also\nattached as exhibits to the declarations copies of the memoranda that Carver and Carter\nhad prepared and submitted to their superiors about White’s behavior. Upon receipt of\nthe County’s opposition, White’s counsel provided the documents to White. This was the\n\n\n                                             5\n\ffirst time that White saw the memoranda from her supervisors or became aware of the\nexistence of such documents.\n       The trial court in White I issued a permanent injunction and writ of mandate\nprohibiting the County from requiring a medical reevaluation of White based on her\nconduct prior to September 7, 2011, or from charging White with insubordination for\nfailing to comply with the reevaluation. The trial court also awarded attorney’s fees to\nWhite under the FMLA. The County filed an appeal in White I.\n       In a published decision, the Division Three of this court reversed the judgment and\norder for attorney’s fees in favor of White, and remanded the matter to the trial court with\ndirections to dissolve the injunction, discharge the writ of mandate, and enter judgment in\nfavor of the County. (White I, supra, 225 Cal.App.4th at p. 708.) The court held that,\nonce an employee has been returned to work as required by the FMLA, an employer is\nnot prohibited by the FMLA from requiring a medical reevaluation related to the serious\nhealth condition for which the employee was granted FMLA leave. (Id. at p. 701.) The\ncourt concluded that, because White was in fact returned to work and then placed on a\npaid administrative leave, the County did not violate the FMLA in requiring White to\nsubmit to a medical reevaluation regarding her fitness for duty. (Id. at p. 707.)\n\nIV.    White Files The Present Action Under The POBRA Based on the County’s\n       Failure to Disclose Adverse Comments in the Memoranda\n\n       On November 21, 2012, White filed the present action against the County, seeking\na writ of mandate and other relief arising out of the County’s use of the five memoranda\nprepared by Carver and Carter and the December 7, 2011 letter from Mueller to OHP. In\na first amended petition, White alleged that the County’s reliance on the memoranda as a\nbasis for requiring her to submit to a medical reevaluation violated Government Code\nsections 3305, 3306, and 3306.5 because White was never shown the documents or given\nan opportunity to respond to their contents. White sought injunctive relief under\nGovernment Code section 3309.5 and issuance of a writ of mandate under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1085, and specifically requested that the County be ordered to delete\n\n\n                                             6\n\fthe documents from any file used for personnel purposes and to refrain from using any\nadverse comments in the documents for any purpose against her. White also sought\nstatutory penalties for each adverse comment in the documents under Government Code\nsection 3309.5, and requested attorney’s fees under Government Code section 3309.5 and\nCode of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.\n       On October 21, 2013, the County filed an opposition to White’s petition for writ of\nmandate. Among other arguments, the County contended that the only relief afforded\nunder the relevant provisions of the POBRA was the right to obtain disclosure of certain\ndocuments and an opportunity to place responses in the personnel file, and that the\ndocuments at issue in this case were disclosed to White in the prior action and White\nfailed to avail herself of the opportunity to comment on them. The County also argued\nthat the POBRA does not require disclosure of internal confidential communications\namong an employee’s supervisors about the need for the employee to undergo a medical\nreevaluation, and that the documents in this case were not used to determine White’s\nqualifications for employment because OHP, the agency responsible for conducting a\nmedical reevaluation, was never provided with any of the documents.\n       In a supporting declaration, Mueller stated that the memoranda were prepared by\nCarver and Carter as part of their supervisory responsibilities solely “to communicate the\nimportant issue of Ms. White’s psychological status and condition to upper\nmanagement.” Mueller also stated that the memoranda “were used as the factual basis\nfor the DA’s request to [OHP], seeking OHP’s consent for White’s reevaluation,” and\n“were an integral part of the DA’s request.” Mueller asserted that the memoranda were\nnever placed in White’s personnel file, but rather were retained in the “Supervisor’s\nWorking File, which was not used, and was not intended for use, in determining\nMs. White’s qualifications for employment, promotion, additional compensation or\ntermination, or any disciplinary action.”4 Mueller further noted that, since White became\n\n\n\n4      The declarations submitted by Carver, Carter, Rivetti, and Mueller in White I\nsimilarly stated the memoranda were prepared solely for the purpose of communicating\n\n                                             7\n\faware of the memoranda during the prior action, she had not made any request to review\nthe documents or to respond to any comments contained therein.\n      Dr. Souris also submitted a declaration supporting the County’s opposition to the\npetition for writ of mandate. Dr. Souris explained that, in determining whether a peace\nofficer meets the necessary psychological standards of the job position, “OHP considers\nthe department’s request for reevaluation such as that sent by Mr. Mueller as one part of\nits evaluation,” but OHP “makes an independent determination, and it includes the review\nby its own medical professionals.” Dr. Souris also stated that, once a psychological\nreevaluation is completed, OHP “will recommend to the department a variety of possible\nactions,” which “are based solely upon the result of the reevaluation, and may for\ninstance include no action, modification of assignment, or reassignment.” Dr. Souris\nconfirmed that Mueller’s letter requesting consent for a medical reevaluation of White\ndid not include any of the memoranda prepared by her supervisors, and that OHP did not\nreceive or consider such documents in consenting to the reevaluation.\n      On December 3, 2013, the trial court granted White’s petition for writ of mandate.\nThe court concluded that the County had violated Government Code section 3305 in\nfailing to disclose the memoranda to White because the documents contained adverse\ncomments about White’s fitness for duty and were used for personnel purposes when the\nDA requested OHP’s consent to ordering a medical reevaluation for White. The court\nfound that the fact that OHP consents to and conducts the medical reevaluation of an\nemployee did not affect the application of the statute because the DA was the entity\nseeking to require White to submit to a medical reevaluation, and the memoranda formed\nthe factual basis of the DA’s request to OHP for such consent. The court further\nconcluded that White’s available remedies were not limited to reviewing and responding\nto adverse comments in the memoranda within 30 days of their disclosure, and that White\n\nconcerns about White’s psychological condition to superiors within the DA’s Bureau\nof Investigation, and that the memoranda were never used, or intended to be used,\n“to determine Ms. White’s qualifications for employment, promotion, additional\ncompensation, termination, or disciplinary action.”\n\n\n                                            8\n\fwas entitled to seek injunctive relief under Government Code section 3309.5 to remedy\nthe violation and to prevent future violations of a similar nature. The court concluded,\nhowever, that White was not entitled to recover statutory penalties or attorney’s fees\nunder Government Code section 3309.5 because she had not established that the County\nacted with malice in creating and maintaining the memoranda.\n       Based on its findings and conclusions, the trial court issued a peremptory writ of\nmandate that (1) ordered the County to allow White to note her agreement or objection to\nthe comments and memoranda at issue; (2) enjoined the County from requiring White to\nundergo a future medical reevaluation based on the challenged adverse comments and\nmemoranda or White’s responses to them; and (3) enjoined the County from retaliating\nagainst White based on the adverse comments and memoranda or White’s responses to\nthem, unless the responses reflect a danger to White, the County, or members of the\npublic. The court denied White’s request for statutory penalties and attorney’s fees under\nGovernment Code section 3309.5. The court also denied the request for attorney’s fees\nunder Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, but without prejudice to a noticed motion\nfor attorney’s fees being made after judgment was entered.\n       On February 24, 2014, following the entry of judgment, White filed a motion for\nattorney’s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. White sought attorney’s\nfees in the amount of $31,625, asserting that the writ proceeding arose directly from\nWhite’s exercise of her rights under the POBRA, that White had prevailed on the merits\nof the action, and that the trial court’s ruling in the action had conferred a significant\nbenefit on the general public or a large class of persons. On May 13, 2014, the trial court\ngranted White’s motion for attorney’s fees. The court found that the action had enforced\nan important right affecting the public interest because it required interpretation of the\nPOBRA and the Los Angeles County Civil Service Rules regarding the County’s duty to\ndisclose documents that may serve as a basis for affecting a police officer’s employment\nstatus, which was a matter of concern to all peace officers subject to the POBRA or\ndiscipline under the County’s civil service rules. The trial court awarded White $30,845\nin attorney’s fees and $812.50 in costs.\n\n                                               9\n\f       The County filed an appeal from the judgment entered in White’s favor on her\npetition for writ of mandate, and an appeal from the post-judgment order awarding White\nattorney’s fees and costs.5 On July 8, 2014, during the pendency of the appeals, White\nvoluntarily resigned from her employment with the County.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n       On appeal, the County challenges the trial court’s order granting White’s petition\nfor writ of mandate, arguing that the County did not violate the POBRA in failing to\ndisclose the memoranda concerning White’s fitness for duty and that the injunctive relief\nordered by the trial court was vague and improper. The County also challenges the trial\ncourt’s order awarding attorney’s fees to White under Code of Civil Procedure section\n1021.5, asserting that White failed to satisfy the criteria for attorney’s fees under the\nstatute and the amount of the award was excessive.\n\nI.     Mootness\n       As a preliminary matter, we address the County’s argument that its appeal from\nthe judgment entered in White’s favor has been rendered moot because White voluntarily\nresigned from her employment with the County while the appeal was pending. The\nCounty has not requested that its appeal be dismissed, but rather urges us to reverse the\njudgment and remand the matter to the trial court with directions to dismiss the action\nfiled by White. White, on the other hand, asserts that the appeal should not be considered\nmoot because the issues raised in the action concern matters of public interest that are\nlikely to recur. White also contends that, if the matter is moot, the proper remedy would\nbe to dismiss the County’s appeal, not the underlying action.\n       As a general rule, an appellate court only decides actual controversies. It is not\nthe function of the appellate court to render opinions “‘“‘upon moot questions or abstract\npropositions, or . . . declare principles or rules of law which cannot affect the matter in\n\n\n\n5      At the County’s request, these appeals have been consolidated.\n\n\n                                              10\n\fissue in the case before it.’”’” (Giles v.

The trial court\nawarded attorney’s fees to White as the prevailing party in the action, and her subsequent\nresignation does not change that status. Moreover, in reviewing the attorney’s fees\naward, we must address the merits of her writ petition because “‘the propriety of the trial\ncourt’s ruling on the merits of the action determines whether [the plaintiff] was eligible\nfor an award of attorney fees [under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5] as the\nsuccessful party.’” (Indio Police Command Unit Assn. v.

Violation of Government Code Section 3305\n       The POBRA provides public safety officers with certain rights concerning their\nemployment, including rights with respect to their personnel files. Government Code\nsection 3305 states, in pertinent part, that “[n]o public safety officer shall have any\ncomment adverse to his interest entered in his personnel file, or any other file used for\nany personnel purposes by his employer, without the public safety officer having first\nread and signed the instrument containing the adverse comment indicating he is aware of\nsuch comment.” Section 3306 provides that “[a] public safety officer shall have 30 days\nwithin which to file a written response to any adverse comment entered in his personnel\nfile,” and that “[s]uch written response shall be attached to, and shall accompany, the\nadverse comment.” Section 3306.5 entitles a public safety officer, upon reasonable\nrequest, “to inspect personnel files that are used or have been used to determine that\nofficer’s qualifications for employment, promotion, additional compensation, or\ntermination or other disciplinary action.”\n       Section 3309.5 of the Government Code sets forth the remedies available to a\npublic safety officer for a violation of one or more of these provisions. Subdivision (c) of\nthe statute provides that “[i]n any case where the superior court finds that a public safety\ndepartment has violated any of the provisions of this chapter, the court shall render\nappropriate injunctive or other extraordinary relief to remedy the violation and to prevent\nfuture violations of a like or similar nature, including, but not limited to, the granting of a\ntemporary restraining order, preliminary injunction, or permanent injunction prohibiting\nthe public safety department from taking any punitive action against the public safety\nofficer.” (Gov. Code, § 3309.5, subd. (c).)\n\n\n\n\n                                              13\n\f       In County of Riverside v. Superior Court (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2639300\"><a href=\"/opinion/2639300/county-of-riverside-v-superior-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">27</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Riverside), the\nCalifornia Supreme Court addressed the scope of documents subject to disclosure under\nGovernment Code section 3305. The Court specifically considered whether a law\nenforcement agency must disclose to a probationary peace officer confidential documents\nthat were prepared in the course of a routine background investigation of the officer for\nthe purpose of determining whether to continue his employment. The Court concluded\nthe language of the POBRA should be construed broadly to include any document that\n“‘“may serve as a basis for affecting the status of [a peace officer’s] employment,”’”\nregardless of whether it is kept in a file separate from the officer’s personnel file. (Id. at\np. 802.) In “reject[ing] the assertion that a law enforcement agency’s background\ninvestigation of a peace officer during probationary employment is somehow not a\npersonnel matter subject to the [POBRA],” the Court reasoned that the materials in the\nfile at issue “unquestionably ‘“may serve as a basis for affecting the status of the\nemployee’s employment”’ [citation]; indeed, that is the very purpose of the background\ninvestigation.” (Ibid.) The Court further concluded that where “the adverse comments\narise out of an investigation, the very purpose of which was to assess the employee’s\nqualifications for continued employment, . . . the [POBRA] applies, whether or not the\ncomments are prepared and filed prior to termination.” (Id. at p. 803.)\n       More recently, the California Supreme Court considered the meaning and scope of\nGovernment Code section 3255, a provision in the Firefighters Procedural Bill of Rights\nAct (FBRA; Gov. Code § 3250 et seq.) that is substantially similar to the POBRA\nprovision at issue here.6 (Poole, supra, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">61</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1378</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">.) In Poole, the Supreme Court\n\n\n\n6       Government Code section 3255 provides that “[a] firefighter shall not have any\ncomment adverse to his or her interest entered in his or her personnel file, or any other\nfile used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer, without the firefighter\nhaving first read and signed the instrument containing the adverse comment indicating\nhe or she is aware of the comment.” As the Supreme Court observed, this statute “is\nvirtually identical to [the] statute applicable to public safety officers ([Gov. Code,]\n§ 3305), and it establishes rights regarding adverse comments that are very similar\nto those that have been granted to teachers. (Ed. Code, § 44031, subd. (b)(1).)\n\n                                              14\n\faddressed whether Government Code section 3255 provides an employee with “the right\nto review and respond to negative comments in a supervisor’s daily log, consisting of\nnotes that memorialize the supervisor’s thoughts and observations concerning an\nemployee, which the supervisor uses as a memory aid in preparing performance plans\nand reviews.” (Id. at p. 1382.) In that case, the supervisor and author of the daily log\nwas the only person who had access to it. Although the supervisor discussed some of the\nincidents described in the log with his superiors, he did not permit them to review the log\nitself. Additionally, to the extent that the supervisor used any of the adverse comments\ncontained in the log in reviewing the employee’s performance, those comments were\ndisclosed to the employee as part of a performance plan or review before being entered\ninto his personnel file. (Id. at p. 1384.) The question before the Supreme Court was\nwhether “negative comments contained in a document memorializing a supervisor’s own\nthoughts and observations that is not itself made available to or shared with anyone else”\nconstitutes a “file ‘used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer.’” (Ibid.)\n       In construing the scope of Government Code section 3255, the Supreme Court in\nPoole determined that “the Legislature was not concerned with any and all files that\nmight in some sense be connected with personnel matters; the Legislature was, rather,\nspecifically concerned with ‘personnel files that are used or have been used to determine\nth[e] firefighter’s qualifications for employment, promotion, additional compensation, or\ntermination or other disciplinary action.” (Poole, supra, 61 Cal.4th at pp. 1385-1386.)\nThe Court thus concluded that the statutory phrase “‘any other file used for any personnel\npurposes by his or her employer’ . . . should be interpreted to encompass any written or\ncomputerized record that, although not designated a personnel file, . . . may be used by\nthe employer to make decisions about promotion, discipline, compensation, and the like.”\n(Id. at p. 1386.) The Court further concluded that, as recognized in cases applying the\nPOBRA and other similar statutes, “a document containing adverse comments may come\n\n\nConsequently, cases interpreting those statutes are relevant to [the] interpretation\nof [Government Code] section 3255.” (Poole, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1386, fn. 2.)\n\n\n                                             15\n\fwithin the disclosure requirement even if not formally entered into the official personnel\nfile, if the document was either (1) maintained in such a manner that it would be available\nto those making personnel decisions in the future, or (2) was actually used by the\nemployer in making a personnel decision, or both.” (Id. at p. 1387.) Applying this\nstatutory interpretation to the case before it, the Court in Poole held that “because the log\nwas not shared with or available to anyone other than the supervisor who wrote the log, it\ndoes not constitute a file ‘used for any personnel purposes by his or her employer’ and\n[Government Code] section 3255 does not apply.” (Id. at p. 1381.)\n       In reaching its holding in Poole, the Supreme Court found its prior decision in\nMiller v. Chico Unified School Dist. (1979) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1187649\"><a href=\"/opinion/1187649/miller-v-chico-unified-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">703</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Miller) distinguishable. In\nMiller, the Court held that, under Education Code section 44031, a school principal was\nentitled to review and respond to “derogatory written material compiled and maintained\nby a school district even though the material has not been properly placed in his\npersonnel file” because it had been used by the school board in its decision to transfer the\nprincipal to a teaching position. (Id. at p. 707.) The principal’s supervisor had used his\n“‘personal notes and calendar’” to dictate a summary of “‘meetings, contacts,\noccurrences, and events’” involving the principal, which were then transcribed into 20\nmemoranda that were submitted to the school board for its use in deciding whether to\nreassign the principle to a teaching position. (Id. at p. 711.) The school board “received\n[these] confidential memoranda without first allowing [the principal] the opportunity to\ncorrect any inaccurate derogatory information contained therein.” (Id. at p. 714.) The\nCourt in Miller rejected the school board’s argument that these memoranda were never\n“‘entered or filed’” in the principal’s personnel file, concluding that an employer “may\nnot avoid the requirements of the statute by maintaining a ‘personnel file’ for certain\ndocuments relating to an employee,” while “segregating elsewhere under a different\nlabel materials which may serve as a basis for affecting the status of the employee’s\nemployment.” (Id. at pp. 712-713.) In distinguishing Miller, the Court in Poole noted\nthat the adverse comments in Miller were contained in documents available to those\nmaking personnel decisions about the principal. (Poole, supra, at p. 1389.) In contrast,\n\n                                             16\n\fthe supervisor in Poole “did not share his log with anyone; he merely discussed with\nothers some of the incidents that he had observed and also recorded in his log.” (Ibid.)\nBecause “there was no evidence that [the] log would be available to anyone making\npersonnel decisions in the future,” it did not fall within the scope of the statute. (Ibid.)\n       Applying the reasoning in Riverside, Poole, and Miller to the present case, we\nconclude that the memoranda that were prepared by White’s supervisors and submitted to\ntheir superiors regarding their observations and concerns about White’s fitness for duty\nconstituted a file that was “used for any personnel purposes by [the] employer” within the\nmeaning of Government Code section 3305. It is undisputed that the memoranda were\ntransmitted to members of upper management at the DA’s Bureau of Investigation.\nAccordingly, as in Riverside and Miller, the documents were available to individuals with\nthe authority to make personnel decisions about White’s employment status, including\ndecisions about her qualifications for employment, promotion, compensation, and\ndiscipline. It is also undisputed that the memoranda were actually used by management\nin making a formal request to OHP for consent to ordering White to submit to a medical\nreevaluation. Indeed, Mueller specifically stated in his declaration that the memoranda\n“were used as the factual basis for the DA’s request to [OHP]” and “were an integral part\nof the DA’s request.” Dr. Souris likewise stated in a declaration that Mueller’s December\n7, 2011 letter, which summarized the contents of the memoranda, “detail[ed] the factual\nbasis ultimately leading to [Dr. Souris] providing the DA with OHP’s ‘consent’” to order\nWhite’s reevaluation. The fact that Dr. Souris did not receive copies of the memoranda\nwith the DA’s request is not determinative of whether these documents came within the\nscope of Government Code section 3305. The disclosure required by the statute was\ntriggered when White’s supervisors, Carter and Carver, transmitted the memoranda to\nupper management at the Bureau of Investigation, who could then use the memoranda to\nseek consent for ordering a medical reevaluation of White or to make other personnel\ndecisions affecting White’s employment status.\n\n\n\n\n                                              17\n\f       The County argues that the memoranda were not subject to disclosure under\nGovernment Code section 3305 because they were not actually used to determine White’s\nqualifications for employment, promotion, compensation, or disciplinary action, but\nrather were used for the sole purpose of communicating matters of concern about White’s\npsychological condition to upper management. However, the DA based its decision to\nseek a medical reevaluation for White on the information detailed in the memoranda\nabout White’s psychological condition, and as the trial court observed, the results of a\npeace officer’s medical reevaluation can lead to significant changes in his or her\nemployment status. Under the Los Angeles County Civil Service Rules, an employee\nwho is found to be partially or fully incapacitated following a medical reevaluation may\nbe subject to a range of employment actions, including a modification of duties, a change\nof classification or reduction in position, or termination if there is no suitable position\nthat the employee can perform satisfactorily. (L.A. County Civil Service Rules, rule\n9.08.) Because Government Code section 3305 applies to any document that “‘“may\nserve as a basis for affecting the status of [a peace officer’s] employment”’” (Riverside,\nsupra, 27 Cal. 4th at p. 802), White had the right to review and respond to documents that\nformed the basis of the DA’s request for a medical reevaluation.\n       The County also asserts that the memoranda could not have been used to affect\nWhite’s employment status because she failed to comply with the DA’s order to appear\nfor her medical reevaluation. However, even if the reevaluation ordered for White did\nnot result in any change in her employment status due to her refusal to appear, the\nmemoranda would have remained available to upper management at the Bureau of\nInvestigation, and thus, could have been used in future personnel decisions affecting\nWhite’s employment. As the Court of Appeal observed in Sacramento Police Officers\nAssn. v. Venegas (2002) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">916</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Venegas), “the broad language employed\nby the Legislature in sections 3305 and 3306 does not limit their reach to comments that\nhave resulted in, or will result in, punitive action against an officer. . . . [E]ven though an\nadverse comment does not directly result in punitive action, it has the potential of\ncreating an adverse impression that could influence future personnel decisions concerning\n\n                                              18\n\fan officer, including decisions that do not constitute discipline or punitive action.” (Id. at\np. 926.) Therefore, “regardless of whether the employing agency contemplates or has\nrejected further action regarding an adverse comment made against a peace officer\nemployee, the officer is entitled to disclosure of the comment if it is entered in an\nagency file used for a personnel purpose.” (Ibid.; see also Seligsohn v. Day (2004) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2259463\"><a href=\"/opinion/2259463/seligsohn-v-day/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">Cal.

In support of this claim, the County notes under Government Code section 3303,\nwhich prescribes the protections that apply when a peace officer is subject to certain\nadministrative interrogations, an officer is entitled to “any reports or complaints made\nby investigators or other persons, except those which are deemed by the investigating\nagency to be confidential.” (Gov. Code, § 3303, subd. (g).) However, as the Court of\nAppeal recognized in Venegas, Government Code section 3303, subdivision (g) “does\nnot give [an employer] an absolute right to deem any and all information confidential and\nto assert such confidentiality against any and all requests for access. It applies in the\ncircumstances set forth in [Government Code] section 3303, i.e., with respect to the\ninterrogation of a peace officer under investigation.” (Venegas, supra, 101 Cal.App.4th\nat p. 923.) Because the County did not seek to withhold the memoranda during the\ncourse of an administrative interrogation of White, the confidentiality limitation set forth\nin Government Code section 3303 does not apply. Additionally, the fact that the County\nmaintained the memoranda in a separate file labeled “Supervisor’s Working File” is of no\nimport. As the Supreme Court succinctly stated in Riverside, “the label placed on the . . .\nfile is irrelevant.” (Riverside, supra, 27 Cal.4th at p. 802; see also Venegas, supra, at\np. 928 [“the law does not permit a law enforcement agency to shield [an adverse]\n\n                                             19\n\fcomment from a peace officer employee by purporting to segregate it from other\npersonnel files”]; Aguilar v.

Instead, the relevant inquiry is\nwhether the document “was actually used by the employer in making a personnel\ndecision” or “maintained in such a manner that it would be available to those making\npersonnel decisions in the future.” (Poole, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1387.) Given that the\nmemoranda were prepared for and transmitted to upper management at the DA’s Bureau\nof Investigation, the documents inarguably would be available to those making personnel\ndecisions about White’s employment status in the future.\n       The County claims that, even if the memoranda were subject to disclosure under\nGovernment Code section 3305, White is not entitled to seek any relief under the statute\nbecause she received copies of the memoranda during the course of White I and did not\nfile a response to any adverse comments contained in the documents within 30 days of\nher receipt, as required by Government Code section 3306. This argument is unavailing.\nGovernment Code section 3305 provides an employee with the right to review an adverse\ncomment before that comment is entered into a file used for personnel purposes. (Gov.\nCode, § 3305 [“[n]o public safety officer shall have any comment adverse to his interest\nentered in . . . any other file used for any personnel purposes by his employer, without the\npublic safety officer having first read and signed the instrument containing the adverse\ncomment”]; see also Poole, supra, 61 Cal.4th at p. 1390 [timing requirement in FBRA\nprovision requiring disclosure of adverse comments in file used for personnel purposes\n“is the requirement that the employee have the opportunity to review the adverse\ncomment before it is actually entered into the file”].) In this case, it is undisputed that the\nmemoranda were not disclosed to White before they were placed in the “Supervisor’s\nWorking File,” submitted to upper management at the DA’s Bureau of Investigation,\nor used by the DA as the basis for seeking consent to order a medical reevaluation for\nWhite. As the Supreme Court noted in Riverside, it would “permit an inappropriate end\nrun around the [POBRA]” if a law enforcement agency could withhold disclosure of\n\n                                              20\n\fadverse comments concerning an employee until after those comments were used by the\nagency for personnel purposes.

Accordingly, the County’s belated\ndisclosure of the memoranda during the course of White I did not preclude White from\nenforcing her rights under Government Code section 3305 in a court of law.\n       For these reasons, the trial court did not err in concluding that the County violated\nGovernment Code section 3305 in failing to disclose the memoranda to White, and that\nWhite was entitled to seek judicial relief under Government Code section 3309.5 based\non the County’s POBRA violation.\n\nIII.   Attorney’s Fees Under Code of Civil Procedure Section 1021.5\n       A.     Standard of Review\n       An award of attorney’s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5\ngenerally is reviewed on appeal for an abuse of discretion. (Indio Police Command Unit\nAssn. v. City of Indio, supra, 230 Cal.App.4th at p. 541.) “‘[W]ith respect to the amount\nof fees awarded, there is no question our review must be highly deferential to the views\nof the trial court.’ [Citations.]” (Concepcion v.

As our Supreme Court has observed, “‘[t]he “experienced trial\njudge is the best judge of the value of professional services rendered in his court, and\nwhile his [or her] judgment is of course subject to review, it will not be disturbed unless\nthe appellate court is convinced that it is clearly wrong” -- meaning that it abused its\ndiscretion. [Citations.]’” (PLCM Group, Inc. v. Drexler (2000) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1195277\"><a href=\"/opinion/1195277/plcm-group-v-drexler/\"><span class=\"volume\">22</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">1084</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1095.)\n\n       B.     Statutory Criteria for an Attorney’s Fee Award\n       Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 provides in relevant part: “Upon motion,\na court may award attorneys’ fees to a successful party against one or more opposing\nparties in any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right\naffecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or\n\n                                              21\n\fnonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the\nnecessity and financial burden of private enforcement, or of enforcement by one public\nentity against another public entity, are such as to make the award appropriate, and\n(c) such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any.”\n       Accordingly, “‘[t]o obtain attorney fees under [Code of Civil Procedure] section\n1021.5, the party seeking fees must show that the litigation: “‘“‘(1) served to vindicate an\nimportant public right; (2) conferred a significant benefit on the general public or a large\nclass of persons; and (3) [was necessary and] imposed a financial burden on plaintiffs\nwhich was out of proportion to their individual stake in the matter.’ [Citation.]”\n[Citation.]’” [Citations.] Because the statute states the criteria in the conjunctive, each\nmust be satisfied to justify a fee award. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (City of Maywood v.\nLos Angeles Unified School Dist. (2012) </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 4th</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 429.)\n       With respect to the first element, the California Supreme Court has recognized that\nthe enforcement of procedural rights in the POBRA serves to vindicate an important right\naffecting the public interest. (Baggett v. Gates (1982) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1318901\"><a href=\"/opinion/1318901/baggett-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 143 (Baggett).) In\nBaggett, four police officers sued the City of Los Angeles and its police chief because\nthey had been reassigned to lower paying positions after an internal investigation into\nalleged misconduct without being given an opportunity for an administrative appeal.\n(Id. at p. 133.) The Supreme Court held that Government Code sections 3303 and 3304\nprovide a right to an administrative appeal to police officers who are reassigned to lower\npaying positions, and the officers who sued to enforce that right were entitled to an award\nof attorney’s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5. (Id. at pp. 141-143.) In\nconsidering whether the officer’s action had resulted in the enforcement of an important\npublic right, the Court specifically concluded: “Plaintiffs’ action resulted in securing for\nthemselves and many others the basic rights and protections of the [POBRA]. . . . [T]hese\nrights and protections are matters of statewide concern. It follows that the rights\nvindicated by plaintiffs are sufficiently ‘important’ to justify an attorney fee award.”\n(Id. at p. 143.) Cases following Baggett have similarly concluded that lawsuits enforcing\nprocedural rights in the POBRA enforce important public rights for purposes of awarding\n\n                                              22\n\fattorney’s fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.

Following Baggett, courts repeatedly have recognized that a significant\nbenefit is conferred on the general public or a large group of persons when the procedural\nprotections contained in the POBRA are enforced. (See, e.g., Robinson v. Chowchilla,\nsupra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 399; Riverside Sheriffs’ Assn. v. County of Riverside, supra,\n152 Cal.App.4th at p. 422; Otto v. Los Angeles Unified School District, supra, 106\nCal.App.4th at pp. 335-336; Aguilar v. Johnson, supra, 202 Cal.App.3d at p. 253;\nMounger v. Gates, supra, 193 Cal.App.3d at p. 1259.) Indeed, “‘“[t]he rights and\nprotections afforded by [POBRA] benefit not only public safety officers but the public in\ngeneral. By promoting stable employer-employee relations, [POBRA] fosters a solid and\nsecure public safety work force. [Citation.] It also encourages peace officer cooperation\nin investigations of possible wrongdoing. [Citation.] Alleged violations of [POBRA]\ntherefore implicate duties ‘which inure[] to the benefit of the public at large’ [citation],\ntranscending the employer-employee relationship….” [Citation.]’ [Citations.]”\n(Riverside Sheriffs’ Assn. v. County of Riverside, supra, at p. 422.)\n\n\n\n\n                                              23\n\f       With respect to the third element regarding the necessity and financial burden of\nprivate enforcement, the Supreme Court in Baggett stated: “[T]he record before this\ncourt indicates that the financial burden this suit placed on plaintiffs was out of\nproportion to their personal stake in the case. By their action, plaintiffs have secured the\nenforcement of basic procedural rights, . . . However, enforcement of these procedural\nrights may well not result in any pecuniary benefit to plaintiffs themselves. [Citation.]. . .\n[¶] This court is satisfied that plaintiffs’ action meets the requirements of section 1021.5\nof the Code of Civil Procedure.” (Baggett, supra, 32 Cal.3d at p. 143.) Other courts\nhave likewise held that a plaintiff is entitled to attorney’s fees for enforcing procedural\nrights under the POBRA where the cost of prevailing in the action ultimately transcends\nthe plaintiff’s personal interest in the litigation. (See, e.g., Riverside Sheriffs’ Assn. v.\nCounty of Riverside, supra, 152 Cal.App.4th at pp. 422-433; Otto v. Los Angeles Unified\nSchool District, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at pp. 335-336; Henneberque v. City of Culver\nCity (1985) </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2160714\"><a href=\"/opinion/2160714/henneberque-v-city-of-culver-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Cal. App. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 846-847.)\n       In this case, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\ndetermining that White was entitled to an award of attorney’s fees under Code of Civil\nProcedure section 1021.5. White’s action to enforce the procedural rights afforded to\npeace officers under the POBRA to review and respond to adverse comments in\npersonnel records served to vindicate an important right affecting the public interest and\nconferred a significant benefit on a large group of persons. Throughout the litigation, the\nCounty maintained that internal memoranda shared among management about a peace\nofficer’s fitness for duty were not subject to disclosure under the POBRA so long as\nthe documents were marked confidential and kept in a separate file from the officer’s\npersonnel file. While the trial court’s ruling that such materials must be disclosed under\nthe POBRA conferred a direct non-pecuniary personal benefit on White, the outcome of\nthe litigation also benefits other peace officers who may be the subject of similar internal\ndocuments containing adverse comments about the officers’ fitness for duty.\n\n\n\n\n                                               24\n\f       Additionally, the trial court reasonably could find that the cost of litigating the\naction to a successful conclusion transcended White’s personal interest in the matter. The\nquestion of whether the County could order White to submit to a medical reevaluation\nbased on the documented concerns about her fitness for duty has now been the subject of\ntwo writ proceedings filed by White and two appeals filed by the County. Although\nWhite successfully enforced the basic procedural rights guaranteed under Government\nCode sections 3305 and 3306 by prosecuting the present action and obtaining injunctive\nrelief, she did not secure any direct pecuniary benefit for herself through such\nenforcement, as her request for statutory penalties under the POBRA was denied. On this\nrecord, the trial court reasonably concluded that White satisfied each of the enumerated\ncriteria in Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5, and thus, was entitled to an attorney’s\nfee award.\n       In arguing that the trial court erred in awarding attorney’s fees, the County asserts\nthat the litigation did not result in any novel interpretation of the POBRA that could\nbenefit the public at large, but rather in the application of an already existing right under\nGovernment Code section 3305 to documents pertaining to White. However, “‘[t]he fact\nthat litigation enforces existing rights does not mean that a substantial benefit to the\npublic cannot result. Attorney fees have consistently been awarded for the enforcement\nof well-defined, existing obligations. [Citations.]’ [Citation.]” (Otto v. Los Angeles\nUnified School District, supra, 106 Cal.App.4th at p. 335.) Because the County\nvigorously denied that the documents were subject to disclosure under Government Code\nsection 3305, White had to file suit to enforce her rights under the statute, which justified\nan attorney’s fee award. (Riverside Sheriffs’ Assn. v. County of Riverside, supra, 152\nCal.App.4th at p. 422.) The County also contends that an award of attorney’s fees was\nnot warranted because the primary effect of the litigation was the vindication of White’s\nown personal rights and economic interests. However, “where each of the criteria is met,\nthe fact the primary effect of the action was to vindicate a plaintiff’s personal economic\ninterests does not foreclose an award of attorney fees” under Code of Civil Procedure\nsection 1021.5. (Robinson v. Chowchilla, supra, 202 Cal.App.4th at p. 399.) In this case,\n\n                                              25\n\fWhite satisfied each of the statutory criteria and there were no special circumstances\nrendering an award of attorney’s fees unjust. (Id. at p. 391 [“attorney fees must be\nawarded when the statutory criteria are met unless special circumstances render such an\naward unjust”].) As the prevailing party in the action, White was therefore entitled to an\nattorney’s fee award under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5.\n\n       C.     Amount of Attorney’s Fee Award\n       The County also challenges the amount of attorney’s fees awarded by the trial\ncourt on the ground that White’s request for attorney’s fees was excessive and duplicative\nof work that was performed in litigating the prior action in White I. We see no abuse of\ndiscretion in the trial court’s determination of the attorney’s fee award. The trial court\nawarded White $30,845 in attorney’s fees based on the lodestar method, which was\nslightly less than the amount of fees requested by White. In support of the motion for\nattorney’s fees, White’s counsel submitted a declaration stating that she had reviewed the\nattached attorney’s fees bills, and that “[a]ll the time reflected on the attached bills was\nspent in connection with the present litigation only.” While the County speculates that\nWhite’s attorneys should have spent less time on discovery given the factual similarities\nbetween the present action and White I, the County has failed to demonstrate that the\namount of time expended was unreasonable. The record further reflects that the trial\ncourt carefully reviewed the bills submitted by White’s counsel, reduced the amount\nrequested by $780 for attorney conferences that appeared to be duplicative, and then\ndetermined that, apart from that single reduction, the hourly rates requested and total\nnumber of hours expended were reasonable and necessary. The trial court’s award of\nattorney’s fees based on the hours reasonably spent by White’s attorneys in litigating the\naction to a successful conclusion did not constitute an abuse of discretion.\n\n\n\n\n                                              26\n\f                                    DISPOSITION\n\n      The judgment is affirmed. White shall recover her costs on appeal.\n\n\n\n\n                                                ZELON, Acting P.
