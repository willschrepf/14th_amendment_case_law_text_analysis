Kendrick, Judge\n\n                    Gilbert K. Davis (Davis & Associates, LLC, on brief), for\n                    appellant.\n\n                    Benjamin H. Katz, Assistant Attorney General (Robert F.\n                    McDonnell, Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.\n\n\n       Convicted of drunk driving under Code § 18.2-266, Pilar L. Morin appeals on three\n\ngrounds. She challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, the alleged multifariousness of the\n\ncharge, and the constitutionality of rebuttable presumptions applied to prosecutions for driving\n\nunder the influence. Rejecting these challenges, we affirm Morin’s conviction.\n\n                                                  I.\n\n       On appeal, we review the evidence in the “light most favorable” to the Commonwealth.\n\nCommonwealth v. Hudson, 265 Va. 505, 514, 578 S.E.2d 781, 786 (2003). Viewing the\n\nevidence through this evidentiary prism requires us to “discard the evidence of the accused in\n\nconflict with that of the Commonwealth, and regard as true all the credible evidence favorable to\n\nthe Commonwealth and all fair inferences to be drawn therefrom.” Parks v. Commonwealth,\n\n221 Va. 492, 498, 270 S.E.2d 755, 759 (1980) (emphasis and citation omitted).\n\n\n\n       *\n           Pursuant to Code § 17.1-413, this opinion is not designated for publication.\n\f       So viewed, the record shows that shortly after 2:00 a.m. Morin made a u-turn in her sport\n\nutility vehicle over a three-foot high median. Sparks sprayed out of the back of her vehicle as\n\nshe came down on the other side. After observing Morin scale the median, a police officer gave\n\nchase with emergency lights and sirens activated. About five blocks later, Morin stopped her\n\nvehicle.\n\n       When questioned, Morin admitted to the officer she had been drinking that night and was\n\non her way to another bar. The vehicle had not malfunctioned, Morin conceded, and she was not\n\nhaving any health or medication issues. The officer noticed that Morin smelled of alcohol. She\n\nhad glassy, watery eyes and slurred speech. She claimed to have consumed less than five\n\nalcoholic drinks and expressed concern about being arrested for DUI because of its impact on her\n\njob as a school bus driver. The officer administered three field sobriety tests, each of which\n\nMorin failed to perform properly. The officer arrested Morin and offered her the opportunity to\n\ntake a breath test. Morin agreed and gave a breath sample that yielded a breath alcohol\n\nconcentration of .20 grams per 210 liters of breath.1\n\n       Consistent with the DUI statute, the arrest warrant charged Morin for violating “Section\n\n18.2-266” and then set out the various theories of criminal liability under which she could be\n\nconvicted. See generally Code § 18.2-266 (“A charge alleging a violation of this section shall\n\nsupport a conviction under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v).”). The warrant stated Morin drove\n\n“while having a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or more . . . or 0.08 grams or more”\n\nper 210 liters of breath (corresponding to subsection (i) of § 18.2-266) or “while under the\n\ninfluence of alcohol” (corresponding to subsection (ii) of § 18.2-266) or while under the\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Code § 18.2-266(i) prohibits driving with a blood alcohol concentration of “0.08\npercent or more by weight by volume or 0.08 grams or more per 210 liters of breath.”\n\n                                                 -2-\n\finfluence of drugs or drugs combined with alcohol (corresponding to subsections (iii) and (iv) of\n\n§ 18.2-266). The warrant further noted Morin’s .20 blood alcohol concentration (BAC).2\n\n       The general district court found Morin guilty as charged and imposed the minimum\n\nmandatory sentence of five days in jail under Code § 18.2-270(A), applicable to convictions\n\naccompanied by a BAC of “at least 0.15, but not more than 0.20.” Morin appealed to the circuit\n\ncourt and filed a motion to dismiss. Morin pointed out that the arrest warrant charged her with\n\nviolating Code § 18.2-266 and repeated verbatim each subsection of the statute as alternative\n\ngrounds for her alleged guilt. That disjunctive method, she asserted, made the warrant\n\nmultifarious and required the court to dismiss the charge unless the prosecution elected one\n\nspecific subsection under which to proceed. Morin also attacked the rebuttable presumptions\n\napplied by Code § 18.2-269 as an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof.\n\n       In addition to the arguments made in her written motion, Morin also asserted that the\n\nminimum mandatory sentence triggered by a finding of a .20 BAC constituted a “different\n\nelement” governed by United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005) (distinguishing between\n\n“elements of a crime” and mere “sentencing factors” for purposes of the Sixth Amendment). In\n\nresponse to this new argument, the Commonwealth conceded the point, admitting: “we do have\n\nto prove all the elements of the DWI, .15 to .20, in order to have the sentencing enhancement.”\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          For purposes of this opinion, BAC will be used to describe both blood alcohol\nconcentration, expressed as a percentage “by weight by volume,” Code § 18.2-266, and breath\nalcohol concentration, measured in grams “per 210 liters of breath,” id. See Code § 18.2-268.9\n(acknowledging the validity of a “blood alcohol reading” obtained from equipment used to\nperform a “breath test”); Hall v. Commonwealth, 32 Va. App. 616, 631, 529 S.E.2d 829, 837\n(2000) (en banc) (describing a “blood alcohol concentration” in terms of “grams per 210 liters of\nbreath” (emphasis added)); see also United States v. Sauls, 981 F. Supp. 909, 924 (D. Md. 1997)\n(“In this [opinion], BAC is defined as either blood alcohol concentration, stated as grams per 100\nmilliliters of blood or as breath alcohol concentration, stated as grams per 210 liters of breath,\nand is reported without a ‘%’ sign.”).\n\n                                               -3-\n\fBut the Commonwealth distinguished Booker as “a totally different situation, because those were\n\npost-trial findings. This is a trial finding.”\n\n        The court rejected Morin’s various motions and tried the case to a jury. The arresting\n\nofficer presented his testimony about Morin’s intoxicated state at the time of her arrest. The\n\nofficer also presented the certificate of analysis showing the .20 BAC finding from the breath\n\ntest. After the Commonwealth rested, Morin called her husband and two friends to the stand\n\nwho testified that Morin had been drinking light beer that night — but not very much. After they\n\ntestified, Morin took the stand in her own defense. She testified that she, her husband, and her\n\nfriends had been to various bars that night. She admitted drinking beer but denied ever being\n\nintoxicated.\n\n        Morin also presented expert testimony from a toxicologist about the tests employed by\n\nthe Commonwealth to measure BAC. The toxicologist described the rate of absorption of\n\nalcohol in a person’s blood and the effects of various variables such as body weight, age, size,\n\nfood consumption, and the like. He added that timing was particularly important. While .03\n\nBAC could be added by each bottle of light beer, the toxicologist estimated that .01 BAC would\n\nbe eliminated in the blood over an hour’s time.\n\n        The defense toxicologist concluded that a person of Morin’s physical characteristics\n\nwould have had a .06 BAC if she consumed less than five beers over the time frame described by\n\nMorin. He conceded his opinion was “based on the accuracy” of Morin’s statements. For the\n\nBAC to be as high as .20, the toxicologist said, Morin would have had to consume about ten to\n\neleven beers that night. He added that the breath test may have produced a false reading because\n\nof indigestion gas or other factors skewing the sampling procedure.\n\n        The court then addressed with counsel the subject of jury instructions. The prosecutor\n\nrequested a finding instruction that took into account that the jurors could find the BAC “could\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fhave been less than .20” but still not as low as the .06 figure hypothesized by the toxicologist.\n\nThe prosecutor also asked that the instruction permit the jury to convict on either or both of the\n\ntwo relevant theories of liability under Code § 18.2-266 — a per se violation of subsection (i)\n\ndue to driving with a BAC of .08 or more, or a violation of subsection (ii)’s prohibition of\n\ndriving under the influence. The trial court agreed and incorporated both in the finding\n\ninstruction. The court also gave another instruction defining “under the influence” to include an\n\naccused who “has drunk enough alcoholic beverages to so affect her manner, disposition, speech,\n\nmuscular movement, general appearance or behavior as to be apparent to observation.”\n\n       The last paragraph of the finding instruction included a specific factfinding task: “If you\n\nfind the defendant guilty because she had a concentration of 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per\n\n210 liters of breath, then you shall indicate whether you find that [her] concentration was: (1)\n\n0.08 or greater, (2) at least 0.15 but less than 0.20 or (3) less than 0.15.” Agreeing with the\n\nprosecutor, the court explained to Morin’s counsel that this language allowed the jurors to find\n\nher guilty with “no mandatory minimum” sentence. See Code § 18.2-270(A) (imposing a 5-day\n\nmandatory minimum jail term for convictions accompanied by a ≥ .15 but ≤ .20 BAC and a\n\n10-day term for BACs higher than .20). Neither Morin nor the prosecutor, however, asked the\n\ncourt to instruct the jury on the “rebuttable presumptions” that permit inferences of driving under\n\nthe influence based upon certain BAC levels. See Code § 18.2-269.\n\n       During closing argument, the prosecutor repeated several times that the jury could find\n\nMorin guilty under either or both of the two proof regimes approved by Code § 18.2-266(i) and\n\n(ii). The verdict form did not distinguish between the two. The guilt option of the verdict form\n\nread: “We, the jury, find the Defendant Guilty of DWI, 1st as charged in the summons, with a\n\nBlood Alcohol Content of ____________.” During their deliberations, the jury questioned this.\n\n“Re: Verdict Sheet,” the jurors asked, “[b]ased on a guilty verdict, is the jury required to assess a\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fblood alcohol level by choosing one of the three options in Instruction #4 paragraph #4 (1), (2),\n\nor (3) or can we find her guilty without selecting one of the options?” The court answered with\n\nan admonition to read the finding instruction carefully. The jury shortly thereafter returned with\n\na verdict reading: “We, the Jury, find the Defendant Guilty of DWI, 1st as charged in the\n\nsummons, with a Blood Alcohol Content of (3) less than .15.” They added the underscored\n\nlanguage by hand.\n\n       After the jury imposed punishment, Morin moved to set aside the verdict claiming it\n\nrested on insufficient evidence. The only believable BAC evidence, she asserted, was the\n\ntoxicologist’s estimate of a .06 BAC. Having rejected the .20 BAC presented by the\n\nCommonwealth, Morin’s counsel reasoned, the jury had no choice but to accept the\n\ntoxicologist’s opinion and to acquit her of a subsection (i) violation for driving with a BAC of\n\n.08 or more. Alluding to subsection (ii), the court questioned counsel’s reasoning: “Do you\n\nthink this record supports the jury’s verdict of driving under the influence?” “Yes,” counsel\n\nanswered, “I think it could support that verdict.” “And that could be less than .15,” the court\n\nnoted, “[a]nd that’s what they found.” The court denied Morin’s motion and entered final\n\njudgment.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       Morin appeals on three grounds. She first claims the jury acquitted her of driving under\n\nthe influence (subsection (ii) of § 18.2-266) and limited its guilty finding solely to driving while\n\nhaving a BAC of .08 or higher (subsection (i) of § 18.2-266). With that limitation, the\n\nconviction could not stand because the jury had no choice but to accept the toxicologist’s\n\nestimate of a maximum BAC of .06. Second, Morin renews her assertion that the arrest warrant\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fasserted multifarious charges grouped as a single charge under Code § 18.2-266. Finally, Morin\n\nattacks the constitutionality of the “rebuttable presumptions” adopted by Code § 18.2-269.\n\n       We find none of these arguments persuasive.\n\n         A. THE EVIDENTIARY SUFFICIENCY OF A SUBSECTION (i) PER SE CONVICTION\n\n       Morin states her first question presented this way: “Whether the trial evidence supported\n\nthe verdict of driving with a blood alcohol level range of .08 to less than .15?” Appellant’s Br. at\n\n1. She then goes on to answer that question with the assertion that the jury had but two options\n\nwith respect to the BAC evidence: first, either to wholly accept the Commonwealth’s evidence\n\nof a .20 BAC, or, second, to wholly accept Morin’s claim to have consumed less than five beers,\n\nthereby placing her BAC below .08 (as her toxicologist testified). What the jury did, Morin\n\nclaims, it could not do — and that is to find her guilty for a per se violation while simultaneously\n\ndetermining her BAC to be “less than” .15. We reject this argument as flawed both in its first\n\npremise and in its application to the facts of this case.\n\n       To begin with, Morin assumes that the jury acquitted her of driving under the influence\n\nunder Code § 18.2-266(ii) and convicted her only of the per se offense of driving with a BAC\n\nlevel of .08 or more under Code § 18.2-266(i). We see no basis in the trial record for this\n\nassumption. The finding instruction permitted a conviction on either or both grounds. A\n\nseparate definitional instruction spelled out the circumstances satisfying the subsection (ii)\n\nstandard for driving under the influence. The prosecutor addressed each ground separately\n\nduring his closing argument and invited the jury to convict on both. If the verdict form implies\n\nanything, it suggests the jurors did just that. Indeed, the verdict specifically stated they found\n\nMorin guilty “as charged” in the summons. The summons and arrest warrant charged Morin\n\nwith violating Code § 18.2-266 and did not limit itself to a per se theory of liability under\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fsubsection (i). A DUI verdict finding an accused guilty “as charged” in a warrant citing Code\n\n§ 18.2-266 requires that we address on appeal “both subsection (i) and subsection (ii) of Code\n\n§ 18.2-266.” Yap v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 622, 627 n.1, 643 S.E.2d 523, 525 n.1 (2007);\n\naccord Code § 18.2-266 (providing that a “charge alleging a violation of this section shall\n\nsupport a conviction under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v)”).\n\n        Nor do we accept Morin’s assertion that the jury’s specific factual finding of a BAC of\n\n“less than” .15 constitutes an acquittal of subsection (ii)’s prohibition of driving under the\n\ninfluence.3 It is true the finding instruction told the jurors that if it found her guilty “because” of\n\na BAC level of .08 or more, then they “shall” determine the BAC. But that directive did not\n\npreclude the jury from specifying the BAC after finding Morin guilty on both subsection (i) and\n\n(ii) grounds. To be sure, given the guilty “as charged” language, the most plausible reading of\n\nthe verdict is that the jury convicted Morin under both theories of criminal liability.\n\n        The context of the finding instruction also refutes Morin’s argument. As the trial judge\n\nnoted in his colloquy with counsel, the .15 and .20 BAC thresholds in the finding instruction do\n\nnot correspond to the evidentiary presumptions of Code § 18.2-269, which uses BAC thresholds\n\nof .05 and .08 for purposes of inferring intoxication. Code § 18.2-269(A) applies these\n\ninferences to prosecutions for violations of “clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of § 18.2-266” — but not to\n\nviolations of subsection (i). See Davis v. Commonwealth, 8 Va. App. 291, 297-98, 381 S.E.2d\n\n11, 14-15 (1989). Nothing in the finding instruction implied that by making the specific BAC\n\n\n\n\n        3\n          The jury’s verdict form for the guilt phase of the trial finds Morin’s BAC to be “less\nthan .15.” The final judgment order likewise recites the jury’s finding as “guilty as charged”\nwith a BAC “less than .15.” The verdict form for the sentencing phase of the trial, however,\nrecites the guilt findings as “at least .08 but less than .15.” Morin did not at trial, nor does she on\nappeal, object to the inconsistency between the final judgment order, which recites accurately the\nguilt verdict, and the prefatory language of the sentencing verdict, which does not.\n\n                                                   -8-\n\fdetermination the jurors necessarily were choosing to acquit Morin of driving under the\n\ninfluence and to convict her only of a per se violation.4\n\n       Perhaps, as Morin suggests, the jury “desired to show leniency,” Appellant’s Br. at 15, by\n\nfinding her guilty but fixing her BAC below the .15 threshold despite the Commonwealth’s\n\nevidence of a .20 BAC. We acknowledge this possibility. The finding instruction, after all,\n\nmentions the ≤ .15 and ≥ .20 BAC levels with no context whatsoever, thus leaving the jurors free\n\nto correctly suppose its relevance had nothing to do with guilt and everything to do with\n\npunishment.\n\n       We fail to see, however, how this speculation supports Morin’s appellate request for\n\nexoneration. “Consistency in jury verdicts is not required.” Gaines v. Commonwealth, 39\n\nVa. App. 562, 570, 574 S.E.2d 775, 779 (2003) (citing Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390, 394\n\n(1932)). It is easy to see why this is so. Inconsistent jury verdicts “present a situation where\n\n‘error,’ in the sense that the jury has not followed the court’s instructions, most certainly has\n\noccurred, but it is unclear whose ox has been gored.” Id. (quoting United States v. Powell, 469\n\nU.S. 57, 65 (1984)). Even if we were to accept Morin’s assertion that the verdict “guilty as\n\ncharged” was inconsistent with the jury’s BAC finding, that ambiguity is far more tolerable than\n\nan unwarranted reversal of a conviction on the ground that the verdict arguably included an\n\nunderstandable, but logically inconsistent, emotive element of clemency.\n\n       In short, Morin’s argument makes an assumption we are unwilling to accept — that the\n\njury acquitted her of driving under the influence under Code § 18.2-266(ii), despite\n\n\n\n       4\n          The only point of the .15 and .20 BAC thresholds, as the trial court noted, was to\ndetermine the appropriate mandatory minimum punishment under Code § 18.2-270(A). By\nmaking a finding of “less than” .15 BAC, the jurors were not applying the evidentiary\npresumptions of Code § 18.2-269. They had never been instructed on those presumptions. The\ntrial judge offered Morin the opportunity to present an instruction on this topic; she decided\nagainst it.\n\n                                                -9-\n\foverwhelming evidence of her guilt, and found her guilty only of the per se offense of driving\n\nwith a BAC of .08 or more in violation of Code § 18.2-266(i). Morin was charged with violating\n\nboth provisions; the jury was instructed on both theories of culpability; and the verdict found her\n\nguilty “as charged.” The jury’s BAC finding, requested by the trial court only for the purpose of\n\ndetermining the applicability of a mandatory minimum sentence, cannot fairly be construed as an\n\nacquittal of driving under the influence under Code § 18.2-266(ii).\n\n       Having rejected the assumption underlying Morin’s argument, we similarly reject\n\nMorin’s remaining challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. In Virginia, the factfinding in a\n\nlower court receives “the highest degree of appellate deference.” Thomas v. Commonwealth, 48\n\nVa. App. 605, 608, 633 S.E.2d 229, 231 (2006). “As an appellate court, we are not permitted to\n\nreweigh the evidence.” Nusbaum v. Berlin, 273 Va. 385, 408, 641 S.E.2d 494, 507 (2007).\n\nPresuming factual findings to be correct, we reverse “only if the trial court’s decision is ‘plainly\n\nwrong or without evidence to support it.’” Kelly v. Commonwealth, 41 Va. App. 250, 257, 584\n\nS.E.2d 444, 447 (2003) (en banc) (citations omitted). This standard requires us to determine\n\nwhether “any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.” Haskins v. Commonwealth, 44 Va. App. 1, 7, 602 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2004)\n\n(citation and footnote omitted; emphasis in original); see also Barnes v. Commonwealth, 47\n\nVa. App. 105, 110, 622 S.E.2d 278, 280 (2005). Governed by this standard, we find the\n\nevidence amply supports the jury’s verdict on both subsection (i) and (ii) theories of liability.\n\n       To convict under subsection (i), the jury was not required to make an election between\n\nwholly believing the Commonwealth’s evidence of a .20 BAC or wholly believing the defense\n\ntoxicologist’s estimate of less than .08. The power to segregate evidence “into the believable,\n\npartly believable, or wholly unbelievable is an exercise of decisional discretion intrinsic to the\n\nfactfinding task and essential to its proper performance.” Harper v. Commonwealth, 49\n\n\n                                               - 10 -\n\fVa. App. 517, 523, 642 S.E.2d 779, 782 (2007); see also Goodman v. Commonwealth, 37\n\nVa. App. 374, 386, 558 S.E.2d 555, 561 (2002) (“The fact finder is not required to believe all\n\naspects of a witness’ testimony; it may accept some parts as believable and reject other parts as\n\nimplausible.”).\n\n       Consequently, a rational jury could have discounted the Commonwealth’s evidence based\n\nupon the toxicologist’s reservations about the reliability of the breath test. The jury could have\n\nsimilarly discounted the toxicologist’s low-ball BAC estimate as naïvely reliant on the criminal\n\ndefendant’s self-serving claim that she drank no more than five beers that night. Between these\n\ntwo evidentiary poles, the jury could have concluded that the BAC exceeded .08 but was less\n\nthan .15. The methodology employed by Morin’s toxicologist provided a basis for reaching this\n\nconclusion. On this record, therefore, Morin’s sufficiency challenge to a per se conviction under\n\nsubsection (i) cannot succeed.\n\n       We come to the same conclusion about the evidence supporting Morin’s guilt under\n\nsubsection (ii). Her erratic driving over the three-foot high median on her way to another bar,\n\nher confession of drinking and driving, the smell of alcohol, her glassy, watery eyes and slurred\n\nspeech, and her three failed field sobriety tests — these circumstances, taken together, eliminate\n\nany plausible challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting Morin’s guilt under Code\n\n§ 18.2-266(ii). See, e.g., Cutright v. Commonwealth, 43 Va. App. 593, 598, 601 S.E.2d 1, 3\n\n(2004) (holding an officer’s observations of defendant’s intoxication “moments after he stepped\n\nout of his car” was a sufficient evidentiary showing, even without BAC test results, to support a\n\nDUI conviction under Code § 18.2-266(ii)); Lemond v. Commonwealth, 19 Va. App. 687, 694,\n\n454 S.E.2d 31, 35-36 (1995) (holding a defendant’s admission that she consumed alcoholic\n\nbeverages, coupled with her appearance and lack of coordination, is sufficient to support a\n\nconviction for driving under the influence of alcohol).\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\f       In short, we reject Morin’s assertion that the jury acquitted her of driving under the\n\ninfluence in violation of subsection (ii) and limited its finding of guilt to a per se offense under\n\nsubsection (i). Nothing in the charging instrument, closing arguments, finding instruction, or\n\nverdict form supports Morin’s interpretation of the nature of her conviction. We similarly reject\n\nMorin’s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence. A rational jury can, and we think did, find\n\nMorin guilty under both subsection (i) and (ii) theories of criminal liability. And either, standing\n\nalone, is sufficient to support the validity of her conviction.\n\n                             B. THE MULTIFARIOUSNESS OBJECTION\n\n       Morin argues that the arrest warrant (serving as the charging instrument) should have\n\nbeen dismissed because it charged her with more than one crime. Short of dismissal, Morin\n\ncontends, the trial court should have forced the Commonwealth to elect before trial between the\n\nseparate theories of liability recognized by subsections (i) and (ii) of Code § 18.2-266. By\n\nfailing to do either, Morin concludes, the trial court’s error “implicated federal and state\n\nconstitutional rights concerning double jeopardy, and due process notice” principles.\n\nAppellant’s Br. at 14.\n\n       Double jeopardy and due process are weighty topics, deserving of considerable analytical\n\nrespect both by counsel and courts. Morin’s appellate brief, however, cites no cases, statutes,\n\ntreatises, or other informative legal sources addressing any aspect of her argument. Nor does she\n\nmention that the DUI statute itself states a “charge alleging a violation of this section shall\n\nsupport a conviction under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v).” Code § 18.2-266.5\n\n       5\n          In this case, as in Cutright, the Commonwealth “charged [the defendant] with violating\nall four subsections of Code § 18.2-266. Even if it had not done so, the Commonwealth could\nrely on any subsection of Code § 18.2-266 in support of a charge asserting a violation of the\nstatute generally.” Cutright v. Commonwealth, 43 Va. App. 593, 597, 601 S.E.2d 1, 3 (2004)\n(emphasis added) (quoting Code § 18.2-266 stating a “charge alleging a violation of this section\nshall support a conviction under clauses (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)” (quote in parenthetical and\nemphasis in original)).”\n\n                                                 - 12 -\n\f       “Rule 5A:20(e) requires an appellant’s brief to include, among other things, the\n\n‘principles of law, the argument, and the authorities relating to each question presented.’”\n\nMcCallum v. Salazar, 49 Va. App. 51, 56 n.2, 636 S.E.2d 486, 488 n.2 (2006); see also Mason v.\n\nCommonwealth, 49 Va. App. 39, 46 n.2, 636 S.E.2d 480, 483 n.2 (2006). “Rule 5A:20(e) bars\n\nus from addressing any issues unsupported by authority.” Klein v. Klein, 49 Va. App. 478, 482,\n\n642 S.E.2d 313, 315 (2007). “By failing to cite any authority,” Epps v. Commonwealth, 47\n\nVa. App. 687, 718, 626 S.E.2d 912, 926 (2006) (en banc), aff’d, 273 Va. 410, 641 S.E.2d 77\n\n(2007), Morin has forfeited her appellate opportunity to challenge her conviction on double\n\njeopardy and due process grounds. See also Stokes v. Commonwealth, 49 Va. App. 401, 410,\n\n641 S.E.2d 780, 784 (2007) (declining to address issue where appellant “cites no authority” for\n\nher position).\n\n       The rationale behind this principle rests on far firmer ground than mere procedural\n\ndefault principles. Practically speaking, for us to intelligently rule on Morin’s unadorned double\n\njeopardy and due process assertions, we would first need to frame the specific constitutional\n\nrights at stake, discern which lines of judicial authority (if any) support or refute her assertions,\n\nprovide the Commonwealth with an opportunity to respond to those precedents (necessitating\n\nadditional briefing because the Attorney General would not know which precedents we thought\n\nrelevant until we informed him), and then decide upon the best possible answer to the best\n\npossible articulation of Morin’s position. None of this can we do. “Suffice it to say, such an\n\nexercise of sua sponte judicial power would impermissibly place us in the role of advocate — far\n\noutside the boundaries of our traditional adjudicative duties.” Johnson v. Commonwealth, 45\n\nVa. App. 113, 116, 609 S.E.2d 58, 59 (2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                    C. THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTIONS OF CODE § 18.2-269\n\n       Morin challenges the constitutionality of the “rebuttable presumptions” employed by\n\nCode § 18.2-269. This argument fails at its inception because the jury was never instructed on\n\nthese rebuttable presumptions and Code § 18.2-269(A), moreover, makes clear the presumptions\n\ndo not apply to per se violations under Code § 18.2-266(i) — the only theory on which Morin\n\nclaims to have been convicted. The presumption Morin misidentifies, but nonetheless means to\n\ntarget, is the implication inherent in Code § 18.2-266(i), which permits the factfinder to infer that\n\nthe BAC level determined by a timely breath test accurately states the BAC level at the time of\n\ndriving. See Davis, 8 Va. App. at 298, 381 S.E.2d at 315.6 While sometimes called a “rebuttable\n\npresumption,” the later-BAC-implies-prior-BAC principle underlying Code § 18.2-266(i) is no\n\nmore than a permissible evidentiary inference that the factfinder may accept or reject. Yap v.\n\nCommonwealth, 49 Va. App. 622, 633, 643 S.E.2d 523, 528 (2007). Understood that way, the\n\ninference violates no constitutional norms. Id. at 633-37, 643 S.E.2d at 528-30 (applying\n\npermissible-inference interpretation to the unstated, but inherent, presumption stemming from\n\nCode § 18.2-266(i) as well as to the express statutory presumptions of Code § 18.2-269).\n\n                                                 III.\n\n       Rejecting Morin’s sufficiency, multifariousness, and constitutional challenges to her\n\nconviction under Code § 18.2-266, we affirm.\n\n\n\n                                                                                     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         See also Charles v.

Sparks sprayed out of the back of her vehicle as\n\nshe came down on the other side. After observing Morin scale the median, a police officer gave\n\nchase with emergency lights and sirens activated. About five blocks later, Morin stopped her\n\nvehicle.\n\n       When questioned, Morin admitted to the officer she had been drinking that night and was\n\non her way to another bar. The vehicle had not malfunctioned, Morin conceded, and she was not\n\nhaving any health or medication issues. The officer noticed that Morin smelled of alcohol. She\n\nhad glassy, watery eyes and slurred speech. She claimed to have consumed less than five\n\nalcoholic drinks and expressed concern about being arrested for DUI because of its impact on her\n\njob as a school bus driver. The officer administered three field sobriety tests, each of which\n\nMorin failed to perform properly. The officer arrested Morin and offered her the opportunity to\n\ntake a breath test. Morin agreed and gave a breath sample that yielded a breath alcohol\n\nconcentration of .20 grams per 210 liters of breath.1\n\n       Consistent with the DUI statute, the arrest warrant charged Morin for violating “Section\n\n18.2-266” and then set out the various theories of criminal liability under which she could be\n\nconvicted. See generally Code § 18.2-266 (“A charge alleging a violation of this section shall\n\nsupport a conviction under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v).”). The warrant stated Morin drove\n\n“while having a blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 percent or more . . . or 0.08 grams or more”\n\nper 210 liters of breath (corresponding to subsection (i) of § 18.2-266) or “while under the\n\ninfluence of alcohol” (corresponding to subsection (ii) of § 18.2-266) or while under the\n\n\n\n\n       1\n         Code § 18.2-266(i) prohibits driving with a blood alcohol concentration of “0.08\npercent or more by weight by volume or 0.08 grams or more per 210 liters of breath.”\n\n                                                 -2-\n\finfluence of drugs or drugs combined with alcohol (corresponding to subsections (iii) and (iv) of\n\n§ 18.2-266). The warrant further noted Morin’s .20 blood alcohol concentration (BAC).2\n\n       The general district court found Morin guilty as charged and imposed the minimum\n\nmandatory sentence of five days in jail under Code § 18.2-270(A), applicable to convictions\n\naccompanied by a BAC of “at least 0.15, but not more than 0.20.” Morin appealed to the circuit\n\ncourt and filed a motion to dismiss. Morin pointed out that the arrest warrant charged her with\n\nviolating Code § 18.2-266 and repeated verbatim each subsection of the statute as alternative\n\ngrounds for her alleged guilt. That disjunctive method, she asserted, made the warrant\n\nmultifarious and required the court to dismiss the charge unless the prosecution elected one\n\nspecific subsection under which to proceed. Morin also attacked the rebuttable presumptions\n\napplied by Code § 18.2-269 as an unconstitutional shifting of the burden of proof.\n\n       In addition to the arguments made in her written motion, Morin also asserted that the\n\nminimum mandatory sentence triggered by a finding of a .20 BAC constituted a “different\n\nelement” governed by United States v. Booker, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005) (distinguishing between\n\n“elements of a crime” and mere “sentencing factors” for purposes of the Sixth Amendment). In\n\nresponse to this new argument, the Commonwealth conceded the point, admitting: “we do have\n\nto prove all the elements of the DWI, .15 to .20, in order to have the sentencing enhancement.”\n\n\n\n\n       2\n          For purposes of this opinion, BAC will be used to describe both blood alcohol\nconcentration, expressed as a percentage “by weight by volume,” Code § 18.2-266, and breath\nalcohol concentration, measured in grams “per 210 liters of breath,” id.

Md. 1997)\n(“In this [opinion], BAC is defined as either blood alcohol concentration, stated as grams per 100\nmilliliters of blood or as breath alcohol concentration, stated as grams per 210 liters of breath,\nand is reported without a ‘%’ sign.”).\n\n                                               -3-\n\fBut the Commonwealth distinguished Booker as “a totally different situation, because those were\n\npost-trial findings. This is a trial finding.”\n\n        The court rejected Morin’s various motions and tried the case to a jury. The arresting\n\nofficer presented his testimony about Morin’s intoxicated state at the time of her arrest. The\n\nofficer also presented the certificate of analysis showing the .20 BAC finding from the breath\n\ntest. After the Commonwealth rested, Morin called her husband and two friends to the stand\n\nwho testified that Morin had been drinking light beer that night — but not very much. After they\n\ntestified, Morin took the stand in her own defense. She testified that she, her husband, and her\n\nfriends had been to various bars that night. She admitted drinking beer but denied ever being\n\nintoxicated.\n\n        Morin also presented expert testimony from a toxicologist about the tests employed by\n\nthe Commonwealth to measure BAC. The toxicologist described the rate of absorption of\n\nalcohol in a person’s blood and the effects of various variables such as body weight, age, size,\n\nfood consumption, and the like. He added that timing was particularly important. While .03\n\nBAC could be added by each bottle of light beer, the toxicologist estimated that .01 BAC would\n\nbe eliminated in the blood over an hour’s time.\n\n        The defense toxicologist concluded that a person of Morin’s physical characteristics\n\nwould have had a .06 BAC if she consumed less than five beers over the time frame described by\n\nMorin. He conceded his opinion was “based on the accuracy” of Morin’s statements. For the\n\nBAC to be as high as .20, the toxicologist said, Morin would have had to consume about ten to\n\neleven beers that night. He added that the breath test may have produced a false reading because\n\nof indigestion gas or other factors skewing the sampling procedure.\n\n        The court then addressed with counsel the subject of jury instructions. The prosecutor\n\nrequested a finding instruction that took into account that the jurors could find the BAC “could\n\n\n                                                 -4-\n\fhave been less than .20” but still not as low as the .06 figure hypothesized by the toxicologist.\n\nThe prosecutor also asked that the instruction permit the jury to convict on either or both of the\n\ntwo relevant theories of liability under Code § 18.2-266 — a per se violation of subsection (i)\n\ndue to driving with a BAC of .08 or more, or a violation of subsection (ii)’s prohibition of\n\ndriving under the influence. The trial court agreed and incorporated both in the finding\n\ninstruction. The court also gave another instruction defining “under the influence” to include an\n\naccused who “has drunk enough alcoholic beverages to so affect her manner, disposition, speech,\n\nmuscular movement, general appearance or behavior as to be apparent to observation.”\n\n       The last paragraph of the finding instruction included a specific factfinding task: “If you\n\nfind the defendant guilty because she had a concentration of 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per\n\n210 liters of breath, then you shall indicate whether you find that [her] concentration was: (1)\n\n0.08 or greater, (2) at least 0.15 but less than 0.20 or (3) less than 0.15.” Agreeing with the\n\nprosecutor, the court explained to Morin’s counsel that this language allowed the jurors to find\n\nher guilty with “no mandatory minimum” sentence. See Code § 18.2-270(A) (imposing a 5-day\n\nmandatory minimum jail term for convictions accompanied by a ≥ .15 but ≤ .20 BAC and a\n\n10-day term for BACs higher than .20). Neither Morin nor the prosecutor, however, asked the\n\ncourt to instruct the jury on the “rebuttable presumptions” that permit inferences of driving under\n\nthe influence based upon certain BAC levels. See Code § 18.2-269.\n\n       During closing argument, the prosecutor repeated several times that the jury could find\n\nMorin guilty under either or both of the two proof regimes approved by Code § 18.2-266(i) and\n\n(ii). The verdict form did not distinguish between the two. The guilt option of the verdict form\n\nread: “We, the jury, find the Defendant Guilty of DWI, 1st as charged in the summons, with a\n\nBlood Alcohol Content of ____________.” During their deliberations, the jury questioned this.\n\n“Re: Verdict Sheet,” the jurors asked, “[b]ased on a guilty verdict, is the jury required to assess a\n\n\n                                                -5-\n\fblood alcohol level by choosing one of the three options in Instruction #4 paragraph #4 (1), (2),\n\nor (3) or can we find her guilty without selecting one of the options?” The court answered with\n\nan admonition to read the finding instruction carefully. The jury shortly thereafter returned with\n\na verdict reading: “We, the Jury, find the Defendant Guilty of DWI, 1st as charged in the\n\nsummons, with a Blood Alcohol Content of (3) less than .15.” They added the underscored\n\nlanguage by hand.\n\n       After the jury imposed punishment, Morin moved to set aside the verdict claiming it\n\nrested on insufficient evidence. The only believable BAC evidence, she asserted, was the\n\ntoxicologist’s estimate of a .06 BAC. Having rejected the .20 BAC presented by the\n\nCommonwealth, Morin’s counsel reasoned, the jury had no choice but to accept the\n\ntoxicologist’s opinion and to acquit her of a subsection (i) violation for driving with a BAC of\n\n.08 or more. Alluding to subsection (ii), the court questioned counsel’s reasoning: “Do you\n\nthink this record supports the jury’s verdict of driving under the influence?” “Yes,” counsel\n\nanswered, “I think it could support that verdict.” “And that could be less than .15,” the court\n\nnoted, “[a]nd that’s what they found.” The court denied Morin’s motion and entered final\n\njudgment.\n\n                                                 II.\n\n       Morin appeals on three grounds. She first claims the jury acquitted her of driving under\n\nthe influence (subsection (ii) of § 18.2-266) and limited its guilty finding solely to driving while\n\nhaving a BAC of .08 or higher (subsection (i) of § 18.2-266). With that limitation, the\n\nconviction could not stand because the jury had no choice but to accept the toxicologist’s\n\nestimate of a maximum BAC of .06. Second, Morin renews her assertion that the arrest warrant\n\n\n\n\n                                                -6-\n\fasserted multifarious charges grouped as a single charge under Code § 18.2-266. Finally, Morin\n\nattacks the constitutionality of the “rebuttable presumptions” adopted by Code § 18.2-269.\n\n       We find none of these arguments persuasive.\n\n         A. THE EVIDENTIARY SUFFICIENCY OF A SUBSECTION (i) PER SE CONVICTION\n\n       Morin states her first question presented this way: “Whether the trial evidence supported\n\nthe verdict of driving with a blood alcohol level range of .08 to less than .15?” Appellant’s Br. at\n\n1. She then goes on to answer that question with the assertion that the jury had but two options\n\nwith respect to the BAC evidence: first, either to wholly accept the Commonwealth’s evidence\n\nof a .20 BAC, or, second, to wholly accept Morin’s claim to have consumed less than five beers,\n\nthereby placing her BAC below .08 (as her toxicologist testified). What the jury did, Morin\n\nclaims, it could not do — and that is to find her guilty for a per se violation while simultaneously\n\ndetermining her BAC to be “less than” .15. We reject this argument as flawed both in its first\n\npremise and in its application to the facts of this case.\n\n       To begin with, Morin assumes that the jury acquitted her of driving under the influence\n\nunder Code § 18.2-266(ii) and convicted her only of the per se offense of driving with a BAC\n\nlevel of .08 or more under Code § 18.2-266(i). We see no basis in the trial record for this\n\nassumption. The finding instruction permitted a conviction on either or both grounds. A\n\nseparate definitional instruction spelled out the circumstances satisfying the subsection (ii)\n\nstandard for driving under the influence. The prosecutor addressed each ground separately\n\nduring his closing argument and invited the jury to convict on both. If the verdict form implies\n\nanything, it suggests the jurors did just that. Indeed, the verdict specifically stated they found\n\nMorin guilty “as charged” in the summons. The summons and arrest warrant charged Morin\n\nwith violating Code § 18.2-266 and did not limit itself to a per se theory of liability under\n\n\n\n\n                                                 -7-\n\fsubsection (i). A DUI verdict finding an accused guilty “as charged” in a warrant citing Code\n\n§ 18.2-266 requires that we address on appeal “both subsection (i) and subsection (ii) of Code\n\n§ 18.2-266.” Yap v.

But that directive did not\n\npreclude the jury from specifying the BAC after finding Morin guilty on both subsection (i) and\n\n(ii) grounds. To be sure, given the guilty “as charged” language, the most plausible reading of\n\nthe verdict is that the jury convicted Morin under both theories of criminal liability.\n\n        The context of the finding instruction also refutes Morin’s argument. As the trial judge\n\nnoted in his colloquy with counsel, the .15 and .20 BAC thresholds in the finding instruction do\n\nnot correspond to the evidentiary presumptions of Code § 18.2-269, which uses BAC thresholds\n\nof .05 and .08 for purposes of inferring intoxication. Code § 18.2-269(A) applies these\n\ninferences to prosecutions for violations of “clause (ii), (iii) or (iv) of § 18.2-266” — but not to\n\nviolations of subsection (i). See Davis v.

Nothing in the finding instruction implied that by making the specific BAC\n\n\n\n\n        3\n          The jury’s verdict form for the guilt phase of the trial finds Morin’s BAC to be “less\nthan .15.” The final judgment order likewise recites the jury’s finding as “guilty as charged”\nwith a BAC “less than .15.” The verdict form for the sentencing phase of the trial, however,\nrecites the guilt findings as “at least .08 but less than .15.” Morin did not at trial, nor does she on\nappeal, object to the inconsistency between the final judgment order, which recites accurately the\nguilt verdict, and the prefatory language of the sentencing verdict, which does not.\n\n                                                   -8-\n\fdetermination the jurors necessarily were choosing to acquit Morin of driving under the\n\ninfluence and to convict her only of a per se violation.4\n\n       Perhaps, as Morin suggests, the jury “desired to show leniency,” Appellant’s Br. at 15, by\n\nfinding her guilty but fixing her BAC below the .15 threshold despite the Commonwealth’s\n\nevidence of a .20 BAC. We acknowledge this possibility. The finding instruction, after all,\n\nmentions the ≤ .15 and ≥ .20 BAC levels with no context whatsoever, thus leaving the jurors free\n\nto correctly suppose its relevance had nothing to do with guilt and everything to do with\n\npunishment.\n\n       We fail to see, however, how this speculation supports Morin’s appellate request for\n\nexoneration. “Consistency in jury verdicts is not required.” Gaines v.

It is easy to see why this is so.

Even if we were to accept Morin’s assertion that the verdict “guilty as\n\ncharged” was inconsistent with the jury’s BAC finding, that ambiguity is far more tolerable than\n\nan unwarranted reversal of a conviction on the ground that the verdict arguably included an\n\nunderstandable, but logically inconsistent, emotive element of clemency.\n\n       In short, Morin’s argument makes an assumption we are unwilling to accept — that the\n\njury acquitted her of driving under the influence under Code § 18.2-266(ii), despite\n\n\n\n       4\n          The only point of the .15 and .20 BAC thresholds, as the trial court noted, was to\ndetermine the appropriate mandatory minimum punishment under Code § 18.2-270(A). By\nmaking a finding of “less than” .15 BAC, the jurors were not applying the evidentiary\npresumptions of Code § 18.2-269. They had never been instructed on those presumptions. The\ntrial judge offered Morin the opportunity to present an instruction on this topic; she decided\nagainst it.\n\n                                                -9-\n\foverwhelming evidence of her guilt, and found her guilty only of the per se offense of driving\n\nwith a BAC of .08 or more in violation of Code § 18.2-266(i).

The jury could have\n\nsimilarly discounted the toxicologist’s low-ball BAC estimate as naïvely reliant on the criminal\n\ndefendant’s self-serving claim that she drank no more than five beers that night. Between these\n\ntwo evidentiary poles, the jury could have concluded that the BAC exceeded .08 but was less\n\nthan .15.

Short of dismissal, Morin\n\ncontends, the trial court should have forced the Commonwealth to elect before trial between the\n\nseparate theories of liability recognized by subsections (i) and (ii) of Code § 18.2-266.

Nor does she\n\nmention that the DUI statute itself states a “charge alleging a violation of this section shall\n\nsupport a conviction under clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), or (v).” Code § 18.2-266.5\n\n       5\n          In this case, as in Cutright, the Commonwealth “charged [the defendant] with violating\nall four subsections of Code § 18.2-266.

Practically speaking, for us to intelligently rule on Morin’s unadorned double\n\njeopardy and due process assertions, we would first need to frame the specific constitutional\n\nrights at stake, discern which lines of judicial authority (if any) support or refute her assertions,\n\nprovide the Commonwealth with an opportunity to respond to those precedents (necessitating\n\nadditional briefing because the Attorney General would not know which precedents we thought\n\nrelevant until we informed him), and then decide upon the best possible answer to the best\n\npossible articulation of Morin’s position. None of this can we do. “Suffice it to say, such an\n\nexercise of sua sponte judicial power would impermissibly place us in the role of advocate — far\n\noutside the boundaries of our traditional adjudicative duties.” Johnson v.

THE REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTIONS OF CODE § 18.2-269\n\n       Morin challenges the constitutionality of the “rebuttable presumptions” employed by\n\nCode § 18.2-269. This argument fails at its inception because the jury was never instructed on\n\nthese rebuttable presumptions and Code § 18.2-269(A), moreover, makes clear the presumptions\n\ndo not apply to per se violations under Code § 18.2-266(i) — the only theory on which Morin\n\nclaims to have been convicted. The presumption Morin misidentifies, but nonetheless means to\n\ntarget, is the implication inherent in Code § 18.2-266(i), which permits the factfinder to infer that\n\nthe BAC level determined by a timely breath test accurately states the BAC level at the time of\n\ndriving. See Davis, 8 Va. App. at 298, 381 S.E.2d at 315.6 While sometimes called a “rebuttable\n\npresumption,” the later-BAC-implies-prior-BAC principle underlying Code § 18.2-266(i) is no\n\nmore than a permissible evidentiary inference that the factfinder may accept or reject.
