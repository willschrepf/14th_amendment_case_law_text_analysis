Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\fApril 3, 2013\n\f           LYNCH, Chief Judge.       In Kaiser Foundation Health Plan,\n\nInc. v. Pfizer, Inc. (Kaiser), Nos. 11-1904, 11-2096 (1st Cir. ____\n\n__, 2013), a related appeal in which we also issue an opinion\n\ntoday, we affirmed a court and jury verdict against Pfizer, Inc.\n\n(\"Pfizer\"), under section 1962 of the Racketeer Influenced and\n\nCorrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-68, and a state\n\nstatute, for fraudulent marketing of off-label uses of its drug\n\nNeurontin.    The arguments presented in Kaiser and in another\n\nrelated   appeal   in   which   we   issue   an   opinion   today,   Harden\n\nManufacturing Co. v. Pfizer, Inc., No. 11-1806 (1st Cir. ____ __,\n\n2013), on most issues are the same as or parallel to those\n\npresented in this appeal, which concerns the claims of Aetna, Inc.\n\n(\"Aetna\") against Pfizer.       Many of the arguments made by Pfizer\n\nagainst Aetna in this case were rejected in Kaiser.\n\n           This case comes to us on Aetna's appeal from a grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Pfizer and against Aetna.               In the\n\nKaiser case, after trial, Pfizer lost.        While the trial record in\n\nKaiser was somewhat larger than the record here, the record on\n\nsummary judgment in this case was very similar and included much\n\nthe same expert and other evidence as to causation.\n\n           The outcome of this case turns on whether Aetna, a health\n\ninsurer which makes claims of harm from third-party payments for\n\nits insureds' fraudulently induced prescriptions, is so differently\n\nsituated from Kaiser that summary judgment was correctly entered\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fagainst it, thus precluding it from proving its case to a jury.\n\nThe district court largely distinguished this case from Kaiser's on\n\nthe   basis      that     Kaiser      had      much     stronger        evidence   of\n\nmisrepresentations made directly to Kaiser and reliance by Kaiser\n\non those misrepresentations in its formulary decisions.\n\n            We conclude that Aetna presented evidence of causation\n\nand damages sufficient to survive summary judgment on its RICO\n\nclaim, and reverse the dismissal of this claim.                       We vacate the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of Aetna's claim under the Pennsylvania\n\nInsurance Fraud Statute (PIFS), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 4117.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            We assume familiarity with the description of this case's\n\nprocedural history and facts set forth in Kaiser, slip op. at 3-22.\n\nOn February 1, 2005, Aetna filed a coordinated complaint with\n\nKaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals\n\n(together, \"Kaiser\") and Guardian Life Insurance Company of America\n\n(\"Guardian\") in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts against\n\nPfizer    and   Warner-Lambert        Company      (together,     \"Pfizer\").       The\n\ncoordinated plaintiffs asserted that they had suffered injury from\n\nthe fraudulent marketing of Neurontin for off-label uses, and\n\nalleged   violations      of,    inter   alia,      RICO    and   the    PIFS.     The\n\ncoordinated     complaint       was   part    of   a   multidistrict      litigation\n\n(\"MDL\")    which    had     been      consolidated         in   the     District    of\n\nMassachusetts on November 24, 2004.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f          On March 2, 2009, Pfizer filed a motion seeking summary\n\njudgment on all of the coordinated plaintiffs' pending claims.   On\n\nJanuary 8, 2010, the district court granted Pfizer's motion in\n\npart, dismissing the claims of Guardian and Aetna, but denying\n\nsummary judgment as to Kaiser's claims.   See In re Neurontin Mktg.\n\n& Sales Practices Litig. (Neurontin Coordinated SJ), 677 F. Supp.\n\n2d 479, 499 (D. Mass. 2010).   The court entered judgment against\n\nGuardian and Aetna and in favor of Pfizer on February 9, 2011, and\n\non April 20, 2011, the court denied Aetna's motion to alter or\n\namend judgment and motion for reconsideration.     On May 19, 2011,\n\nAetna timely filed a notice of appeal as to the district court's\n\njudgment against Aetna and the court's denial of Aetna's motion for\n\nreconsideration.\n\n                               II.\n\n          We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, \"drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving\n\nparty   while   ignoring   'conclusory    allegations,   improbable\n\ninferences, and unsupported speculation.'\" Sutliffe v. Epping Sch.\n\nDist., 584 F.3d 314, 325 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Sullivan v. City\n\nof Springfield, 561 F.3d 7, 14 (1st Cir. 2009)).    We must reverse\n\na grant of summary judgment if we find that \"the nonmovant has\n\n'established a genuine issue of material fact that a reasonable\n\njury could resolve in their favor.'\"   Rockwood v. SKF USA Inc., 687\n\nF.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2012) (emphasis omitted) (quoting Collins v.\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fUniv. of N.H., 664 F.3d 8, 19 (1st Cir. 2011)).                   We assume\n\nfamiliarity   with   the    background   facts    concerning     Neurontin's\n\ndevelopment and FDA approval described in Kaiser, slip op. at 7-8.\n\nThese were not disputed at summary judgment.         We describe only the\n\nfacts relevant to Aetna's appeal.\n\nA.         Neurontin's Effectiveness for Off-Label Uses\n\n           As the district court noted, Aetna presented studies\n\nshowing that Neurontin was not more effective than a placebo in\n\ntreating certain off-label indications.          These studies included:\n\nfour   clinical   studies    regarding   bipolar     disorder,     Neurontin\n\nCoordinated SJ, 677 F. Supp. 2d at 489; six clinical trials\n\nregarding neuropathic pain, id.; four clinical trials regarding\n\nnociceptive pain, id. at 490; three studies regarding migraine,\n\nid.; and three clinical trials regarding doses above 1800 mg per\n\nday, id. at 490-91.\n\nB.         Defendants' Marketing of Neurontin for Off-Label Uses\n\n           Beginning in late 1995 and early 1996, Parke-Davis, a\n\nsubsidiary of Warner-Lambert, began marketing Neurontin as an\n\neffective treatment for bipolar disorder and other mood disorders,\n\nneuropathic and nociceptive pain, migraines and other headaches,\n\nand doses above 1800 mg per day, though the FDA had not approved\n\nNeurontin for these off-label uses.              These marketing efforts\n\ncontinued after Pfizer purchased Parke-Davis in 2000, through at\n\nleast 2001, and are described in Kaiser, slip op. at 8-9.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            As the district court stated, Aetna \"presented evidence\n\nthat Defendants communicated half truths that are actionable under\n\nthe RICO statute\" in conducting this marketing, including by\n\n\"suppressing negative information while submitting for publication\n\nin monographs positive information about off-label indications.\"\n\nNeurontin Coordinated SJ, 677 F. Supp. 2d at 492; see also id. at\n\n495, 498-99.    Pfizer does not argue to the contrary on appeal.\n\nC.        Defendants' Targeting of Third-Party Payors (\"TPPs\"),\n          Including Aetna\n\n          Defendants' efforts to promote Neurontin, for both on-\n\nlabel and off-label uses, demonstrated their understanding that\n\nTPPs, including Aetna, would both play a role in determining demand\n\nfor Neurontin (by managing access to formularies, or lists of drugs\n\nfor which TPPs would pay) and ultimately pay for most prescriptions\n\nof Neurontin.\n\n          In 1993, Parke-Davis listed Aetna as the number four\n\nmanaged care plan it intended to target to encourage the use of\n\nNeurontin as an anticonvulsant.    In 1994, Parke-Davis commissioned\n\na survey of the pharmacy directors of ten managed care plans,\n\nincluding Aetna.   This study concluded that these plans, including\n\nAetna,   were   unlikely   to   place   formulary   restrictions   on\n\nanticonvulsants.    A 1998 Parke-Davis business plan stated that,\n\n\"[i]n general, formulary access is not an issue for Neurontin so\n\nshare building programs can be carried out unrestricted.\"     Pfizer\n\nprepared a marketing business plan regarding Aetna in 2002 that\n\n                                  -7-\n\fnoted that Pfizer's \"sales representatives have open access to the\n\nproviders\" in Aetna's network.         That same year, Pfizer established\n\na Neurontin Outcomes Research Task Force that sought to support the\n\nmarketing of Neurontin for neuropathic pain and to prepare \"for a\n\nmore vigorous defense of reimbursement\" to managed care plans.            In\n\n2003,    as    Neurontin's    patent     neared   expiration,    defendants\n\ncommissioned a study by a market research company of how TPPs would\n\nreact to a new tablet form of the drug intended to compete with\n\ngeneric forms of the drug.       The market research company conducted\n\nfocus groups with TPP representatives, including representatives\n\nfrom    Aetna.     Pfizer    prepared    \"HMO   Opportunity   Reports\"   for\n\nNeurontin that tracked formulary status, projected annual sales and\n\nprescriptions, potential profits, and market share for various\n\nHMOs, including Aetna.       Pfizer also tracked sources of revenue for\n\nNeurontin sales; in 2001, Pfizer recorded that 69% of its Neurontin\n\nrevenues came from TPPs.\n\nD.            Aetna's Decision to Pay for Neurontin Prescriptions\n\n              Aetna, a large TPP, provides health payment benefits to\n\nmore than 13 million people across the country.                 Aetna added\n\nNeurontin to its formulary -- a list of drugs it agreed to pay for\n\nunder its member contracts -- soon after the FDA approved Neurontin\n\nin 1993 for use as an add-on therapy in the treatment of epilepsy.\n\n              Aetna had a formulary development team comprised of\n\npharmacists who developed clinical reviews of drug classes to\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fpresent to Aetna's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (\"P & T\n\nCommittee\").    These reviews presented all the clinical information\n\navailable to Aetna about a drug class, and included all the drugs\n\nwithin a class used for a particular therapeutic purpose.                       The\n\nformulary    development      team   looked     at     package    inserts,     drug\n\ncompendia, and online collections of clinical research, and also\n\nmet with drug manufacturers to get information that had not been\n\npublished.\n\n            Aetna's P & T Committee met monthly to determine what\n\nwould be included on formularies, as well as appropriate coverage\n\nrestrictions on drug classes, by majority vote.                    The Committee\n\nreviewed clinical drug reviews, previous clinical policy bulletins\n\nthe Committee had issued, and any other formulary documents (such\n\nas formulary guides disseminated to doctors).                     The Committee\n\nconsidered   the    safety,    efficacy,       on-labeled     indications,      and\n\noff-label indications of drugs, as well as cost information and the\n\nother drugs within a class.          To control drug prescriptions, Aetna\n\nused formulary controls and mailings to physicians.\n\n            Aetna   initially        decided     not     to   place    formulary\n\nrestrictions on the anticonvulsant drug class, which included\n\nNeurontin.     In late 2003, however, Aetna decided to manage the\n\nclass of anticonvulsants because it wanted to encourage the use of\n\nfirst-line     monotherapy      drugs.          Neurontin        was   moved    to\n\n\"non-preferred\" status.        That is, Aetna imposed quantity (i.e.,\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fdose) limits on Neurontin prescriptions in 2004, and step edits\n\n(under which other drugs needed to be tried before Neurontin could\n\nbe prescribed) in 2006.         Some other anticonvulsants were moved to\n\nnon-preferred status at the same time.\n\n               Michael Brodeur, the head of formulary development and\n\nclinical pharmacy policies at Aetna, had communications with Pfizer\n\nand     Warner-Lambert,       but   did     not    remember   any     specific\n\ncommunications about Neurontin. Aetna conceded that defendants, in\n\nany communications to Aetna about Neurontin, had not made any\n\ndirect misrepresentations to it, its P & T Committee, or its\n\nformulary development team.          Before January 2004, Aetna did not\n\nmanage the drug class which included Neurontin. But Brodeur stated\n\nthat,    had    the   facts   concerning    the   manufacturers'    misleading\n\nmarketing campaign surfaced earlier, he believed this would have\n\nled Aetna to start to manage this drug class at an earlier date.\n\nE.             Statistical Evidence of Causation\n\n               The summary judgment record included the statistical\n\nevidence presented by experts Dr. Meredith Rosenthal, Ph.D., and\n\nDr. Raymond Hartman, Ph.D., that we described in Kaiser, slip op.\n\nat 13-16, 19-20.       For the reasons stated in Kaiser, that evidence\n\ncould be found by a reasonable factfinder to show that Pfizer's\n\nmarketing of Neurontin for off-label indications caused a sharp\n\nincrease in the number of prescriptions that Aetna paid for or\n\nreimbursed.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f          Dr. Rosenthal, an associate professor of health economics\n\nand policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, submitted an\n\nexpert report in which she used \"standard econometric methods\" to\n\nquantify the impact of defendants' promotional activities on the\n\nnumber of off-label prescriptions of Neurontin written.                      Dr.\n\nRosenthal's   data     on    promotional     spending   included      defendants'\n\nexpenditures on detailing and advertising in professional journals.\n\nHer database included prescriptions paid for by Aetna, as did Dr.\n\nHartman's.\n\n          Dr. Rosenthal's analysis demonstrated that defendants'\n\nmarketing of Neurontin for the off-label indications of bipolar,\n\nneuropathic pain, nociceptive pain, migraine, and doses over 1800\n\nmg per day caused 43 million off-label prescriptions of Neurontin\n\nbetween 1995 and 2004.            This total included prescriptions for\n\nNeurontin for these uses paid for by Aetna.                She concluded that\n\nnationally during this period, defendants' off-label marketing\n\ncaused   99.4%    of        the   Neurontin     prescriptions      written    by\n\npsychiatrists for bipolar; 27.9% of the Neurontin prescriptions\n\nwritten by neurologists for migraine; 70.0% of the Neurontin\n\nprescriptions    for    neuropathic        pain;   84.7%   of   the    Neurontin\n\nprescriptions for nociceptive pain; and 37.5% of the Neurontin\n\nprescriptions for doses exceeding 1800 mg per day.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f                                      III.\n\n           In ruling on defendants' motion for summary judgment, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that Aetna had \"presented evidence that\n\nDefendants communicated half truths that are actionable under the\n\nRICO statute,\" Neurontin Coordinated SJ, 677 F. Supp. 2d at 492,\n\nand that plaintiffs \"presented sufficient evidence to support\n\n[their] RICO claim that Neurontin was ineffective for the off-label\n\nindications,\" so that they sustained injury from paying for off-\n\nlabel prescriptions of Neurontin, id. at 498.\n\n           However, the court also determined that:\n\n     There is no evidence in the record that Guardian or Aetna\n     at any point directly relied on Pfizer's \"half truths,\"\n     communicated through its alleged manipulation and\n     withholding of studies that suggested Neurontin's\n     ineffectiveness for off-label indications. Rather, their\n     causation argument is wholly dependent on individualized\n     proof that their members' prescribing physicians relied\n     on defendants' misrepresentations. Because the Court has\n     concluded that the evidence provided in support of this\n     theory, namely the aggregate evidence presented in Dr.\n     Meredith Rosenthal's report, is legally insufficient to\n     effectively segregate damages caused by Defendants'\n     misrepresentations from damages caused by other sources,\n     Guardian and Aetna cannot rely solely on the aggregate\n     evidence to prove causation. Accordingly, the motion for\n     summary judgment with respect to Guardian and Aetna will\n     be allowed.\n\nId. at 497 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). The district court\n\ndetermined that \"[w]hile each of the Coordinated Plaintiffs can\n\nprove   through   aggregated    proof    that   the    fraudulent    marketing\n\ncampaign   likely   caused   them     injury,   they    cannot   prove   which\n\ndoctor's   prescriptions       were    caused   by     Defendants'     alleged\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\ffraudulent misrepresentations or omissions and which were not.\"\n\nId. at 495.     Because Aetna did not present proof of its direct\n\nreliance upon defendants' misrepresentations,1 as Kaiser did, the\n\ncourt concluded that Aetna's evidence of but-for causation -- which\n\nrelied   largely    on    aggregate      statistical      evidence    --   was\n\ninsufficient as a matter of law.              The district court granted\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment as to Guardian and Aetna's\n\nclaims, including Aetna's claim under the PIFS (though the court\n\ndid not discuss this claim separately).          Id. at 499.\n\n          Aetna argues on appeal that the district court erred in\n\nrejecting its aggregate evidence of causation and damages under\n\nRICO and in requiring Aetna to present stronger evidence of direct\n\nmisrepresentations and reliance as to its formulary.             Aetna also\n\nargues that the court erred in dismissing its claim under the PIFS.\n\nDefendants    respond    that   the   court   correctly    rejected   Aetna's\n\naggregate evidence and PIFS claim, and that Aetna's RICO claim was\n\nfurther doomed by its failure to present evidence of proximate\n\ncausation or injury.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Aetna argues on appeal that in addition to its aggregate\nevidence of but-for causation, it presented Brodeur's testimony as\nto the effect of Pfizer's suppression of negative information about\nNeurontin's off-label effectiveness on Aetna's decision not to\nimpose restrictions on Neurontin in its formulary.      Because we\nconclude that Aetna's aggregate evidence of but-for causation was\nsufficient to survive summary judgment, we need not separately\nconsider the adequacy of Brodeur's testimony.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fA.           RICO: But-For Causation and Aggregate Evidence\n\n             The but-for causation question in this case is \"whether,\n\nabsent Pfizer's fraud, [a plaintiff TPP] would have paid for fewer\n\noff-label Neurontin prescriptions.\"        Kaiser, slip op. at 24.    In\n\nKaiser, we noted \"the use of . . . aggregate evidence to show\n\ncausation under several causes of action\" and concluded that there\n\nwas \"no reason to reach a different conclusion for the specific\n\nsubset of RICO claims based on fraudulent marketing.\"         Id. at 54.\n\nWe believe the evidence Aetna presented on but-for causation --\n\nthat in the absence of Pfizer's alleged fraud, Aetna would have\n\npaid for fewer off-label prescriptions of Neurontin -- survives\n\nsummary judgment.2    Aetna's evidence of but-for causation included\n\nnot   only    aggregate   statistical    evidence,   but   circumstantial\n\nevidence, such as the increase in off-label prescriptions of\n\nNeurontin following the initiation of Pfizer's alleged fraudulent\n\nmarketing efforts, and the fact that Pfizer embarked on these\n\nefforts in order to increase sales of Neurontin for off-label uses.\n\nThe absence of evidence from individual doctors in this record does\n\nnot defeat our conclusion that summary judgment was inappropriately\n\n\n\n      2\n        Defendants argue on appeal that \"[a]ggregate proof of\nreliance in these circumstances is impermissible for the additional\nreason that it represents a back-door attempt to invoke the 'fraud\non the market' doctrine, which is limited to the securities context\nand cannot be applied to Plaintiffs' RICO claims.\" As we explained\nin Kaiser, slip op. at 29 n.9, the analogy between the fraud-on-\nthe-market doctrine and the use of aggregate evidence in civil RICO\ncases is inapt.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fgranted.3    It should have been left to a jury to weigh the\n\naggregate and circumstantial evidence of causation presented by\n\nAetna against any failure to present individualized testimony from\n\ndoctors.\n\n            While Aetna did have the burden of \"segregat[ing] damages\n\ncaused by Defendants' misrepresentations from damages caused by\n\nother sources,\" Neurontin Coordinated SJ, 677 F. Supp. 2d at 497,\n\nthis did not mean that Aetna was required to \"prove which doctor's\n\nprescriptions    were   caused   by   Defendants'   alleged   fraudulent\n\nmisrepresentations,\" id. at 495, as the district court concluded.\n\nQuantifying the damages caused by defendants' alleged fraud belongs\n\nto the damages phase of Aetna's RICO case, and \"[o]n that phase of\n\nthe case the plaintiff has a more relaxed burden of proof.\"         BCS\n\nServs., Inc. v. Heartwood 88, LLC, 637 F.3d 750, 759 (7th Cir.\n\n2011).\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       Defendants argue that Aetna failed to make an adequate\nshowing of but-for causation because it \"did not produce a single\ndoctor who claimed to have 'relied on a misrepresentation or\nomission in prescribing Neurontin for an off-label indication.'\"\nDefs.' Br. at 19 (quoting Neurontin Coordinated SJ, 677 F. Supp. 2d\nat 495). Aetna's failure to present the form of but-for causation\nevidence that defendants would have favored does not mean that the\nevidence Aetna did present was insufficient for a jury to conclude\nthat Aetna showed the needed causation. Moreover, as we noted in\nKaiser, slip op. at 50, relying on physicians' individual\nrecollections as to their prescribing decisions might have been an\nunreliable approach.\n\n                                  -15-\n\fB.         RICO: Proximate Causation\n\n           Pfizer also argues that summary judgment was, in any\n\nevent,   appropriate      because    there   was       inadequate    evidence   of\n\nproximate causation. For reasons similar to those we enunciated in\n\nKaiser, we   conclude      that   Aetna   made     a    sufficient    showing   of\n\nproximate causation to withstand summary judgment.\n\n           Regarding Pfizer's argument that Aetna, unlike Kaiser,\n\nhas not shown direct reliance on Pfizer's misrepresentations,\n\ndirect reliance is not an element of proximate cause in a private\n\nRICO claim predicated on mail fraud.          See Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &\n\nIndem. Co., 128 S. Ct. 2131, 2134 (2008).                     Moreover, Aetna's\n\naggregate statistical evidence of causation did not rely upon the\n\ntheory that direct misrepresentations by Pfizer influenced Aetna's\n\nmanagement of its formulary.         Instead, Dr. Rosenthal demonstrated\n\na causal relationship between Pfizer's alleged fraudulent marketing\n\nto doctors and Aetna's payment for off-label prescriptions of\n\nNeurontin. Aetna did not have to show direct reliance to establish\n\nproximate or but-for causation.\n\n           A jury could have found that Aetna, like Kaiser, was \"the\n\nprimary and intended victim[] of the scheme to defraud,\" id. at\n\n2139, and that the injury suffered was a \"foreseeable and natural\n\nconsequence\" of the fraudulent scheme, id. at 2144.                  Because TPPs\n\nultimately   paid   for    most     prescriptions        of   Neurontin,   Pfizer\n\nmonitored TPPs' management of Neurontin on their formularies, kept\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\ftrack of sales to TPPs, and targeted TPPs as Neurontin customers,\n\nwith respect to both on-label and off-label sales of the drug.\n\nDefendants particularly monitored sales to Aetna, targeted Aetna as\n\na Neurontin customer, and sought information from Aetna about its\n\nformulary management practices and willingness to pay for Neurontin\n\ninstead   of     generic    gabapentin.       Pfizer      prepared    a   marketing\n\nbusiness plan targeting Aetna.                A reasonable jury could have\n\nconcluded based on this evidence that Aetna was the intended victim\n\nof defendants' fraudulent scheme and that Aetna's economic injury\n\nwas a \"foreseeable and natural consequence\" of this scheme.                      That\n\nis so even if the scheme involved making misrepresentations to\n\ndoctors about Neurontin's off-label effectiveness instead of making\n\nthose misrepresentations directly to Aetna itself.\n\n               The functional tests for proximate cause articulated in\n\nHolmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., 503 U.S. 258, 269-\n\n70 (1992), further favor the conclusion that Aetna made an adequate\n\nproximate causation showing.           A jury could have ascertained the\n\namount    of    Aetna's    damages   based     on   Dr.   Rosenthal's      and    Dr.\n\nHartman's expert reports; Aetna alone suffered the damages it\n\nalleged, so there was no risk of multiple recoveries; and as the\n\nparty directly injured, Aetna was best placed to act as a private\n\nattorney general.         Id.\n\n               The   \"individualized    decisions      made   by     thousands     of\n\nphysicians who decided to prescribe Neurontin\" do not introduce\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fsuch attenuation   into   Aetna's causal    theory   as to   prevent   a\n\nreasonable jury from finding proximate causation, as defendants\n\ncontend.   A reasonable jury could have concluded, based on the\n\nevidence, that defendants' scheme relied upon the expectation that\n\nfraudulent off-label marketing to doctors would induce them to act\n\nin a foreseeable fashion -- i.e., to write off-label prescriptions\n\nfor Neurontin that would be paid for by Aetna.\n\nC.         RICO: Economic Injury\n\n           Defendants argue on appeal that the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment may also be affirmed on the alternate\n\ntheory, rejected by the district court, that Aetna failed to\n\npresent evidence of economic injury.       Defendants argue that, to\n\nestablish the economic injury needed to make out its civil RICO\n\nclaim, Aetna was required to prove that Neurontin was always\n\nineffective for the off-label uses at issue,4 and that Aetna failed\n\nto produce evidence of ineffectiveness at summary judgment.\n\nDefendants are incorrect.     Aetna presented evidence at summary\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       Defendants argue that Aetna \"expressly disavowed any burden\"\nto prove Neurontin's ineffectiveness, and instead opposed summary\njudgment based on a purportedly invalid \"cheaper alternative\"\ntheory of economic injury. That misrepresents Aetna's arguments\nthat it could prove economic injury based either on a \"cheaper\nalternative\" theory or on a theory of Neurontin's ineffectiveness.\nSee Coordinated Pls.' Mem. Law in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. at\n18-21 & n.16. Because we conclude that Aetna presented sufficient\nevidence of Neurontin's ineffectiveness to survive summary\njudgment, we need not pass on the viability of the \"cheaper\nalternative\" theory of injury.\n\n                                -18-\n\fjudgment5 that multiple clinical trials had demonstrated that\n\nNeurontin was no more effective than placebo in treating the off-\n\nlabel conditions at issue. A reasonable jury could have found from\n\nthe evidence on the summary judgment record that Neurontin was\n\nineffective   for   these   uses,6   as     the   district   court   correctly\n\nconcluded.    Neurontin Coordinated SJ, 677 F. Supp. 2d at 498 (\"The\n\nCourt finds that [plaintiffs have] presented sufficient evidence to\n\nsupport [their] RICO claim that Neurontin was ineffective for the\n\noff-label indications . . . .\").\n\nD.        Aetna's PIFS Claim\n\n          Coordinated plaintiffs asserted a PIFS claim pursuant to\n\n18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 4117(a)(2). The district court denied Aetna's\n\nPIFS claim without separate discussion.            Id. at 499.   In light of\n\nour holding on the RICO claim, we vacate and leave the matter for\n\nfurther consideration on remand.\n\n\n\n     5\n       Defendants devote much of their argument on this point to\nthe evidence presented at the trial on Kaiser's claims, and to the\ndistrict court's findings with respect to Kaiser's state law claim,\nrather than examining the evidence of ineffectiveness plaintiffs\npresented at summary judgment. In this case \"we review the record\nas it existed at the time the district court rendered its ruling.\"\nLewis v. City of Boston, 321 F.3d 207, 214 n.7 (1st Cir. 2003).\nFurther, on the fuller trial record, we rejected Pfizer's argument.\n     6\n       Defendants argue that \"Aetna had the burden of proving that\nnone of its members derived any benefit from the defendant's drug,\"\nbut they offer no authority in support of this contention, and it\nis plainly incorrect. As we noted in Kaiser, slip op. at 57, \"due\nto the placebo effect, some patients would report improvements\nregardless of whether the drug was scientifically effective for\ntheir conditions.\"\n\n                                     -19-\n\f                               IV.\n\n          The judgment of the district court is reversed as to\n\nAetna's RICO claim, and vacated as to Aetna's PIFS claim.      We\n\nremand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                              -20-\n\f",

In Kaiser Foundation Health Plan,\n\nInc. v. Pfizer, Inc. (Kaiser), Nos. 11-1904, 11-2096 (1st Cir. ____\n\n__, 2013), a related appeal in which we also issue an opinion\n\ntoday, we affirmed a court and jury verdict against Pfizer, Inc.\n\n(\"Pfizer\"), under section 1962 of the Racketeer Influenced and\n\nCorrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 18 U.S.C. §§ 1961-68, and a state\n\nstatute, for fraudulent marketing of off-label uses of its drug\n\nNeurontin.    The arguments presented in Kaiser and in another\n\nrelated   appeal   in   which   we   issue   an   opinion   today,   Harden\n\nManufacturing Co. v. Pfizer, Inc., No. 11-1806 (1st Cir. ____ __,\n\n2013), on most issues are the same as or parallel to those\n\npresented in this appeal, which concerns the claims of Aetna, Inc.\n\n(\"Aetna\") against Pfizer.       Many of the arguments made by Pfizer\n\nagainst Aetna in this case were rejected in Kaiser.\n\n           This case comes to us on Aetna's appeal from a grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Pfizer and against Aetna.               In the\n\nKaiser case, after trial, Pfizer lost.        While the trial record in\n\nKaiser was somewhat larger than the record here, the record on\n\nsummary judgment in this case was very similar and included much\n\nthe same expert and other evidence as to causation.\n\n           The outcome of this case turns on whether Aetna, a health\n\ninsurer which makes claims of harm from third-party payments for\n\nits insureds' fraudulently induced prescriptions, is so differently\n\nsituated from Kaiser that summary judgment was correctly entered\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fagainst it, thus precluding it from proving its case to a jury.\n\nThe district court largely distinguished this case from Kaiser's on\n\nthe   basis      that     Kaiser      had      much     stronger        evidence   of\n\nmisrepresentations made directly to Kaiser and reliance by Kaiser\n\non those misrepresentations in its formulary decisions.\n\n            We conclude that Aetna presented evidence of causation\n\nand damages sufficient to survive summary judgment on its RICO\n\nclaim, and reverse the dismissal of this claim.                       We vacate the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of Aetna's claim under the Pennsylvania\n\nInsurance Fraud Statute (PIFS), 18 Pa. Cons. Stat. § 4117.\n\n                                         I.\n\n            We assume familiarity with the description of this case's\n\nprocedural history and facts set forth in Kaiser, slip op. at 3-22.\n\nOn February 1, 2005, Aetna filed a coordinated complaint with\n\nKaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. and Kaiser Foundation Hospitals\n\n(together, \"Kaiser\") and Guardian Life Insurance Company of America\n\n(\"Guardian\") in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts against\n\nPfizer    and   Warner-Lambert        Company      (together,     \"Pfizer\").       The\n\ncoordinated plaintiffs asserted that they had suffered injury from\n\nthe fraudulent marketing of Neurontin for off-label uses, and\n\nalleged   violations      of,    inter   alia,      RICO    and   the    PIFS.     The\n\ncoordinated     complaint       was   part    of   a   multidistrict      litigation\n\n(\"MDL\")    which    had     been      consolidated         in   the     District    of\n\nMassachusetts on November 24, 2004.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\f          On March 2, 2009, Pfizer filed a motion seeking summary\n\njudgment on all of the coordinated plaintiffs' pending claims.   On\n\nJanuary 8, 2010, the district court granted Pfizer's motion in\n\npart, dismissing the claims of Guardian and Aetna, but denying\n\nsummary judgment as to Kaiser's claims.

Neurontin's Effectiveness for Off-Label Uses\n\n           As the district court noted, Aetna presented studies\n\nshowing that Neurontin was not more effective than a placebo in\n\ntreating certain off-label indications.          These studies included:\n\nfour   clinical   studies    regarding   bipolar     disorder,     Neurontin\n\nCoordinated SJ, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Defendants' Marketing of Neurontin for Off-Label Uses\n\n           Beginning in late 1995 and early 1996, Parke-Davis, a\n\nsubsidiary of Warner-Lambert, began marketing Neurontin as an\n\neffective treatment for bipolar disorder and other mood disorders,\n\nneuropathic and nociceptive pain, migraines and other headaches,\n\nand doses above 1800 mg per day, though the FDA had not approved\n\nNeurontin for these off-label uses.              These marketing efforts\n\ncontinued after Pfizer purchased Parke-Davis in 2000, through at\n\nleast 2001, and are described in Kaiser, slip op. at 8-9.\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\f            As the district court stated, Aetna \"presented evidence\n\nthat Defendants communicated half truths that are actionable under\n\nthe RICO statute\" in conducting this marketing, including by\n\n\"suppressing negative information while submitting for publication\n\nin monographs positive information about off-label indications.\"\n\nNeurontin Coordinated SJ, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 492; see also id. at\n\n495, 498-99.    Pfizer does not argue to the contrary on appeal.\n\nC.        Defendants' Targeting of Third-Party Payors (\"TPPs\"),\n          Including Aetna\n\n          Defendants' efforts to promote Neurontin, for both on-\n\nlabel and off-label uses, demonstrated their understanding that\n\nTPPs, including Aetna, would both play a role in determining demand\n\nfor Neurontin (by managing access to formularies, or lists of drugs\n\nfor which TPPs would pay) and ultimately pay for most prescriptions\n\nof Neurontin.\n\n          In 1993, Parke-Davis listed Aetna as the number four\n\nmanaged care plan it intended to target to encourage the use of\n\nNeurontin as an anticonvulsant.    In 1994, Parke-Davis commissioned\n\na survey of the pharmacy directors of ten managed care plans,\n\nincluding Aetna.   This study concluded that these plans, including\n\nAetna,   were   unlikely   to   place   formulary   restrictions   on\n\nanticonvulsants.    A 1998 Parke-Davis business plan stated that,\n\n\"[i]n general, formulary access is not an issue for Neurontin so\n\nshare building programs can be carried out unrestricted.\"     Pfizer\n\nprepared a marketing business plan regarding Aetna in 2002 that\n\n                                  -7-\n\fnoted that Pfizer's \"sales representatives have open access to the\n\nproviders\" in Aetna's network.         That same year, Pfizer established\n\na Neurontin Outcomes Research Task Force that sought to support the\n\nmarketing of Neurontin for neuropathic pain and to prepare \"for a\n\nmore vigorous defense of reimbursement\" to managed care plans.            In\n\n2003,    as    Neurontin's    patent     neared   expiration,    defendants\n\ncommissioned a study by a market research company of how TPPs would\n\nreact to a new tablet form of the drug intended to compete with\n\ngeneric forms of the drug.       The market research company conducted\n\nfocus groups with TPP representatives, including representatives\n\nfrom    Aetna.     Pfizer    prepared    \"HMO   Opportunity   Reports\"   for\n\nNeurontin that tracked formulary status, projected annual sales and\n\nprescriptions, potential profits, and market share for various\n\nHMOs, including Aetna.       Pfizer also tracked sources of revenue for\n\nNeurontin sales; in 2001, Pfizer recorded that 69% of its Neurontin\n\nrevenues came from TPPs.\n\nD.            Aetna's Decision to Pay for Neurontin Prescriptions\n\n              Aetna, a large TPP, provides health payment benefits to\n\nmore than 13 million people across the country.                 Aetna added\n\nNeurontin to its formulary -- a list of drugs it agreed to pay for\n\nunder its member contracts -- soon after the FDA approved Neurontin\n\nin 1993 for use as an add-on therapy in the treatment of epilepsy.\n\n              Aetna had a formulary development team comprised of\n\npharmacists who developed clinical reviews of drug classes to\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fpresent to Aetna's Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee (\"P & T\n\nCommittee\").    These reviews presented all the clinical information\n\navailable to Aetna about a drug class, and included all the drugs\n\nwithin a class used for a particular therapeutic purpose.                       The\n\nformulary    development      team   looked     at     package    inserts,     drug\n\ncompendia, and online collections of clinical research, and also\n\nmet with drug manufacturers to get information that had not been\n\npublished.\n\n            Aetna's P & T Committee met monthly to determine what\n\nwould be included on formularies, as well as appropriate coverage\n\nrestrictions on drug classes, by majority vote.                    The Committee\n\nreviewed clinical drug reviews, previous clinical policy bulletins\n\nthe Committee had issued, and any other formulary documents (such\n\nas formulary guides disseminated to doctors).                     The Committee\n\nconsidered   the    safety,    efficacy,       on-labeled     indications,      and\n\noff-label indications of drugs, as well as cost information and the\n\nother drugs within a class.          To control drug prescriptions, Aetna\n\nused formulary controls and mailings to physicians.\n\n            Aetna   initially        decided     not     to   place    formulary\n\nrestrictions on the anticonvulsant drug class, which included\n\nNeurontin.     In late 2003, however, Aetna decided to manage the\n\nclass of anticonvulsants because it wanted to encourage the use of\n\nfirst-line     monotherapy      drugs.          Neurontin        was   moved    to\n\n\"non-preferred\" status.        That is, Aetna imposed quantity (i.e.,\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fdose) limits on Neurontin prescriptions in 2004, and step edits\n\n(under which other drugs needed to be tried before Neurontin could\n\nbe prescribed) in 2006.         Some other anticonvulsants were moved to\n\nnon-preferred status at the same time.\n\n               Michael Brodeur, the head of formulary development and\n\nclinical pharmacy policies at Aetna, had communications with Pfizer\n\nand     Warner-Lambert,       but   did     not    remember   any     specific\n\ncommunications about Neurontin. Aetna conceded that defendants, in\n\nany communications to Aetna about Neurontin, had not made any\n\ndirect misrepresentations to it, its P & T Committee, or its\n\nformulary development team.          Before January 2004, Aetna did not\n\nmanage the drug class which included Neurontin. But Brodeur stated\n\nthat,    had    the   facts   concerning    the   manufacturers'    misleading\n\nmarketing campaign surfaced earlier, he believed this would have\n\nled Aetna to start to manage this drug class at an earlier date.\n\nE.             Statistical Evidence of Causation\n\n               The summary judgment record included the statistical\n\nevidence presented by experts Dr. Meredith Rosenthal, Ph.D., and\n\nDr. Raymond Hartman, Ph.D., that we described in Kaiser, slip op.\n\nat 13-16, 19-20.       For the reasons stated in Kaiser, that evidence\n\ncould be found by a reasonable factfinder to show that Pfizer's\n\nmarketing of Neurontin for off-label indications caused a sharp\n\nincrease in the number of prescriptions that Aetna paid for or\n\nreimbursed.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f          Dr. Rosenthal, an associate professor of health economics\n\nand policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, submitted an\n\nexpert report in which she used \"standard econometric methods\" to\n\nquantify the impact of defendants' promotional activities on the\n\nnumber of off-label prescriptions of Neurontin written.                      Dr.\n\nRosenthal's   data     on    promotional     spending   included      defendants'\n\nexpenditures on detailing and advertising in professional journals.\n\nHer database included prescriptions paid for by Aetna, as did Dr.\n\nHartman's.\n\n          Dr. Rosenthal's analysis demonstrated that defendants'\n\nmarketing of Neurontin for the off-label indications of bipolar,\n\nneuropathic pain, nociceptive pain, migraine, and doses over 1800\n\nmg per day caused 43 million off-label prescriptions of Neurontin\n\nbetween 1995 and 2004.            This total included prescriptions for\n\nNeurontin for these uses paid for by Aetna.                She concluded that\n\nnationally during this period, defendants' off-label marketing\n\ncaused   99.4%    of        the   Neurontin     prescriptions      written    by\n\npsychiatrists for bipolar; 27.9% of the Neurontin prescriptions\n\nwritten by neurologists for migraine; 70.0% of the Neurontin\n\nprescriptions    for    neuropathic        pain;   84.7%   of   the    Neurontin\n\nprescriptions for nociceptive pain; and 37.5% of the Neurontin\n\nprescriptions for doses exceeding 1800 mg per day.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f                                      III.\n\n           In ruling on defendants' motion for summary judgment, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that Aetna had \"presented evidence that\n\nDefendants communicated half truths that are actionable under the\n\nRICO statute,\" Neurontin Coordinated SJ, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">2d</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> at 492,\n\nand that plaintiffs \"presented sufficient evidence to support\n\n[their] RICO claim that Neurontin was ineffective for the off-label\n\nindications,\" so that they sustained injury from paying for off-\n\nlabel prescriptions of Neurontin, id. at 498.\n\n           However, the court also determined that:\n\n     There is no evidence in the record that Guardian or Aetna\n     at any point directly relied on Pfizer's \"half truths,\"\n     communicated through its alleged manipulation and\n     withholding of studies that suggested Neurontin's\n     ineffectiveness for off-label indications. Rather, their\n     causation argument is wholly dependent on individualized\n     proof that their members' prescribing physicians relied\n     on defendants' misrepresentations. Because the Court has\n     concluded that the evidence provided in support of this\n     theory, namely the aggregate evidence presented in Dr.\n     Meredith Rosenthal's report, is legally insufficient to\n     effectively segregate damages caused by Defendants'\n     misrepresentations from damages caused by other sources,\n     Guardian and Aetna cannot rely solely on the aggregate\n     evidence to prove causation. Accordingly, the motion for\n     summary judgment with respect to Guardian and Aetna will\n     be allowed.\n\nId. at 497 (emphasis added) (footnote omitted). The district court\n\ndetermined that \"[w]hile each of the Coordinated Plaintiffs can\n\nprove   through   aggregated    proof    that   the    fraudulent    marketing\n\ncampaign   likely   caused   them     injury,   they    cannot   prove   which\n\ndoctor's   prescriptions       were    caused   by     Defendants'     alleged\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\ffraudulent misrepresentations or omissions and which were not.\"\n\nId. at 495.     Because Aetna did not present proof of its direct\n\nreliance upon defendants' misrepresentations,1 as Kaiser did, the\n\ncourt concluded that Aetna's evidence of but-for causation -- which\n\nrelied   largely    on    aggregate      statistical      evidence    --   was\n\ninsufficient as a matter of law.              The district court granted\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment as to Guardian and Aetna's\n\nclaims, including Aetna's claim under the PIFS (though the court\n\ndid not discuss this claim separately).          Id. at 499.\n\n          Aetna argues on appeal that the district court erred in\n\nrejecting its aggregate evidence of causation and damages under\n\nRICO and in requiring Aetna to present stronger evidence of direct\n\nmisrepresentations and reliance as to its formulary.             Aetna also\n\nargues that the court erred in dismissing its claim under the PIFS.\n\nDefendants    respond    that   the   court   correctly    rejected   Aetna's\n\naggregate evidence and PIFS claim, and that Aetna's RICO claim was\n\nfurther doomed by its failure to present evidence of proximate\n\ncausation or injury.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Aetna argues on appeal that in addition to its aggregate\nevidence of but-for causation, it presented Brodeur's testimony as\nto the effect of Pfizer's suppression of negative information about\nNeurontin's off-label effectiveness on Aetna's decision not to\nimpose restrictions on Neurontin in its formulary.      Because we\nconclude that Aetna's aggregate evidence of but-for causation was\nsufficient to survive summary judgment, we need not separately\nconsider the adequacy of Brodeur's testimony.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fA.           RICO: But-For Causation and Aggregate Evidence\n\n             The but-for causation question in this case is \"whether,\n\nabsent Pfizer's fraud, [a plaintiff TPP] would have paid for fewer\n\noff-label Neurontin prescriptions.\"        Kaiser, slip op. at 24.    In\n\nKaiser, we noted \"the use of . . . aggregate evidence to show\n\ncausation under several causes of action\" and concluded that there\n\nwas \"no reason to reach a different conclusion for the specific\n\nsubset of RICO claims based on fraudulent marketing.\"         Id. at 54.\n\nWe believe the evidence Aetna presented on but-for causation --\n\nthat in the absence of Pfizer's alleged fraud, Aetna would have\n\npaid for fewer off-label prescriptions of Neurontin -- survives\n\nsummary judgment.2    Aetna's evidence of but-for causation included\n\nnot   only    aggregate   statistical    evidence,   but   circumstantial\n\nevidence, such as the increase in off-label prescriptions of\n\nNeurontin following the initiation of Pfizer's alleged fraudulent\n\nmarketing efforts, and the fact that Pfizer embarked on these\n\nefforts in order to increase sales of Neurontin for off-label uses.\n\nThe absence of evidence from individual doctors in this record does\n\nnot defeat our conclusion that summary judgment was inappropriately\n\n\n\n      2\n        Defendants argue on appeal that \"[a]ggregate proof of\nreliance in these circumstances is impermissible for the additional\nreason that it represents a back-door attempt to invoke the 'fraud\non the market' doctrine, which is limited to the securities context\nand cannot be applied to Plaintiffs' RICO claims.\" As we explained\nin Kaiser, slip op. at 29 n.9, the analogy between the fraud-on-\nthe-market doctrine and the use of aggregate evidence in civil RICO\ncases is inapt.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fgranted.3    It should have been left to a jury to weigh the\n\naggregate and circumstantial evidence of causation presented by\n\nAetna against any failure to present individualized testimony from\n\ndoctors.\n\n            While Aetna did have the burden of \"segregat[ing] damages\n\ncaused by Defendants' misrepresentations from damages caused by\n\nother sources,\" Neurontin Coordinated SJ, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Aetna's failure to present the form of but-for causation\nevidence that defendants would have favored does not mean that the\nevidence Aetna did present was insufficient for a jury to conclude\nthat Aetna showed the needed causation. Moreover, as we noted in\nKaiser, slip op. at 50, relying on physicians' individual\nrecollections as to their prescribing decisions might have been an\nunreliable approach.\n\n                                  -15-\n\fB.         RICO: Proximate Causation\n\n           Pfizer also argues that summary judgment was, in any\n\nevent,   appropriate      because    there   was       inadequate    evidence   of\n\nproximate causation. For reasons similar to those we enunciated in\n\nKaiser, we   conclude      that   Aetna   made     a    sufficient    showing   of\n\nproximate causation to withstand summary judgment.\n\n           Regarding Pfizer's argument that Aetna, unlike Kaiser,\n\nhas not shown direct reliance on Pfizer's misrepresentations,\n\ndirect reliance is not an element of proximate cause in a private\n\nRICO claim predicated on mail fraud.          See Bridge v. Phoenix Bond &\n\nIndem. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145799\"><a href=\"/opinion/145799/bridge-v-phoenix-bond-indem-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Moreover, Aetna's\n\naggregate statistical evidence of causation did not rely upon the\n\ntheory that direct misrepresentations by Pfizer influenced Aetna's\n\nmanagement of its formulary.         Instead, Dr. Rosenthal demonstrated\n\na causal relationship between Pfizer's alleged fraudulent marketing\n\nto doctors and Aetna's payment for off-label prescriptions of\n\nNeurontin. Aetna did not have to show direct reliance to establish\n\nproximate or but-for causation.\n\n           A jury could have found that Aetna, like Kaiser, was \"the\n\nprimary and intended victim[] of the scheme to defraud,\" id. at\n\n2139, and that the injury suffered was a \"foreseeable and natural\n\nconsequence\" of the fraudulent scheme, id. at 2144.                  Because TPPs\n\nultimately   paid   for    most     prescriptions        of   Neurontin,   Pfizer\n\nmonitored TPPs' management of Neurontin on their formularies, kept\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\ftrack of sales to TPPs, and targeted TPPs as Neurontin customers,\n\nwith respect to both on-label and off-label sales of the drug.\n\nDefendants particularly monitored sales to Aetna, targeted Aetna as\n\na Neurontin customer, and sought information from Aetna about its\n\nformulary management practices and willingness to pay for Neurontin\n\ninstead   of     generic    gabapentin.       Pfizer      prepared    a   marketing\n\nbusiness plan targeting Aetna.                A reasonable jury could have\n\nconcluded based on this evidence that Aetna was the intended victim\n\nof defendants' fraudulent scheme and that Aetna's economic injury\n\nwas a \"foreseeable and natural consequence\" of this scheme.                      That\n\nis so even if the scheme involved making misrepresentations to\n\ndoctors about Neurontin's off-label effectiveness instead of making\n\nthose misrepresentations directly to Aetna itself.\n\n               The functional tests for proximate cause articulated in\n\nHolmes v. Securities Investor Protection Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112708\"><a href=\"/opinion/112708/holmes-v-securities-investor-protection-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 269-\n\n70 (1992), further favor the conclusion that Aetna made an adequate\n\nproximate causation showing.           A jury could have ascertained the\n\namount    of    Aetna's    damages   based     on   Dr.   Rosenthal's      and    Dr.\n\nHartman's expert reports; Aetna alone suffered the damages it\n\nalleged, so there was no risk of multiple recoveries; and as the\n\nparty directly injured, Aetna was best placed to act as a private\n\nattorney general.         Id.\n\n               The   \"individualized    decisions      made   by     thousands     of\n\nphysicians who decided to prescribe Neurontin\" do not introduce\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\fsuch attenuation   into   Aetna's causal    theory   as to   prevent   a\n\nreasonable jury from finding proximate causation, as defendants\n\ncontend.   A reasonable jury could have concluded, based on the\n\nevidence, that defendants' scheme relied upon the expectation that\n\nfraudulent off-label marketing to doctors would induce them to act\n\nin a foreseeable fashion -- i.e., to write off-label prescriptions\n\nfor Neurontin that would be paid for by Aetna.\n\nC.         RICO: Economic Injury\n\n           Defendants argue on appeal that the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment may also be affirmed on the alternate\n\ntheory, rejected by the district court, that Aetna failed to\n\npresent evidence of economic injury.       Defendants argue that, to\n\nestablish the economic injury needed to make out its civil RICO\n\nclaim, Aetna was required to prove that Neurontin was always\n\nineffective for the off-label uses at issue,4 and that Aetna failed\n\nto produce evidence of ineffectiveness at summary judgment.\n\nDefendants are incorrect.     Aetna presented evidence at summary\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       Defendants argue that Aetna \"expressly disavowed any burden\"\nto prove Neurontin's ineffectiveness, and instead opposed summary\njudgment based on a purportedly invalid \"cheaper alternative\"\ntheory of economic injury. That misrepresents Aetna's arguments\nthat it could prove economic injury based either on a \"cheaper\nalternative\" theory or on a theory of Neurontin's ineffectiveness.\nSee Coordinated Pls.' Mem. Law in Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. Summ. J. at\n18-21 & n.16. Because we conclude that Aetna presented sufficient\nevidence of Neurontin's ineffectiveness to survive summary\njudgment, we need not pass on the viability of the \"cheaper\nalternative\" theory of injury.\n\n                                -18-\n\fjudgment5 that multiple clinical trials had demonstrated that\n\nNeurontin was no more effective than placebo in treating the off-\n\nlabel conditions at issue.
