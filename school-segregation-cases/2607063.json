JONES, Circuit Judge:*\n       C. Michael Kamps, a law school applicant over the age of 50, sued Baylor\nUniversity and its administrators for violations of the Age Discrimination Act\n\n\n       * Pursuant to 5TH CIR. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not\nbe published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5TH\nCIR. R. 47.5.4.\n\f     Case: 14-50050       Document: 00512842657          Page: 2     Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-50050\nof 1975 (“ADA”). 42 U.S.C. § 6101 et seq. The district court referred the case\nto a magistrate judge, who recommended dismissing Kamps’s claims. The\ndistrict court adopted the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation.\nKamps appealed. This court has considered his appeal in light of the briefs\nand pertinent portions of the record. We find no reversible error of law or fact\nin the magistrate judge’s well-reasoned report and recommendation.\n                                     BACKGROUND\n        Kamps’s age discrimination claim relies not on the fact that the law\nschool rejected him, but that it did not admit him for his preferred terms.\nKamps wanted to matriculate in the Fall of 2010. The law school wait-listed\nhim for the fall, but offered him a seat in the Summer 2010 or Spring 2011\nclass. Kamps declined. The following year, Kamps applied for the Fall 2011\nterm. Again, the law school wait-listed him, but offered him a seat in the\nSpring 2012 class. Again, Kamps declined. Kamps also complains that he did\nnot receive the Nance Scholarship in 2011 because of his age, and that, in\nresponse to a formal complaint, the University retaliated against him when it\nrejected his Fall 2012 application.            Based on these acts, Kamps brought\ndisparate treatment, disparate impact, and retaliation claims against the\nUniversity and its administrators.\n                              STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       This court reviews de novo a district court’s dismissal under Rule\n12(b)(6), accepting as true all well-pleaded facts and viewing those facts most\nfavorably to the plaintiff. 1 Warren v. Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., 759 F.3d\n\n\n\n       1   On appeal, Kamps argues that the magistrate’s report and recommendation\nerroneously accepted the defendants’ allegations as true. It plainly did not. The report\nconsidered exhibits that Kamps himself attached to the complaint. Those exhibits included\na letter from David Swenson, Chair of Baylor Law School’s Admissions Committee. When a\nplaintiff attaches documents to the complaint, courts are not required to accept the plaintiff’s\ninterpretation of those documents. If “an allegation is contradicted by the contents of an\n                                               2\n\f     Case: 14-50050       Document: 00512842657         Page: 3    Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                      No. 14-50050\n413, 415 (5th Cir. 2014). “To survive a [ ] motion to dismiss, plaintiff[] must\nplead enough facts to state a claim for relief that is plausible on its face.” Id.\n(internal citation omitted). When considering a motion to dismiss, this Court\nholds pro se litigants to a less stringent standard than those represented by\ncounsel. Taylor v. Books A Million, Inc., 296 F.3d 376, 378 (5th Cir. 2002).\nNevertheless, “conclusory allegations or legal conclusions masquerading as\nfactual conclusions will not suffice to prevent a motion to dismiss.”                    Id.\n(internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\n                                     DISCUSSION\n       The magistrate judge recommended dismissing Kamps’s claims because:\nKamps did not exhaust administrative remedies for the 2010 claims; Kamps\ndid not state a plausible claim for intentional discrimination for the 2011\nclaims; and the ADA does not allow disparate impact or retaliation claims. In\naddition to the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation, we restate a\nfew additional points for emphasis.\n       I.     Exhaustion of Remedies\n       Kamps has not exhausted administrative remedies for the 2010\nadmission and scholarship claims. Under the ADA “[n]o action . . . shall be\nbrought . . . if administrative remedies have not been exhausted.”\n42 U.S.C. § 6104(e)(2).         Interpreting comparable language in the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act, the Supreme Court has held that administrative\nexhaustion requires proper exhaustion, utilizing “all steps that the agency\n\n\n\n\nexhibit attached to the pleading, then indeed the exhibit and not the allegation controls.”\nU.S. ex rel. Riley v. St. Luke’s Episcopal Hosp., 355 F.3d 370, 377 (5th Cir. 2004) (internal\ncitation and quotation marks omitted). It makes no difference that a defendant authored the\ndocument; the court may consider it without violating the 12(b)(6) standard. Quite simply,\nKamps cannot complain that the magistrate judge considered a document that he referenced\nin his complaint; that he attached as an exhibit; and that he contends supports his\ndiscrimination claim—even if a defendant authored it.\n                                             3\n\f     Case: 14-50050       Document: 00512842657          Page: 4     Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-50050\nholds out, and doing so properly.”                 Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 90,\n126 S. Ct. 2378, 2385 (2006) (emphasis in original) (internal citation and\nquotation marks omitted). “Proper exhaustion demands compliance with an\nagency’s deadlines and other critical procedural rules . . . .” Id. “Pre-filing\nexhaustion is mandatory, and the case must be dismissed if available\nadministrative remedies were not exhausted.” Gonzalez v. Seal, 702 F.3d 785,\n788 (5th Cir. 2012).\n       The Department of Education (“DOE”) requires all complaints to be filed\n“within 180 days from the date the complainant first had knowledge of the\nalleged discrimination.” 34 C.F.R. § 110.31(a). The law school denied Kamps’s\n2010 application on February 17, 2010, but Kamps did not complain to the\nDOE until over a year later—on October 27, 2011. Because Kamps did not\ncomplain about the 2010 admission and scholarship decisions within the 180-\nday window, he did not exhaust administrative remedies as to those claims.\n       II.    Intentional Discrimination\n       Kamps’s 2011 admission claim fails for two reasons. 2 First, there are no\nfacts in his complaint showing that Baylor used applicants’ college grade point\naverage (“GPA”) to discriminate against older applicants generally or Kamps\nin particular. Kamps alleges that the defendants have known about grade\ninflation, and therefore, “knew, or should have known, the effect that grade\ninflation would have when comparing []GPAs earned in different eras.” But\nknowing that GPA disadvantages older applicants does not mean Baylor used\nGPA in order to disadvantage older applicants.                  Second, Kamps was not\n\n\n\n\n       2Kamps seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and monetary damages. The ADA,\nhowever, allows suit only for injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. See 42 U.S.C. § 6104(e)(1).\nTo the extent Kamps seeks monetary damages and declaratory relief, those claims must be\ndismissed.\n                                               4\n\f    Case: 14-50050       Document: 00512842657   Page: 5   Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-50050\nexcluded from Baylor Law. Baylor admitted him for the Spring 2012 term and\nhe declined to attend.\n      Kamps’s 2011 scholarship claim fails for similar reasons. His complaint\nreferences no facts supporting his conclusion that the law school changed the\nNance Scholarship’s criteria to disadvantage him. In fact, his complaint shows\nthe opposite.   The law school’s strategic planning committee changed the\nscholarship eligibility criteria in Spring 2009, long before Kamps applied. The\ncommittee simply could not have changed the criteria to disadvantage Kamps.\nKamps has not alleged that the scholarship committee knew that he would\nsubsequently apply, so his 2011 scholarship claim fails.\n      Overarching these claims is the fact that the law school’s use of GPA falls\nwithin one of the ADA’s exceptions to liability. It is not a violation of the ADA\nto take an otherwise prohibited action if “the differentiation made by such\naction   is     based     upon    reasonable     factors   other    than    age.”\n42 U.S.C. § 6103(b)(1)(B). A factor other than age is one that bears “a direct\nand substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or\nactivity . . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 110.13. Use of GPA in post-secondary school\nadmission decisions is a reasonable non-age-based factor. Nearly every law\nschool in the country uses GPA when evaluating candidates. According to\ndocuments contained in Kamps’s complaint, it is “one of the best quantitative\npredictors of academic success in law school.” And the use of GPA is directly\nrelated to the law school’s normal operation. Therefore, the use of GPA to\nevaluate potential students and scholarship recipients is a reasonable factor\nother than age and the school cannot be liable under the ADA.\n      III.    Disparate Impact\n      The ADA does not prohibit policies that have a disparate impact. When\nCongress wants to allow disparate impact claims, it uses particular language.\nFor example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act states: “It shall be an unlawful\n                                        5\n\f    Case: 14-50050     Document: 00512842657      Page: 6   Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-50050\nemployment practice for an employer—to limit, segregate, or classify his\nemployees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or\ntend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s\nrace . . . .” Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, § 703, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2)\n(emphasis added). The Supreme Court identified the “otherwise adversely\naffects” language as prohibiting policies that have a disparate impact. Watson\nv. Fort Worth Bank and Trust, 487 U.S. 977, 991, 108 S. Ct. 2777, 2787 (1988).\nSimilarly, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) makes it\nunlawful for an employer “to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\nopportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because\nof such individual’s age[.]” Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967\n§ 4, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2) (emphasis added). As with Title VII, the Court held\nthat this “otherwise adversely affects” language prohibits polices that have a\ndisparate impact.    Smith v. City of Jackson, Miss., 544 U.S. 228, 233-40,\n125 S. Ct. 1536, 1540-45 (2005).\n      The ADA lacks any such language. The ADA states “no person in the\nUnited States shall, on the basis of age, be excluded from participation in, be\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 42 U.S.C. § 6102. Unlike Title\nVII and the ADEA, nowhere does the ADA use “otherwise adversely affects”\nlanguage. Moreover, the ADA’s prohibition is almost identical to Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act, which prohibits only intentional discrimination. See Civil\nRights Act of 1964, Title VI, §601, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (“No person in the United\nStates shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination\nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”);\n                                        6\n\f    Case: 14-50050    Document: 00512842657     Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-50050\nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 280, 121 S. Ct. 1511, 1516 (2001) (holding\nthat Title VI “prohibits only intentional discrimination”).\n      Further, although the DOE’s regulations purport to prohibit policies that\nhave a disparate impact, no implied private cause of action exists to enforce\nthem. “[A] private plaintiff cannot enforce a regulation . . . if the regulation\nimposes an obligation or prohibition that is not imposed [ ] by the controlling\nstatute.” Ability Ctr. of Greater Toledo v. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 906\n(6th Cir. 2004) (citing Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 284-85); see also Lonberg v. City\nof Riverside, 571 F.3d 846, 852 (9th Cir. 2009) (holding that “under Sandoval,\n[the regulation] is not enforceable” through a private cause of action because\nthe “obligations it imposes are nowhere” to be found in the statute). Therefore,\n“if a statutory provision prohibits only intentional discrimination . . .\nregulations adopted to effectuate the provision may be enforceable through its\nprivate cause of action only to the extent that they, too, prohibit intentional\ndiscrimination.” Ability Ctr. of Greater Toledo, 385 F.3d at 906.\n      IV.   Retaliation\n      Kamps’s retaliation claim fails for the same reason as his disparate\nimpact claim. Under Sandoval, a regulation provides a private cause of action\nonly if it effectuates an express statutory provision. Id. The ADA prohibits\nonly intentional discrimination.      See 42 U.S.C. § 6102.         Because the\nregulations—not the statute—prohibit retaliation, Kamps has no cause of\naction for retaliation. See id.; 34 C.F.R. § 110.34. Kamps’s retaliation claim\nwas correctly dismissed.\n      V.    Dismissal with Prejudice\n      Kamps argues last that dismissal with prejudice was unwarranted.\nOrdinarily, a court “should not dismiss the complaint except after affording\nevery opportunity (for) the plaintiff to state a claim upon which relief (can) be\ngranted.” Hitt v. City of Pasadena, 561 F.2d 606, 607 (5th Cir. 1977) (internal\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 14-50050      Document: 00512842657      Page: 8   Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-50050\ncitation and quotation marks omitted). But here amendment would be futile.\nMost of Kamps’s claims are barred because he did not exhaust administrative\nremedies or because the statute does not allow disparate impact and\nretaliation claims. Regarding his claims of intentional discrimination, his\nallegations are wholly conclusional; in the case of Baylor’s use of GPA, plainly\nnon-age-related; and are trumped by the fact that he was offered admission on\nseveral occasions. These allegations plainly fail under Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556\nU.S. 662, 678, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 1949 (2009) (holding a complaint “demands\nmore than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation.”),\nand Bell Atlantic v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007)\n(holding that “[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a right to relief\nabove the speculative level . . . .”).\n                                  CONCLUSION\n      For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court’s dismissal of Kamps’s\ncomplaint with prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                         8\n\f",

R. 47.5.4.\n\f     Case: 14-50050       Document: 00512842657          Page: 2     Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-50050\nof 1975 (“ADA”). 42 U.S.C. § 6101 et seq. The district court referred the case\nto a magistrate judge, who recommended dismissing Kamps’s claims. The\ndistrict court adopted the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation.\nKamps appealed. This court has considered his appeal in light of the briefs\nand pertinent portions of the record. We find no reversible error of law or fact\nin the magistrate judge’s well-reasoned report and recommendation.\n                                     BACKGROUND\n        Kamps’s age discrimination claim relies not on the fact that the law\nschool rejected him, but that it did not admit him for his preferred terms.\nKamps wanted to matriculate in the Fall of 2010. The law school wait-listed\nhim for the fall, but offered him a seat in the Summer 2010 or Spring 2011\nclass. Kamps declined. The following year, Kamps applied for the Fall 2011\nterm. Again, the law school wait-listed him, but offered him a seat in the\nSpring 2012 class. Again, Kamps declined. Kamps also complains that he did\nnot receive the Nance Scholarship in 2011 because of his age, and that, in\nresponse to a formal complaint, the University retaliated against him when it\nrejected his Fall 2012 application.            Based on these acts, Kamps brought\ndisparate treatment, disparate impact, and retaliation claims against the\nUniversity and its administrators.\n                              STANDARD OF REVIEW\n       This court reviews de novo a district court’s dismissal under Rule\n12(b)(6), accepting as true all well-pleaded facts and viewing those facts most\nfavorably to the plaintiff. 1 Warren v. Chesapeake Exploration, L.L.C., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">759</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n\n\n       <span class=\"page\">1</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">   On appeal, Kamps argues that the magistrate’s report and recommendation\nerroneously accepted the defendants’ allegations as true. It plainly did not. The report\nconsidered exhibits that Kamps himself attached to the complaint. Those exhibits included\na letter from David Swenson, Chair of Baylor Law School’s Admissions Committee. When a\nplaintiff attaches documents to the complaint, courts are not required to accept the plaintiff’s\ninterpretation of those documents.

In\naddition to the magistrate judge’s report and recommendation, we restate a\nfew additional points for emphasis.\n       I.     Exhaustion of Remedies\n       Kamps has not exhausted administrative remedies for the 2010\nadmission and scholarship claims. Under the ADA “[n]o action . . . shall be\nbrought . . . if administrative remedies have not been exhausted.”\n42 U.S.C. § 6104(e)(2).         Interpreting comparable language in the Prison\nLitigation Reform Act, the Supreme Court has held that administrative\nexhaustion requires proper exhaustion, utilizing “all steps that the agency\n\n\n\n\nexhibit attached to the pleading, then indeed the exhibit and not the allegation controls.”\nU.S. ex rel. Riley v. St. Luke’s Episcopal Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"33767\"><a href=\"/opinion/33767/united-states-v-st-lukes-epis-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">370</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 377 (5th Cir. 2004) (internal\ncitation and quotation marks omitted). It makes no difference that a defendant authored the\ndocument; the court may consider it without violating the 12(b)(6) standard. Quite simply,\nKamps cannot complain that the magistrate judge considered a document that he referenced\nin his complaint; that he attached as an exhibit; and that he contends supports his\ndiscrimination claim—even if a defendant authored it.\n                                             3\n\f     Case: 14-50050       Document: 00512842657          Page: 4     Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                       No. 14-50050\nholds out, and doing so properly.”                 Woodford v.

The law school denied Kamps’s\n2010 application on February 17, 2010, but Kamps did not complain to the\nDOE until over a year later—on October 27, 2011. Because Kamps did not\ncomplain about the 2010 admission and scholarship decisions within the 180-\nday window, he did not exhaust administrative remedies as to those claims.\n       II.    Intentional Discrimination\n       Kamps’s 2011 admission claim fails for two reasons. 2 First, there are no\nfacts in his complaint showing that Baylor used applicants’ college grade point\naverage (“GPA”) to discriminate against older applicants generally or Kamps\nin particular. Kamps alleges that the defendants have known about grade\ninflation, and therefore, “knew, or should have known, the effect that grade\ninflation would have when comparing []GPAs earned in different eras.” But\nknowing that GPA disadvantages older applicants does not mean Baylor used\nGPA in order to disadvantage older applicants.                  Second, Kamps was not\n\n\n\n\n       2Kamps seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, and monetary damages. The ADA,\nhowever, allows suit only for injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees. See 42 U.S.C. § 6104(e)(1).\nTo the extent Kamps seeks monetary damages and declaratory relief, those claims must be\ndismissed.\n                                               4\n\f    Case: 14-50050       Document: 00512842657   Page: 5   Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                  No. 14-50050\nexcluded from Baylor Law. Baylor admitted him for the Spring 2012 term and\nhe declined to attend.\n      Kamps’s 2011 scholarship claim fails for similar reasons. His complaint\nreferences no facts supporting his conclusion that the law school changed the\nNance Scholarship’s criteria to disadvantage him. In fact, his complaint shows\nthe opposite.   The law school’s strategic planning committee changed the\nscholarship eligibility criteria in Spring 2009, long before Kamps applied. The\ncommittee simply could not have changed the criteria to disadvantage Kamps.\nKamps has not alleged that the scholarship committee knew that he would\nsubsequently apply, so his 2011 scholarship claim fails.\n      Overarching these claims is the fact that the law school’s use of GPA falls\nwithin one of the ADA’s exceptions to liability. It is not a violation of the ADA\nto take an otherwise prohibited action if “the differentiation made by such\naction   is     based     upon    reasonable     factors   other    than    age.”\n42 U.S.C. § 6103(b)(1)(B). A factor other than age is one that bears “a direct\nand substantial relationship to the normal operation of the program or\nactivity . . . .” 34 C.F.R. § 110.13. Use of GPA in post-secondary school\nadmission decisions is a reasonable non-age-based factor. Nearly every law\nschool in the country uses GPA when evaluating candidates. According to\ndocuments contained in Kamps’s complaint, it is “one of the best quantitative\npredictors of academic success in law school.” And the use of GPA is directly\nrelated to the law school’s normal operation. Therefore, the use of GPA to\nevaluate potential students and scholarship recipients is a reasonable factor\nother than age and the school cannot be liable under the ADA.\n      III.    Disparate Impact\n      The ADA does not prohibit policies that have a disparate impact. When\nCongress wants to allow disparate impact claims, it uses particular language.\nFor example, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act states: “It shall be an unlawful\n                                        5\n\f    Case: 14-50050     Document: 00512842657      Page: 6   Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                   No. 14-50050\nemployment practice for an employer—to limit, segregate, or classify his\nemployees or applicants for employment in any way which would deprive or\ntend to deprive any individual of employment opportunities or otherwise\nadversely affect his status as an employee, because of such individual’s\nrace . . . .” Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title VII, § 703, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(2)\n(emphasis added). The Supreme Court identified the “otherwise adversely\naffects” language as prohibiting policies that have a disparate impact. Watson\nv. Fort Worth Bank and Trust, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112145\"><a href=\"/opinion/112145/watson-v-fort-worth-bank-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">487</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">977</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112145\"><a href=\"/opinion/112145/watson-v-fort-worth-bank-trust/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2777</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 2787 (1988).\nSimilarly, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (“ADEA”) makes it\nunlawful for an employer “to limit, segregate, or classify his employees in any\nway which would deprive or tend to deprive any individual of employment\nopportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee, because\nof such individual’s age[.]” Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967\n§ 4, 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(2) (emphasis added). As with Title VII, the Court held\nthat this “otherwise adversely affects” language prohibits polices that have a\ndisparate impact.    Smith v. City of Jackson, Miss., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">228</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 233-40,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142883\"><a href=\"/opinion/142883/smith-v-city-of-jackson/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1536</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1540-45 (2005).\n      The ADA lacks any such language. The ADA states “no person in the\nUnited States shall, on the basis of age, be excluded from participation in, be\ndenied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under, any program or\nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.” 42 U.S.C. § 6102. Unlike Title\nVII and the ADEA, nowhere does the ADA use “otherwise adversely affects”\nlanguage. Moreover, the ADA’s prohibition is almost identical to Title VI of\nthe Civil Rights Act, which prohibits only intentional discrimination. See Civil\nRights Act of 1964, Title VI, §601, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (“No person in the United\nStates shall, on the ground of race, color, or national origin, be excluded from\nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination\nunder any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.”);\n                                        6\n\f    Case: 14-50050    Document: 00512842657     Page: 7   Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                 No. 14-50050\nAlexander v.

Therefore,\n“if a statutory provision prohibits only intentional discrimination . . .\nregulations adopted to effectuate the provision may be enforceable through its\nprivate cause of action only to the extent that they, too, prohibit intentional\ndiscrimination.” Ability Ctr. of Greater Toledo, 385 F.3d at 906.\n      IV.   Retaliation\n      Kamps’s retaliation claim fails for the same reason as his disparate\nimpact claim. Under Sandoval, a regulation provides a private cause of action\nonly if it effectuates an express statutory provision. Id. The ADA prohibits\nonly intentional discrimination.      See 42 U.S.C. § 6102.         Because the\nregulations—not the statute—prohibit retaliation, Kamps has no cause of\naction for retaliation. See id.; 34 C.F.R. § 110.34. Kamps’s retaliation claim\nwas correctly dismissed.\n      V.    Dismissal with Prejudice\n      Kamps argues last that dismissal with prejudice was unwarranted.\nOrdinarily, a court “should not dismiss the complaint except after affording\nevery opportunity (for) the plaintiff to state a claim upon which relief (can) be\ngranted.” Hitt v. City of Pasadena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"348645\"><a href=\"/opinion/348645/ricky-d-hitt-kathleen-hitt-and-charlott-cross-v-the-city-of-pasadena-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">561</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 607 (5th Cir. 1977) (internal\n                                       7\n\f    Case: 14-50050      Document: 00512842657      Page: 8   Date Filed: 11/19/2014\n\n\n\n                                    No. 14-50050\ncitation and quotation marks omitted). But here amendment would be futile.\nMost of Kamps’s claims are barred because he did not exhaust administrative\nremedies or because the statute does not allow disparate impact and\nretaliation claims. Regarding his claims of intentional discrimination, his\nallegations are wholly conclusional; in the case of Baylor’s use of GPA, plainly\nnon-age-related; and are trumped by the fact that he was offered admission on\nseveral occasions. These allegations plainly fail under Ashcroft v.
