ARNOLD, Circuit Judges.\n                         ___________\n\nRICHARD S. ARNOLD, Circuit Judge.\n\f       This case consolidates two appeals, both arising from the Little Rock School\nDistrict's request for unitary status. First, the Joshua Intervenors1 appeal from the\nDistrict Court's2 denial of their Motion for Recusal of District Judge and Vacating of\nOrders, Rulings, and Judgments. We review a district court's denial of recusal for\nabuse of discretion. See In re Hale, 980 F.2d 1176, 1178 (8th Cir. 1992); United\nStates v. Walker, 920 F.2d 513, 516 (8th Cir. 1990). We conclude that Judge\nWilson's representation of Judge Henry Woods at a much earlier stage of the case,\nand on far different issues, did not involve the same \"matter in controversy\" for\npurposes of 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(2); thus, we affirm the denial of the Joshua\nIntervenors' Motion for Recusal.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors also appeal from the District Court's judgment granting\nthe Little Rock School District (LRSD) partial unitary status. The Joshua Intervenors\nassert: (1) that the District Court erred by not requiring and considering additional\nreports from the Office of Desegregation Monitoring (ODM); and (2) that the District\nCourt's finding of substantial compliance with the Revised Desegregation and\nEducation Plan was erroneous. We hold that the District Court did not err by failing\nto require new written reports from the ODM, and that the District Court's findings\nof fact are not clearly erroneous; thus, we affirm the grant of partial unitary status.\n\n      Because the facts relevant to each issue on appeal are different, we address\nthem separately. In Part I, we address the issue of disqualification. In Part II, we\naddress whether the District Court should have required new written reports from the\n\n\n      1\n        This group of school children and parents are, as a practical matter, the\nplaintiffs in the case at its present juncture. The Little Rock School District, which\nactually initiated the case in 1982, is effectively the defendant for purposes of this\nappeal.\n      2\n       The Honorable William R. Wilson, Jr., United States District Judge for the\nEastern District of Arkansas.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fODM. Finally, in Part III, we address whether the District Court erred in finding that\nLRSD substantially complied with the Revised Plan in most respects.\n\n                                          I.\n\n       This litigation began in 1982 and has been in and out of this Court and the\nDistrict Court several times — it is complex to say the least. We briefly highlight the\nevents relevant to the issue of the disqualification of Judge Wilson.\n\n       In 1987, LRSD and the Joshua Intervenors sought to disqualify Judge Henry\nWoods,3 who was then presiding over the case. The parties asserted as grounds for\ndisqualification that during Judge Woods's private law practice, one of his partners\nhad represented parties who participated as amici curiae in a related case, and that\nJudge Woods's impartiality was called into question by his comments at a meeting\nwith students. Judge Wilson, then in private practice, represented Judge Woods for\nthe limited purpose of the mandamus proceedings, defending Judge Woods's decision\nnot to recuse himself.4\n\n       In the current proceeding, begun by LRSD's motion that it be released from\ncourt supervision, the Joshua Intervenors sought the recusal of Judge Wilson under\n28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(2), which requires a judge to disqualify himself \"where in private\npractice he served as lawyer in the matter in controversy.\" After Judge Wilson\nentered an order on September 13, 2002, granting LRSD partial unitary status, the\n\n      3\n       The Little Rock School District sought a writ of mandamus asking this Court\nto disqualify Judge Woods, and the Joshua Intervenors appealed a judgment entered\nby Judge Woods, asserting, among other things, that the judge should be disqualified.\n      4\n        This Court found that Judge Woods was not disqualified. Little Rock Sch.\nDist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 839 F.2d 1296 (8th Cir. 1988); Little\nRock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 833 F.2d 112 (8th Cir.\n1987).\n\n                                         -3-\n\fIntervenors filed a Motion for a Hearing Regarding the Relevance of 28 U.S.C. § 455\nto the Present Proceedings. Judge Wilson denied this motion on October 29, 2002.\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 2002 WL 31465311\n(E.D. Ark. 2002). Thereafter, on November 25, 2002, the Joshua Intervenors moved\nfor disqualification of Judge Wilson. Judge Wilson denied this motion because,\namong other reasons, he had never served, in his view, as a lawyer in the \"matter in\ncontroversy.\" Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, No.\n4:82CV00866 (E.D. Ark. Dec. 20, 2002). The Joshua Intervenors appeal.\n\n      We must determine whether Judge Wilson's representation of Judge Woods in\nthe mandamus proceeding in 1987 involved the same \"matter in controversy\" as the\npresent questions before us for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(2). Because the\nmandamus proceeding did not touch upon the merits of the case, we conclude that it\nwas not a part of the same \"matter in controversy.\"\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors contend that Judge Wilson's participation was part of\nthe same matter in controversy because it was part of a single case. The language\nchosen by Congress, \"matter in controversy,\" is not defined by the statute. However,\nCongress easily could have substituted the word \"case\" for the words \"matter in\ncontroversy,\" but did not do so. This deliberate choice by Congress demonstrates an\nintent that the words \"matter in controversy\" mean something other than what we\ncommonly refer to as a \"case.\" In fact, Congress used the words \"proceeding,\" \"case\nin controversy,\" and \"subject matter in controversy\" in various other subsections of\n§ 455(b) to describe situations where a judge must disqualify himself. Thus, we must\nassume that Congress ascribed a particular meaning to the words \"matter in\ncontroversy,\" and we must try to discern that meaning.\n\n      We note that Judge Wilson represented Judge Woods at the mandamus\nproceedings, which were given a separate docket number from the rest of the case in\nthis Court. This circumstance, though relevant, is not enough in itself to enable us\n\n                                        -4-\n\fto conclude that the disqualification proceeding was not the same \"matter in\ncontroversy\" as the present appeal. As we have indicated, the phrase \"matter in\ncontroversy\" must mean something other than the word \"case,\" and so we do not rely\non this technical distinction. Instead, we look to the substance of the issues argued\nand decided in the two proceedings.\n\n      In Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 839 F.2d\n1296 (8th Cir. 1988), we discussed, but did not decide, whether a matter in\ncontroversy could extend beyond a single case. Even if a matter in controversy could\nbe more extensive than a single case, we concluded that the facts before us did not\nsupport such a conclusion because the cases involved, \"to a large extent, different\nissues and different remedies.\" Id. at 1302. We think this reasoning is useful in\ndetermining whether a matter in controversy may be less extensive than a case.\n\n       Judge Wilson's representation of Judge Woods was restricted solely to the issue\nof recusal and did not go to the merits of the case. Judge Wilson was involved in the\ncase solely for the mandamus proceedings and, in the course of his representation,\nnever addressed the merits of the case or expressed any opinion about them. The\nissues before Judge Wilson in the present matter are wholly unrelated to his prior\nrepresentation of Judge Woods.\n\n       Although the case law is slim in this area, we find support for our position in\nIn re Apex Oil Co., 981 F.2d 302 (8th Cir. 1992). In Apex Oil, Judge Loken found\nhis recusal unnecessary where he and his former law firm were previously involved\nwith plaintiffs' claim for damages from an oil spill and where, later, his law firm filed\nclaims on behalf of plaintiffs in Apex Oil's bankruptcy proceedings. Id. at 304-05.\nThe question was whether the plaintiffs' claim for damages constituted the same\nmatter in controversy as the later claims in bankruptcy when both resulted from the\nsame oil spill. Id. at 303. Although acknowledging that bankruptcy proceedings are\natypical because they are conducted under an umbrella proceeding, Judge Loken\n\n                                          -5-\n\fconcluded that the cases were not \"sufficiently related\" so as to constitute the same\nmatter in controversy. Id. at 304. Applying this analysis to our situation, we\nconclude that there is not a sufficient relationship between the recusal proceedings\nwith respect to Judge Woods and the issues now before us on the merits to make them\nthe same \"matter in controversy.\" Nor do we think that any impartial observer could\nreasonably think that Judge Wilson's impartiality should be called into question. Not\nonly was his prior representation of Judge Woods wholly distinct; the issues before\nthe Judge in the current proceeding involved the current version of the parties'\nagreement to settle the underlying case, an agreement that was never before Judge\nWoods, and that was not even in existence until long after he voluntarily relinquished\nthe case.\n\n                                         II.\n\n       As we have noted, this appeal arises from an interdistrict desegregation case\nfiled by LRSD in 1982. As part of that case, the parties agreed to a settlement plan\nin 1989. However, as time passed, portions of that plan proved unworkable, and the\nparties agreed to the Revised Desegregation and Education Plan. This plan was\napproved by the District Court and this Court.\n\n      On March 15, 2001, LRSD asked the District Court to declare it unitary under\n§ 11 of the Revised Plan. On July 25, 2001, the Joshua Intervenors filed an\nopposition to this request. The opposition, App. of Appellants 185-86, made the\nfollowing argument, among many others:\n\n             The Joshua Intervenors believe further that the court must\n             have before it a written response to the district's plan or\n             other written analysis regarding that plan from the Court's\n             Office of Desegregation Monitoring (ODM) before the\n             Court can issue a final opinion regarding the matter.\n             Otherwise, any assessment by the Court would be\n\n                                         -6-\n\f             incomplete and not keeping with the expectations of the\n             Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals when it required the\n             establishment of the ODM to assist the Court in\n             determining and effectuating desegregation compliance.\n\n       This opposition was filed while the case was still before Chief Judge Wright\n(who had taken the case after Judge Woods had removed himself from it). She then\nconducted five and one-half days of evidentiary hearings, ending on November 20,\n2001. On January 3, 2002, Chief Judge Wright withdrew from the case, and it was\nreassigned to Judge Wilson. He held three additional days of evidentiary hearings on\nJuly 22, 23, and 24, 2002.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors' second major argument on appeal is that the District\nCourt erred in making findings and entering judgment without directing ODM to\nprepare additional monitoring reports on LRSD's compliance with the Revised Plan.\nThe Joshua Intervenors point out that the ODM was created in the first place at the\ndirection of this Court. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch.\nDist. No. 1, 921 F.2d 1371, 1388 (8th Cir. 1990).\n\n       The District Court had before it some relevant materials from the ODM: a\nreport on LRSD's preparations for implementation of the Revised Plan, filed August\n11, 1999, and a report of disciplinary sanctions in the Little Rock School District,\nfiled on June 14, 2000. As to the first report, the Court observed that it \"indicated\nthat, overall, LRSD was doing a satisfactory job of implementing the Revised Plan.\"\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 237 F. Supp. 2d\n988, 1048 (E.D. Ark. 2002). The District Court did not view the second report as\nhaving much value. The Joshua Intervenors argue that the District Court should have\nhad the ODM prepare an additional report or reports before making any findings.\nThey point out that \"ODM had gained considerable expertise, preparing at least 49\nreports.\" Brief for Appellants 39.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f      In response, LRSD argues that this point was not properly raised in the District\nCourt. Certainly it is true that the Court never entered a written order expressly\ndisposing of the request that additional monitoring reports be prepared. Before the\ncase was transferred to Judge Wilson, however, Chief Judge Wright effectively\ndenied the Intervenors' request, saying:\n\n             And of course, you are free, Mr. Walker, to call the Office\n             of Desegregation Monitoring as witnesses, as well, I mean,\n             those people as witnesses to the extent you think they have\n             knowledge on the matters at issue. And furthermore, and\n             I talked information with Ms. Marshall [the head of ODM]\n             about this, I don't mind Ms. Marshall telling you, sharing\n             with you the information that she has, but if she does that\n             I want her to share it with everyone else too.\n\nTr. of June 29, 2001, 27-28. The Joshua Intervenors, in response to this invitation or\notherwise, did not call anybody from the ODM as a witness.\n\n        As we have noted, the request that additional monitoring reports be required\nwas not the subject of a separate motion, but rather a matter mentioned, almost in\npassing, in a pleading filed by the Joshua Intervenors. App. of Appellants 185-86.\nAs far as we can tell, the request was never renewed on the record, either in writing\nor in open Court, during the days of evidentiary hearings conducted by Judge Wilson,\nor in any other manner. We nevertheless assume for present purposes that the point\nis properly before us, and we hold that it is without merit. The ODM, as the Joshua\nIntervenors point out, was created at the direction of this Court, at the time of our\ninitial approval of the settlement agreement, but the ODM was to be under the\nsupervision of the District Court and to act as an arm of that Court in ensuring that\nthe settlement agreement was followed. It was and remains the job of the District\nCourt, in its discretion, to determine how the ODM should be used. A choice to rely\non the existing materials prepared by the ODM, and to eschew the preparation of\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fadditional reports, is certainly not an abuse of discretion. Two further points are\nimportant. First, the Joshua Intervenors could have, but did not, call someone from\nthe ODM to testify. Second, no offer of proof was made. We do not know what\nODM's position would have been if it had been asked. In this situation, it is simply\nimpossible to say that the decision not to request the production of additional papers\nhad any effect on the outcome of this case.\n\n                                         III.\n\n      The Revised Plan \"supersede[s] and extinguish[es] all prior agreements and\norders\" in the case, with limited exceptions. App. of Appellants 87. Unlike the\nprevious settlement agreement, the Revised Plan contains a specific procedure by\nwhich LRSD can attain unitary status. Section 11 of the Revised Plan provides:\n\n             At the conclusion of the 2000-01 school year, the district\n             court shall enter an order releasing LRSD from court\n             supervision and finding the LRSD unitary with regard to\n             all aspects of school operations provided that LRSD has\n             substantially complied with its obligations set forth in this\n             Revised Plan. In anticipation of release, LRSD shall issue\n             a report on March 15, 2001 indicating the state of LRSD's\n             compliance with the Revised Plan. Any party challenging\n             LRSD's compliance bears the burden of proof. If no party\n             challenges LRSD's compliance, the above-described order\n             shall be entered without further proceedings.\n\nApp. of Appellants 110.\n\n       Although not required by § 11 of the Revised Plan, one year before the final\nreport required by § 11 was due, LRSD filed an interim report to demonstrate its\nprogress toward compliance. App. of Appellee 71. On March 15, 2001, as required\nby the Revised Plan, LRSD filed its final report, which supplemented and updated the\n\n                                         -9-\n\finformation provided in the interim report. App. of Appellee 245. The Joshua\nIntervenors filed objections to this report on June 25, 2001, challenging LRSD's\nsubstantial compliance with various sections of the Revised Plan. App. of Appellants\n185.\n\n       After holding evidentiary hearings on the Joshua Intervenors' objections, the\nDistrict Court issued an order granting LRSD partial unitary status. See Little Rock\nSch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d 1086. The District Court denied LRSD unitary status\nunder § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan, requiring LRSD to assess annually the academic\nprograms promulgated under § 2.7. Id. at 1081-82. LRSD has not cross-appealed the\nDistrict Court's ruling on § 2.7.1, and it is not before us. This issue remains pending\nin the District Court.\n\n      On appeal, the Joshua Intervenors argue that the District Court erred in\ngranting partial unitary status to LRSD. Specifically, the Joshua Intervenors\nchallenge the District Court's finding of substantial compliance with the following\nsections: (1) § 2.1, Good Faith; (2) §§ 2.5-2.5.4, Student Discipline; (3) § 2.6,\nExtracurricular Activities; and (4) §§ 2.6-2.6.2, Advanced Placement Classes.\n\n       We review the District Court's findings of fact for clear error. See Nash Finch\nCo. v. Rubloff Hastings, L.L.C., 341 F.3d 846, 850 (8th Cir. 2003). Thus, we must\naffirm unless the findings are, in our opinion, clearly erroneous, which means that we\nmust have a \"definite and firm conviction\" that the District Court was mistaken. Ibid.\nIf \"there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between\nthem cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Id. at 851 (quoting Anderson v. City of Bessemer\nCity, 470 U.S. 564, 574 (1985)).\n\n       We also note that the Joshua Intervenors bear the burden of proof. Under § 11\nof the Revised Plan, \"[a]ny party who challenges the Little Rock School District's\ncompliance bears the burden of proof.\" App. of Appellants 110. Section 11 of the\n\n                                         -10-\n\fRevised Plan also compelled the District Court to enter an order granting unitary\nstatus to LRSD unless the Joshua Intervenors met this burden. Ibid. We hold that the\nDistrict Court did not clearly err in finding that the Joshua Intervenors had not met\ntheir burden with respect to the four subject-matter areas on appeal. Thus, we affirm.\n\n                                         A.\n\n    The Joshua Intervenors appeal from the District Court's judgment granting\nLRSD unitary status under § 2.1 of the Revised Plan, which provides:\n\n             LRSD shall in good faith exercise its best efforts to comply\n             with the Constitution, to remedy the effects of past\n             discrimination by LRSD against African-American\n             students, to ensure that no person is discriminated against\n             on the basis of race, color or ethnicity in the operation of\n             the LRSD and to provide an equal educational opportunity\n             for all students attending LRSD schools.\n\nApp. of Appellants 88. This section places an independent duty on LRSD to exercise\nits \"best efforts\" and to act in \"good faith\" in attempting to remedy the effects of\ndiscrimination.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors argue that LRSD did not act in good faith. As\nevidence, they allege that Central High School is still functionally segregated,\nalthough the building itself has been integrated. See Brief for Appellants 44-46.\nSpecifically, the Joshua Intervenors argue that the advanced-placement program\nsegregates students into different classrooms, which are the functional equivalent of\ndifferent schools.

Moreover, they assert that the teachers are assigned to\nadvanced-placement courses in a racially segregated manner—white teachers\nteaching advanced-placement classes and African-American teachers teaching regular\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fclasses. Ibid. The Joshua Intervenors also suggest that segregation seeps outside of\nthe classroom and into extracurricular activities. Ibid.\n\n       The obligation of good faith under § 2.1 of the Revised Plan is separate from,\nand independent of, other affirmative obligations undertaken by LRSD pursuant to\n§ 2 of the Revised Plan. Thus, it is possible for LRSD to have acted in good faith,\nmeeting its obligation under § 2.1, even though it did not meet other affirmative\nobligations imposed by the Revised Plan.\n\n       After the Revised Plan was adopted, the Little Rock School Board enacted\nfifteen different policies related to its obligation of good faith and took steps to ensure\nthat all administrators and teachers were aware of these new policies. LRSD also\nhired Dr. Terrence Roberts, Tr. of July 24, 2002, at 615-16, and Dr. Steven Ross, Tr.\nof July 23, 2002, at 539, as desegregation experts. Dr. Roberts testified that he had\nbeen actively involved in reviewing policies and procedures. Tr. of July 24, 2002, at\n619-20. He also testified that he had developed training programs for teachers and\nother staff members. Ibid. Dr. Roberts testified that he told the Board that LRSD had\ndirected much energy and effort toward meeting all the criteria in the Revised Plan and\nthat LRSD had the potential for being a model school district for the nation. Id. at\n647. Dr. Roberts criticized LRSD for having a \"compliance mentality\" because some\nindividuals were interested only in meeting the requirements of the Revised Plan. Id.\nat 630-31. However, as explained by the District Court, compliance was exactly the\nissue at hand. LRSD was under constant scrutiny and had to be very careful that it met\nits obligations. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1045.\n\n       Under § 8.2 of the Revised Plan, a detailed procedure for addressing compliance\nissues was established whereby the parties would attempt to solve compliance issues\nbefore submitting them to the District Court for resolution. The Board paid the Joshua\nIntervenors to monitor LRSD's compliance with the Revised Plan. During the term\nof the Revised Plan, the Joshua Intervenors raised only five compliance issues, which\n\n                                          -12-\n\fwere all resolved without resorting to the District Court. App. of Appellee 415. None\nof the issues raised in opposition to the final report was previously raised by the\nJoshua Intervenors. The District Court found that the purpose of the dispute\nmechanism under § 8.2 was to avoid any surprises when LRSD filed the final report,\nand that LRSD reasonably relied on the Joshua Intervenors to raise any problems in\na timely fashion. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1043. The District Court\nalso found that the interim report placed the Joshua Intervenors on notice of all the\nproblems, but they did not respond. Ibid. Although § 11 does not require that any\nobjections be previously raised under § 8.2, the District Court found that Intervenors'\nfailure to raise these issues was a factor to consider in deciding whether LRSD\nsubstantially complied with the Revised Plan. Id. at 1043-44.\n\n      For the reasons stated above, we find no clear error in the District Court's\nfinding of substantial compliance with § 2.1 of the Revised Plan.\n\n                                         B.\n\n      The Joshua Intervenors also appeal from the District Court's judgment granting\nLRSD unitary status under §§ 2.5-2.5.4, relating to student discipline. Although\n§§ 2.5.1-2.5.4 impose specific obligations with regard to discipline, the Joshua\nIntervenors assert in particular that LRSD did not meet its obligation under § 2.5,\nwhich provides:\n\n             LRSD shall implement programs, policies and/or\n             procedures designed to ensure that there is no racial\n             discrimination with regard to student discipline.\n\nApp. of Appellants 90. This section requires LRSD to create and implement\nprograms and policies designed to eliminate discriminatory practices from student\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fdiscipline. It does not require, however, that LRSD in fact absolutely eliminate racial\ndisparity from student discipline.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors argue that the District Court improperly found that\nLRSD had substantially complied with § 2.5 because the Court misconstrued the\nmeaning of the words \"to ensure.\" Brief for Appellants 40. Interpretation of the\nRevised Plan is a question of law, which we review de novo, and we hold that the\nDistrict Court did not err in construing the obligation imposed by § 2.5.\n\n        The Joshua Intervenors argue that \"to ensure\" means to make sure that racial\ndiscrimination does not occur. Ibid. If \"to ensure\" were the only operative phrase in\nthe provision, the argument might be well taken. But § 2.5 does not require LRSD\nto ensure anything. It merely requires that LRSD \"implement programs, policies,\nand/or procedures designed to ensure . . ..\" (Emphasis ours.) The thrust of the\nprovision is that certain programs with the purpose of ensuring that there is no racial\ndiscrimination with regard to student discipline be instituted. This does not mean that\nthe programs must be perfectly efficacious. In addition, the object is to eradicate\ndiscrimination, which is not necessarily the same thing as disparity. Racial disparity\nmay exist without discrimination. Discrimination, of course, can cause disparity, but\nit is not the only possible cause.\n\n       Disparity in discipline is a nation-wide problem. The District Court cited\nsomething called \"total suspension index.\" The total suspension index demonstrates\ndisparity in discipline and is calculated by dividing the percentage of African-\nAmerican students expelled or suspended by the percentage of African-American\nstudents in the population, and comparing this number with that for white students.\nThe District Court found that LRSD's suspension index was between 1.25 - 1.31 for\nthe years 1997-2001. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1054. In other\nwords, to take 1997 as an example, African-American students were 1.25 times as\nlikely, so to speak, to be disciplined or suspended than white students. The national\n\n                                         -14-\n\findex for 1998 was 2.24, and the Arkansas index was 2.16. The District Court\nspecifically found that the Joshua Intervenors did not meet their burden of proving\nthat disproportionate discipline imposed on African-American students was the result\nof discrimination. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1057. This finding is not\nclearly erroneous.\n\n       LRSD enacted several policies to implement its obligations regarding student\ndiscipline and created a Compliance Plan, which outlined how LRSD planned to\nimplement the Revised Plan and who bore responsibility for such implementation.\nUnder the Compliance Plan, Junious Babbs was responsible for monitoring student\ndiscipline. An ombudsman, James Washington, was appointed pursuant to § 2.5.3 to\nensure that students were treated fairly throughout the discipline process. The\nombudsman was charged with shepherding students through the discipline process,\nincluding making students aware of the rules, acting as an advocate for students\ninvolved in the disciplinary process, and investigating parental and student\ncomplaints of discrimination.\n\n       The interim and final reports issued by LRSD focused on the decrease in\noverall suspensions and expulsions, due in part to programs developed by LRSD,\nsuch as behavior modification programs and alternative learning centers. App. of\nAppellee 85-87, 273-74.            Although the reduction in suspensions for\nAfrican-American students was not so large as that of white students, the District\nCourt found that the proportion of suspensions received by African-American\nstudents remained the same. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1051. Neither\nthe interim report nor the final report focused on the fact that racial disparity existed\namong the students who received suspensions or expulsions, and the District Court\nfound that LRSD could have sorted the data in such a way as to give a more\nmeaningful analysis. Id. at 1051-52. However, the District Court found that the\nJoshua Intervenors had access to the raw data and never raised the issue. Id. at 1052.\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fMore specifically, the District Court found that the reports did not mislead the Joshua\nIntervenors. Ibid.\n\n       The ODM produced a Report on Disciplinary Sanctions in LRSD, which\nshowed that African-American students received a disproportionate number of\nsuspensions and expulsions. However, the District Court specifically found that this\nreport was not intended to address the effectiveness of any programs that were\ninstituted to address fairness in discipline. Id. at 1052-53. The District Court also\nnoted that the report suggested that factors outside of the schools might affect which\nstudents receive discipline, such as home environment, family values, and whether\nthe home is a single-parent home. Id. at 1052. The report did not contain a specific\nanalysis of the facts of each suspension or expulsion to help determine whether\ndiscrimination occurred. Id. at 1052-53. However, the report did conclude that the\nracial disparity meant that LRSD \"has certainly not eliminated nor even abated racial\ndiscrimination in suspensions . . ..\" Id. at 1053 (quoting Report on Disciplinary\nSanctions in LRSD, June 14, 2000). The District Court rejected this conclusion as\nspeculative because it was based on raw statistics. Ibid.\n\n       Dr. Linda Watson, the Assistant Superintendent for Student Hearings, was\nresponsible for monitoring compliance with the Student Handbook. She reviewed\nevery long-term suspension or expulsion and all appeals from short-term suspensions.\nTr. of Nov. 19, 2001, 36-37. If the procedures of the Student Handbook were not\nfollowed, Dr. Watson overturned the punishment and removed it from the records.\nIbid. Although Dr. Watson acknowledged that African-American students were more\nfrequently suspended than white students, she believed this was due to the fact that\nthey more frequently engaged in conduct prohibited by the Student Handbook. Id.\nat 83-84. She also testified that she believed this was due primarily to socioeconomic\nfactors. (Some of these factors may be caused by or related to racial discrimination,\nbut they are not the fault of the present administration of LRSD.) The District Court\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fspecifically found that the testimony of all the administrators involved in the\ndisciplinary process was credible. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1050.\n\n      For these reasons, we find no clear error in the District Court's finding of\nsubstantial compliance with § 2.5 of the Revised Plan.\n\n                                           C.\n\n      The Joshua Intervenors also appeal from the District Court's judgment granting\nLRSD unitary status under §§ 2.6 and 2.6.3, relating to extracurricular activities.\nAlthough § 2.6.3 imposes a specific obligation with regard to transportation for\nextracurricular activities, the Joshua Intervenors assert that LRSD did not meet its\nobligation under § 2.6, which provides:\n\n             LRSD shall implement programs, policies and/or\n             procedures designed to promote participation and to ensure\n             that there are no barriers to participation by qualified\n             African-Americans in extracurricular activities . . ..\n\nApp. of Appellants 90-91.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors argue that racial discrimination occurred in\nextracurricular activities, evidenced by the fact that many extracurricular activities\ndid not have a proportionate share of African-American participants. Brief for\nAppellants 46. Certain activities' participants, such as tennis, swimming, quiz bowl,\nmock trial, and cheerleading, were predominantly white. The Joshua Intervenors also\nassert that there were barriers to participation, including costs of participation and\nlack of transportation.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors argue that racial disparities in extracurricular activities\nare the result of discrimination. However, as noted by the District Court, nothing in\n\n                                          -17-\n\f§ 2.6 of the Revised Plan required LRSD to impose quotas on extracurricular\nactivities. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1058. LRSD undertook to\npromote the participation of African-American students and to eliminate barriers to\nparticipation. As we noted above with respect to § 2.5, this provision does not make\nLRSD an insurer. It requires only that the District \"implement programs, policies\nand/or procedures designed to promote participation and to ensure,\" et cetera.\n(Emphasis ours.)\n\n       The final report noted a marked increase in African-American students'\nparticipation in extracurricular activities following the enactment of the new policies.\nApp. of Appellee 276-77. The final report also demonstrated that LRSD attempted\nto eliminate barriers to participation by having buses transport students to and from\nextracurricular activities. Id. at 278. Although the record does not establish which\nstudents took advantage of the extra buses, the final report stated that \"no\nextracurricular activity transportation request made by an eligible student has been\ndenied.\" Ibid. As noted by the District Court, the Joshua Intervenors bore the burden\nof proof on this issue, and they did not provide a single witness to testify that\nAfrican-American students were unable to participate because of a lack of\ntransportation. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1059.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors also assert that the costs of certain activities create a\nbarrier to participation. Although there are costs associated with certain activities,\nDr. Marian Lacey, Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Schools, testified that each\nschool had a discretionary fund which could be used to help students pay the costs of\nextracurricular activities. Tr. of July 24, 2002, 775-76. The District Court also found\nthat the Joshua Intervenors presented no testimony that any student was denied an\nopportunity to participate because of costs. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d\nat 1059-60.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f       The Joshua Intervenors asserted that certain schools, which were primarily\nAfrican-American, did not have the same extracurricular activities as other schools,\nand that this violated LRSD's duty to promote participation. However, the District\nCourt found that each school determined which extracurricular activities to offer on\nthe basis of student interest, and if enough interest existed, each school offered a\nstipend to sponsors of those activities. Id. at 1060. The District Court concluded that\ncertain activities were missing at certain schools not because of discrimination but\ninstead because of lack of student interest. Ibid.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors presented several students' testimony to support their\nassertion that African-American students were not encouraged to participate or were\nprevented from participating in extracurricular activities. The District Court did not\nfind this testimony impressive. Id. at 1061. Questions of credibility and inferences\nto be drawn from facts must generally be left to the trial court.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors bore the burden of proving that LRSD was not\nimplementing programs, policies, or procedures designed to promote participation\nand ensure there were no barriers to participation by qualified African-Americans in\nextracurricular activities. We hold that the District Court did not err in determining\nthat the Joshua Intervenors failed to meet this burden.\n\n                                          D.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors also appeal from the District Court's order granting\nLRSD unitary status under §§ 2.6-2.6.2, relating to advanced-placement classes and\nhonors programs. While §§ 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 impose specific duties on LRSD to\nprovide training programs for teachers to identify and encourage qualified\nAfrican-American students to participate in advanced-placement programs and to\nassist African-American students in being successful in advanced-placement\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fprograms, the Intervenors do not complain that these specific provisions were\nviolated. Instead, they focus on § 2.6, which imposes a more general duty:\n\n             LRSD shall implement programs, policies and/or\n             procedures designed to promote participation and to ensure\n             there are no barriers to participation by qualified\n             African-Americans in . . . advanced placement courses,\n             honors and enriched courses and the gifted and talented\n             program.\n\nApp. of Appellants 90-91. The phraseology of this provision is similar to others\ndiscussed above.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors assert that the District Court erred in finding no barriers\nto participation in advanced-placement courses. The low number of African-\nAmerican teachers assigned to advanced-placement courses, they say, is a barrier to\nparticipation. Brief for Appellants 43-44. The Joshua Intervenors rely primarily on\nthe testimony of Dr. Michael Faucette, an English teacher at Central High School.\nDr. Faucette testified that although there were eight African-American teachers and\neight white teachers in Central High's English Department, African-American\nteachers taught only a few of the advanced-placement sections. Tr. of July 22, 2002,\n176-80. Dr. Faucette, an African-American teacher, did not teach any of the\nadvanced-placement sections. Id. at 177.\n\n       The Little Rock School District Board created a regulation setting forth criteria\nto help teachers identify African-American students for participation in\nadvanced-placement courses. Although this was one factor used in identifying\nstudents for participation in advanced-placement courses, enrollment was still open\nto any student who showed the proper level of motivation and commitment. App. of\nAppellee 279. Teachers were then required to monitor performance and behavior to\nensure that students placed in those courses would remain there.\n\n                                          -20-\n\f       LRSD studied methods to increase enrollment in advanced-placement courses\nand determined that pre-advanced-placement courses were necessary to prepare\nstudents better and earlier. LRSD implemented pre-advanced-placement courses for\nsixth and seventh-grade students. These programs have been highly successful, and\nthe District Court found that as a result of these programs, LRSD has added over 600\nAfrican-American students to its advanced-placement courses for juniors and seniors.\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1063.\n\n      LRSD has also implemented the SMART Program, a summer program\ndesigned to teach algebra to students to prepare them for algebra in the eighth grade.\nApp. of Appellee 112. The District Court found that during the term of the Revised\nPlan, at least 95% of the students attending the SMART Program were\nAfrican-American. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1063. Evaluations of\nthe SMART Program determined that it was a success. Tr. of July 24, 2002, 678.\n\n       LRSD also instituted a \"Teachers of Color\" program to increase the number of\nAfrican-American advanced-placement teachers. Id. at 671. The principal at each\nmiddle school and high school determined who would be assigned to teach each class.\nHowever, the principals were constrained by the collective-bargaining agreement,\nwhich required consideration of a teacher's experience and seniority. Tr. of July 22,\n2002, 90. An advanced-placement teacher also needed to be qualified through the\nstate.   Although Dr. Faucette testified about the racial composition of\nadvanced-placement teachers in Central High School's English Department, he did\nnot know about other advanced-placement sections at Central High School. Little\nRock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1065. The District Court found Dr. Faucette's\ntestimony unreliable. Ibid.\n\n      The Joshua Intervenors also point to racial disparity in the Hall High School\nUniversity Studies program, a program developed in conjunction with the University\nof Arkansas at Little Rock that provided an opportunity for students to earn college\n\n                                        -21-\n\fcredit for classes taken at Hall High School. Admission requirements were developed\nby the University of Arkansas. Tr. of July 24, 2002, 727-28. In order to receive\ncollege credit for the courses, students were required to pay tuition of approximately\n$150 per course. Tr. of July 22, 2002, 114. The Joshua Intervenors assert that the\ntuition payments created a barrier to participation for African-American students.\nBrief for Appellants 42-43.\n\n      The District Court found that during the 1999-2000 school year, 58% of the\nstudents participating in Hall High School's University Studies Program were\nAfrican-American, while African-American students comprised 71% of all students\nat Hall High School. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1066. During\n2000-2001, only 35% of the students in the University Studies program were\nAfrican-American, while African-American students comprised 72% of all students\nat Hall High School. Ibid. However, the Court found that the Joshua Intervenors\npresented no evidence that any student was denied admission to the University\nStudies Program because of inability to pay. Ibid. Testimony also indicates that the\nschool solicited a donation to cover the cost for at least one African-American student\nwho wished to participate but was unable to pay. Tr. of July 24, 2002, 802.\n\n    For these reasons, we hold that the District Court did not err in finding that\nLRSD substantially complied with its obligations under § 2.6 of the Revised Plan.\n\n                             *    *    *      *   *    *\n\n      The judgment is affirmed. It goes without saying, but we say it anyway, that\nLRSD remains fully subject to the Constitution and all other applicable laws, and that\nthese obligations are enforceable by appropriate legal action.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\fHEANEY, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n       I concur in every aspect of the majority’s opinion except insofar as it holds that\nthe LRSD has implemented “programs, policies and/or procedures designed to ensure\nthat there is no racial discrimination with regard to student discipline,” as required by\nsection 2.5 of the Revised Plan. In my view, the LRSD has failed to meet this\nobligation.\n\n       It is true that the LRSD has implemented several programs with regard to\nstudent discipline: the LRSD provided every student, parent, teacher, and\nadministrator with a copy of the Student Handbook; the LRSD trained students,\nteachers, and administrators on provisions in the Handbook; the LRSD created the\nposition of Ombudsman to investigate student complaints of race-based mistreatment\nin student discipline; Dr. Linda Watson, the Assistant Superintendent who was\nresponsible for implementing section 2.5 of the Revised Plan, reviewed every long-\nterm suspension and expulsion, and any short-term suspensions that were appealed;\nDr. Watson prepared and reviewed quarterly Discipline Management Reports from\neach school, used these reports to identify problems, and met with the schools’\nadministrators to discuss solutions; the LRSD established alternative learning\nenvironments to allow students with behavioral problems to remain in school; the\nLRSD offered training in classroom management and effective discipline; and the\nLRSD followed a progressive discipline approach by imposing lesser sanctions before\nsuspending students.\n\n      It is also true that the LRSD has reduced the total number of disciplinary\nsanctions of students during the time of the Revised Plan from 5,312 total sanctions\nin 1998, to 5,080 total sanctions in 2001.5 During that same period, however, the\n\n\n      5\n     All 1998 statistics are from the LRSD’s 1998-1999 Annual Disciplinary\nManagement Report (Ct. Ex. CX679) and the 2001 statistics are from the LRSD’s\n\n                                          -23-\n\fnumber of black students receiving disciplinary sanctions actually increased. During\nthe 1998-99 school year, there were 4,470 disciplinary sanctions of black students\ncompared to 842 disciplinary sanctions of white students. Put another way, in the\nfirst year of the Revised Plan, 65% of the student population in the LRSD was black,\nwhile 84% of the disciplinary sanctions were of black students. By 2001, the year the\nLRSD sought unitary status, the disparity was even greater. In the 2000-01 school\nyear, there were 4,534 disciplinary sanctions of black students compared to 546\ndisciplinary sanctions of white students. In other words, black students consisted of\n68% of the student population, but accounted for 89% of the disciplinary sanctions.\nTherefore, from 1998 to 2001, disciplinary sanctions of black students increased from\n84% to 89%. It is undisputed that the programs instituted by the LRSD to address\ndisciplinary issues have had no positive impact on the racial disparity of student\ndiscipline in the district.\n\n       If you compare the discipline statistics in the individual high schools for the\nsame period they track in very similar ways with almost all of the schools\nexperiencing an increase in disparity. It is worth noting, however, that Parkview\nHigh School, the most integrated high school in the district, has the lowest racial\ndisparity in student discipline in the district. In 1998-99, Parkview’s student\npopulation was 51% black and the percentage of disciplinary sanctions of black\nstudents was 49%. In 2000-01, Parkview’s black student population was still 51%,\nbut the percentage of disciplinary sanctions of black students rose to 66%. Even at\n66%, however, Parkview still had the lowest disparity in student discipline in the\ndistrict that year.\n\n       I agree that the Revised Plan does not require the LRSD to absolutely eliminate\nracial disparity from student discipline. The majority and the district court, however,\nrely heavily on the fact that section 2.5 requires the LRSD to implement programs\n\n\n2000-2001 Annual Disciplinary Management Report (Ct. Ex. CX681).\n\n                                         -24-\n\f“designed to ensure” that there is no racial discrimination in student discipline. The\nimplication is that because the LRSD implemented programs which would effect\nstudent discipline, the actual impact of those programs does not matter. I disagree.\nIt is not enough for the LRSD to list the programs it implemented to address the\ndisparity in student discipline, when the result of those programs was an increase in\nthe racial disparity in student discipline. The mere implementation of programs, no\nmatter how many or how impressive sounding, that have virtually no impact on the\nracial disparity in student discipline is not enough to meet the district’s obligations\nunder the Revised Plan.\n\n       This lack of impact on the disparity in discipline is really no surprise when you\nreview the testimony of Dr. Watson. Dr. Watson testified that: she was never\ninstructed that there needed to be a reduction in the racial impact of suspensions in\nthe district; she never prepared a monitoring report with regard to disparities in\ndiscipline; she did not prepare any reports which track whether certain teachers or\nadministrators have a pattern of disciplinary actions based on race; nor did she\nrecommend any programs to address the continued disparate impact of discipline.\n(Nov. 19, 2001, Unitary Status Hr’g Tr. at 25-163.) Dr. Watson also testified that the\npercentage of black students being suspended did not decrease, that disparate patterns\nof discipline still exist based on race, that there are no plans to reduce the disparate\nimpact of student discipline in the district, and that the LRSD is not even looking at\nstudent discipline based on race. (Id.)\n\n       The majority, and the district court, seem to take solace in the fact that racial\ndisparity in student discipline is a national problem. According to the district court,\nin 1998, the national “total suspension index” was 2.24 and the Arkansas “total\nsuspension index” was 2.16, whereas the LRSD’s “total suspension index” remained\nconstant at 1.26 from 1997-2000. Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special\nSch. Dist. No. 1, 237 F.Supp. 2d 988, 1054 (E.D. Ark. 2002). The majority and the\ndistrict court consider the fact that the LRSD’s index is lower than that of the nation\n\n                                         -25-\n\fand the state significant, and the fact that the LRSD’s index did not change over the\nperiod of the Revised Plan insignificant. I disagree. The Revised Plan said nothing\nabout the LRSD’s racial disparity in student discipline in comparison to the state or\nthe nation. The Revised Plan did, however, require the LRSD to implement programs\ndesigned to ensure that the racial disparity in student discipline in the district would\ndecrease. This, they failed to do.\n\n       The majority and the district court also assert that Joshua did not meet its\nburden in proving that the racial disparity in student discipline was the result of\ndiscrimination. This was not Joshua’s burden. According to section 11 of the\nRevised Plan, Joshua bears the burden of proving that the LRSD failed to comply\nwith its obligations as set forth in the plan. Joshua met this burden by showing that\nthe programs the LRSD implemented to address the racial disparity in discipline were\nineffective. As I read the Revised Plan, it was the LRSD’s obligation to determine\nwhether the continued disparity in discipline was the result of racial discrimination\nor merely socioeconomic factors as suggested by Dr. Watson. Here again, the LRSD\nfailed to meet its obligation and rested merely on the fact that it implemented\nprograms. Programs that, in the end, had no effect on the racial disparity in student\ndiscipline.\n\n       It is true that Joshua could have done more to raise concerns about the failure\nof the LRSD’s programs earlier, but this does not remove all responsibility from the\nLRSD. The statistics compiled and reports filed by the LRSD lack valuable data. I\nhave found no useful statistics on recidivism among students to determine how many\nstudents, and of what race, are receiving multiple disciplinary sanctions. The record\ndoes not contain statistics that separate offenses involving the discretionary judgment\nof staff from objective offenses. The record lacks any reports which show whether\nthere is a correlation between the race of the teacher administering the discipline and\nthe race of the student receiving it, or whether certain teachers have a higher rate of\ndiscipline than others. Dr. Watson testified that she was able to access some of this\n\n                                         -26-\n\finformation and that she knew which schools had high rates of disciplinary sanctions\nand which teachers issued more suspensions than others, but I cannot agree that her\npersonal, undocumented knowledge was sufficient to meet the court’s mandate that\nthe district implement programs, policies, and procedures designed to ensure that\nthere is no racial discrimination with respect to student discipline.\n\n       Absent the necessary records, there is no way the district court, or this court,\ncan reach an informed conclusion as to whether blacks are disciplined more\nfrequently for legitimate reasons or because they are judged by different standards\nthan white students, at least by some teachers. I would remand this case to the district\ncourt on the disciplinary issue, along with the issue of student achievement retained\nby the district court, to require the district to comply with our original mandate.\n                        ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\f",

We conclude that Judge\nWilson's representation of Judge Henry Woods at a much earlier stage of the case,\nand on far different issues, did not involve the same \"matter in controversy\" for\npurposes of 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(2); thus, we affirm the denial of the Joshua\nIntervenors' Motion for Recusal.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors also appeal from the District Court's judgment granting\nthe Little Rock School District (LRSD) partial unitary status. The Joshua Intervenors\nassert: (1) that the District Court erred by not requiring and considering additional\nreports from the Office of Desegregation Monitoring (ODM); and (2) that the District\nCourt's finding of substantial compliance with the Revised Desegregation and\nEducation Plan was erroneous. We hold that the District Court did not err by failing\nto require new written reports from the ODM, and that the District Court's findings\nof fact are not clearly erroneous; thus, we affirm the grant of partial unitary status.\n\n      Because the facts relevant to each issue on appeal are different, we address\nthem separately. In Part I, we address the issue of disqualification. In Part II, we\naddress whether the District Court should have required new written reports from the\n\n\n      1\n        This group of school children and parents are, as a practical matter, the\nplaintiffs in the case at its present juncture. The Little Rock School District, which\nactually initiated the case in 1982, is effectively the defendant for purposes of this\nappeal.\n      2\n       The Honorable William R. Wilson, Jr., United States District Judge for the\nEastern District of Arkansas.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fODM. Finally, in Part III, we address whether the District Court erred in finding that\nLRSD substantially complied with the Revised Plan in most respects.\n\n                                          I.\n\n       This litigation began in 1982 and has been in and out of this Court and the\nDistrict Court several times — it is complex to say the least. We briefly highlight the\nevents relevant to the issue of the disqualification of Judge Wilson.\n\n       In 1987, LRSD and the Joshua Intervenors sought to disqualify Judge Henry\nWoods,3 who was then presiding over the case. The parties asserted as grounds for\ndisqualification that during Judge Woods's private law practice, one of his partners\nhad represented parties who participated as amici curiae in a related case, and that\nJudge Woods's impartiality was called into question by his comments at a meeting\nwith students. Judge Wilson, then in private practice, represented Judge Woods for\nthe limited purpose of the mandamus proceedings, defending Judge Woods's decision\nnot to recuse himself.4\n\n       In the current proceeding, begun by LRSD's motion that it be released from\ncourt supervision, the Joshua Intervenors sought the recusal of Judge Wilson under\n28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(2), which requires a judge to disqualify himself \"where in private\npractice he served as lawyer in the matter in controversy.\" After Judge Wilson\nentered an order on September 13, 2002, granting LRSD partial unitary status, the\n\n      3\n       The Little Rock School District sought a writ of mandamus asking this Court\nto disqualify Judge Woods, and the Joshua Intervenors appealed a judgment entered\nby Judge Woods, asserting, among other things, that the judge should be disqualified.\n      4\n        This Court found that Judge Woods was not disqualified.

Judge Wilson denied this motion on October 29, 2002.\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">31465311</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n(E.D. Ark. 2002). Thereafter, on November 25, 2002, the Joshua Intervenors moved\nfor disqualification of Judge Wilson. Judge Wilson denied this motion because,\namong other reasons, he had never served, in his view, as a lawyer in the \"matter in\ncontroversy.\" Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, No.\n4:82CV00866 (E.D. Ark. Dec. 20, 2002). The Joshua Intervenors appeal.\n\n      We must determine whether Judge Wilson's representation of Judge Woods in\nthe mandamus proceeding in 1987 involved the same \"matter in controversy\" as the\npresent questions before us for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 455(b)(2). Because the\nmandamus proceeding did not touch upon the merits of the case, we conclude that it\nwas not a part of the same \"matter in controversy.\"\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors contend that Judge Wilson's participation was part of\nthe same matter in controversy because it was part of a single case. The language\nchosen by Congress, \"matter in controversy,\" is not defined by the statute. However,\nCongress easily could have substituted the word \"case\" for the words \"matter in\ncontroversy,\" but did not do so. This deliberate choice by Congress demonstrates an\nintent that the words \"matter in controversy\" mean something other than what we\ncommonly refer to as a \"case.\" In fact, Congress used the words \"proceeding,\" \"case\nin controversy,\" and \"subject matter in controversy\" in various other subsections of\n§ 455(b) to describe situations where a judge must disqualify himself. Thus, we must\nassume that Congress ascribed a particular meaning to the words \"matter in\ncontroversy,\" and we must try to discern that meaning.\n\n      We note that Judge Wilson represented Judge Woods at the mandamus\nproceedings, which were given a separate docket number from the rest of the case in\nthis Court. This circumstance, though relevant, is not enough in itself to enable us\n\n                                        -4-\n\fto conclude that the disqualification proceeding was not the same \"matter in\ncontroversy\" as the present appeal. As we have indicated, the phrase \"matter in\ncontroversy\" must mean something other than the word \"case,\" and so we do not rely\non this technical distinction. Instead, we look to the substance of the issues argued\nand decided in the two proceedings.\n\n      In Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"501867\"><a href=\"/opinion/501867/little-rock-school-district-lorene-joshua-as-next-friend-of-minors-leslie/\"><span class=\"volume\">839</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1988), we discussed, but did not decide, whether a matter in\ncontroversy could extend beyond a single case. Even if a matter in controversy could\nbe more extensive than a single case, we concluded that the facts before us did not\nsupport such a conclusion because the cases involved, \"to a large extent, different\nissues and different remedies.\" Id. at 1302. We think this reasoning is useful in\ndetermining whether a matter in controversy may be less extensive than a case.\n\n       Judge Wilson's representation of Judge Woods was restricted solely to the issue\nof recusal and did not go to the merits of the case. Judge Wilson was involved in the\ncase solely for the mandamus proceedings and, in the course of his representation,\nnever addressed the merits of the case or expressed any opinion about them. The\nissues before Judge Wilson in the present matter are wholly unrelated to his prior\nrepresentation of Judge Woods.\n\n       Although the case law is slim in this area, we find support for our position in\nIn re Apex Oil Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"596440\"><a href=\"/opinion/596440/in-re-apex-oil-company-debtor-artoc-bank-and-trust-limited-v-apex-oil/\"><span class=\"volume\">981</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (8th Cir. 1992). In Apex Oil, Judge Loken found\nhis recusal unnecessary where he and his former law firm were previously involved\nwith plaintiffs' claim for damages from an oil spill and where, later, his law firm filed\nclaims on behalf of plaintiffs in Apex Oil's bankruptcy proceedings. Id. at 304-05.\nThe question was whether the plaintiffs' claim for damages constituted the same\nmatter in controversy as the later claims in bankruptcy when both resulted from the\nsame oil spill. Id. at 303. Although acknowledging that bankruptcy proceedings are\natypical because they are conducted under an umbrella proceeding, Judge Loken\n\n                                          -5-\n\fconcluded that the cases were not \"sufficiently related\" so as to constitute the same\nmatter in controversy. Id. at 304. Applying this analysis to our situation, we\nconclude that there is not a sufficient relationship between the recusal proceedings\nwith respect to Judge Woods and the issues now before us on the merits to make them\nthe same \"matter in controversy.\" Nor do we think that any impartial observer could\nreasonably think that Judge Wilson's impartiality should be called into question. Not\nonly was his prior representation of Judge Woods wholly distinct; the issues before\nthe Judge in the current proceeding involved the current version of the parties'\nagreement to settle the underlying case, an agreement that was never before Judge\nWoods, and that was not even in existence until long after he voluntarily relinquished\nthe case.\n\n                                         II.\n\n       As we have noted, this appeal arises from an interdistrict desegregation case\nfiled by LRSD in 1982. As part of that case, the parties agreed to a settlement plan\nin 1989. However, as time passed, portions of that plan proved unworkable, and the\nparties agreed to the Revised Desegregation and Education Plan. This plan was\napproved by the District Court and this Court.\n\n      On March 15, 2001, LRSD asked the District Court to declare it unitary under\n§ 11 of the Revised Plan. On July 25, 2001, the Joshua Intervenors filed an\nopposition to this request. The opposition, App. of Appellants 185-86, made the\nfollowing argument, among many others:\n\n             The Joshua Intervenors believe further that the court must\n             have before it a written response to the district's plan or\n             other written analysis regarding that plan from the Court's\n             Office of Desegregation Monitoring (ODM) before the\n             Court can issue a final opinion regarding the matter.\n             Otherwise, any assessment by the Court would be\n\n                                         -6-\n\f             incomplete and not keeping with the expectations of the\n             Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals when it required the\n             establishment of the ODM to assist the Court in\n             determining and effectuating desegregation compliance.\n\n       This opposition was filed while the case was still before Chief Judge Wright\n(who had taken the case after Judge Woods had removed himself from it). She then\nconducted five and one-half days of evidentiary hearings, ending on November 20,\n2001. On January 3, 2002, Chief Judge Wright withdrew from the case, and it was\nreassigned to Judge Wilson. He held three additional days of evidentiary hearings on\nJuly 22, 23, and 24, 2002.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors' second major argument on appeal is that the District\nCourt erred in making findings and entering judgment without directing ODM to\nprepare additional monitoring reports on LRSD's compliance with the Revised Plan.\nThe Joshua Intervenors point out that the ODM was created in the first place at the\ndirection of this Court. See Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch.\nDist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553317\"><a href=\"/opinion/553317/little-rock-school-district-lorene-joshua-as-next-friend-of-minors-leslie/\"><span class=\"volume\">921</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1371</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1388 (8th Cir. 1990).\n\n       The District Court had before it some relevant materials from the ODM: a\nreport on LRSD's preparations for implementation of the Revised Plan, filed August\n11, 1999, and a report of disciplinary sanctions in the Little Rock School District,\nfiled on June 14, 2000. As to the first report, the Court observed that it \"indicated\nthat, overall, LRSD was doing a satisfactory job of implementing the Revised Plan.\"\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462997\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462997/little-rock-sch-dist-v-pulaski-cty-spec-sch/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1048 (E.D. Ark. 2002). The District Court did not view the second report as\nhaving much value. The Joshua Intervenors argue that the District Court should have\nhad the ODM prepare an additional report or reports before making any findings.\nThey point out that \"ODM had gained considerable expertise, preparing at least 49\nreports.\" Brief for Appellants 39.\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f      In response, LRSD argues that this point was not properly raised in the District\nCourt. Certainly it is true that the Court never entered a written order expressly\ndisposing of the request that additional monitoring reports be prepared. Before the\ncase was transferred to Judge Wilson, however, Chief Judge Wright effectively\ndenied the Intervenors' request, saying:\n\n             And of course, you are free, Mr. Walker, to call the Office\n             of Desegregation Monitoring as witnesses, as well, I mean,\n             those people as witnesses to the extent you think they have\n             knowledge on the matters at issue. And furthermore, and\n             I talked information with Ms. Marshall [the head of ODM]\n             about this, I don't mind Ms. Marshall telling you, sharing\n             with you the information that she has, but if she does that\n             I want her to share it with everyone else too.\n\nTr. of June 29, 2001, 27-28. The Joshua Intervenors, in response to this invitation or\notherwise, did not call anybody from the ODM as a witness.\n\n        As we have noted, the request that additional monitoring reports be required\nwas not the subject of a separate motion, but rather a matter mentioned, almost in\npassing, in a pleading filed by the Joshua Intervenors. App. of Appellants 185-86.\nAs far as we can tell, the request was never renewed on the record, either in writing\nor in open Court, during the days of evidentiary hearings conducted by Judge Wilson,\nor in any other manner. We nevertheless assume for present purposes that the point\nis properly before us, and we hold that it is without merit. The ODM, as the Joshua\nIntervenors point out, was created at the direction of this Court, at the time of our\ninitial approval of the settlement agreement, but the ODM was to be under the\nsupervision of the District Court and to act as an arm of that Court in ensuring that\nthe settlement agreement was followed. It was and remains the job of the District\nCourt, in its discretion, to determine how the ODM should be used. A choice to rely\non the existing materials prepared by the ODM, and to eschew the preparation of\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fadditional reports, is certainly not an abuse of discretion. Two further points are\nimportant. First, the Joshua Intervenors could have, but did not, call someone from\nthe ODM to testify. Second, no offer of proof was made. We do not know what\nODM's position would have been if it had been asked. In this situation, it is simply\nimpossible to say that the decision not to request the production of additional papers\nhad any effect on the outcome of this case.\n\n                                         III.\n\n      The Revised Plan \"supersede[s] and extinguish[es] all prior agreements and\norders\" in the case, with limited exceptions. App. of Appellants 87. Unlike the\nprevious settlement agreement, the Revised Plan contains a specific procedure by\nwhich LRSD can attain unitary status. Section 11 of the Revised Plan provides:\n\n             At the conclusion of the 2000-01 school year, the district\n             court shall enter an order releasing LRSD from court\n             supervision and finding the LRSD unitary with regard to\n             all aspects of school operations provided that LRSD has\n             substantially complied with its obligations set forth in this\n             Revised Plan. In anticipation of release, LRSD shall issue\n             a report on March 15, 2001 indicating the state of LRSD's\n             compliance with the Revised Plan. Any party challenging\n             LRSD's compliance bears the burden of proof. If no party\n             challenges LRSD's compliance, the above-described order\n             shall be entered without further proceedings.\n\nApp. of Appellants 110.\n\n       Although not required by § 11 of the Revised Plan, one year before the final\nreport required by § 11 was due, LRSD filed an interim report to demonstrate its\nprogress toward compliance. App. of Appellee 71. On March 15, 2001, as required\nby the Revised Plan, LRSD filed its final report, which supplemented and updated the\n\n                                         -9-\n\finformation provided in the interim report. App. of Appellee 245. The Joshua\nIntervenors filed objections to this report on June 25, 2001, challenging LRSD's\nsubstantial compliance with various sections of the Revised Plan. App. of Appellants\n185.\n\n       After holding evidentiary hearings on the Joshua Intervenors' objections, the\nDistrict Court issued an order granting LRSD partial unitary status. See Little Rock\nSch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1086</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The District Court denied LRSD unitary status\nunder § 2.7.1 of the Revised Plan, requiring LRSD to assess annually the academic\nprograms promulgated under § 2.7. Id. at 1081-82. LRSD has not cross-appealed the\nDistrict Court's ruling on § 2.7.1, and it is not before us. This issue remains pending\nin the District Court.\n\n      On appeal, the Joshua Intervenors argue that the District Court erred in\ngranting partial unitary status to LRSD. Specifically, the Joshua Intervenors\nchallenge the District Court's finding of substantial compliance with the following\nsections: (1) § 2.1, Good Faith; (2) §§ 2.5-2.5.4, Student Discipline; (3) § 2.6,\nExtracurricular Activities; and (4) §§ 2.6-2.6.2, Advanced Placement Classes.\n\n       We review the District Court's findings of fact for clear error. See Nash Finch\nCo. v. Rubloff Hastings, L.L.C., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783361\"><a href=\"/opinion/783361/nash-finch-company-v-rubloff-hastings-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">846</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 850 (8th Cir. 2003). Thus, we must\naffirm unless the findings are, in our opinion, clearly erroneous, which means that we\nmust have a \"definite and firm conviction\" that the District Court was mistaken. Ibid.\nIf \"there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice between\nthem cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Id. at 851 (quoting Anderson v. City of Bessemer\nCity, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111373\"><a href=\"/opinion/111373/anderson-v-bessemer-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 574 (1985)).\n\n       We also note that the Joshua Intervenors bear the burden of proof. Under § 11\nof the Revised Plan, \"[a]ny party who challenges the Little Rock School District's\ncompliance bears the burden of proof.\" App. of Appellants 110. Section 11 of the\n\n                                         -10-\n\fRevised Plan also compelled the District Court to enter an order granting unitary\nstatus to LRSD unless the Joshua Intervenors met this burden. Ibid. We hold that the\nDistrict Court did not clearly err in finding that the Joshua Intervenors had not met\ntheir burden with respect to the four subject-matter areas on appeal. Thus, we affirm.\n\n                                         A.\n\n    The Joshua Intervenors appeal from the District Court's judgment granting\nLRSD unitary status under § 2.1 of the Revised Plan, which provides:\n\n             LRSD shall in good faith exercise its best efforts to comply\n             with the Constitution, to remedy the effects of past\n             discrimination by LRSD against African-American\n             students, to ensure that no person is discriminated against\n             on the basis of race, color or ethnicity in the operation of\n             the LRSD and to provide an equal educational opportunity\n             for all students attending LRSD schools.\n\nApp. of Appellants 88. This section places an independent duty on LRSD to exercise\nits \"best efforts\" and to act in \"good faith\" in attempting to remedy the effects of\ndiscrimination.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors argue that LRSD did not act in good faith. As\nevidence, they allege that Central High School is still functionally segregated,\nalthough the building itself has been integrated. See Brief for Appellants 44-46.\nSpecifically, the Joshua Intervenors argue that the advanced-placement program\nsegregates students into different classrooms, which are the functional equivalent of\ndifferent schools. Ibid. Moreover, they assert that the teachers are assigned to\nadvanced-placement courses in a racially segregated manner—white teachers\nteaching advanced-placement classes and African-American teachers teaching regular\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fclasses. Ibid. The Joshua Intervenors also suggest that segregation seeps outside of\nthe classroom and into extracurricular activities. Ibid.\n\n       The obligation of good faith under § 2.1 of the Revised Plan is separate from,\nand independent of, other affirmative obligations undertaken by LRSD pursuant to\n§ 2 of the Revised Plan. Thus, it is possible for LRSD to have acted in good faith,\nmeeting its obligation under § 2.1, even though it did not meet other affirmative\nobligations imposed by the Revised Plan.\n\n       After the Revised Plan was adopted, the Little Rock School Board enacted\nfifteen different policies related to its obligation of good faith and took steps to ensure\nthat all administrators and teachers were aware of these new policies. LRSD also\nhired Dr. Terrence Roberts, Tr. of July 24, 2002, at 615-16, and Dr. Steven Ross, Tr.\nof July 23, 2002, at 539, as desegregation experts. Dr. Roberts testified that he had\nbeen actively involved in reviewing policies and procedures. Tr. of July 24, 2002, at\n619-20. He also testified that he had developed training programs for teachers and\nother staff members. Ibid. Dr. Roberts testified that he told the Board that LRSD had\ndirected much energy and effort toward meeting all the criteria in the Revised Plan and\nthat LRSD had the potential for being a model school district for the nation. Id. at\n647. Dr. Roberts criticized LRSD for having a \"compliance mentality\" because some\nindividuals were interested only in meeting the requirements of the Revised Plan. Id.\nat 630-31. However, as explained by the District Court, compliance was exactly the\nissue at hand. LRSD was under constant scrutiny and had to be very careful that it met\nits obligations. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1045.\n\n       Under § 8.2 of the Revised Plan, a detailed procedure for addressing compliance\nissues was established whereby the parties would attempt to solve compliance issues\nbefore submitting them to the District Court for resolution. The Board paid the Joshua\nIntervenors to monitor LRSD's compliance with the Revised Plan. During the term\nof the Revised Plan, the Joshua Intervenors raised only five compliance issues, which\n\n                                          -12-\n\fwere all resolved without resorting to the District Court. App. of Appellee 415. None\nof the issues raised in opposition to the final report was previously raised by the\nJoshua Intervenors. The District Court found that the purpose of the dispute\nmechanism under § 8.2 was to avoid any surprises when LRSD filed the final report,\nand that LRSD reasonably relied on the Joshua Intervenors to raise any problems in\na timely fashion. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1043. The District Court\nalso found that the interim report placed the Joshua Intervenors on notice of all the\nproblems, but they did not respond. Ibid. Although § 11 does not require that any\nobjections be previously raised under § 8.2, the District Court found that Intervenors'\nfailure to raise these issues was a factor to consider in deciding whether LRSD\nsubstantially complied with the Revised Plan. Id. at 1043-44.\n\n      For the reasons stated above, we find no clear error in the District Court's\nfinding of substantial compliance with § 2.1 of the Revised Plan.\n\n                                         B.\n\n      The Joshua Intervenors also appeal from the District Court's judgment granting\nLRSD unitary status under §§ 2.5-2.5.4, relating to student discipline. Although\n§§ 2.5.1-2.5.4 impose specific obligations with regard to discipline, the Joshua\nIntervenors assert in particular that LRSD did not meet its obligation under § 2.5,\nwhich provides:\n\n             LRSD shall implement programs, policies and/or\n             procedures designed to ensure that there is no racial\n             discrimination with regard to student discipline.\n\nApp. of Appellants 90. This section requires LRSD to create and implement\nprograms and policies designed to eliminate discriminatory practices from student\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fdiscipline. It does not require, however, that LRSD in fact absolutely eliminate racial\ndisparity from student discipline.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors argue that the District Court improperly found that\nLRSD had substantially complied with § 2.5 because the Court misconstrued the\nmeaning of the words \"to ensure.\" Brief for Appellants 40. Interpretation of the\nRevised Plan is a question of law, which we review de novo, and we hold that the\nDistrict Court did not err in construing the obligation imposed by § 2.5.\n\n        The Joshua Intervenors argue that \"to ensure\" means to make sure that racial\ndiscrimination does not occur. Ibid. If \"to ensure\" were the only operative phrase in\nthe provision, the argument might be well taken. But § 2.5 does not require LRSD\nto ensure anything. It merely requires that LRSD \"implement programs, policies,\nand/or procedures designed to ensure . . ..\" (Emphasis ours.) The thrust of the\nprovision is that certain programs with the purpose of ensuring that there is no racial\ndiscrimination with regard to student discipline be instituted. This does not mean that\nthe programs must be perfectly efficacious. In addition, the object is to eradicate\ndiscrimination, which is not necessarily the same thing as disparity. Racial disparity\nmay exist without discrimination. Discrimination, of course, can cause disparity, but\nit is not the only possible cause.\n\n       Disparity in discipline is a nation-wide problem. The District Court cited\nsomething called \"total suspension index.\" The total suspension index demonstrates\ndisparity in discipline and is calculated by dividing the percentage of African-\nAmerican students expelled or suspended by the percentage of African-American\nstudents in the population, and comparing this number with that for white students.\nThe District Court found that LRSD's suspension index was between 1.25 - 1.31 for\nthe years 1997-2001. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1054. In other\nwords, to take 1997 as an example, African-American students were 1.25 times as\nlikely, so to speak, to be disciplined or suspended than white students. The national\n\n                                         -14-\n\findex for 1998 was 2.24, and the Arkansas index was 2.16. The District Court\nspecifically found that the Joshua Intervenors did not meet their burden of proving\nthat disproportionate discipline imposed on African-American students was the result\nof discrimination. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1057. This finding is not\nclearly erroneous.\n\n       LRSD enacted several policies to implement its obligations regarding student\ndiscipline and created a Compliance Plan, which outlined how LRSD planned to\nimplement the Revised Plan and who bore responsibility for such implementation.\nUnder the Compliance Plan, Junious Babbs was responsible for monitoring student\ndiscipline. An ombudsman, James Washington, was appointed pursuant to § 2.5.3 to\nensure that students were treated fairly throughout the discipline process. The\nombudsman was charged with shepherding students through the discipline process,\nincluding making students aware of the rules, acting as an advocate for students\ninvolved in the disciplinary process, and investigating parental and student\ncomplaints of discrimination.\n\n       The interim and final reports issued by LRSD focused on the decrease in\noverall suspensions and expulsions, due in part to programs developed by LRSD,\nsuch as behavior modification programs and alternative learning centers. App. of\nAppellee 85-87, 273-74.            Although the reduction in suspensions for\nAfrican-American students was not so large as that of white students, the District\nCourt found that the proportion of suspensions received by African-American\nstudents remained the same. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1051. Neither\nthe interim report nor the final report focused on the fact that racial disparity existed\namong the students who received suspensions or expulsions, and the District Court\nfound that LRSD could have sorted the data in such a way as to give a more\nmeaningful analysis. Id. at 1051-52. However, the District Court found that the\nJoshua Intervenors had access to the raw data and never raised the issue. Id. at 1052.\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\fMore specifically, the District Court found that the reports did not mislead the Joshua\nIntervenors. Ibid.\n\n       The ODM produced a Report on Disciplinary Sanctions in LRSD, which\nshowed that African-American students received a disproportionate number of\nsuspensions and expulsions. However, the District Court specifically found that this\nreport was not intended to address the effectiveness of any programs that were\ninstituted to address fairness in discipline. Id. at 1052-53. The District Court also\nnoted that the report suggested that factors outside of the schools might affect which\nstudents receive discipline, such as home environment, family values, and whether\nthe home is a single-parent home. Id. at 1052. The report did not contain a specific\nanalysis of the facts of each suspension or expulsion to help determine whether\ndiscrimination occurred. Id. at 1052-53. However, the report did conclude that the\nracial disparity meant that LRSD \"has certainly not eliminated nor even abated racial\ndiscrimination in suspensions . . ..\" Id. at 1053 (quoting Report on Disciplinary\nSanctions in LRSD, June 14, 2000). The District Court rejected this conclusion as\nspeculative because it was based on raw statistics. Ibid.\n\n       Dr. Linda Watson, the Assistant Superintendent for Student Hearings, was\nresponsible for monitoring compliance with the Student Handbook. She reviewed\nevery long-term suspension or expulsion and all appeals from short-term suspensions.\nTr. of Nov. 19, 2001, 36-37. If the procedures of the Student Handbook were not\nfollowed, Dr. Watson overturned the punishment and removed it from the records.\nIbid. Although Dr. Watson acknowledged that African-American students were more\nfrequently suspended than white students, she believed this was due to the fact that\nthey more frequently engaged in conduct prohibited by the Student Handbook. Id.\nat 83-84. She also testified that she believed this was due primarily to socioeconomic\nfactors. (Some of these factors may be caused by or related to racial discrimination,\nbut they are not the fault of the present administration of LRSD.) The District Court\n\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fspecifically found that the testimony of all the administrators involved in the\ndisciplinary process was credible. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1050.\n\n      For these reasons, we find no clear error in the District Court's finding of\nsubstantial compliance with § 2.5 of the Revised Plan.\n\n                                           C.\n\n      The Joshua Intervenors also appeal from the District Court's judgment granting\nLRSD unitary status under §§ 2.6 and 2.6.3, relating to extracurricular activities.\nAlthough § 2.6.3 imposes a specific obligation with regard to transportation for\nextracurricular activities, the Joshua Intervenors assert that LRSD did not meet its\nobligation under § 2.6, which provides:\n\n             LRSD shall implement programs, policies and/or\n             procedures designed to promote participation and to ensure\n             that there are no barriers to participation by qualified\n             African-Americans in extracurricular activities . . ..\n\nApp. of Appellants 90-91.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors argue that racial discrimination occurred in\nextracurricular activities, evidenced by the fact that many extracurricular activities\ndid not have a proportionate share of African-American participants. Brief for\nAppellants 46. Certain activities' participants, such as tennis, swimming, quiz bowl,\nmock trial, and cheerleading, were predominantly white. The Joshua Intervenors also\nassert that there were barriers to participation, including costs of participation and\nlack of transportation.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors argue that racial disparities in extracurricular activities\nare the result of discrimination. However, as noted by the District Court, nothing in\n\n                                          -17-\n\f§ 2.6 of the Revised Plan required LRSD to impose quotas on extracurricular\nactivities. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1058. LRSD undertook to\npromote the participation of African-American students and to eliminate barriers to\nparticipation. As we noted above with respect to § 2.5, this provision does not make\nLRSD an insurer. It requires only that the District \"implement programs, policies\nand/or procedures designed to promote participation and to ensure,\" et cetera.\n(Emphasis ours.)\n\n       The final report noted a marked increase in African-American students'\nparticipation in extracurricular activities following the enactment of the new policies.\nApp. of Appellee 276-77. The final report also demonstrated that LRSD attempted\nto eliminate barriers to participation by having buses transport students to and from\nextracurricular activities. Id. at 278. Although the record does not establish which\nstudents took advantage of the extra buses, the final report stated that \"no\nextracurricular activity transportation request made by an eligible student has been\ndenied.\" Ibid. As noted by the District Court, the Joshua Intervenors bore the burden\nof proof on this issue, and they did not provide a single witness to testify that\nAfrican-American students were unable to participate because of a lack of\ntransportation. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1059.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors also assert that the costs of certain activities create a\nbarrier to participation. Although there are costs associated with certain activities,\nDr. Marian Lacey, Assistant Superintendent of Secondary Schools, testified that each\nschool had a discretionary fund which could be used to help students pay the costs of\nextracurricular activities. Tr. of July 24, 2002, 775-76. The District Court also found\nthat the Joshua Intervenors presented no testimony that any student was denied an\nopportunity to participate because of costs. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d\nat 1059-60.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -18-\n\f       The Joshua Intervenors asserted that certain schools, which were primarily\nAfrican-American, did not have the same extracurricular activities as other schools,\nand that this violated LRSD's duty to promote participation. However, the District\nCourt found that each school determined which extracurricular activities to offer on\nthe basis of student interest, and if enough interest existed, each school offered a\nstipend to sponsors of those activities. Id. at 1060. The District Court concluded that\ncertain activities were missing at certain schools not because of discrimination but\ninstead because of lack of student interest. Ibid.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors presented several students' testimony to support their\nassertion that African-American students were not encouraged to participate or were\nprevented from participating in extracurricular activities. The District Court did not\nfind this testimony impressive. Id. at 1061. Questions of credibility and inferences\nto be drawn from facts must generally be left to the trial court.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors bore the burden of proving that LRSD was not\nimplementing programs, policies, or procedures designed to promote participation\nand ensure there were no barriers to participation by qualified African-Americans in\nextracurricular activities. We hold that the District Court did not err in determining\nthat the Joshua Intervenors failed to meet this burden.\n\n                                          D.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors also appeal from the District Court's order granting\nLRSD unitary status under §§ 2.6-2.6.2, relating to advanced-placement classes and\nhonors programs. While §§ 2.6.1 and 2.6.2 impose specific duties on LRSD to\nprovide training programs for teachers to identify and encourage qualified\nAfrican-American students to participate in advanced-placement programs and to\nassist African-American students in being successful in advanced-placement\n\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fprograms, the Intervenors do not complain that these specific provisions were\nviolated. Instead, they focus on § 2.6, which imposes a more general duty:\n\n             LRSD shall implement programs, policies and/or\n             procedures designed to promote participation and to ensure\n             there are no barriers to participation by qualified\n             African-Americans in . . . advanced placement courses,\n             honors and enriched courses and the gifted and talented\n             program.\n\nApp. of Appellants 90-91. The phraseology of this provision is similar to others\ndiscussed above.\n\n       The Joshua Intervenors assert that the District Court erred in finding no barriers\nto participation in advanced-placement courses. The low number of African-\nAmerican teachers assigned to advanced-placement courses, they say, is a barrier to\nparticipation. Brief for Appellants 43-44. The Joshua Intervenors rely primarily on\nthe testimony of Dr. Michael Faucette, an English teacher at Central High School.\nDr. Faucette testified that although there were eight African-American teachers and\neight white teachers in Central High's English Department, African-American\nteachers taught only a few of the advanced-placement sections. Tr. of July 22, 2002,\n176-80. Dr. Faucette, an African-American teacher, did not teach any of the\nadvanced-placement sections. Id. at 177.\n\n       The Little Rock School District Board created a regulation setting forth criteria\nto help teachers identify African-American students for participation in\nadvanced-placement courses. Although this was one factor used in identifying\nstudents for participation in advanced-placement courses, enrollment was still open\nto any student who showed the proper level of motivation and commitment. App. of\nAppellee 279. Teachers were then required to monitor performance and behavior to\nensure that students placed in those courses would remain there.\n\n                                          -20-\n\f       LRSD studied methods to increase enrollment in advanced-placement courses\nand determined that pre-advanced-placement courses were necessary to prepare\nstudents better and earlier. LRSD implemented pre-advanced-placement courses for\nsixth and seventh-grade students. These programs have been highly successful, and\nthe District Court found that as a result of these programs, LRSD has added over 600\nAfrican-American students to its advanced-placement courses for juniors and seniors.\nLittle Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1063.\n\n      LRSD has also implemented the SMART Program, a summer program\ndesigned to teach algebra to students to prepare them for algebra in the eighth grade.\nApp. of Appellee 112. The District Court found that during the term of the Revised\nPlan, at least 95% of the students attending the SMART Program were\nAfrican-American. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1063. Evaluations of\nthe SMART Program determined that it was a success. Tr. of July 24, 2002, 678.\n\n       LRSD also instituted a \"Teachers of Color\" program to increase the number of\nAfrican-American advanced-placement teachers. Id. at 671. The principal at each\nmiddle school and high school determined who would be assigned to teach each class.\nHowever, the principals were constrained by the collective-bargaining agreement,\nwhich required consideration of a teacher's experience and seniority. Tr. of July 22,\n2002, 90. An advanced-placement teacher also needed to be qualified through the\nstate.   Although Dr. Faucette testified about the racial composition of\nadvanced-placement teachers in Central High School's English Department, he did\nnot know about other advanced-placement sections at Central High School. Little\nRock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1065. The District Court found Dr. Faucette's\ntestimony unreliable. Ibid.\n\n      The Joshua Intervenors also point to racial disparity in the Hall High School\nUniversity Studies program, a program developed in conjunction with the University\nof Arkansas at Little Rock that provided an opportunity for students to earn college\n\n                                        -21-\n\fcredit for classes taken at Hall High School. Admission requirements were developed\nby the University of Arkansas. Tr. of July 24, 2002, 727-28. In order to receive\ncollege credit for the courses, students were required to pay tuition of approximately\n$150 per course. Tr. of July 22, 2002, 114. The Joshua Intervenors assert that the\ntuition payments created a barrier to participation for African-American students.\nBrief for Appellants 42-43.\n\n      The District Court found that during the 1999-2000 school year, 58% of the\nstudents participating in Hall High School's University Studies Program were\nAfrican-American, while African-American students comprised 71% of all students\nat Hall High School. Little Rock Sch. Dist., 237 F. Supp. 2d at 1066. During\n2000-2001, only 35% of the students in the University Studies program were\nAfrican-American, while African-American students comprised 72% of all students\nat Hall High School. Ibid. However, the Court found that the Joshua Intervenors\npresented no evidence that any student was denied admission to the University\nStudies Program because of inability to pay. Ibid. Testimony also indicates that the\nschool solicited a donation to cover the cost for at least one African-American student\nwho wished to participate but was unable to pay. Tr. of July 24, 2002, 802.\n\n    For these reasons, we hold that the District Court did not err in finding that\nLRSD substantially complied with its obligations under § 2.6 of the Revised Plan.\n\n                             *    *    *      *   *    *\n\n      The judgment is affirmed. It goes without saying, but we say it anyway, that\nLRSD remains fully subject to the Constitution and all other applicable laws, and that\nthese obligations are enforceable by appropriate legal action.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\fHEANEY, Circuit Judge, concurring.\n\n       I concur in every aspect of the majority’s opinion except insofar as it holds that\nthe LRSD has implemented “programs, policies and/or procedures designed to ensure\nthat there is no racial discrimination with regard to student discipline,” as required by\nsection 2.5 of the Revised Plan. In my view, the LRSD has failed to meet this\nobligation.\n\n       It is true that the LRSD has implemented several programs with regard to\nstudent discipline: the LRSD provided every student, parent, teacher, and\nadministrator with a copy of the Student Handbook; the LRSD trained students,\nteachers, and administrators on provisions in the Handbook; the LRSD created the\nposition of Ombudsman to investigate student complaints of race-based mistreatment\nin student discipline; Dr. Linda Watson, the Assistant Superintendent who was\nresponsible for implementing section 2.5 of the Revised Plan, reviewed every long-\nterm suspension and expulsion, and any short-term suspensions that were appealed;\nDr. Watson prepared and reviewed quarterly Discipline Management Reports from\neach school, used these reports to identify problems, and met with the schools’\nadministrators to discuss solutions; the LRSD established alternative learning\nenvironments to allow students with behavioral problems to remain in school; the\nLRSD offered training in classroom management and effective discipline; and the\nLRSD followed a progressive discipline approach by imposing lesser sanctions before\nsuspending students.\n\n      It is also true that the LRSD has reduced the total number of disciplinary\nsanctions of students during the time of the Revised Plan from 5,312 total sanctions\nin 1998, to 5,080 total sanctions in 2001.5 During that same period, however, the\n\n\n      5\n     All 1998 statistics are from the LRSD’s 1998-1999 Annual Disciplinary\nManagement Report (Ct. Ex. CX679) and the 2001 statistics are from the LRSD’s\n\n                                          -23-\n\fnumber of black students receiving disciplinary sanctions actually increased. During\nthe 1998-99 school year, there were 4,470 disciplinary sanctions of black students\ncompared to 842 disciplinary sanctions of white students. Put another way, in the\nfirst year of the Revised Plan, 65% of the student population in the LRSD was black,\nwhile 84% of the disciplinary sanctions were of black students. By 2001, the year the\nLRSD sought unitary status, the disparity was even greater. In the 2000-01 school\nyear, there were 4,534 disciplinary sanctions of black students compared to 546\ndisciplinary sanctions of white students. In other words, black students consisted of\n68% of the student population, but accounted for 89% of the disciplinary sanctions.\nTherefore, from 1998 to 2001, disciplinary sanctions of black students increased from\n84% to 89%. It is undisputed that the programs instituted by the LRSD to address\ndisciplinary issues have had no positive impact on the racial disparity of student\ndiscipline in the district.\n\n       If you compare the discipline statistics in the individual high schools for the\nsame period they track in very similar ways with almost all of the schools\nexperiencing an increase in disparity. It is worth noting, however, that Parkview\nHigh School, the most integrated high school in the district, has the lowest racial\ndisparity in student discipline in the district. In 1998-99, Parkview’s student\npopulation was 51% black and the percentage of disciplinary sanctions of black\nstudents was 49%. In 2000-01, Parkview’s black student population was still 51%,\nbut the percentage of disciplinary sanctions of black students rose to 66%. Even at\n66%, however, Parkview still had the lowest disparity in student discipline in the\ndistrict that year.\n\n       I agree that the Revised Plan does not require the LRSD to absolutely eliminate\nracial disparity from student discipline. The majority and the district court, however,\nrely heavily on the fact that section 2.5 requires the LRSD to implement programs\n\n\n2000-2001 Annual Disciplinary Management Report (Ct. Ex. CX681).\n\n                                         -24-\n\f“designed to ensure” that there is no racial discrimination in student discipline. The\nimplication is that because the LRSD implemented programs which would effect\nstudent discipline, the actual impact of those programs does not matter. I disagree.\nIt is not enough for the LRSD to list the programs it implemented to address the\ndisparity in student discipline, when the result of those programs was an increase in\nthe racial disparity in student discipline. The mere implementation of programs, no\nmatter how many or how impressive sounding, that have virtually no impact on the\nracial disparity in student discipline is not enough to meet the district’s obligations\nunder the Revised Plan.\n\n       This lack of impact on the disparity in discipline is really no surprise when you\nreview the testimony of Dr. Watson. Dr. Watson testified that: she was never\ninstructed that there needed to be a reduction in the racial impact of suspensions in\nthe district; she never prepared a monitoring report with regard to disparities in\ndiscipline; she did not prepare any reports which track whether certain teachers or\nadministrators have a pattern of disciplinary actions based on race; nor did she\nrecommend any programs to address the continued disparate impact of discipline.\n(Nov. 19, 2001, Unitary Status Hr’g Tr. at 25-163.) Dr. Watson also testified that the\npercentage of black students being suspended did not decrease, that disparate patterns\nof discipline still exist based on race, that there are no plans to reduce the disparate\nimpact of student discipline in the district, and that the LRSD is not even looking at\nstudent discipline based on race. (Id.)\n\n       The majority, and the district court, seem to take solace in the fact that racial\ndisparity in student discipline is a national problem. According to the district court,\nin 1998, the national “total suspension index” was 2.24 and the Arkansas “total\nsuspension index” was 2.16, whereas the LRSD’s “total suspension index” remained\nconstant at 1.26 from 1997-2000. Little Rock Sch. Dist. v. Pulaski County Special\nSch. Dist. No. 1, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2462997\"><a href=\"/opinion/2462997/little-rock-sch-dist-v-pulaski-cty-spec-sch/\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">988</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1054 (E.D. Ark. 2002). The majority and the\ndistrict court consider the fact that the LRSD’s index is lower than that of the nation\n\n                                         -25-\n\fand the state significant, and the fact that the LRSD’s index did not change over the\nperiod of the Revised Plan insignificant. I disagree. The Revised Plan said nothing\nabout the LRSD’s racial disparity in student discipline in comparison to the state or\nthe nation. The Revised Plan did, however, require the LRSD to implement programs\ndesigned to ensure that the racial disparity in student discipline in the district would\ndecrease. This, they failed to do.\n\n       The majority and the district court also assert that Joshua did not meet its\nburden in proving that the racial disparity in student discipline was the result of\ndiscrimination. This was not Joshua’s burden. According to section 11 of the\nRevised Plan, Joshua bears the burden of proving that the LRSD failed to comply\nwith its obligations as set forth in the plan. Joshua met this burden by showing that\nthe programs the LRSD implemented to address the racial disparity in discipline were\nineffective. As I read the Revised Plan, it was the LRSD’s obligation to determine\nwhether the continued disparity in discipline was the result of racial discrimination\nor merely socioeconomic factors as suggested by Dr. Watson. Here again, the LRSD\nfailed to meet its obligation and rested merely on the fact that it implemented\nprograms. Programs that, in the end, had no effect on the racial disparity in student\ndiscipline.\n\n       It is true that Joshua could have done more to raise concerns about the failure\nof the LRSD’s programs earlier, but this does not remove all responsibility from the\nLRSD. The statistics compiled and reports filed by the LRSD lack valuable data. I\nhave found no useful statistics on recidivism among students to determine how many\nstudents, and of what race, are receiving multiple disciplinary sanctions. The record\ndoes not contain statistics that separate offenses involving the discretionary judgment\nof staff from objective offenses. The record lacks any reports which show whether\nthere is a correlation between the race of the teacher administering the discipline and\nthe race of the student receiving it, or whether certain teachers have a higher rate of\ndiscipline than others. Dr. Watson testified that she was able to access some of this\n\n                                         -26-\n\finformation and that she knew which schools had high rates of disciplinary sanctions\nand which teachers issued more suspensions than others, but I cannot agree that her\npersonal, undocumented knowledge was sufficient to meet the court’s mandate that\nthe district implement programs, policies, and procedures designed to ensure that\nthere is no racial discrimination with respect to student discipline.\n\n       Absent the necessary records, there is no way the district court, or this court,\ncan reach an informed conclusion as to whether blacks are disciplined more\nfrequently for legitimate reasons or because they are judged by different standards\nthan white students, at least by some teachers. I would remand this case to the district\ncourt on the disciplinary issue, along with the issue of student achievement retained\nby the district court, to require the district to comply with our original mandate.\n                        ______________________________\n\n\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\f</pre>",
