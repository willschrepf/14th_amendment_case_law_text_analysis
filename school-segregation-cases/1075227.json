In 2011 Indiana adopted a law\nprohibiting state agencies from providing state or\nfederal funds to “any entity that performs abortions or\nmaintains or operates a facility where abortions are\nperformed.” IND. C ODE § 5-22-17-5.5(b). The Hyde Amend-\nment already forbids states from using federal funds to\npay for most nontherapeutic abortions; Indiana has a\n\f2                                                No. 11-2464\n\nsimilar ban on the use of state funds. The new law goes a\nstep further by prohibiting abortion providers from\nreceiving any state-administered funds, even if the\nmoney is earmarked for other services. The point is to\neliminate the indirect subsidization of abortion.\n  Immediately after the defunding law was enacted,\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and several individual\nplaintiffs filed this lawsuit seeking to block its imple-\nmentation. 1 As an enrolled Medicaid provider,\nPlanned Parenthood provides reimbursable medical\nservices to low-income patients, two of whom are\nnamed as plaintiffs. Planned Parenthood claims that the\ndefunding law violates the Medicaid Act’s “free choice\nof provider” provision, which requires state Medicaid\nplans to allow patients to choose their own medical\nprovider. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23). The United States,\nas amicus curiae, supports this claim. Planned Parent-\nhood also contends that the defunding law is preempted\nby a federal block-grant statute that authorizes the Secre-\ntary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to make\n\n\n1\n  The plaintiffs are Planned Parenthood of Indiana, one of its\ndoctors, and two Indiana residents who receive Medicaid\nservices from Planned Parenthood clinics. We refer to the\nplaintiffs collectively as “Planned Parenthood” unless the\ncontext requires otherwise. The defendants are the Commis-\nsioner of the Indiana State Department of Health and several\nother state department heads, the Indiana General Assembly,\nand the state prosecutors of Marion, Monroe, and Tippecanoe\nCounties. We refer to the defendants collectively as “Indi-\nana” unless the context requires otherwise.\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                3\n\ngrants to the states for programs related to sexually\ntransmitted diseases. See 42 U.S.C. § 247c(c). Finally,\nPlanned Parenthood claims that the defunding law\nplaces an unconstitutional condition on its receipt of state-\nadministered funds because it must choose between\nproviding abortion services and receiving public money.\n  The district court held that the first two claims were\nlikely to succeed and enjoined Indiana from enforcing\nthe defunding law with respect to Planned Parenthood’s\nMedicaid and § 247c(c) grant funding. The court did not\naddress the unconstitutional-conditions claim. Indiana\nappealed.\n  We affirm in part and reverse in part. A threshold\nquestion on the two statutory claims is whether the\nplaintiffs have a right of action. To create private rights\nactionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the statutes in question\nmust meet the requirements of Gonzaga University v.\nDoe, 536 U.S. 273 (2002). The free-choice-of-provider\nstatute does. Under § 1396a(a)(23) state Medicaid plans\n“must” allow beneficiaries to obtain medical care from\n“any institution, agency, . . . or person, qualified to\nperform the service.” This is individual-rights language,\nstated in mandatory terms, and interpreting the right\ndoes not strain judicial competence. See Gonzaga Univ.,\n536 U.S. at 284.\n  Planned Parenthood is likely to succeed on this\nclaim. Although Indiana has broad authority to exclude\nunqualified providers from its Medicaid program, the\nState does not have plenary authority to exclude a class\nof providers for any reason—more particularly, for a\n\f4                                              No. 11-2464\n\nreason unrelated to provider qualifications. In this\ncontext, “qualified” means fit to provide the necessary\nmedical services—that is, capable of performing the\nneeded medical services in a professionally competent,\nsafe, legal, and ethical manner. The defunding law ex-\ncludes Planned Parenthood from Medicaid for a reason\nunrelated to its fitness to provide medical services, vio-\nlating its patients’ statutory right to obtain medical care\nfrom the qualified provider of their choice.\n  The remaining claims are not likely to succeed, how-\never, so the scope of the injunction must be modified.\nFirst, the block-grant statute does not create private\nrights actionable under § 1983, and the district court’s\nconclusion that the Supremacy Clause supplies a pre-\nemption claim of its own force is probably wrong. In\nany event, the defunding law does not conflict with\n§ 247c(c), which attaches no strings to the federal money\nother than a general requirement that the recipient\nstate spend it on programs for the surveillance of sexually\ntransmitted diseases. Finally, the unconstitutional-condi-\ntions claim does not supply an alternative basis for\nrelief. This doctrine, sometimes murky, requires close\nattention to the potentially implicated right. Here,\nPlanned Parenthood’s claim is entirely derivative of a\nwoman’s right to obtain an abortion. It is settled law\nthat the government’s refusal to subsidize abortion does\nnot impermissibly burden a woman’s right to obtain an\nabortion. If a ban on public funding for abortion does\nnot directly violate the abortion right, then Indiana’s ban\non other forms of public subsidy for abortion providers\ncannot be an unconstitutional condition that indirectly\nviolates the right.\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                     5\n\n                        I. Background\n  Medicaid “is a cooperative federal-state program\nthrough which the Federal Government provides financial\nassistance to States so that they may furnish medical care\nto needy individuals.” Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass’n, 496\nU.S. 498, 502 (1990). Indiana participates in Medicaid, and\nas a condition of receiving federal funds, its Medicaid\nprogram must comply with federal requirements. See\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a); see also Collins v. Hamilton, 349 F.3d\n371, 374 (7th Cir. 2003) (“[O]nce a state elects to\nparticipate [in Medicaid], it must abide by all federal\nrequirements and standards as set forth in the Act.”).\nAssuming the federal requirements are met, states\nhave “substantial discretion to choose the proper mix\nof amount, scope, and duration limitations on coverage,\nas long as care and services are provided in ‘the best\ninterests of the recipients.’ ” Alexander v. Choate, 469\nU.S. 287, 303 (1985) (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(19)).\n  To ensure compliance with federal rules, participating\nstates must submit proposed Medicaid plans and any\nsubsequent amendments to the Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services (“CMS”) for approval. 2 Douglas v.\nIndep. Living Ctr. of S. Cal., Inc., 132 S. Ct. 1204, 1208 (2012).\nThe HHS Secretary may withhold Medicaid fund-\ning—either in whole or in part—from any state whose\nplan does not comply with federal requirements. See 42\nU.S.C. § 1396c; 42 C.F.R. § 430.12(c); cf. Nat’l Fed’n of\nIndep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. 2566, 2607-08 (2012).\n\n\n\n2\n    CMS is a division of HHS.\n\f6                                               No. 11-2464\n\n  At issue here is the Medicaid Act’s requirement that\nstate Medicaid plans “must . . . provide that . . . any\nindividual eligible for medical assistance . . . may obtain\nsuch assistance from any institution, agency, community\npharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service\nor services required.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23); see also\n42 C.F.R. § 431.51(b)(1) (requiring that a state plan\nprovide that “a recipient may obtain Medicaid services\nfrom any institution . . . that is [q]ualified to furnish\nthe services[] . . . and [w]illing to furnish them to that\nparticular recipient”). This is known as the free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement.\n\n\nA. Indiana House Enrolled Act 1210, the Abortion-\n   Provider Defunding Law\n  In the spring of 2011, the Indiana General Assembly\nadopted a law prohibiting abortion providers from re-\nceiving any state contracts and grants, including those\ninvolving state-administered federal funds. More specifi-\ncally, the defunding law provides that state agencies\n“may not[] enter into a contract with[] or make a grant\nto[] any entity that performs abortions or maintains or\noperates a facility where abortions are performed.” IND.\nC ODE § 5-22-17-5.5(b). The new law, known as House\nEnrolled Act 1210, also cancelled existing contracts with\nabortion providers. See id. § 5-22-17-5.5(c), (d). The\ndefunding law does not apply to hospitals and am-\nbulatory surgical centers. See id. § 5-22-17-5.5(a).\n  Act 1210 fills a gap in Indiana law regarding public\nfunding of abortion. The Hyde Amendment prohibits the\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                   7\n\nuse of federal funds to pay for nontherapeutic abortions\nexcept in the case of pregnancies resulting from rape\nor incest.3 Indiana law contains similar restrictions on\nthe use of state funds. See id. §§ 12-15-5-1(17), 16-34-1-2; 405\nIND. A DMIN. C ODE 5-28-7; Humphreys v. Clinic for Women,\nInc., 796 N.E.2d 247, 250-51 (Ind. 2003). Act 1210 aims\nto prevent the indirect subsidization of abortion by stop-\nping the flow of all state-administered funds to abor-\ntion providers.\n  Governor Mitch Daniels signed Act 1210 into law on\nMay 10, 2011. On May 13 Indiana notified CMS of the\nchange in its law and sought approval for an amend-\nment to its Medicaid plan to exclude any provider (not\nincluding hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers) that\noffers abortion services. After consulting with the HHS\nSecretary, see 42 C.F.R. § 430.15(c), the CMS Admini-\nstrator rejected the proposed plan amendment citing\n§ 1396a(a)(23), the free-choice-of-provider rule. In a\nletter to Indiana’s Director of Medicaid Policy &\nPlanning, the Administrator noted that “federal\nMedicaid funding of abortion services is not permitted\nunder federal law except in extraordinary circum-\nstances (such as in cases of rape or incest).” “At the\nsame time,” the Administrator continued, “Medicaid\nprograms may not exclude qualified health care\n\n\n\n3\n  The Hyde Amendment is actually a rider Congress attaches\nto appropriations legislation each year. See Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-74, §§ 506-507,\n125 Stat. 786, 1111-12 (2011).\n\f8                                               No. 11-2464\n\nproviders from providing services that are funded under\nthe program because of a provider’s scope of practice.”\nBecause Indiana’s proposed amendment excluded\nabortion providers from participation in Medicaid for a\nreason unrelated to provider qualifications, the Admin-\nistrator refused to approve it.\n  Indiana petitioned for reconsideration of the Admin-\nistrator’s decision. See 42 U.S.C. § 1316(a)(2); 42 C.F.R.\n§ 430.18. This initiated an administrative appeal process\nthat included a hearing, see 42 C.F.R. §§ 430.76(a), 430.83,\nand the right to seek judicial review of the final decision,\nsee 42 U.S.C. § 1316(a)(3); 42 C.F.R. § 430.38. The\nhearing was held on December 15, 2011, and on June 20,\n2012, the hearing officer sent the Administrator his rec-\nommended findings and a proposed decision upholding\nthe initial determination. See 42 C.F.R. § 430.102. Under\n42 C.F.R. § 430.102(b)(2), the parties have an opportunity\nto file objections before final action on the recommenda-\ntion is taken. To our knowledge, a final agency decision\nhas not yet been issued.\n\n\nB. Planned Parenthood’s Legal Challenge to Act 1210\n  Planned Parenthood is a nonprofit healthcare provider\noffering reproductive healthcare and family-planning\nservices in Indiana, including preventive primary-care\nservices such as medical examinations, cancer screenings,\ntesting for sexually transmitted diseases, and various birth-\ncontrol services. The organization operates 28 health\nclinics in Indiana and has more than 75,000 patients.\nPlanned Parenthood is an enrolled provider in Indiana’s\n\fNo. 11-2464                                              9\n\nMedicaid program. In 2010 the organization offered\nMedicaid services to more than 9,300 patients and\nreceived $1,360,437 in Medicaid reimbursement. Planned\nParenthood also receives grants from Indiana state agen-\ncies, including some funded with federal money. Among\nthose in effect when Act 1210 was adopted were two\ngrants totaling $150,000 from Indiana’s federal Disease\nIntervention Services block-grant money received under\n§ 247c(c), which authorizes grants for programs that\ndiagnose and monitor sexually transmitted diseases.\n  Planned Parenthood also performs abortions. The\norganization uses private funding to support its\nabortion services and takes steps to ensure that public and\nprivate funds are not commingled. As an abortion pro-\nvider, Planned Parenthood is barred by Act 1210 from\nreceiving any state-administered funds, including\nMedicaid reimbursement and funding from state and\nfederal grants for services unrelated to abortion. The\norganization estimates that full implementation of the\ndefunding law would require it to close a quarter of its\nhealth clinics, lay off approximately 37 employees, and\ncease serving an unknown number of patients.\n  Because of the effect of the defunding law on its state-\nwide operations, Planned Parenthood did not wait for\nthe outcome of the CMS administrative process. On\nMay 10, 2011—the same day that Governor Daniels\nsigned Act 1210 into law—Planned Parenthood went to\ncourt in the Southern District of Indiana seeking to block\nthe new law. Its lawsuit challenges Act 1210 on several\ngrounds. First, Planned Parenthood alleges that the law\n\f10                                                    No. 11-2464\n\nviolates § 1396a(a)(23), the Medicaid free-choice-of-pro-\nvider requirement. The complaint also asserts a preemp-\ntion claim based on several federal block-grant programs.\nFinally, Planned Parenthood alleges that the defunding\nlaw imposes an unconstitutional condition on its\nreceipt of public funds by forcing it to choose between\nperforming abortions and receiving nonabortion-related\npublic funding. The complaint seeks declaratory and\ninjunctive relief under § 1983. Planned Parenthood im-\nmediately moved for a temporary restraining order\n(“TRO”) and a preliminary injunction.4\n  The district court denied the motion for a TRO, but\nafter full briefing granted Planned Parenthood’s motion\nfor a preliminary injunction. Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc.\nv. Comm’r of the Ind. State Dep’t of Health, 794 F. Supp. 2d\n892 (S.D. Ind. 2011). As relevant here, the court held that\n§ 1396a(a)(23) creates individual rights enforceable\nunder § 1983 and that Planned Parenthood was likely\nto succeed on its claim that the defunding law violates\n§ 1396a(a)(23). On the preemption claim, the court\nfocused solely on the Disease Intervention Services block-\ngrant program under § 247c(c). The court held that al-\nthough § 247c(c) does not confer an individual right,\n\n\n4\n  Planned Parenthood also challenges two provisions in Act\n1210 that amended Indiana’s informed-consent statute to\nrequire abortion practitioners to inform patients that “human\nphysical life begins when a human ovum is fertilized by a\nhuman sperm” and that “objective scientific information\nshows that a fetus can feel pain at or before twenty (20) weeks\nof postfertilization age.” I ND . C ODE § 16-34-2-1.1(a)(1)(E), (G).\nThese aspects of the case are not at issue in this appeal.\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                  11\n\nPlanned Parenthood could bring its preemption claim\ndirectly under the Supremacy Clause. Having found a\nright of action, the court concluded that Planned Parent-\nhood was likely to succeed on its claim that § 247c(c)\npreempts Act 1210. The court then assessed the balance\nof harms and the public interest, ultimately concluding\nthat preliminary injunctive relief was warranted. The\ncourt enjoined “[a]ll attempts to stop current or future\nfunding contracted for or due” Planned Parenthood\nand ordered Indiana to “take all steps to insure that\nall monies are paid.” Id. at 921. Having awarded all the\npreliminary relief Planned Parenthood had requested,\nthe court did not address the unconstitutional-condi-\ntions claim.\n\n\n                       II. Discussion\n  This case comes to us on Indiana’s appeal from the\ndistrict court’s order granting a preliminary injunction.\nSee 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). To obtain a preliminary injunc-\ntion, the moving party must demonstrate a reasonable\nlikelihood of success on the merits, no adequate remedy\nat law, and irreparable harm absent the injunction. See\nAm. Civil Liberties Union of Ill. v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 589-\n90 (7th Cir. 2012); Christian Legal Soc’y v. Walker, 453\nF.3d 853, 859 (7th Cir. 2006); Joelner v. Village of Washing-\nton Park, Ill., 378 F.3d 613, 619 (7th Cir. 2004). If it makes\nthis threshold showing, the district court weighs the\nbalance of harm to the parties if the injunction is granted\nor denied and also evaluates the effect of an injunction\non the public interest. See Alvarez, 679 F.3d at 589-90;\nChristian Legal Soc’y, 453 F.3d at 859. The strength of\n\f12                                               No. 11-2464\n\nthe moving party’s likelihood of success on the merits\naffects the balance of harms. “The more likely it is that [the\nmoving party] will win its case on the merits, the less\nthe balance of harms need weigh in its favor.” Girl Scouts\nof Manitou Council, Inc. v. Girl Scouts of U.S., Inc., 549\nF.3d 1079, 1100 (7th Cir. 2008). We review the district\ncourt’s factual findings for clear error, its legal conclu-\nsions de novo, and its balancing of the injunction\nfactors for an abuse of discretion. Christian Legal Soc’y,\n453 F.3d at 859; Joelner, 378 F.3d at 620.\n  Here, the relevant facts are not in dispute. Planned\nParenthood’s motion raised legal questions about the\nexistence of private statutory rights enforceable under\n§ 1983 and whether Act 1210 conflicts with federal law\nor violates the unconstitutional-conditions doctrine.\nThe motion also called for a discretionary judgment\nabout the balance of harms and the effect of an injunc-\ntion on the public interest.\n\n\nA. The Medicaid Act Claim\n  1.   Is There a Private Right of Action Enforceable Under\n       § 1983?\n  Section 1983 creates a federal remedy against anyone\nwho, under color of state law, deprives “any citizen of\nthe United States . . . of any rights, privileges, or immuni-\nties secured by the Constitution and laws.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1983. In Maine v. Thiboutot, 448 U.S. 1 (1980), the\nSupreme Court held that § 1983 “means what it says,” id.\nat 4, and “authorizes suits to enforce individual rights\nunder federal statutes as well as the Constitution,” City\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                   13\n\nof Rancho Palos Verdes, Cal. v. Abrams, 544 U.S. 113,\n119 (2005). But “it is rights, not the broader or vaguer\n‘benefits’ or ‘interests,’ that may be enforced under\nthe authority of that section.” Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S.\nat 283.\n  Three factors help determine whether a federal\nstatute creates private rights enforceable under § 1983:\n(1) “Congress must have intended that the provision\nin question benefit the plaintiff”; (2) the asserted right\nmust not be “so vague and amorphous that its\nenforcement would strain judicial competence”; and\n(3) “the provision giving rise to the asserted right must\nbe couched in mandatory, rather than precatory, terms.”\nBlessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 340-41(1997) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). These factors are meant to\nset the bar high; nothing “short of an unambiguously\nconferred right [will] support a cause of action\nbrought under § 1983.” Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 283.\n“[W]here the text and structure of a statute provide\nno indication that Congress intends to create new individ-\nual rights, there is no basis for a private suit, whether\nunder § 1983 or under an implied right of action.” Id.\nat 286.\n  In the context of legislation adopted under the\nspending power,5 this rigorous approach reflects\nconcerns about federalism and reinforces the principle\nthat Congress must clearly express its “intent to\n\n\n5\n  See U.S. C ONST . art. I, § 8, cl. 1 (“The Congress shall have\nPower To lay and collect Taxes . . . to pay the Debts and provide\nfor the . . . general Welfare of the United States . . . .”).\n\f14                                               No. 11-2464\n\nimpose conditions on the grant of federal funds so that\nthe States can knowingly decide whether or not to accept\nthose funds.” Pennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman,\n451 U.S. 1, 24 (1981); see also Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd.\nof Educ. v. Murphy, 548 U.S. 291, 296 (2006) (requiring\nthat spending statutes provide “clear notice” of state\nobligations). Pennhurst analogized cooperative Spending\nClause legislation to a contract between the federal gov-\nernment and willing states: “[L]egislation enacted\npursuant to the spending power is much in the nature of\na contract: in return for federal funds, the States agree\nto comply with federally imposed conditions.” 451 U.S.\nat 17. As such, the legitimacy of spending-power legisla-\ntion “rests on whether the State voluntarily and\nknowingly accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’ ” Id. There\ncannot be knowing acceptance “if a State is unaware of\nthe conditions or is unable to ascertain what is expected\nof it.” Id.; see also Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., 548 U.S. at\n296. The Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed this\nunderstanding, most recently in National Federation\nof Independent Business v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. at 2601-02.\n   Accordingly, “where a statute by its terms grants no\nprivate rights to any identifiable class,” Gonzaga Univ.,\n536 U.S. at 284 (internal quotation marks omitted), it\ncannot be construed to confer an individual right en-\nforceable under § 1983, id. at 284-85. Instead, to\ncreate judicially enforceable private rights, the statute\n“ ‘must be phrased in terms of the persons benefited,’ ”\nwith “ ‘an unmistakable focus on the benefited class.’ ” Id.\n(quoting Cannon v. Univ. of Chi., 441 U.S. 677, 691, 692 n.13\n(1979)). It must “confer[] entitlements ‘sufficiently specific\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                15\n\nand definite to qualify as enforceable rights.’ ” Id. at 280\n(quoting Wright v. Roanoke Redev. & Hous. Auth., 479 U.S.\n418, 432 (1987)). In other words, the statute must contain\n“rights-creating language” that unambiguously creates\nan “ ‘individual entitlement.’ ” Id. at 287 (quoting Blessing,\n520 U.S. at 343).\n  “Once a plaintiff demonstrates that a statute confers\nan individual right, the right is presumptively enforceable\nby § 1983.” Id. at 284. The defendant may defeat this\npresumption by demonstrating “that Congress shut\nthe door to private enforcement either expressly, through\nspecific evidence from the statute itself, or impliedly,\nby creating a comprehensive enforcement scheme that\nis incompatible with individual enforcement under\n§ 1983.” Id. at 284 n.4 (internal quotation marks and\ncitations omitted); see also Wilder, 496 U.S. at 520-21;\nMiddlesex Cnty. Sewerage Auth. v. Nat’l Sea Clammers\nAss’n, 453 U.S. 1, 20 (1981) (holding that there is no en-\nforceable private right where the statute itself creates\na remedial scheme that is “sufficiently comprehensive . . .\nto demonstrate congressional intent to preclude the\nremedy of suits under § 1983”).\n  Applying these principles here, we agree with the\ndistrict court that the free-choice-of-provider statute\nunambiguously gives Medicaid-eligible patients an indi-\nvidual right. Section 1396a(a)(23) mandates that all\nstate Medicaid plans provide that “any individual\neligible for medical assistance . . . may obtain such assis-\ntance from any institution, agency, community\npharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service\nor services required.” Medicaid patients are the obvious\n\f16                                              No. 11-2464\n\nintended beneficiaries of the statute; it states that any\nMedicaid-eligible person may obtain medical assistance\nfrom any institution, agency, or person qualified to\nperform that service. In other words, Medicaid patients\nhave the right to receive care from the qualified\nprovider of their choice. This language does not simply\nset an aggregate plan requirement, but instead\nestablishes a personal right to which all Medicaid\npatients are entitled. Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 288 (con-\ntrasting a statute with an “aggregate” focus with one\nthat is focused on the needs of an identified class of\npersons). Section 1396a(a)(23) uses “individually focused\nterminology,” id. at 287, unmistakably “ ‘phrased in terms\nof the persons benefitted,’ ” id. at 284 (quoting Cannon,\n441 U.S. at 692 n.13).\n  Second, the right is administrable and falls comfortably\nwithin the judiciary’s core interpretive competence.\nPlanned Parenthood argues that a state infringes the free-\nchoice-of-provider right when it excludes a provider\nfrom its Medicaid program for a reason other than the\nprovider’s fitness to render the medical services re-\nquired. Whether this is the proper interpretation of\n§ 1396a(a)(23) is a legal question fully capable of judicial\nresolution.\n  Finally, § 1396a(a)(23) is plainly couched in mandatory\nterms. It says that all states “must provide” in their\nMedicaid plans that beneficiaries may obtain medical\ncare from any provider qualified to perform the service.\nIn sum, the free-choice-of-provider statute explicitly\nrefers to a specific class of people—Medicaid-eligible\n\fNo. 11-2464                                            17\n\npatients—and confers on them an individual entitle-\nment—the right to receive reimbursable medical services\nfrom any qualified provider. We agree with the district\ncourt that § 1396a(a)(23) unambiguously creates private\nrights “presumptively enforceable by § 1983.” Gonzaga\nUniv., 536 U.S. at 284.\n  Nothing in the Medicaid Act suggests, explicitly or\nimplicitly, that “Congress specifically foreclosed a\nremedy under § 1983.” Id. at 284 n.4 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Indiana points to the Medicaid Act’s\ngeneral administrative scheme—more specifically, to the\nHHS Secretary’s authority to review state plans for com-\npliance and withhold or curtail Medicaid funds as a\nmeans of bringing noncompliant states into line. See 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1316(a), 1396c; 42 C.F.R. § 430.12(c). The State\nsuggests that this feature of the administrative scheme\nimplies that Congress foreclosed private enforcement of\n§ 1396a(a)(23). But the Secretary’s power to shut off all\nor part of a state’s funding is not a “comprehensive\nenforcement scheme,” see Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 284\nn.4, nor does the administrative-approval process for\nplan amendments provide an avenue for beneficiaries\nto vindicate their free-choice-of-provider rights, cf.\nMiddlesex Cnty. Sewerage Auth., 453 U.S. at 20 (ex-\nplaining that where a federal statute provides “its own\ncomprehensive enforcement scheme, the requirements\nof that enforcement procedure may not be bypassed\nby bringing suit directly under § 1983”).\n  It would be a different matter if Congress had provided\nan administrative remedy for individual patients. “The\n\f18                                              No. 11-2464\n\nprovision of an express, private means of redress in\nthe statute itself is ordinarily an indication that Congress\ndid not intend to leave open a more expansive remedy\nunder § 1983.” Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S. at 121. But\nCongress did not provide a means of private redress\nhere. And private enforcement of § 1396a(a)(23) in suits\nunder § 1983 in no way interferes with the Secretary’s\nprerogative to enforce compliance using her administra-\ntive authority. Indeed, addressing a different subsection\nof § 1396a(a), the Supreme Court has held that the\nMedicaid Act’s “administrative scheme cannot be con-\nsidered sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate a\ncongressional intent to withdraw the private remedy\nof § 1983.” Wilder, 496 U.S. at 522. Wilder held that the\nBoren Amendment, which established a standard for\nMedicaid reimbursement of hospitals, nursing homes,\nand intermediate-care facilities, is enforceable under\n§ 1983. Id. (holding that 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(13)(A) is\nenforceable in a suit under § 1983).\n  Our conclusion finds support in decisions from other\ncircuits. In Harris v. Olszewski, 442 F.3d 456, 459 (6th Cir.\n2006), the Sixth Circuit squarely addressed this\nissue and held that § 1396a(a)(23) uses the kind of rights-\ncreating, mandatory language required to create\nindividual rights enforceable under § 1983. The court\nwent on to note that although\n     there may be legitimate debates about the medical\n     care covered by or exempted from the freedom-of-\n     choice provision, the mandate itself does not\n     contain the kind of vagueness that would push the\n     limits of judicial enforcement. Whether a state\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                   19\n\n    plan provides an individual with the choice specified\n    in the provision is likely to be readily apparent . . . .\nId. at 462. Finally, the court observed that the Medicaid\nAct does not “explicitly or implicitly foreclose the private\nenforcement of this statute through § 1983 actions.”\nId. More particularly, the Act “does not provide other\nmethods for private enforcement.” Id. In short, applying\nthe Gonzaga University test, the Sixth Circuit concluded\nthat § 1396a(a)(23) “creates enforceable rights that a\nMedicaid beneficiary may vindicate through § 1983.“ 6\nId. at 461.\n  Other circuits have reached the same conclusion in\ncases involving individual suits for violation of\n§ 1396a(a)(8), which requires that state Medicaid plans\n“provide that all individuals wishing to make applica-\ntion for medical assistance under the plan shall have\nopportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall\nbe furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible\nindividuals.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8); see Doe v. Kidd, 501\nF.3d 348, 355-57 (4th Cir. 2007); Sabree ex rel. Sabree v.\nRichman, 367 F.3d 180, 189-93 (3d Cir. 2004); Bryson v.\nShumway, 308 F.3d 79, 88-89 (1st Cir. 2002); Doe ex rel.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  The Eleventh Circuit agrees, albeit in a case decided prior to\nGonzaga University. See Silver v. Baggiano, 804 F.2d 1211, 1218\n(11th Cir. 1986), abrogated on other grounds by Lapides v. Bd. of\nRegents of Univ. Sys. of Ga., 523 U.S. 613 (2002) (holding that\n“Medicaid recipients do have enforceable rights under\n§ 1396a(a)(23)”).\n\f20                                                  No. 11-2464\n\nDoe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709, 715-19 (11th Cir. 1998).7 And we\nhave recently followed the lead of our sister circuits in\nfinding an enforceable individual right in yet another\nprovision of § 1396a(a)—subsection (10), which requires\nthat state Medicaid plans “must . . . provide . . . for making\nmedical assistance available . . . to all [eligible] individu-\nals.” See Bontrager v. Ind. Family & Soc. Servs. Admin.,\nNo. 11-3710, 2012 WL 4372524, *6 (7th Cir. Sept. 26, 2012)\n(citing Watson v. Weeks, 436 F.3d 1152, 1159-61 (9th Cir.\n2006); Sabree, 367 F.3d at 189-92; South Dakota ex rel.\nDickson v. Hood, 391 F.3d 581 604-06 (5th Cir. 2004)). The\nfree-choice-of-provider provision uses language far\nmore concrete and individually focused than either\nsubsection (8) or (10) of § 1396a(a). Indiana’s position\nis hard to reconcile with Wilder and a fair amount of\nprecedent from this and other circuits.8\n  Against this authority, Indiana insists that legislation\nadopted under Congress’s spending power cannot create\nindividual rights enforceable under § 1983 because its\nlegal force stems from a state’s acceptance of federal\n\n\n\n7\n   We have assumed without deciding that § 1396a(a)(8) creates\nan enforceable individual right. See Bertrand ex rel. Bertrand\nv. Maram, 495 F.3d 452, 457 (7th Cir. 2007) (“This circuit has\nitself assumed after Gonzaga University that § 1396a(a)(8) may\nbe enforced via § 1983.”).\n8\n  One district-court decision supports Indiana’s argument.\nSee M.A.C. v. Betit, 284 F. Supp. 2d 1298, 1307 (D. Utah 2003). As\nthe Sixth Circuit has observed, however, that opinion offers\nvirtually no analysis of the issue. See Harris v. Olszewski, 442\nF.3d 456, 463 (6th Cir. 2006).\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                    21\n\nfunding rather than from the law itself. This categorical\nargument cannot be correct; if it were, then the elaborate\ndoctrine worked out in Gonzaga University and its prede-\ncessors was completely unnecessary. Not too long ago\nwe made this very point, observing that the Supreme\nCourt’s recent statutory-right-of-action cases “do not\nstand for a broad rule that spending power statutes\ncan never be enforced by private actions” under § 1983.\nInd. Prot. & Advocacy Servs. v. Ind. Family & Soc. Servs.\nAdmin., 603 F.3d 365, 378 (7th Cir. 2010) (en banc).\n   Taking a slightly different tack, Indiana argues that\nthe free-choice-of-provider statute does not create\nprivately enforceable rights because the conditions\nlisted in § 1396a(a) are simply criteria for federal reim-\nbursement, not requirements that must be met by partic-\nipating states. In other words, noncompliance with the\nconditions listed in § 1396a(a) puts the State at risk of\nlosing its federal Medicaid funding but does not\nconstitute a violation of federal law.9 To be sure, non-\n\n\n9\n  In a related argument, Indiana maintains that federal statutes\nspecifying the requirements of state Medicaid plans cannot\nimpose legal obligations on state officials. Congress specifically\nforeclosed this argument when it enacted 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-2,\nwhich states that a provision of the Medicaid Act “is not to\nbe deemed unenforceable because of its inclusion in a section\nof this chapter requiring a State plan or specifying the\nrequired contents of a State plan.” See Harris v. James, 127\nF.3d 993, 1003 (11th Cir. 1997) (explaining that § 1320a-2\nestablishes that “the mere fact that an obligation is couched in\n                                                   (continued...)\n\f22                                              No. 11-2464\n\ncompliance with the requirements of § 1396a(a) may\nserve as a basis for the Secretary’s disapproval of a\nstate’s Medicaid plan and withholding of Medicaid\nfunds, but that does not mean that § 1396a(a) functions\nonly as a condition precedent to the federal government’s\nobligation to keep its end of the Medicaid bargain.\nFederal statutes enacted pursuant to the spending power\ndo not create federal rights or obligations of their\nown force, but “once a state elects to participate [in\nMedicaid], it must abide by all federal requirements and\nstandards as set forth in the Act.” Collins, 349 F.3d at\n374 (citing Wilder, 496 U.S. at 502); see also Alexander,\n469 U.S. at 289 n.1. As we have explained, the contract\nmodel for interpreting Spending Clause legislation\nhas important implications for the relationship between\nthe federal government and the states, see Nat’l Fed’n\nof Indep. Bus., 132 S. Ct. at 2601-03; Pennhurst, 451 U.S. at\n17, but it does not follow that Spending Clause legisla-\ntion can never create judicially enforceable individual\nrights.\n  Finally, Indiana argues that allowing private enforce-\nment of the free-choice-of-provider requirement would\nconflict with O’Bannon v. Town Court Nursing Center, 447\nU.S. 773 (1980), and Kelly Kare, Ltd. v. O’Rourke, 930\n\n\n\n9\n  (...continued)\na requirement that the State file a plan is not itself\nsufficient grounds for finding the obligation unenforceable\nunder § 1983 ”).\n\fNo. 11-2464                                              23\n\nF.2d 170 (2d Cir. 1991). We disagree. In O’Bannon the\nSupreme Court held that a state need not provide a pre-\ntermination hearing to Medicaid beneficiaries when\nstate officials terminate a medical provider (in that case,\na nursing home) as unfit to participate in Medicaid.\n447 U.S. at 785. The Court explained its holding as follows:\n      [T]he Medicaid provisions relied upon by the Court\n      of Appeals do not confer a right to continued\n      residence in a home of one’s choice. Title 42 U.S.C.\n      § 1396a(a)(23) . . . gives [Medicaid] recipients the\n      right to choose among a range of qualified providers,\n      without government interference. By implication, it\n      also confers an absolute right to be free from gov-\n      ernment interference with the choice to remain in\n      a home that continues to be qualified. But it clearly\n      does not confer a right on a recipient to enter an\n      unqualified home and demand a hearing to certify\n      it, nor does it confer a right on a recipient to\n      continue to receive benefits for care in a home that\n      has been decertified.\nId.\n  Similarly, in Kelly Kare the free-choice-of-provider\nstatute was raised in the context of a due-process claim.\nA home-healthcare provider and its patients alleged\nthat they were deprived of due process when the State\ncancelled the provider’s contract based on allegations\nof unfitness without providing a pre-termination hear-\ning. Relying on O’Bannon, the Second Circuit rejected the\nclaim:\n\f24                                              No. 11-2464\n\n     We read O’Bannon as holding that a Medicaid recipi-\n     ent’s freedom of choice rights are necessarily depend-\n     ent on a provider’s ability to render services. No\n     cognizable property interest can arise in the\n     Medicaid recipient unless the provider is both quali-\n     fied and participating in the Medicaid program.\nKelly Kare, 930 F.2d at 178.\n  Neither O’Bannon nor Kelly Kare supports Indiana’s\nargument. This is not a due-process case. Planned Parent-\nhood and its patients are not suing for violation of their\nprocedural rights; they are making a substantive claim\nthat Indiana’s defunding law violates § 1396a(a)(23). As\nthe Supreme Court explained in O’Bannon, § 1396a(a)(23)\n“gives [Medicaid] recipients the right to choose among\na range of qualified providers.” 447 U.S. at 785. This lan-\nguage reinforces rather than undermines our conclu-\nsion that § 1396a(a)(23) confers individual rights enforce-\nable under § 1983.\n\n\n  2. Does the Defunding Law Violate § 1396a(a)(1)?\n  Indiana argues that even if § 1396a(a)(23) confers\nan individual right, the states may establish provider\nqualifications that effectively limit that right. It is true\nthat Medicaid regulations permit the states to establish\n“reasonable standards relating to the qualifications\nof providers.” 42 C.F.R. § 431.51(c)(2). But Indiana\nclaims plenary authority to exclude Medicaid providers\nfor any reason, as long as it furthers a legitimate state\ninterest—here, the State’s interest in avoiding indirect\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                   25\n\nsubsidization of abortion. This sweeping claim conflicts\nwith the unambiguous language of § 1396a(a)(23) and\nfinds no support in related Medicaid statutes and regula-\ntions.\n  To repeat, § 1396a(a)(23) requires that state Medicaid\nplans must provide that “any individual eligible for\nmedical assistance . . . may obtain such assistance from\nany institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person,\nqualified to perform the service or services required.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396a(a)(23) (emphases added). The Act does not\ndefine what it means for a provider to be “qualified,” and\nthe term is not self-defining. See B LACK’S L AW D ICTIONARY\n1360 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “qualified” as “[p]ossessing\nthe necessary qualifications; capable or competent”).\nMedicaid regulations provide that the states may\nestablish “reasonable standards relating to the qualifica-\ntions of providers.” 42 C.F.R. § 431.51(c)(2). This authority,\nhowever, does not suggest that states are free to ascribe\nany meaning to the statutory term “qualified”—including\na meaning “ ‘entirely strange to those familiar with its\nordinary usage.’ ” United States v. Little Lake Misere Land Co.,\n412 U.S. 580, 596 (1973) (quoting De Sylva v. Ballentine,\n351 U.S. 570, 581 (1956)). As the limiting term “reasonable”\nin the regulation suggests, a state’s authority to\ndetermine provider qualifications must be keyed to\nthe “permissible variations in the ordinary concept”\nof what it means to be “qualified” in this particular\ncontext. De Sylva, 351 U.S. at 581.\n  Read in context, the term “qualified” as used in\n§ 1396a(a)(23) unambiguously relates to a provider’s\n\f26                                              No. 11-2464\n\nfitness to perform the medical services the patient re-\nquires. The statute provides that Medicaid beneficiaries\n“may obtain [medical] assistance from any institution,\nagency . . . or person[] qualified to perform the service or\nservices required.” To be “qualified” in the relevant sense\nis to be capable of performing the needed medical services\nin a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical\nmanner. Planned Parenthood’s clinics are “qualified” in\nthe sense meant by § 1396a(a)(23).\n  Indiana argues that the term is more elastic and\nincludes the authority to establish provider-eligibility\ncriteria based on any legitimate state interest. That inter-\npretation of § 1396a(a)(23) would lead to strange results.\nIf the states are free to set any qualifications they\nwant—no matter how unrelated to the provider’s fitness\nto treat Medicaid patients—then the free-choice-of-pro-\nvider requirement could be easily undermined by\nsimply labeling any exclusionary rule as a “qualification.”\nThis would open a significant loophole for restricting\npatient choice, contradicting the broad access to medical\ncare that § 1396a(a)(23) is meant to preserve.\n   Indiana attempts to articulate a limiting principle, but\nits effort is unpersuasive. It suggests that “a [s]tate may\nnot use a qualification to target patient choice as\nsuch—for example by eliminating all choice in the\nmarket—but it may reduce patient choice incident to a\nqualification targeting some legitimate government\nobjective, such as the desire not to subsidize abortion\neven indirectly.” This argument inverts what the statute\nsays. Section 1396a(a)(23) does not simply bar the states\n\fNo. 11-2464                                           27\n\nfrom ending all choice of providers, it guarantees to\nevery Medicaid beneficiary the right to choose any quali-\nfied provider.\n  Looking for support elsewhere in the Medicaid\nAct, Indiana focuses on § 1396a(p)(1), which elaborates\non the states’ authority to exclude Medicaid providers:\n   In addition to any other authority, a State may\n   exclude any individual or entity for purposes of\n   participating under the State plan under this\n   subchapter for any reason for which the Secretary\n   could exclude the individual or entity from partic-\n   ipation in a program under subchapter XVIII of\n   this chapter under section 1320a-7, 1320a-7a, or\n   1395cc(b)(2) of this title.\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1). The cross-referenced sections of\nthe Medicaid Act—§§ 1320a-7, 1320a-7a, and 1395cc(b)(2)—\npertain to mandatory or permissive exclusions of pro-\nviders for various forms of malfeasance such as fraud,\ndrug crimes, and failure to disclose necessary informa-\ntion to regulators. Indiana emphasizes the phrase “[i]n\naddition to any other authority” and suggests that this\nlanguage implies a plenary power reserved to the states\nto exclude Medicaid providers as they see fit. This\nreads the phrase for more than it’s worth. “[I]n addition\nto any other authority” signals only that what follows\nis a nonexclusive list of specific grounds upon\nwhich states may bar providers from participating\nin Medicaid. It does not imply that the states have an\nunlimited authority to exclude providers for any\nreason whatsoever.\n\f28                                                 No. 11-2464\n\n   To bolster its implied-authority argument, Indiana\nrelies on a Senate Finance Committee Report explaining\nthat § 1396a(p)(1) “is not intended to preclude a State\nfrom establishing, under State law, any other bases for\nexcluding individuals or entities from its Medicaid program.”\nS. R EP. N O . 100-109, at 20 (1987) (emphasis added), reprinted\nin 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 682, 700. The Senate Report is not\nuseful here; it suggests only that § 1396a(p)(1) does not\nhave preemptive effect. The Senate Report does\nnot—indeed, it cannot—alter the plain meaning of “quali-\nfied” as that term is used in § 1396a(a)(23).\n  Indiana also points to 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(14), which\nallows states to exclude providers who are in default\non their student-loan payments, and from this provision\nmakes another argument by implication: If the states\nmay refuse to subsidize student-loan delinquents with\nMedicaid dollars, then they must have the authority to\n“avoid indirect financing” of any “non-Medicaid” conduct.\nBut like § 1396a(p)(1), this statute merely stipulates a\nparticular ground for excluding a Medicaid provider; it\ndoes not imply that the states may establish any rule of\nexclusion and declare it a provider “qualification” for\npurposes of § 1396a(a)(23). That would make the free-\nchoice-of-provider requirement a nullity.\n  Finally, the cases Indiana cites do not support its posi-\ntion. In First Medical Health Plan, Inc. v. Vega-Ramos, 479\nF.3d 46 (1st Cir. 2007), for instance, the First Circuit\nsimply recognized the point we have just made—that\nstates may exclude providers from participating in\nMedicaid for reasons not listed in § 1396a(p)(1). Vega-\n\fNo. 11-2464                                             29\n\nRamos, moreover, involved a conflict-of-interest rule\napplicable only in Puerto Rico; the First Circuit had no\nreason to consider the effect of the free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement, which does not apply to Puerto\nRico’s Medicaid program. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(B).\nThe court’s opinion thus cannot be understood to\nsuggest that states may override the free-choice-of-pro-\nvider requirement by creating “qualifications” wholly\nunrelated to the competent delivery of medical services.\n  Nor does Guzman v. Shewry, 552 F.3d 941 (9th Cir.\n2009), help Indiana’s case. There, a provider was sus-\npended from California’s Medicaid program based on a\npending criminal investigation. He claimed that federal\nlaw occupies the entire field of regulation pertaining\nto Medicaid and therefore preempted the state’s disciplin-\nary measure. The Ninth Circuit rejected this argu-\nment, relying in part on 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(5), which\nprovides that the states may suspend or exclude\nproviders from participating in Medicaid “for reasons\nbearing on the individual’s or entity’s professional compe-\ntence, professional performance, or financial integrity.”\nThe court remarked that this provision presupposes\nstate regulatory authority over provider qualifications.\nGuzman, 552 F.3d at 949.\n  No one disputes that the states retain considerable\nauthority to establish licensing standards and other\nrelated practice qualifications for providers—this residual\npower is inherent in the cooperative-federalism model\nof the Medicaid program and expressly recognized in\nthe Medicaid regulations. See 42 C.F.R. § 431.51(c)(2)\n\f30                                                No. 11-2464\n\n(providing that states may establish “reasonable\nstandards relating to the qualifications of providers”).\nThis case raises a question about the limits of that author-\nity. Guzman, which involved state action falling within\nthe core of the state’s residual authority, does not\nsupport Indiana’s argument.\n   Before concluding our discussion of the Medicaid Act\nclaim, a few words about agency deference, which the\ndistrict court applied and the parties briefed on appeal.\nAs an additional reason to affirm the district court’s\ndecision, Planned Parenthood argues, and the United\nStates agrees, that we should defer to the CMS Admin-\nistrator’s interpretation of § 1396a(a)(23) under Chevron.\nSee Chevron, U. S. A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,\n467 U.S. 837 (1984). But Chevron deference is triggered\nonly when a statute is ambiguous. Id. at 842-43 (“If the\nintent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter;\nfor the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to\nthe unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”). As\nwe have explained, the term “qualified” as used in\n§ 1396a(a)(23) unambiguously refers to the provider’s\nfitness to render the medical services required. See\ngenerally Carcieri v. Salazar, 555 U.S. 379, 391 (2009) (noting\nthat statutory text susceptible to alternative meanings\nis not ambiguous when its meaning is clear in light of the\nstatutory context). In the absence of ambiguity, Chevron\ndeference does not come into play.\n  Because Indiana’s defunding law excludes a class of\nproviders from Medicaid for reasons unrelated to\nprovider qualifications, we agree with the district court\nthat Planned Parenthood is likely to succeed on its\n\fNo. 11-2464                                              31\n\nclaim that Indiana’s defunding law violates § 1396a(a)(23).\nThis brings us to the district court’s evaluation of the\nbalance of harms and the effect of preliminary injunctive\nrelief on the public interest.\n\n\n  3. Balance of Harms and the Public Interest\n  The court below held that the loss of Medicaid funding\nwould cause Planned Parenthood immediate irreparable\nharm. Indiana does not seriously challenge this con-\nclusion. Planned Parenthood would have to lay off\ndozens of workers, close multiple clinics, and stop\nserving a significant number of its patients. Planned\nParenthood of Ind., 794 F. Supp. 2d at 912. Absent a pre-\nliminary injunction, its Medicaid patients would lose\ntheir provider of choice for the duration of the litigation.\nId. at 912-13. These harms are entitled to significant\nweight given Planned Parenthood’s strong likelihood\nof success on the merits of its Medicaid Act claim. In\naddition, the district court noted that “[t]he federal gov-\nernment has threatened partial or total withholding\nof federal Medicaid dollars to the State of Indiana,\nwhich could total well over $5 billion dollars annually\nand affect nearly 1 million Hoosiers.” Id. at 913. The\njudge saw “a high-stakes political impasse” looming,\nwith the well-being of Indiana’s Medicaid patients\nhanging in the balance: “[I]f dogma trumps pragmatism\nand neither side budges, Indiana’s most vulnerable\ncitizens could end up paying the price as the collateral\ndamage of a partisan battle.” Id. This helped tip the\nscales in favor of a preliminary injunction.\n\f32                                            No. 11-2464\n\n  Without endorsing the political commentary, we see\nno reason to disturb the district court’s assessment of\nthe balance of harms and the public interest. Indiana\nmaintains that any harm to Planned Parenthood’s\nMedicaid patients is superficial because they have\nmany other qualified Medicaid providers to choose\nfrom in every part of the state. This argument misses\nthe mark. That a range of qualified providers remains\navailable is beside the point. Section 1396a(a)(23) gives\nMedicaid patients the right to receive medical\nassistance from the provider of their choice without\nstate interference, save on matters of provider qualifica-\ntions.\n   Indiana also argues that the district court’s\npreliminary injunction “completely undermines” the pub-\nlic’s interest in the established administrative pro-\ncess. We cannot see how. Indiana’s appeal of the CMS\nAdministrator’s decision has proceeded in the ordinary\ncourse. It is true that the federal government’s position\nas an amicus curiae in this litigation makes it unlikely\nthat the HHS Secretary will overrule the CMS Admin-\nistrator’s decision and approve Indiana’s request to\namend its Medicaid plan. But that has no real effect on\nthe balance of harms. And if the Secretary approves\nthe plan amendment, Indiana may ask for relief from\nthe preliminary injunction.\n  In the end, our review of this aspect of the district\ncourt’s decision is deferential. The judge appropriately\nweighed the relative harm to the parties and the public\ninterest and reasonably concluded that it warranted\n\fNo. 11-2464                                             33\n\npreliminary injunctive relief on the Medicaid Act claim.\nThat decision was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n\nB. Block-Grant Preemption Claim\n  The district court also enjoined Indiana from enforcing\nAct 1210 to halt the payment of money Planned Parent-\nhood receives from the State under a federal block-grant\nprogram for the diagnosis and monitoring of sexually\ntransmitted diseases. The statutory authority for the\nprogram is as follows:\n    § 247c. Sexually transmitted diseases; prevention and\n    control projects and programs\n    ....\n    (c) Project grants to States\n    The Secretary is also authorized to make project grants\n    to States and, in consultation with the State health\n    authority, to political subdivisions of States, for—\n      (1) sexually transmitted diseases surveillance ac-\n    tivities, including the reporting, screening, and\n    followup of diagnostic tests for, and diagnosed cases\n    of, sexually transmitted diseases . . . .\n42 U.S.C. § 247c.\n  The Disease Intervention Services agency (“DIS”) ad-\nministers the grants at the federal level. In 2011\nIndiana awarded Planned Parenthood two grants\ntotaling $150,000 from federal funds the State received\nfrom DIS under § 247c(c). Planned Parenthood has re-\n\f34                                              No. 11-2464\n\nceived grants from this program continuously since 1996\nand alleges that but for Act 1210, it would receive\nrenewals on an ongoing basis. The defunding law can-\nceled Planned Parenthood’s 2011 contracts and makes the\norganization ineligible for future grants or renewals.1 0\n  The district court accepted Planned Parenthood’s\nargument that § 247c(c) preempts the defunding law\nand on this basis enjoined Indiana from cutting off the\norganization’s funding under this program. There are\nseveral problems with the court’s analysis. First, § 247c(c)\ndoes not create private rights actionable under § 1983.\nNo one argued to the contrary, but the judge held that\nPlanned Parenthood’s preemption claim may proceed\nanyway, as a direct claim under the Supremacy Clause.\nThat was very likely an error. Even if it was not, Planned\nParenthood cannot succeed on the merits of this claim.\nSection 247c(c) places no conditions on recipient states\nother than the basic requirement that the block-granted\nmoney be used for the stated purposes. Finally, the\nunconstitutional-conditions doctrine does not supply\nan alternative basis to affirm the injunction on the block-\ngrant claim.\n\n\n\n\n10\n  The complaint also mentions other federal block-grant\nprograms under which Planned Parenthood receives state-\nadministered federal funds, but the injunction proceeding\nwas limited to § 247c(c).\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                35\n\n  1.   Does the Supremacy Clause Supply a Preemption\n       Right of Action?\n  By its terms, § 247c(c) merely authorizes the HHS\nSecretary to make grants to the states for surveillance\nactivities relating to sexually transmitted diseases. The\nstatute confers no individual rights and therefore the\nremedy of § 1983 is unavailable. Planned Parenthood\nacknowledges as much, but persuaded the district court\nthat the Supremacy Clause supplies a preemption right\nof action of its own force. We have our doubts.\n  It is well-established that the Supremacy Clause is “not\na source of any federal rights.” Chapman v. Hous. Welfare\nRights Org., 441 U.S. 600, 613 (1979); see also Ill. Ass’n of\nMortg. Brokers v. Office of Banks & Real Estate, 308 F.3d 762,\n765 (7th Cir. 2002) (recognizing that the Supremacy\nClause “does not of its own force create rights”). The\nSupremacy Clause “ ‘secure[s] federal rights by according\nthem priority whenever they come in conflict with state\nlaw.’ ” Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Angeles, 493\nU.S. 103, 107 (1989) (alteration in original) (quoting Chap-\nman, 441 U.S. at 613) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  Just this past Term, the Supreme Court was set to\ndecide a case raising the question whether Medicaid\nproviders and recipients could bring a claim that the\nMedicaid Act preempts state statutes reducing Medicaid\npayments to providers. See Douglas, 132 S. Ct. at 1207. In\nDouglas, as here, the providers and recipients had no\nstatutory right of action under the Medicaid Act, but\nthe Ninth Circuit said they could bring the suit directly\nunder the Supremacy Clause. Id. at 1209. The Supreme\n\f36                                                No. 11-2464\n\nCourt granted certiorari to decide whether the court of\nappeals was correct. Id. While the case was pending,\nhowever, CMS approved California’s statutory scheme.\nId. The Court held that this development did not moot\nthe case, id. at 1209-10, but remanded to the Ninth Circuit\nto permit that court to address the impact of this\nnew development “in the first instance,” id. at 1211.\n  Chief Justice Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Scalia,\nThomas, and Alito. In their view, the Court should have\nkept the case and decided the legal question presented:\nwhether the Supremacy Clause provides a cause of\naction to enforce the requirements of a Spending Clause\nstatute when Congress has not provided a right of action\nin the statute itself. Id. at 1212 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).\nThat is the precise question here, and although the\nCourt ultimately left it for another day, we can take\nsome cues from the Chief Justice’s analysis.\n  The Chief Justice began by reiterating the principle\nthat the Supremacy Clause does not create federal rights,\nbut instead “simply ensures that the rule established\nby Congress controls.” Id. at 1213. In other words, the role\nof the Supremacy Clause is simply to “ensure that, in a\nconflict with state law, whatever Congress says goes.” Id.\nat 1212. So “if Congress does not intend for a statute to\nsupply a cause of action for its enforcement, it makes no\nsense to claim that the Supremacy Clause itself must\nprovide one.” Id. In this situation, implying a direct right\nof action under the Supremacy Clause “would effect a\ncomplete end-run around [the Court’s] implied right of\naction and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 jurisprudence.” Id. at 1213. In\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                 37\n\nthe view of the dissenting justices in Douglas, a proper\nunderstanding of the Supremacy Clause compelled\nthe conclusion that “[w]hen Congress did not intend to\nprovide a private right of action to enforce a statute\nenacted under the Spending Clause, the Supremacy\nClause does not supply one of its own force.” Id. at 1215.\n  Other than the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Douglas, few\nappellate opinions have recognized a freestanding right\nto bring a preemption action under the Supremacy\nClause, though we acknowledge that there are some. See,\ne.g., Wilderness Soc’y v. Kane County, Utah, 581 F.3d 1198,\n1216 (10th Cir. 2009), vacated on other grounds, 632 F.3d 1162\n(10th Cir. 2011) (en banc); Planned Parenthood of Hous. & Se.\nTex. v. Sanchez, 403 F.3d 324, 331-35 (5th Cir. 2005). This\napproach is controversial (as the grant of certiorari\nin Douglas implies), and we think highly doubtful, for\nthe reasons articulated by the Douglas dissenters.\n   This is not, moreover, a circumstance covered by the\ndoctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908). The pre-\nemption claim here, as in Douglas, does not involve\nthe “pre-emptive assertion in equity of a defense that\nwould otherwise have been available in the State’s en-\nforcement proceedings at law.” Va. Office for Prot. &\nAdvocacy v. Stewart, 131 S. Ct. 1632, 1642 (2011) (Kennedy,\nJ., concurring); see also Douglas, 132 S. Ct. at 1213 (Roberts,\nC. J., dissenting). In other words, Indiana is not\nthreatening Planned Parenthood with an enforcement\naction or otherwise trying to regulate its behavior\nthrough an action at law; the State has simply turned off\nthe funding spigot.\n\f38                                                No. 11-2464\n\n  If Planned Parenthood’s preemption claim is to\nproceed, we would have to agree with its position that\nthe Supremacy Clause supplies a right of action of its\nown force. We are not inclined to agree, but we do not\nneed to commit ourselves here. Planned Parenthood’s\npreemption claim cannot succeed on the merits. Because\nour jurisdiction is not at issue, we can assume without\ndeciding the right-of-action question and proceed\ndirectly to the merits. See Nw. Airlines, Inc. v. County of\nKent, Mich., 510 U.S. 355, 365 (1994) (“The question\nwhether a federal statute creates a claim for relief is not\njurisdictional.”); see also Bertrand ex rel. Bertrand v. Maram,\n495 F.3d 452, 457-58 (7th Cir. 2007) (assuming a right of\naction exists and deciding the case on the merits because\n“[a] private right of action is not a component of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction”); Bruggeman ex rel. Bruggeman v.\nBlagojevich, 324 F.3d 906, 911 (7th Cir. 2003) (same).\n\n\n  2.   Likelihood of Success on the § 247c(c) Preemption\n       Claim\n  By its terms, § 247c(c) does no more than authorize\nthe HHS Secretary to make federal block grants to the\nstates to help pay for programs that diagnose and monitor\nsexually transmitted diseases. The only restriction on\nthe states is that the federal money be used for the stated\npurposes. Beyond that, § 247c(c) attaches no strings to\nthe block-granted money at all. Nor has Planned Parent-\nhood identified any related federal statute or regulation\nthat expressly limits how a recipient state may disburse\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                     39\n\nthese funds. 11 Indiana’s defunding law cannot possibly\nconflict with a block-grant statute as unrestricted as\nthis one.\n   Nonetheless, the district court concluded that Indiana\nis not free to decide how to distribute its § 247c(c) funds.\nWithout discussing the statutory text at all, the court\nheld that § 247c(c) “does not suggest that states are per-\nmitted to determine eligibility criteria for the DIS\ngrants.” Planned Parenthood of Ind., 794 F. Supp. 2d at 912.\nThis inverts established preemption analysis, which\nbegins with a presumption against preemption and focuses\nfirst on the text of the statute. Wyeth v. Levine, 555 U.S. 555,\n565 & n.3 (2009). Unless Congress has “indicate[d]\npre-emptive intent through a statute’s express language\nor through its structure and purpose,” the state law is\n\n\n11\n   Planned Parenthood makes passing reference to 42 C.F.R.\n§ 51b.106(e), but that regulation simply provides that the\nSecretary of HHS may impose conditions on the state’s use of\n§ 247c(c) block-granted funds at the time the grant is made,\n“including conditions governing the use of information or\nconsent forms, when, in the [federal government’s] judgment,\nthey are necessary to advance the approved program, the\ninterest of the public health, or the conservation of grant funds.”\nWithout explanation, the district court also relied on\n§ 51b.106(e). See Planned Parenthood of Ind., Inc. v. Comm’r of\nthe Ind. State Dep’t of Health, 794 F. Supp. 2d 892, 912 (S.D. Ind.\n2011). The regulation has no relevance here. It simply makes\nexplicit what is already implicit in the Secretary’s authority\nto make block grants: that she may attach specific conditions\nto a state’s § 247c(c) block-grant funding at the time the grant\nis made.\n\f40                                               No. 11-2464\n\npresumed to be valid. Altria Grp., Inc. v. Good, 555 U.S. 70,\n76 (2008).\n  Because § 247c(c) contains no express preemption\nlanguage, only implied preemption is even conceivably\nat issue. Implied preemption comes in two types: (1) field\npreemption, which arises when the federal regulatory\nscheme is so pervasive or the federal interest so\ndominant that it may be inferred that Congress intended\nto occupy the entire legislative field; and (2) conflict\npreemption, which arises when state law conflicts with\nfederal law to the extent that “compliance with both\nfederal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,” or\nthe state law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplish-\nment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\nof Congress.” Arizona v. United States, 132 S. Ct. 2492,\n2501 (2012) (internal quotation marks and citations omit-\nted). Field preemption and the “impossibility” form of\nconflict preemption are not implicated here. That leaves\nonly obstacle preemption.\n  We note for starters that the district court’s view that\nIndiana may not impose eligibility conditions on DIS\nsubgrants conflicts with the basic structure and purpose\nof block-grant funding. As a general matter, federal\nblock grants devolve control to the states over the dis-\nbursement of federal funds. Of course, Congress may\nrestrict a recipient state’s disbursement of block-granted\nmoney in a variety of ways, see King v. Smith, 392 U.S.\n309, 333 n.34 (1968), as when the federal statute or im-\nplementing regulations expressly provide eligibility\ncriteria for subgrants from states, see N.Y. State Dep’t of\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                 41\n\nSoc. Servs. v. Dublino, 413 U.S. 405, 421-22 (1973). But if the\nfederal law allows room for state-imposed eligibility\nconditions, then the recipient state is free to establish its\nown eligibility criteria unless the party asserting preemp-\ntion meets its burden of showing that the state rules\nfrustrate the federal objective. Id. (distinguishing\nbetween grants where federal law “expressly provided\n[who] would be eligible” and those where federal law\nallowed for “complementary” state conditions).\n   The district court stood this principle on its head. The\nquestion is not whether § 247c(c) expressly allows a recipi-\nent state to impose its own subgrant conditions, as the\ndistrict court seemed to think. Instead, the pertinent\nquestion is whether § 247c(c) prohibits state-imposed\neligibility conditions, either expressly or by necessary\nimplication. As we have noted, congressional and regula-\ntory silence usually defeats a claim of preemption, not the\nother way around. See Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 602-03 (Thomas,\nJ., concurring in the judgment).\n  Nothing in § 247c(c) or its implementing regulations\nrestricts Indiana’s authority over subgrants. Absent a\nconflict between state and federal law in the first place,\nstate law cannot possibly stand as an obstacle to the\naccomplishment of congressional objectives. “[S]tate law\nis displaced only ‘to the extent that it actually conflicts\nwith federal law.’ ” Dalton v. Little Rock Family Planning\nServs., 516 U.S. 474, 476 (1996) (per curiam) (quoting Pac.\nGas & Elec. Co. v. State Energy Res. Conservation & Dev.\nComm’n, 461 U.S. 190, 204 (1983)). Because Indiana’s\n§ 247c(c) funding is unrestricted, there is no conflict\nbetween state and federal law.\n\f42                                               No. 11-2464\n\n  The district court relied on a series of cases regarding\nblock-grant family-planning funding under Title X. See,\ne.g., Sanchez, 403 F.3d at 336-37; Planned Parenthood\nFed’n of Am., Inc. v. Heckler, 712 F.2d 650, 663-64 (D.C. Cir.\n1983); Valley Family Planning v. North Dakota, 661 F.2d 99,\n100-02 (8th Cir. 1981). Indiana pointed out that Title X’s\nimplementing regulations contain an explicit open-eligibil-\nity requirement—“[a]ny public or nonprofit private\nentity in a State may apply for a grant,” 42 C.F.R.\n§ 59.3—while § 247c(c) and its regulatory scheme do not,\nsee 42 C.F.R. § 51b.106. The district court ignored this\ncritical distinction. The Title X cases have no bearing here.\n  Simply put, Indiana’s defunding law does not conflict\nwith § 247c(c) or its implementing regulations. Having\n“identified no significant conflict with an identifiable\nfederal policy or interest,” O’Melveny & Myers v. FDIC,\n512 U.S. 79, 88 (1994), Planned Parenthood cannot\nsucceed on the merits of its preemption claim. The\ndistrict court should not have enjoined the enforcement\nof Act 1210 with respect to Indiana’s DIS block-grant\nfunding.\n\n\n  3.   Unconstitutional-Conditions Doctrine\n  Having decided to order preliminary injunctive relief\non the statutory claims, the district court had no need\nto address Planned Parenthood’s unconstitutional-condi-\ntions claim. Our decision on the merits of the preemp-\ntion claim brings this alternative theory into play. If viable\nand likely to succeed, Planned Parenthood’s unconstitu-\n\fNo. 11-2464                                               43\n\ntional-conditions claim may serve as an independent\nbasis to affirm the judge’s order prohibiting the termina-\ntion of its DIS funding. The issue was preserved in the\ndistrict court, the parties have briefed it on appeal, and\nbecause it raises a purely legal question, it makes sense\nfor us to address it here. See Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S.\n154, 166-67 (1997) (“The asserted grounds were raised\nbelow, and have been fully briefed and argued here;\nwe deem it an appropriate exercise of our discretion\nto consider them now rather than leave them for disposi-\ntion on remand.”); see also Alvarez, 679 F.3d at 590.\n   “The ‘unconstitutional conditions’ doctrine is premised\non the notion that what a government cannot compel, it\nshould not be able to coerce.” Libertarian Party of Ind. v.\nPackard, 741 F.2d 981, 988 (7th Cir. 1984). Understood at\nits most basic level, the doctrine aims to prevent the\ngovernment from achieving indirectly what the Con-\nstitution prevents it from achieving directly. Thus, “[t]he\ndenial of a public benefit may not be used by the gov-\nernment for the purpose of creating an incentive\nenabling it to achieve what it may not command directly.”\nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 361 (1976) (plurality opinion).\nThis does not mean that the myriad public benefits dis-\npensed at all levels of government have the status of\nconstitutional rights; rather, the doctrine prevents the\ngovernment from awarding or withholding a public\nbenefit for the purpose of coercing the beneficiary to\ngive up a constitutional right or to penalize his exercise\nof a constitutional right. As the Supreme Court explained\nthe doctrine in Perry v. Sindermann,\n\f44                                               No. 11-2464\n\n     even though a person has no “right” to a valuable\n     governmental benefit and even though the govern-\n     ment may deny him the benefit for any number of\n     reasons, there are some reasons upon which the\n     government may not rely. It may not deny a benefit\n     to a person on a basis that infringes his con-\n     stitutionally protected interests . . . .\n408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972).\n  The first step in any unconstitutional-conditions claim\nis to identify the nature and scope of the constitutional\nright arguably imperiled by the denial of a public benefit.\nSee Michael W. McConnell, The Selective Funding Problem:\nAbortions and Religious Schools, 104 H ARV . L. R EV. 989, 992\n(1991) (observing that a claim that a selective-funding\ndecision is an unconstitutional condition requires\n“careful consideration of the nature of the constitutional\nright implicated by the funding decision, including the\nnature of the countervailing interests of the govern-\nment”); Cass R. Sunstein, Is There an Unconstitutional\nConditions Doctrine?, 26 SAN D IEGO L. R EV. 337, 338 (1989)\n(“Whether a condition is permissible is a function of the\nparticular constitutional provision at issue . . . .”). Here,\nPlanned Parenthood’s unconstitutional-conditions claim\nnecessarily derives from a woman’s constitutional right\nto obtain an abortion. See Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v.\nCasey, 505 U.S. 833, 846 (1992) (“Constitutional protection\nof the woman’s decision to terminate her pregnancy\nderives from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.” (emphasis added)). Under existing prece-\ndent any protection for Planned Parenthood as an\n\fNo. 11-2464                                             45\n\nabortion provider is “derivative of the woman’s posi-\ntion.” Id. at 884 (plurality opinion).\n  Two aspects of the Supreme Court’s abortion juris-\nprudence are important here. First, the Court has\nexplained that the constitutional right to obtain an\nabortion is a right against coercive governmental burdens;\nthe government may not “prohibit any woman from\nmaking the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy”\nbefore fetal viability or impose an “undue burden on a\nwoman’s ability to make this decision.” Id. at 874, 879;\nsee also Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124, 146 (2007). An\n“undue burden” exists if the challenged law has the\n“purpose or effect” of placing “a substantial obstacle in\nthe path of a woman seeking an abortion before the\nfetus attains viability.” Casey, 505 U.S. at 878 (plurality\nopinion); see also Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 146.\n  Accordingly, the Court has conceptualized the right as “a\nconstitutionally protected interest ‘in making certain\nkinds of important decisions’ free from govern-\nmental compulsion.” Maher v. Roe, 432 U.S. 464, 473 (1977)\n(quoting Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 599-600 & nn.24 &\n26 (1977)).\n  This brings up the second important point. The Court\nhas explicitly rejected a neutrality-based view of abor-\ntion rights. Thus, the Court has held that although\nthe abortion right recognized in Roe v. Wade1 2 “protects\nthe woman from unduly burdensome interference with\nher freedom to decide whether to terminate her preg-\n\n\n\n12\n     410 U.S. 113 (1973).\n\f46                                               No. 11-2464\n\nnancy[,] [i]t implies no limitation on the authority of a\nState to make a value judgment favoring childbirth\nover abortion, and to implement that judgment by the\nallocation of public funds.” Id. at 473-74. In Maher the\nCourt upheld Connecticut’s ban on public funding for\nnontherapeutic abortions because it “places no obsta-\ncles—absolute or otherwise—in the pregnant woman’s\npath to an abortion.” Id. at 474. The Court reaffirmed\nMaher in Harris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 314-17 (1980),\nupholding the Hyde Amendment. And in Webster v.\nReproductive Health Services, 492 U.S. 490, 508-11 (1989),\nthe Court upheld Missouri’s statutory ban on the use of\npublic employees and facilities to perform or assist in\nthe performance of an abortion.\n  Finally, in Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991), the\nCourt rejected a challenge to federal regulations prohi-\nbiting recipients of Title X family-planning grants from\nadvocating abortion as a method of family planning\nor referring patients for abortion. Under the regulations,\ngrant recipients with abortion-related practices could\ncontinue to receive Title X money only if they segregated\ntheir abortion-related activities in a separate affiliate. Id.\nat 179-81. Rust held that the regulations did not place\nan unconstitutional condition on Title X grant recipients.\nId. at 203. This was so whether the claim was premised\non the speech rights of the providers, id. at 196-99, or\nthe abortion rights of their patients, id. at 201-03. As\nrelevant here, the Court reaffirmed the holdings of\nWebster, Harris, and Maher that “[t]he Government has no\nconstitutional duty to subsidize an activity merely\nbecause the activity is constitutionally protected and\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                  47\n\nmay validly choose to fund childbirth over abortion.” Id.\nat 201. Because the Title X regulations did not place\nan undue burden on a woman’s right to obtain an\nabortion or otherwise impose an unconstitutional condi-\ntion on grant recipients, the Court upheld the regulatory\nscheme. Id. at 203.\n   As these cases make clear, the government need not be\nneutral between abortion providers and other medical\nproviders, and this principle is particularly well-estab-\nlished in the context of governmental decisions regarding\nthe use of public funds. As long as the difference\nin treatment does not unduly burden a woman’s right\nto obtain an abortion, the government is free to treat\nabortion providers differently.\n  Applying these principles here, the unconstitutional-\nconditions claim is not likely to succeed. Planned Parent-\nhood does not argue that the loss of its block-grant\nfunding imposes an undue burden—directly or indi-\nrectly—on a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. If, as\nthe foregoing cases hold, the government’s refusal to\nsubsidize abortion does not unduly burden a woman’s\nright to obtain an abortion, then Indiana’s ban on public\nfunding of abortion providers—even for unrelated\nservices—cannot indirectly burden a woman’s right to\nobtain an abortion.1 3 See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic &\n\n\n13\n  The unconstitutional-conditions doctrine would be\nimplicated if a state adopted a policy of withholding unrelated\npublic benefits from a woman who had an abortion. See\nHarris v. McRae, 448 U.S. 297, 317 n.19 (1980) (“A substantial\n                                                  (continued...)\n\f48                                                   No. 11-2464\n\nInstitutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 59-60 (2006) (“It is\nclear that a funding condition cannot be unconstitutional\nif it could be constitutionally imposed directly.”).\nPlanned Parenthood offers nothing else in support of\nits unconstitutional-conditions claim.1 4 Accordingly, this\ntheory does not provide an alternative basis to affirm\nthe district court’s order prohibiting Indiana from ter-\nminating Planned Parenthood’s DIS funding.\n\n\n                        III. Conclusion\n  For the foregoing reasons, we A FFIRM the district court’s\norder granting preliminary injunctive relief on Planned\nParenthood’s Medicaid Act claim.

See Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 179-81 (1991). That issue\nis not directly relevant here. The defunding law does not, on\nits face, provide for this option, and Planned Parenthood\ndoes not now organize its affairs in this way.\n\fNo. 11-2464                                              49\n\n   C UDAHY, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\nI join Part IIA of the majority opinion in full. I also join\nPart IIB1 and IIB2 but do not join Part IIB3 or the reversal\nof the judgment requiring modification of the prelim-\ninary injunction insofar as it prohibits state restrictions\non § 247c(c) block-grant funding. I believe the issue of\nunconstitutional conditions should be remanded to the\ndistrict court for development of the record with respect\nto any possible imposition of a burden on access to abor-\ntions. In arguing the matter below, Planned Parenthood\nwas required to defend both its Medicaid and block-\ngrant funding. Unsurprisingly, Planned Parenthood\nfocused on Medicaid and aimed its brief primarily at the\nappropriate interpretation of § 1396a(a)(23). The § 247c(c)\nblock-grant funding received comparatively little atten-\ntion from both parties as well as numerous amici in\nthis case. I believe it is premature for this court to\naddress this issue on the present record. Plaintiffs\nmay not have fully addressed this issue below, but the\nfundamental constitutional nature of this issue should\npreclude its disposition on less than an adequate record.\n\n\n\n\n                          10-23-12\n\f",

In 2011 Indiana adopted a law\nprohibiting state agencies from providing state or\nfederal funds to “any entity that performs abortions or\nmaintains or operates a facility where abortions are\nperformed.” IND. C ODE § 5-22-17-5.5(b). The Hyde Amend-\nment already forbids states from using federal funds to\npay for most nontherapeutic abortions; Indiana has a\n\f2                                                No. 11-2464\n\nsimilar ban on the use of state funds. The new law goes a\nstep further by prohibiting abortion providers from\nreceiving any state-administered funds, even if the\nmoney is earmarked for other services. The point is to\neliminate the indirect subsidization of abortion.\n  Immediately after the defunding law was enacted,\nPlanned Parenthood of Indiana and several individual\nplaintiffs filed this lawsuit seeking to block its imple-\nmentation. 1 As an enrolled Medicaid provider,\nPlanned Parenthood provides reimbursable medical\nservices to low-income patients, two of whom are\nnamed as plaintiffs. Planned Parenthood claims that the\ndefunding law violates the Medicaid Act’s “free choice\nof provider” provision, which requires state Medicaid\nplans to allow patients to choose their own medical\nprovider. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23). The United States,\nas amicus curiae, supports this claim. Planned Parent-\nhood also contends that the defunding law is preempted\nby a federal block-grant statute that authorizes the Secre-\ntary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to make\n\n\n1\n  The plaintiffs are Planned Parenthood of Indiana, one of its\ndoctors, and two Indiana residents who receive Medicaid\nservices from Planned Parenthood clinics. We refer to the\nplaintiffs collectively as “Planned Parenthood” unless the\ncontext requires otherwise. The defendants are the Commis-\nsioner of the Indiana State Department of Health and several\nother state department heads, the Indiana General Assembly,\nand the state prosecutors of Marion, Monroe, and Tippecanoe\nCounties. We refer to the defendants collectively as “Indi-\nana” unless the context requires otherwise.\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                3\n\ngrants to the states for programs related to sexually\ntransmitted diseases. See 42 U.S.C. § 247c(c). Finally,\nPlanned Parenthood claims that the defunding law\nplaces an unconstitutional condition on its receipt of state-\nadministered funds because it must choose between\nproviding abortion services and receiving public money.\n  The district court held that the first two claims were\nlikely to succeed and enjoined Indiana from enforcing\nthe defunding law with respect to Planned Parenthood’s\nMedicaid and § 247c(c) grant funding. The court did not\naddress the unconstitutional-conditions claim. Indiana\nappealed.\n  We affirm in part and reverse in part. A threshold\nquestion on the two statutory claims is whether the\nplaintiffs have a right of action. To create private rights\nactionable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the statutes in question\nmust meet the requirements of Gonzaga University v.\nDoe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"121157\"><a href=\"/opinion/121157/gonzaga-univ-v-doe/\"><span class=\"volume\">536</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2002). The free-choice-of-provider\nstatute does. Under § 1396a(a)(23) state Medicaid plans\n“must” allow beneficiaries to obtain medical care from\n“any institution, agency, . . . or person, qualified to\nperform the service.” This is individual-rights language,\nstated in mandatory terms, and interpreting the right\ndoes not strain judicial competence. See Gonzaga Univ.,\n536 U.S. at 284.\n  Planned Parenthood is likely to succeed on this\nclaim. Although Indiana has broad authority to exclude\nunqualified providers from its Medicaid program, the\nState does not have plenary authority to exclude a class\nof providers for any reason—more particularly, for a\n\f4                                              No. 11-2464\n\nreason unrelated to provider qualifications. In this\ncontext, “qualified” means fit to provide the necessary\nmedical services—that is, capable of performing the\nneeded medical services in a professionally competent,\nsafe, legal, and ethical manner. The defunding law ex-\ncludes Planned Parenthood from Medicaid for a reason\nunrelated to its fitness to provide medical services, vio-\nlating its patients’ statutory right to obtain medical care\nfrom the qualified provider of their choice.\n  The remaining claims are not likely to succeed, how-\never, so the scope of the injunction must be modified.\nFirst, the block-grant statute does not create private\nrights actionable under § 1983, and the district court’s\nconclusion that the Supremacy Clause supplies a pre-\nemption claim of its own force is probably wrong. In\nany event, the defunding law does not conflict with\n§ 247c(c), which attaches no strings to the federal money\nother than a general requirement that the recipient\nstate spend it on programs for the surveillance of sexually\ntransmitted diseases. Finally, the unconstitutional-condi-\ntions claim does not supply an alternative basis for\nrelief. This doctrine, sometimes murky, requires close\nattention to the potentially implicated right. Here,\nPlanned Parenthood’s claim is entirely derivative of a\nwoman’s right to obtain an abortion. It is settled law\nthat the government’s refusal to subsidize abortion does\nnot impermissibly burden a woman’s right to obtain an\nabortion. If a ban on public funding for abortion does\nnot directly violate the abortion right, then Indiana’s ban\non other forms of public subsidy for abortion providers\ncannot be an unconstitutional condition that indirectly\nviolates the right.\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                     5\n\n                        I.

Indiana House Enrolled Act 1210, the Abortion-\n   Provider Defunding Law\n  In the spring of 2011, the Indiana General Assembly\nadopted a law prohibiting abortion providers from re-\nceiving any state contracts and grants, including those\ninvolving state-administered federal funds. More specifi-\ncally, the defunding law provides that state agencies\n“may not[] enter into a contract with[] or make a grant\nto[] any entity that performs abortions or maintains or\noperates a facility where abortions are performed.” IND.\nC ODE § 5-22-17-5.5(b). The new law, known as House\nEnrolled Act 1210, also cancelled existing contracts with\nabortion providers. See id. § 5-22-17-5.5(c), (d). The\ndefunding law does not apply to hospitals and am-\nbulatory surgical centers. See id. § 5-22-17-5.5(a).\n  Act 1210 fills a gap in Indiana law regarding public\nfunding of abortion. The Hyde Amendment prohibits the\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                   7\n\nuse of federal funds to pay for nontherapeutic abortions\nexcept in the case of pregnancies resulting from rape\nor incest.3 Indiana law contains similar restrictions on\nthe use of state funds.

Act 1210 aims\nto prevent the indirect subsidization of abortion by stop-\nping the flow of all state-administered funds to abor-\ntion providers.\n  Governor Mitch Daniels signed Act 1210 into law on\nMay 10, 2011. On May 13 Indiana notified CMS of the\nchange in its law and sought approval for an amend-\nment to its Medicaid plan to exclude any provider (not\nincluding hospitals and ambulatory surgical centers) that\noffers abortion services. After consulting with the HHS\nSecretary, see 42 C.F.R. § 430.15(c), the CMS Admini-\nstrator rejected the proposed plan amendment citing\n§ 1396a(a)(23), the free-choice-of-provider rule. In a\nletter to Indiana’s Director of Medicaid Policy &\nPlanning, the Administrator noted that “federal\nMedicaid funding of abortion services is not permitted\nunder federal law except in extraordinary circum-\nstances (such as in cases of rape or incest).” “At the\nsame time,” the Administrator continued, “Medicaid\nprograms may not exclude qualified health care\n\n\n\n3\n  The Hyde Amendment is actually a rider Congress attaches\nto appropriations legislation each year. See Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, 2012, Pub. L.

See 42 U.S.C. § 1316(a)(2); 42 C.F.R.\n§ 430.18. This initiated an administrative appeal process\nthat included a hearing, see 42 C.F.R. §§ 430.76(a), 430.83,\nand the right to seek judicial review of the final decision,\nsee 42 U.S.C. § 1316(a)(3); 42 C.F.R. § 430.38. The\nhearing was held on December 15, 2011, and on June 20,\n2012, the hearing officer sent the Administrator his rec-\nommended findings and a proposed decision upholding\nthe initial determination. See 42 C.F.R. § 430.102. Under\n42 C.F.R. § 430.102(b)(2), the parties have an opportunity\nto file objections before final action on the recommenda-\ntion is taken. To our knowledge, a final agency decision\nhas not yet been issued.\n\n\nB. Planned Parenthood’s Legal Challenge to Act 1210\n  Planned Parenthood is a nonprofit healthcare provider\noffering reproductive healthcare and family-planning\nservices in Indiana, including preventive primary-care\nservices such as medical examinations, cancer screenings,\ntesting for sexually transmitted diseases, and various birth-\ncontrol services. The organization operates 28 health\nclinics in Indiana and has more than 75,000 patients.\nPlanned Parenthood is an enrolled provider in Indiana’s\n\fNo. 11-2464                                              9\n\nMedicaid program. In 2010 the organization offered\nMedicaid services to more than 9,300 patients and\nreceived $1,360,437 in Medicaid reimbursement. Planned\nParenthood also receives grants from Indiana state agen-\ncies, including some funded with federal money. Among\nthose in effect when Act 1210 was adopted were two\ngrants totaling $150,000 from Indiana’s federal Disease\nIntervention Services block-grant money received under\n§ 247c(c), which authorizes grants for programs that\ndiagnose and monitor sexually transmitted diseases.\n  Planned Parenthood also performs abortions. The\norganization uses private funding to support its\nabortion services and takes steps to ensure that public and\nprivate funds are not commingled. As an abortion pro-\nvider, Planned Parenthood is barred by Act 1210 from\nreceiving any state-administered funds, including\nMedicaid reimbursement and funding from state and\nfederal grants for services unrelated to abortion. The\norganization estimates that full implementation of the\ndefunding law would require it to close a quarter of its\nhealth clinics, lay off approximately 37 employees, and\ncease serving an unknown number of patients.\n  Because of the effect of the defunding law on its state-\nwide operations, Planned Parenthood did not wait for\nthe outcome of the CMS administrative process. On\nMay 10, 2011—the same day that Governor Daniels\nsigned Act 1210 into law—Planned Parenthood went to\ncourt in the Southern District of Indiana seeking to block\nthe new law. Its lawsuit challenges Act 1210 on several\ngrounds. First, Planned Parenthood alleges that the law\n\f10                                                    No. 11-2464\n\nviolates § 1396a(a)(23), the Medicaid free-choice-of-pro-\nvider requirement. The complaint also asserts a preemp-\ntion claim based on several federal block-grant programs.\nFinally, Planned Parenthood alleges that the defunding\nlaw imposes an unconstitutional condition on its\nreceipt of public funds by forcing it to choose between\nperforming abortions and receiving nonabortion-related\npublic funding. The complaint seeks declaratory and\ninjunctive relief under § 1983. Planned Parenthood im-\nmediately moved for a temporary restraining order\n(“TRO”) and a preliminary injunction.4\n  The district court denied the motion for a TRO, but\nafter full briefing granted Planned Parenthood’s motion\nfor a preliminary injunction.

As relevant here, the court held that\n§ 1396a(a)(23) creates individual rights enforceable\nunder § 1983 and that Planned Parenthood was likely\nto succeed on its claim that the defunding law violates\n§ 1396a(a)(23). On the preemption claim, the court\nfocused solely on the Disease Intervention Services block-\ngrant program under § 247c(c). The court held that al-\nthough § 247c(c) does not confer an individual right,\n\n\n4\n  Planned Parenthood also challenges two provisions in Act\n1210 that amended Indiana’s informed-consent statute to\nrequire abortion practitioners to inform patients that “human\nphysical life begins when a human ovum is fertilized by a\nhuman sperm” and that “objective scientific information\nshows that a fetus can feel pain at or before twenty (20) weeks\nof postfertilization age.” I ND .

Having found a\nright of action, the court concluded that Planned Parent-\nhood was likely to succeed on its claim that § 247c(c)\npreempts Act 1210. The court then assessed the balance\nof harms and the public interest, ultimately concluding\nthat preliminary injunctive relief was warranted. The\ncourt enjoined “[a]ll attempts to stop current or future\nfunding contracted for or due” Planned Parenthood\nand ordered Indiana to “take all steps to insure that\nall monies are paid.” Id. at 921.

As such, the legitimacy of spending-power legisla-\ntion “rests on whether the State voluntarily and\nknowingly accepts the terms of the ‘contract.’ ” Id. There\ncannot be knowing acceptance “if a State is unaware of\nthe conditions or is unable to ascertain what is expected\nof it.” Id.; see also Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist., 548 U.S. at\n296. The Supreme Court has repeatedly reaffirmed this\nunderstanding, most recently in National Federation\nof Independent Business v. Sebelius, 132 S. Ct. at 2601-02.\n   Accordingly, “where a statute by its terms grants no\nprivate rights to any identifiable class,” Gonzaga Univ.,\n536 U.S. at 284 (internal quotation marks omitted), it\ncannot be construed to confer an individual right en-\nforceable under § 1983, id. at 284-85.

Section 1396a(a)(23) mandates that all\nstate Medicaid plans provide that “any individual\neligible for medical assistance . . . may obtain such assis-\ntance from any institution, agency, community\npharmacy, or person, qualified to perform the service\nor services required.” Medicaid patients are the obvious\n\f16                                              No. 11-2464\n\nintended beneficiaries of the statute; it states that any\nMedicaid-eligible person may obtain medical assistance\nfrom any institution, agency, or person qualified to\nperform that service. In other words, Medicaid patients\nhave the right to receive care from the qualified\nprovider of their choice. This language does not simply\nset an aggregate plan requirement, but instead\nestablishes a personal right to which all Medicaid\npatients are entitled. Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 288 (con-\ntrasting a statute with an “aggregate” focus with one\nthat is focused on the needs of an identified class of\npersons). Section 1396a(a)(23) uses “individually focused\nterminology,” id. at 287, unmistakably “ ‘phrased in terms\nof the persons benefitted,’ ” id. at 284 (quoting Cannon,\n441 U.S. at 692 n.13).\n  Second, the right is administrable and falls comfortably\nwithin the judiciary’s core interpretive competence.\nPlanned Parenthood argues that a state infringes the free-\nchoice-of-provider right when it excludes a provider\nfrom its Medicaid program for a reason other than the\nprovider’s fitness to render the medical services re-\nquired. Whether this is the proper interpretation of\n§ 1396a(a)(23) is a legal question fully capable of judicial\nresolution.\n  Finally, § 1396a(a)(23) is plainly couched in mandatory\nterms. It says that all states “must provide” in their\nMedicaid plans that beneficiaries may obtain medical\ncare from any provider qualified to perform the service.\nIn sum, the free-choice-of-provider statute explicitly\nrefers to a specific class of people—Medicaid-eligible\n\fNo. 11-2464                                            17\n\npatients—and confers on them an individual entitle-\nment—the right to receive reimbursable medical services\nfrom any qualified provider. We agree with the district\ncourt that § 1396a(a)(23) unambiguously creates private\nrights “presumptively enforceable by § 1983.” Gonzaga\nUniv., 536 U.S. at 284.\n  Nothing in the Medicaid Act suggests, explicitly or\nimplicitly, that “Congress specifically foreclosed a\nremedy under § 1983.” Id. at 284 n.4 (internal quotation\nmarks omitted). Indiana points to the Medicaid Act’s\ngeneral administrative scheme—more specifically, to the\nHHS Secretary’s authority to review state plans for com-\npliance and withhold or curtail Medicaid funds as a\nmeans of bringing noncompliant states into line. See 42\nU.S.C. §§ 1316(a), 1396c; 42 C.F.R. § 430.12(c). The State\nsuggests that this feature of the administrative scheme\nimplies that Congress foreclosed private enforcement of\n§ 1396a(a)(23). But the Secretary’s power to shut off all\nor part of a state’s funding is not a “comprehensive\nenforcement scheme,” see Gonzaga Univ., 536 U.S. at 284\nn.4, nor does the administrative-approval process for\nplan amendments provide an avenue for beneficiaries\nto vindicate their free-choice-of-provider rights, cf.\nMiddlesex Cnty. Sewerage Auth., 453 U.S. at 20 (ex-\nplaining that where a federal statute provides “its own\ncomprehensive enforcement scheme, the requirements\nof that enforcement procedure may not be bypassed\nby bringing suit directly under § 1983”).\n  It would be a different matter if Congress had provided\nan administrative remedy for individual patients. “The\n\f18                                              No. 11-2464\n\nprovision of an express, private means of redress in\nthe statute itself is ordinarily an indication that Congress\ndid not intend to leave open a more expansive remedy\nunder § 1983.” Rancho Palos Verdes, 544 U.S. at 121. But\nCongress did not provide a means of private redress\nhere. And private enforcement of § 1396a(a)(23) in suits\nunder § 1983 in no way interferes with the Secretary’s\nprerogative to enforce compliance using her administra-\ntive authority. Indeed, addressing a different subsection\nof § 1396a(a), the Supreme Court has held that the\nMedicaid Act’s “administrative scheme cannot be con-\nsidered sufficiently comprehensive to demonstrate a\ncongressional intent to withdraw the private remedy\nof § 1983.” Wilder, 496 U.S. at 522. Wilder held that the\nBoren Amendment, which established a standard for\nMedicaid reimbursement of hospitals, nursing homes,\nand intermediate-care facilities, is enforceable under\n§ 1983. Id. (holding that 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(13)(A) is\nenforceable in a suit under § 1983).\n  Our conclusion finds support in decisions from other\ncircuits. In Harris v.

The court\nwent on to note that although\n     there may be legitimate debates about the medical\n     care covered by or exempted from the freedom-of-\n     choice provision, the mandate itself does not\n     contain the kind of vagueness that would push the\n     limits of judicial enforcement. Whether a state\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                   19\n\n    plan provides an individual with the choice specified\n    in the provision is likely to be readily apparent . . . .\nId. at 462. Finally, the court observed that the Medicaid\nAct does not “explicitly or implicitly foreclose the private\nenforcement of this statute through § 1983 actions.”\nId. More particularly, the Act “does not provide other\nmethods for private enforcement.” Id. In short, applying\nthe Gonzaga University test, the Sixth Circuit concluded\nthat § 1396a(a)(23) “creates enforceable rights that a\nMedicaid beneficiary may vindicate through § 1983.“ 6\nId. at 461.\n  Other circuits have reached the same conclusion in\ncases involving individual suits for violation of\n§ 1396a(a)(8), which requires that state Medicaid plans\n“provide that all individuals wishing to make applica-\ntion for medical assistance under the plan shall have\nopportunity to do so, and that such assistance shall\nbe furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible\nindividuals.” 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8); see Doe v.

We disagree. In O’Bannon the\nSupreme Court held that a state need not provide a pre-\ntermination hearing to Medicaid beneficiaries when\nstate officials terminate a medical provider (in that case,\na nursing home) as unfit to participate in Medicaid.\n447 U.S. at 785. The Court explained its holding as follows:\n      [T]he Medicaid provisions relied upon by the Court\n      of Appeals do not confer a right to continued\n      residence in a home of one’s choice. Title 42 U.S.C.\n      § 1396a(a)(23) . . . gives [Medicaid] recipients the\n      right to choose among a range of qualified providers,\n      without government interference. By implication, it\n      also confers an absolute right to be free from gov-\n      ernment interference with the choice to remain in\n      a home that continues to be qualified. But it clearly\n      does not confer a right on a recipient to enter an\n      unqualified home and demand a hearing to certify\n      it, nor does it confer a right on a recipient to\n      continue to receive benefits for care in a home that\n      has been decertified.\nId.\n  Similarly, in Kelly Kare the free-choice-of-provider\nstatute was raised in the context of a due-process claim.\nA home-healthcare provider and its patients alleged\nthat they were deprived of due process when the State\ncancelled the provider’s contract based on allegations\nof unfitness without providing a pre-termination hear-\ning. Relying on O’Bannon, the Second Circuit rejected the\nclaim:\n\f24                                              No. 11-2464\n\n     We read O’Bannon as holding that a Medicaid recipi-\n     ent’s freedom of choice rights are necessarily depend-\n     ent on a provider’s ability to render services. No\n     cognizable property interest can arise in the\n     Medicaid recipient unless the provider is both quali-\n     fied and participating in the Medicaid program.\nKelly Kare, 930 F.2d at 178.\n  Neither O’Bannon nor Kelly Kare supports Indiana’s\nargument. This is not a due-process case. Planned Parent-\nhood and its patients are not suing for violation of their\nprocedural rights; they are making a substantive claim\nthat Indiana’s defunding law violates § 1396a(a)(23). As\nthe Supreme Court explained in O’Bannon, § 1396a(a)(23)\n“gives [Medicaid] recipients the right to choose among\na range of qualified providers.” 447 U.S. at 785. This lan-\nguage reinforces rather than undermines our conclu-\nsion that § 1396a(a)(23) confers individual rights enforce-\nable under § 1983.\n\n\n  2. Does the Defunding Law Violate § 1396a(a)(1)?\n  Indiana argues that even if § 1396a(a)(23) confers\nan individual right, the states may establish provider\nqualifications that effectively limit that right. It is true\nthat Medicaid regulations permit the states to establish\n“reasonable standards relating to the qualifications\nof providers.” 42 C.F.R. § 431.51(c)(2). But Indiana\nclaims plenary authority to exclude Medicaid providers\nfor any reason, as long as it furthers a legitimate state\ninterest—here, the State’s interest in avoiding indirect\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                   25\n\nsubsidization of abortion. This sweeping claim conflicts\nwith the unambiguous language of § 1396a(a)(23) and\nfinds no support in related Medicaid statutes and regula-\ntions.\n  To repeat, § 1396a(a)(23) requires that state Medicaid\nplans must provide that “any individual eligible for\nmedical assistance . . . may obtain such assistance from\nany institution, agency, community pharmacy, or person,\nqualified to perform the service or services required.” 42 U.S.C.\n§ 1396a(a)(23) (emphases added). The Act does not\ndefine what it means for a provider to be “qualified,” and\nthe term is not self-defining. See B LACK’S L AW D ICTIONARY\n1360 (9th ed. 2009) (defining “qualified” as “[p]ossessing\nthe necessary qualifications; capable or competent”).\nMedicaid regulations provide that the states may\nestablish “reasonable standards relating to the qualifica-\ntions of providers.” 42 C.F.R. § 431.51(c)(2). This authority,\nhowever, does not suggest that states are free to ascribe\nany meaning to the statutory term “qualified”—including\na meaning “ ‘entirely strange to those familiar with its\nordinary usage.’ ” United States v. Little Lake Misere Land Co.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108819\"><a href=\"/opinion/108819/united-states-v-little-lake-misere-land-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 596 (1973) (quoting De Sylva v. Ballentine,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105419\"><a href=\"/opinion/105419/de-sylva-v-ballentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">570</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 581 (1956)). As the limiting term “reasonable”\nin the regulation suggests, a state’s authority to\ndetermine provider qualifications must be keyed to\nthe “permissible variations in the ordinary concept”\nof what it means to be “qualified” in this particular\ncontext. De Sylva, 351 U.S. at 581.\n  Read in context, the term “qualified” as used in\n§ 1396a(a)(23) unambiguously relates to a provider’s\n\f26                                              No. 11-2464\n\nfitness to perform the medical services the patient re-\nquires. The statute provides that Medicaid beneficiaries\n“may obtain [medical] assistance from any institution,\nagency . . . or person[] qualified to perform the service or\nservices required.” To be “qualified” in the relevant sense\nis to be capable of performing the needed medical services\nin a professionally competent, safe, legal, and ethical\nmanner. Planned Parenthood’s clinics are “qualified” in\nthe sense meant by § 1396a(a)(23).\n  Indiana argues that the term is more elastic and\nincludes the authority to establish provider-eligibility\ncriteria based on any legitimate state interest. That inter-\npretation of § 1396a(a)(23) would lead to strange results.\nIf the states are free to set any qualifications they\nwant—no matter how unrelated to the provider’s fitness\nto treat Medicaid patients—then the free-choice-of-pro-\nvider requirement could be easily undermined by\nsimply labeling any exclusionary rule as a “qualification.”\nThis would open a significant loophole for restricting\npatient choice, contradicting the broad access to medical\ncare that § 1396a(a)(23) is meant to preserve.\n   Indiana attempts to articulate a limiting principle, but\nits effort is unpersuasive. It suggests that “a [s]tate may\nnot use a qualification to target patient choice as\nsuch—for example by eliminating all choice in the\nmarket—but it may reduce patient choice incident to a\nqualification targeting some legitimate government\nobjective, such as the desire not to subsidize abortion\neven indirectly.” This argument inverts what the statute\nsays. Section 1396a(a)(23) does not simply bar the states\n\fNo. 11-2464                                           27\n\nfrom ending all choice of providers, it guarantees to\nevery Medicaid beneficiary the right to choose any quali-\nfied provider.\n  Looking for support elsewhere in the Medicaid\nAct, Indiana focuses on § 1396a(p)(1), which elaborates\non the states’ authority to exclude Medicaid providers:\n   In addition to any other authority, a State may\n   exclude any individual or entity for purposes of\n   participating under the State plan under this\n   subchapter for any reason for which the Secretary\n   could exclude the individual or entity from partic-\n   ipation in a program under subchapter XVIII of\n   this chapter under section 1320a-7, 1320a-7a, or\n   1395cc(b)(2) of this title.\n42 U.S.C. § 1396a(p)(1). The cross-referenced sections of\nthe Medicaid Act—§§ 1320a-7, 1320a-7a, and 1395cc(b)(2)—\npertain to mandatory or permissive exclusions of pro-\nviders for various forms of malfeasance such as fraud,\ndrug crimes, and failure to disclose necessary informa-\ntion to regulators. Indiana emphasizes the phrase “[i]n\naddition to any other authority” and suggests that this\nlanguage implies a plenary power reserved to the states\nto exclude Medicaid providers as they see fit. This\nreads the phrase for more than it’s worth. “[I]n addition\nto any other authority” signals only that what follows\nis a nonexclusive list of specific grounds upon\nwhich states may bar providers from participating\nin Medicaid. It does not imply that the states have an\nunlimited authority to exclude providers for any\nreason whatsoever.\n\f28                                                 No. 11-2464\n\n   To bolster its implied-authority argument, Indiana\nrelies on a Senate Finance Committee Report explaining\nthat § 1396a(p)(1) “is not intended to preclude a State\nfrom establishing, under State law, any other bases for\nexcluding individuals or entities from its Medicaid program.”\nS. R EP. N O . 100-109, at 20 (1987) (emphasis added), reprinted\nin 1987 U.S.C.C.A.N. 682, 700. The Senate Report is not\nuseful here; it suggests only that § 1396a(p)(1) does not\nhave preemptive effect. The Senate Report does\nnot—indeed, it cannot—alter the plain meaning of “quali-\nfied” as that term is used in § 1396a(a)(23).\n  Indiana also points to 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(14), which\nallows states to exclude providers who are in default\non their student-loan payments, and from this provision\nmakes another argument by implication: If the states\nmay refuse to subsidize student-loan delinquents with\nMedicaid dollars, then they must have the authority to\n“avoid indirect financing” of any “non-Medicaid” conduct.\nBut like § 1396a(p)(1), this statute merely stipulates a\nparticular ground for excluding a Medicaid provider; it\ndoes not imply that the states may establish any rule of\nexclusion and declare it a provider “qualification” for\npurposes of § 1396a(a)(23). That would make the free-\nchoice-of-provider requirement a nullity.\n  Finally, the cases Indiana cites do not support its posi-\ntion. In First Medical Health Plan, Inc. v. Vega-Ramos, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202641\"><a href=\"/opinion/202641/first-medical-health-v-vega-ramon/\"><span class=\"volume\">479</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2007), for instance, the First Circuit\nsimply recognized the point we have just made—that\nstates may exclude providers from participating in\nMedicaid for reasons not listed in § 1396a(p)(1). Vega-\n\fNo. 11-2464                                             29\n\nRamos, moreover, involved a conflict-of-interest rule\napplicable only in Puerto Rico; the First Circuit had no\nreason to consider the effect of the free-choice-of-\nprovider requirement, which does not apply to Puerto\nRico’s Medicaid program. See 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(23)(B).\nThe court’s opinion thus cannot be understood to\nsuggest that states may override the free-choice-of-pro-\nvider requirement by creating “qualifications” wholly\nunrelated to the competent delivery of medical services.\n  Nor does Guzman v. Shewry, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">552</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir.\n2009), help Indiana’s case. There, a provider was sus-\npended from California’s Medicaid program based on a\npending criminal investigation. He claimed that federal\nlaw occupies the entire field of regulation pertaining\nto Medicaid and therefore preempted the state’s disciplin-\nary measure. The Ninth Circuit rejected this argu-\nment, relying in part on 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7(b)(5), which\nprovides that the states may suspend or exclude\nproviders from participating in Medicaid “for reasons\nbearing on the individual’s or entity’s professional compe-\ntence, professional performance, or financial integrity.”\nThe court remarked that this provision presupposes\nstate regulatory authority over provider qualifications.\nGuzman, 552 F.3d at 949.\n  No one disputes that the states retain considerable\nauthority to establish licensing standards and other\nrelated practice qualifications for providers—this residual\npower is inherent in the cooperative-federalism model\nof the Medicaid program and expressly recognized in\nthe Medicaid regulations. See 42 C.F.R. § 431.51(c)(2)\n\f30                                                No. 11-2464\n\n(providing that states may establish “reasonable\nstandards relating to the qualifications of providers”).\nThis case raises a question about the limits of that author-\nity. Guzman, which involved state action falling within\nthe core of the state’s residual authority, does not\nsupport Indiana’s argument.\n   Before concluding our discussion of the Medicaid Act\nclaim, a few words about agency deference, which the\ndistrict court applied and the parties briefed on appeal.\nAs an additional reason to affirm the district court’s\ndecision, Planned Parenthood argues, and the United\nStates agrees, that we should defer to the CMS Admin-\nistrator’s interpretation of § 1396a(a)(23) under Chevron.\nSee Chevron, U. S. A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111221\"><a href=\"/opinion/111221/chevron-usa-inc-v-natural-resources-defense-council-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">837</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1984). But Chevron deference is triggered\nonly when a statute is ambiguous. Id. at 842-43 (“If the\nintent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter;\nfor the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to\nthe unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.”). As\nwe have explained, the term “qualified” as used in\n§ 1396a(a)(23) unambiguously refers to the provider’s\nfitness to render the medical services required. See\ngenerally Carcieri v. Salazar, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145908\"><a href=\"/opinion/145908/carcieri-v-salazar/\"><span class=\"volume\">555</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">379</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 391 (2009) (noting\nthat statutory text susceptible to alternative meanings\nis not ambiguous when its meaning is clear in light of the\nstatutory context). In the absence of ambiguity, Chevron\ndeference does not come into play.\n  Because Indiana’s defunding law excludes a class of\nproviders from Medicaid for reasons unrelated to\nprovider qualifications, we agree with the district court\nthat Planned Parenthood is likely to succeed on its\n\fNo. 11-2464                                              31\n\nclaim that Indiana’s defunding law violates § 1396a(a)(23).\nThis brings us to the district court’s evaluation of the\nbalance of harms and the effect of preliminary injunctive\nrelief on the public interest.\n\n\n  3. Balance of Harms and the Public Interest\n  The court below held that the loss of Medicaid funding\nwould cause Planned Parenthood immediate irreparable\nharm. Indiana does not seriously challenge this con-\nclusion. Planned Parenthood would have to lay off\ndozens of workers, close multiple clinics, and stop\nserving a significant number of its patients. Planned\nParenthood of Ind., 794 F. Supp. 2d at 912. Absent a pre-\nliminary injunction, its Medicaid patients would lose\ntheir provider of choice for the duration of the litigation.\nId. at 912-13. These harms are entitled to significant\nweight given Planned Parenthood’s strong likelihood\nof success on the merits of its Medicaid Act claim. In\naddition, the district court noted that “[t]he federal gov-\nernment has threatened partial or total withholding\nof federal Medicaid dollars to the State of Indiana,\nwhich could total well over $5 billion dollars annually\nand affect nearly 1 million Hoosiers.” Id. at 913. The\njudge saw “a high-stakes political impasse” looming,\nwith the well-being of Indiana’s Medicaid patients\nhanging in the balance: “[I]f dogma trumps pragmatism\nand neither side budges, Indiana’s most vulnerable\ncitizens could end up paying the price as the collateral\ndamage of a partisan battle.” Id. This helped tip the\nscales in favor of a preliminary injunction.\n\f32                                            No. 11-2464\n\n  Without endorsing the political commentary, we see\nno reason to disturb the district court’s assessment of\nthe balance of harms and the public interest. Indiana\nmaintains that any harm to Planned Parenthood’s\nMedicaid patients is superficial because they have\nmany other qualified Medicaid providers to choose\nfrom in every part of the state. This argument misses\nthe mark. That a range of qualified providers remains\navailable is beside the point. Section 1396a(a)(23) gives\nMedicaid patients the right to receive medical\nassistance from the provider of their choice without\nstate interference, save on matters of provider qualifica-\ntions.\n   Indiana also argues that the district court’s\npreliminary injunction “completely undermines” the pub-\nlic’s interest in the established administrative pro-\ncess. We cannot see how. Indiana’s appeal of the CMS\nAdministrator’s decision has proceeded in the ordinary\ncourse. It is true that the federal government’s position\nas an amicus curiae in this litigation makes it unlikely\nthat the HHS Secretary will overrule the CMS Admin-\nistrator’s decision and approve Indiana’s request to\namend its Medicaid plan. But that has no real effect on\nthe balance of harms. And if the Secretary approves\nthe plan amendment, Indiana may ask for relief from\nthe preliminary injunction.\n  In the end, our review of this aspect of the district\ncourt’s decision is deferential. The judge appropriately\nweighed the relative harm to the parties and the public\ninterest and reasonably concluded that it warranted\n\fNo. 11-2464                                             33\n\npreliminary injunctive relief on the Medicaid Act claim.\nThat decision was not an abuse of discretion.\n\n\nB. Block-Grant Preemption Claim\n  The district court also enjoined Indiana from enforcing\nAct 1210 to halt the payment of money Planned Parent-\nhood receives from the State under a federal block-grant\nprogram for the diagnosis and monitoring of sexually\ntransmitted diseases. The statutory authority for the\nprogram is as follows:\n    § 247c.

In 2011\nIndiana awarded Planned Parenthood two grants\ntotaling $150,000 from federal funds the State received\nfrom DIS under § 247c(c). Planned Parenthood has re-\n\f34                                              No. 11-2464\n\nceived grants from this program continuously since 1996\nand alleges that but for Act 1210, it would receive\nrenewals on an ongoing basis. The defunding law can-\nceled Planned Parenthood’s 2011 contracts and makes the\norganization ineligible for future grants or renewals.1 0\n  The district court accepted Planned Parenthood’s\nargument that § 247c(c) preempts the defunding law\nand on this basis enjoined Indiana from cutting off the\norganization’s funding under this program. There are\nseveral problems with the court’s analysis. First, § 247c(c)\ndoes not create private rights actionable under § 1983.\nNo one argued to the contrary, but the judge held that\nPlanned Parenthood’s preemption claim may proceed\nanyway, as a direct claim under the Supremacy Clause.\nThat was very likely an error. Even if it was not, Planned\nParenthood cannot succeed on the merits of this claim.\nSection 247c(c) places no conditions on recipient states\nother than the basic requirement that the block-granted\nmoney be used for the stated purposes. Finally, the\nunconstitutional-conditions doctrine does not supply\nan alternative basis to affirm the injunction on the block-\ngrant claim.\n\n\n\n\n10\n  The complaint also mentions other federal block-grant\nprograms under which Planned Parenthood receives state-\nadministered federal funds, but the injunction proceeding\nwas limited to § 247c(c).\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                35\n\n  1.   Does the Supremacy Clause Supply a Preemption\n       Right of Action?\n  By its terms, § 247c(c) merely authorizes the HHS\nSecretary to make grants to the states for surveillance\nactivities relating to sexually transmitted diseases. The\nstatute confers no individual rights and therefore the\nremedy of § 1983 is unavailable. Planned Parenthood\nacknowledges as much, but persuaded the district court\nthat the Supremacy Clause supplies a preemption right\nof action of its own force. We have our doubts.\n  It is well-established that the Supremacy Clause is “not\na source of any federal rights.” Chapman v. Hous.

See Douglas, 132 S. Ct. at 1207. In\nDouglas, as here, the providers and recipients had no\nstatutory right of action under the Medicaid Act, but\nthe Ninth Circuit said they could bring the suit directly\nunder the Supremacy Clause. Id. at 1209. The Supreme\n\f36                                                No. 11-2464\n\nCourt granted certiorari to decide whether the court of\nappeals was correct. Id. While the case was pending,\nhowever, CMS approved California’s statutory scheme.\nId. The Court held that this development did not moot\nthe case, id. at 1209-10, but remanded to the Ninth Circuit\nto permit that court to address the impact of this\nnew development “in the first instance,” id. at 1211.\n  Chief Justice Roberts dissented, joined by Justices Scalia,\nThomas, and Alito. In their view, the Court should have\nkept the case and decided the legal question presented:\nwhether the Supremacy Clause provides a cause of\naction to enforce the requirements of a Spending Clause\nstatute when Congress has not provided a right of action\nin the statute itself. Id. at 1212 (Roberts, C.J., dissenting).\nThat is the precise question here, and although the\nCourt ultimately left it for another day, we can take\nsome cues from the Chief Justice’s analysis.\n  The Chief Justice began by reiterating the principle\nthat the Supremacy Clause does not create federal rights,\nbut instead “simply ensures that the rule established\nby Congress controls.” Id. at 1213. In other words, the role\nof the Supremacy Clause is simply to “ensure that, in a\nconflict with state law, whatever Congress says goes.” Id.\nat 1212. So “if Congress does not intend for a statute to\nsupply a cause of action for its enforcement, it makes no\nsense to claim that the Supremacy Clause itself must\nprovide one.” Id. In this situation, implying a direct right\nof action under the Supremacy Clause “would effect a\ncomplete end-run around [the Court’s] implied right of\naction and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 jurisprudence.” Id. at 1213. In\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                 37\n\nthe view of the dissenting justices in Douglas, a proper\nunderstanding of the Supremacy Clause compelled\nthe conclusion that “[w]hen Congress did not intend to\nprovide a private right of action to enforce a statute\nenacted under the Spending Clause, the Supremacy\nClause does not supply one of its own force.” Id. at 1215.\n  Other than the Ninth Circuit’s decision in Douglas, few\nappellate opinions have recognized a freestanding right\nto bring a preemption action under the Supremacy\nClause, though we acknowledge that there are some.

Likelihood of Success on the § 247c(c) Preemption\n       Claim\n  By its terms, § 247c(c) does no more than authorize\nthe HHS Secretary to make federal block grants to the\nstates to help pay for programs that diagnose and monitor\nsexually transmitted diseases. The only restriction on\nthe states is that the federal money be used for the stated\npurposes. Beyond that, § 247c(c) attaches no strings to\nthe block-granted money at all. Nor has Planned Parent-\nhood identified any related federal statute or regulation\nthat expressly limits how a recipient state may disburse\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                     39\n\nthese funds. 11 Indiana’s defunding law cannot possibly\nconflict with a block-grant statute as unrestricted as\nthis one.\n   Nonetheless, the district court concluded that Indiana\nis not free to decide how to distribute its § 247c(c) funds.\nWithout discussing the statutory text at all, the court\nheld that § 247c(c) “does not suggest that states are per-\nmitted to determine eligibility criteria for the DIS\ngrants.” Planned Parenthood of Ind., 794 F.

Implied preemption comes in two types: (1) field\npreemption, which arises when the federal regulatory\nscheme is so pervasive or the federal interest so\ndominant that it may be inferred that Congress intended\nto occupy the entire legislative field; and (2) conflict\npreemption, which arises when state law conflicts with\nfederal law to the extent that “compliance with both\nfederal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,” or\nthe state law “stands as an obstacle to the accomplish-\nment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\nof Congress.” Arizona v.

Field preemption and the “impossibility” form of\nconflict preemption are not implicated here. That leaves\nonly obstacle preemption.\n  We note for starters that the district court’s view that\nIndiana may not impose eligibility conditions on DIS\nsubgrants conflicts with the basic structure and purpose\nof block-grant funding. As a general matter, federal\nblock grants devolve control to the states over the dis-\nbursement of federal funds. Of course, Congress may\nrestrict a recipient state’s disbursement of block-granted\nmoney in a variety of ways, see King v. Smith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107743\"><a href=\"/opinion/107743/king-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">309</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 333 n.34 (1968), as when the federal statute or im-\nplementing regulations expressly provide eligibility\ncriteria for subgrants from states, see N.Y.

But if the\nfederal law allows room for state-imposed eligibility\nconditions, then the recipient state is free to establish its\nown eligibility criteria unless the party asserting preemp-\ntion meets its burden of showing that the state rules\nfrustrate the federal objective. Id. (distinguishing\nbetween grants where federal law “expressly provided\n[who] would be eligible” and those where federal law\nallowed for “complementary” state conditions).\n   The district court stood this principle on its head. The\nquestion is not whether § 247c(c) expressly allows a recipi-\nent state to impose its own subgrant conditions, as the\ndistrict court seemed to think. Instead, the pertinent\nquestion is whether § 247c(c) prohibits state-imposed\neligibility conditions, either expressly or by necessary\nimplication. As we have noted, congressional and regula-\ntory silence usually defeats a claim of preemption, not the\nother way around. See Wyeth, 555 U.S. at 602-03 (Thomas,\nJ., concurring in the judgment).\n  Nothing in § 247c(c) or its implementing regulations\nrestricts Indiana’s authority over subgrants. Absent a\nconflict between state and federal law in the first place,\nstate law cannot possibly stand as an obstacle to the\naccomplishment of congressional objectives. “[S]tate law\nis displaced only ‘to the extent that it actually conflicts\nwith federal law.’ ” Dalton v.

The district court ignored this\ncritical distinction. The Title X cases have no bearing here.\n  Simply put, Indiana’s defunding law does not conflict\nwith § 247c(c) or its implementing regulations.

Unconstitutional-Conditions Doctrine\n  Having decided to order preliminary injunctive relief\non the statutory claims, the district court had no need\nto address Planned Parenthood’s unconstitutional-condi-\ntions claim.

Here,\nPlanned Parenthood’s unconstitutional-conditions claim\nnecessarily derives from a woman’s constitutional right\nto obtain an abortion. See Planned Parenthood of Se. Pa. v.\nCasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112786\"><a href=\"/opinion/112786/planned-parenthood-of-southeastern-pa-v-casey/\"><span class=\"volume\">505</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">833</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 846 (1992) (“Constitutional protection\nof the woman’s decision to terminate her pregnancy\nderives from the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment.” (emphasis added)). Under existing prece-\ndent any protection for Planned Parenthood as an\n\fNo. 11-2464                                             45\n\nabortion provider is “derivative of the woman’s posi-\ntion.” Id. at 884 (plurality opinion).\n  Two aspects of the Supreme Court’s abortion juris-\nprudence are important here. First, the Court has\nexplained that the constitutional right to obtain an\nabortion is a right against coercive governmental burdens;\nthe government may not “prohibit any woman from\nmaking the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy”\nbefore fetal viability or impose an “undue burden on a\nwoman’s ability to make this decision.” Id. at 874, 879;\nsee also Gonzales v. Carhart, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145744\"><a href=\"/opinion/145744/gonzales-v-carhart/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 146 (2007). An\n“undue burden” exists if the challenged law has the\n“purpose or effect” of placing “a substantial obstacle in\nthe path of a woman seeking an abortion before the\nfetus attains viability.” Casey, 505 U.S. at 878 (plurality\nopinion); see also Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 146.\n  Accordingly, the Court has conceptualized the right as “a\nconstitutionally protected interest ‘in making certain\nkinds of important decisions’ free from govern-\nmental compulsion.” Maher v. Roe, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109710\"><a href=\"/opinion/109710/maher-v-roe/\"><span class=\"volume\">432</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">464</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 473 (1977)\n(quoting Whalen v.

The Court\nhas explicitly rejected a neutrality-based view of abor-\ntion rights. Thus, the Court has held that although\nthe abortion right recognized in Roe v.

In Maher the\nCourt upheld Connecticut’s ban on public funding for\nnontherapeutic abortions because it “places no obsta-\ncles—absolute or otherwise—in the pregnant woman’s\npath to an abortion.” Id. at 474. The Court reaffirmed\nMaher in Harris v. McRae, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110333\"><a href=\"/opinion/110333/harris-v-mcrae/\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">297</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 314-17 (1980),\nupholding the Hyde Amendment.

Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112593\"><a href=\"/opinion/112593/rust-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991), the\nCourt rejected a challenge to federal regulations prohi-\nbiting recipients of Title X family-planning grants from\nadvocating abortion as a method of family planning\nor referring patients for abortion. Under the regulations,\ngrant recipients with abortion-related practices could\ncontinue to receive Title X money only if they segregated\ntheir abortion-related activities in a separate affiliate. Id.\nat 179-81. Rust held that the regulations did not place\nan unconstitutional condition on Title X grant recipients.\nId. at 203. This was so whether the claim was premised\non the speech rights of the providers, id. at 196-99, or\nthe abortion rights of their patients, id. at 201-03. As\nrelevant here, the Court reaffirmed the holdings of\nWebster, Harris, and Maher that “[t]he Government has no\nconstitutional duty to subsidize an activity merely\nbecause the activity is constitutionally protected and\n\fNo. 11-2464                                                  47\n\nmay validly choose to fund childbirth over abortion.” Id.\nat 201. Because the Title X regulations did not place\nan undue burden on a woman’s right to obtain an\nabortion or otherwise impose an unconstitutional condi-\ntion on grant recipients, the Court upheld the regulatory\nscheme. Id. at 203.\n   As these cases make clear, the government need not be\nneutral between abortion providers and other medical\nproviders, and this principle is particularly well-estab-\nlished in the context of governmental decisions regarding\nthe use of public funds. As long as the difference\nin treatment does not unduly burden a woman’s right\nto obtain an abortion, the government is free to treat\nabortion providers differently.\n  Applying these principles here, the unconstitutional-\nconditions claim is not likely to succeed. Planned Parent-\nhood does not argue that the loss of its block-grant\nfunding imposes an undue burden—directly or indi-\nrectly—on a woman’s right to obtain an abortion. If, as\nthe foregoing cases hold, the government’s refusal to\nsubsidize abortion does not unduly burden a woman’s\nright to obtain an abortion, then Indiana’s ban on public\nfunding of abortion providers—even for unrelated\nservices—cannot indirectly burden a woman’s right to\nobtain an abortion.1 3 See Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic &\n\n\n13\n  The unconstitutional-conditions doctrine would be\nimplicated if a state adopted a policy of withholding unrelated\npublic benefits from a woman who had an abortion.

I believe the issue of\nunconstitutional conditions should be remanded to the\ndistrict court for development of the record with respect\nto any possible imposition of a burden on access to abor-\ntions. In arguing the matter below, Planned Parenthood\nwas required to defend both its Medicaid and block-\ngrant funding. Unsurprisingly, Planned Parenthood\nfocused on Medicaid and aimed its brief primarily at the\nappropriate interpretation of § 1396a(a)(23). The § 247c(c)\nblock-grant funding received comparatively little atten-\ntion from both parties as well as numerous amici in\nthis case. I believe it is premature for this court to\naddress this issue on the present record. Plaintiffs\nmay not have fully addressed this issue below, but the\nfundamental constitutional nature of this issue should\npreclude its disposition on less than an adequate record.\n\n\n\n\n                          10-23-12\n\f</pre>",
