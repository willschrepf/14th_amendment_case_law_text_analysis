On November 7, 2000, Puerto Rico's\n\nincumbent New Progressive Party (\"NPP\") was defeated by its primary\n\nopponent,    the     Popular    Democratic     Party   (\"PDP\"),     in     the\n\ngubernatorial      election.    The   governor-elect   chose    Cesar     Rey-\n\nHernandez    to    serve   as   Secretary    of   Education    in   the    new\n\nadministration, and Rey took office on January 8, 2001.              Events,\n\nmostly occurring after Rey took office, led certain employees of\n\nthe department to file section 1983 claims, 42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n(2000), in the federal district court for Puerto Rico.\n\n            The suit was filed against Rey and others by a group of\n\ndrivers (and two of their spouses1), by a probationary attorney\n\n(Edith Perez-Posso) and by Luis Garcia-Gonzalez, an investigator\n\nwho had served the secretary in the previous administration.              Each\n\nplaintiff claimed to have suffered injury resulting from political\n\ndiscrimination in violation of the first amendment and subject to\n\nredress under section 1983. Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497\n\nU.S. 62, 74-76 (1990).\n\n            The case was tried twice.        On the first attempt, in May\n\nand June 2004, the jury deadlocked and a mistrial was declared.            In\n\na retrial in October and November 2005, the jury returned a verdict\n\nlargely in the plaintiffs' favor on November 23, 2005. Because the\n\n\n\n     1\n      The spouses filed pendent claims under articles 1802 and 1803\nof the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141-42.\nThese judgments stand or fall with the drivers' section 1983 claims\nand need no separate discussion.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fcase embraced four different \"mini trials\" with different parties\n\nand different episodes, we do no more here than summarize the\n\nverdicts as modified after post-trial motions.\n\n                 1. Seven drivers obtained verdicts\n          against Rey and Lizzette Pillich-Otero, who\n          was Rey's Assistant Secretary for Human\n          Resources, based on the drivers' transfer to a\n          central transportation pool and loss of\n          overtime pay. The awards ranged from $1 to $\n          25,000 in compensatory damages with nominal\n          awards for punitive damages.\n\n                  2.  The same seven drivers prevailed\n          against Jose Rivera-Sauri, the supervisor of\n          the office to which they were transferred, for\n          alleged acts of harassment.    Sauri was held\n          liable with Rey and Pillich with no allocation\n          of damages as between transfer and harassment\n          claims.\n\n                 3. Edith Perez-Posso, who worked as a\n          probationary attorney in the legal division of\n          the department, was awarded $11,000 plus\n          nominal punitive damages against Carmen Motta-\n          Montanez, the new director of the division who\n          had evaluated and terminated Perez-Posso.\n\n                 4.   Luis Garcia-Gonzalez was awarded\n          $10,000 in compensatory damages against Rey\n          and Motta and a further $10,000 in punitive\n          damages against Motta.    Garcia had accused\n          both of fostering administrative charges\n          against him that led to temporary suspension\n          and delayed his intended retirement.\n\n          The district court also granted equitable relief in light\n\nof the jury's findings.   Specifically, the court ordered that a\n\nplan be adopted to ensure that overtime work not be distributed to\n\ncareer drivers based on political affiliation; that Perez be\n\nreinstated; and that an admonishment be expunged from Garcia's\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\femployment file.    Plaintiffs' counsel were awarded attorneys' fees\n\nin the amount of $ 949,631.40.\n\n           All four defendants (Rey, Motta, Pillich and Sauri) now\n\nappeal, contesting the money judgments against them and the award\n\nof attorneys' fees.      The current education secretary, who has\n\nsucceeded Rey, seeks review only of the attorneys' fees awarded\n\nagainst the secretary in his official capacity.           No one has sought\n\nto overturn the equitable relief.             Before examining the four\n\ndifferent episodes one by one, we begin with the common legal\n\nframework.\n\n           The Supreme Court, in a set of decisions beginning with\n\nElrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), has declared it to be a\n\nviolation of the first amendment for government officials to take\n\nadverse actions--at least of a certain level of severity and with\n\ncertain exceptions--against other government employees based on\n\ntheir political party affiliation.2           The rationale is to avoid\n\nchilling   the   employees'    rights   of    political    free    speech   and\n\nassociation.     Rutan, 497 U.S. at 73.\n\n           Inevitably,   the    case    law   recognizes    that    political\n\naffiliation is a legitimate touchstone for policy-makers or those\n\nwho serve in a confidential capacity.          Elrod, 427 U.S. at 367-68.\n\n(Often, but not always, this category overlaps with those not\n\n\n     2\n      Elrod, 427 U.S. at 373 (patronage dismissals); Branti v.\nFinkel, 445 U.S. 507, 519-20 (1980) (same); Rutan, 497 U.S. at 65\n(promotion, transfer, recall, and hiring decisions).\n\n                                   -7-\n\fprotected by civil service laws, called \"trust\" employees in Puerto\n\nRico.)         Nor does liability attach where an adverse employment\n\naction, even though resting in part on political motives, would\n\nhave been taken anyway for permissible reasons (e.g., misconduct or\n\nincompetence).          Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,\n\n429 U.S. 274, 285-87 (1977).\n\n                A prima facie case requires evidence that \"(1) the\n\nplaintiff        and    the   defendant        belong     to    opposing      political\n\naffiliations; (2) the defendant has knowledge of the plaintiff's .\n\n.   .       affiliation;   (3)   .   .   .    a    challenged      employment    action\n\n[occurred]; and (4) . . . 'political affiliation was a substantial\n\nor motivating factor'\" behind it. Peguero-Moronta v. Santiago, 464\n\nF.3d 29, 48 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Gonzalez-de-Blasini v. Family\n\nDept., 377 F.3d 81, 85-86 (1st Cir. 2004)).                         A defendant may\n\ncontest this showing, offer a Mt. Healthy defense or both.\n\n                The usual vehicle for such claims against state actors is\n\nsection 1983, whose remedy embraces actual and (sometimes) punitive\n\ndamages, as well as attorneys' fees.3                     Because of the eleventh\n\namendment,        the    damages     claims        are   usually    brought     against\n\nindividual government officials in their personal capacities while\n\n        3\n      Carey v. Piphus, 435 U.S. 247, 255-57 (1978) (ordinary\nprinciples of compensation apply); Smith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 55-\n56 (1983) (punitive damages available against individual officers\nif their conduct was motivated by evil intent or involved reckless\nor callous indifference to constitutional rights); see also 42\nU.S.C. § 1988(b) (attorneys' fees). But see City of Newport v.\nFact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 271 (1981) (municipal\ngovernments cannot be liable for punitive damages).\n\n                                             -8-\n\fequitable relief runs against officers in their official capacities\n\n(i.e., effectively against the state entity itself). Will v. Mich.\n\nDep't of State Police, 491 U.S. 58, 66 (1989); Quern v. Jordan, 440\n\nU.S. 332, 337 (1979).\n\n            Where the sufficiency of the evidence is contested, the\n\nquestion is whether, drawing reasonable inferences and resolving\n\ncredibility in favor of the prevailing party, a rational jury could\n\nhave found in favor of the plaintiff.          Bisbal-Ramos v. City of\n\nMayaguez, 467 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir. 2006).        Other issues, such as\n\njury instructions or evidentiary rulings, are judged on appeal by\n\nthe standards applicable to the issue.            E.g., Diaz-Rivera v.\n\nRivera-Rodriguez, 377 F.3d 119, 123 (1st Cir. 2004) (evidentiary\n\nissues).\n\n            Driver claims against Rey and Pillich. Prior to December\n\n2000, all seven driver-plaintiffs worked at the Office of the\n\nSecretary, on the twelfth floor of the main Department of Education\n\nbuilding    in   San   Juan.   All    were   affiliated   with   the   NPP.\n\nPrimarily, they drove department officials, but in practice, their\n\nwork included many other duties--everything from messenger service\n\nto answering the phones--and each of them performed a substantial\n\namount of overtime work, in some cases almost doubling their base\n\nsalaries.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f          When Rey took office in January 2001, two of the seven\n\ndrivers had transferred to another facility4 but the other five\n\ntestified that they then received less work and that several PDP\n\nmembers appeared on the twelfth floor and were doing some of the\n\nduties that the seven had earlier done.      In February 2001 Rey\n\napproved a plan whereby drivers, whether assigned to the twelfth\n\nfloor or not, were re-assigned to a general pool--ultimately\n\ncomprising some 25 drivers--centrally supervised in an annex to the\n\nmain building.\n\n          The seven drivers were reassigned to this pool effective\n\nFebruary 20, 2001.    In the subsequent weeks, several more PDP\n\ndrivers were assigned work on the twelfth floor and thereafter\n\nenjoyed substantial overtime.    Various officials on the twelfth\n\nfloor often sought assignment of particular drivers who were PDP\n\nmembers and the overtime flowed to these drivers.      None of the\n\nseven driver-plaintiffs thereafter enjoyed substantial overtime.\n\n          The drivers' theory at trial was that the sequence of\n\nevents just described added up to a plan, for which Rey and Pillich\n\nwere responsible, to displace the NPP drivers on the twelfth floor\n\n(and the two brothers who had transferred to Naranjito) with PDP\n\ndrivers who would thereafter enjoy the overtime, and that the\n\nmotive was political discrimination against the former and in favor\n\n     4\n      In December 2000, for personal reasons two of the driver-\nplaintiffs, brothers Jose and Ricardo Castillo, requested a\ntransfer to a department facility in Naranjito, which is located\nabout an hour from San Juan.\n\n                                -10-\n\fof the latter.    Rey and Pillich say that the evidence for such a\n\ndetermination was lacking.\n\n           The jury could have concluded that overtime did shift\n\nfrom the five drivers who initially remained on the twelfth floor\n\nto PDP drivers and that the two brothers who had transferred (see\n\nnote 4, above) were seriously inconvenienced by their re-transfer\n\nto the pool, impairing their ability to keep non-government evening\n\njobs.   That there was no entitlement to overtime or to a particular\n\nlocation is no barrier under the precedents and their rationale.\n\nRutan, 497 U.S. at 72.\n\n           Probably the jury was also entitled to conclude that the\n\nNPP affiliation of the seven was sufficiently well known that Rey\n\nand Pillich were aware of it, cf. Peguero-Moronta, 464 F.3d at 48;\n\nperhaps, also, that after the transfer the defendants were aware\n\nthat overtime previously available to the NPP drivers now went to\n\nPDP drivers.     No one disputes that the pool plan was approved by\n\nRey and the transfers (pursuant to the plan) of all seven driver-\n\nplaintiffs were signed by Pillich.\n\n           But fatally, there is no evidence that Rey or Pillich\n\nconceived the pool plan or transfers as a means of favoring PDP\n\ndrivers over NPP drivers or that they approved or fostered the re-\n\ndirection of twelfth floor work or overtime to PDP drivers.     The\n\npool arrangements merely centralized supervision of the drivers.\n\nSo far as the record reveals, the PDP drivers achieved such\n\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\fbenefits almost entirely as a result of decisions by various other\n\ntwelfth floor officials who, on an individual basis, requested\n\nparticular drivers generally or for specific assignments.\n\n            On this record, Rey and Pillich cannot be held liable for\n\ndiscrimination by others.            Section 1983 does not impose purely\n\nsupervisory liability,             Rizzo v. Goode, 423 U.S. 362, 375-77\n\n(1976);    it   aims    at    \"persons    who   have   actually   abused   their\n\npositions of authority,\" Dunham v. Crosby, 435 F.2d 1177, 1180 (1st\n\nCir. 1970), and hence \"only persons who were directly involved in\n\nthe wrongdoing may be held liable.\"             Kostka v. Hogg, 560 F.2d 37,\n\n39 (1st Cir. 1977).           Exceptions exist but are either irrelevant\n\nhere or have not been invoked.5\n\n            True enough, a couple of PDP members showed up on the\n\ntwelfth floor early in the new administration to do some of the\n\nwork done by the NPP drivers; but there was no proof as to who had\n\nassigned them (or that they earned overtime pay).                    Three more\n\nappeared after the February transfer, but again there is no proof\n\nwho sought them.         Plaintiffs at trial pointed to two more PDP\n\ndrivers,    but   one        was   clearly   requested    by   the   Office   of\n\n     5\n      Officers can be held liable for the acts of their\nsubordinates if they engaged in \"'supervisory encouragement,\ncondonation or acquiescence' or 'gross negligence amounting to\ndeliberate indifference,'\" Lipsett v. Univ. of Puerto Rico, 864\nF.2d 881, 902 (1st Cir. 1988) (citation omitted), but that is a\ndemanding standard, see Seekamp v. Michaud, 109 F.3d 802, 808 (1st\nCir. 1997). Municipalities, but not states, can be held liable for\nacts of municipal employees only if those actions constitute a\n\"policy or custom\" of the government.    Monell v. Dep't of Soc.\nServs., 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978).\n\n                                         -12-\n\fCommunications, and another appears to have worked in San German,\n\nnot in San Juan.\n\n                  Pillich in an administrative capacity signed off for\n\novertime earned by various PDP drivers on the twelfth floor but\n\nthere is no indication that she chose the drivers.              Indeed, in some\n\ncases       the    officials   who   actually   ordered   the   overtime   were\n\nPillich's superiors in the department.            The sign-offs suggest that\n\nPillich knew that PDP drivers were doing well at the expense of NPP\n\ndrivers but not that she caused them to be so favored.\n\n                  On its face, the pool plan was a plausible piece of\n\nagency reorganization, centralizing some 25 or so drivers including\n\nboth NPP and PDP members under one office.            If Rey or Pillich had\n\ninstigated or approved the subsequent favoring of PDP members, it\n\nmight be inferred that they had conceived the plan for this\n\npurpose.          But there was no such evidence.         The officials who\n\nsystematically summoned PDP drivers for overtime might perhaps have\n\nbeen sued but they were not.\n\n                  The drivers did show, and the jury was free to believe,\n\nthat defendants were committed political partisans. More pertinent\n\nto a discrimination claim, Pillich (but not Rey) was accused of\n\nuttering two arguably hostile political remarks and the jury may\n\nhave credited the testimony (although the remarks were pretty mild\n\nby current standards).6          But this hardly shows that either Rey or\n\n        6\n      One of Pillich's two remarks dated back to 1996, and the\nother--that Pillich warned a colleague not to trust one of the\n\n                                        -13-\n\fPillich devised the pool plan to mask a discriminatory scheme to be\n\nexecuted by others.\n\n               Contrast this with Fernandez v. Chardon, 681 F.2d 42 (1st\n\nCir.    1982),    which   also    concerned    a    facially    neutral      policy\n\npromulgated by a then-Secretary of Education.                Although the policy\n\nhad the ultimate result of demoting employees of one party in favor\n\nof those belonging to the other, the \"critical evidence\" against\n\nthe then-secretary, id. at 56, comprised his comments that his\n\nparty would ensure that its political opponents would not fill any\n\nvacancies.\n\n               If the reorganization in this case was hatched as a plan\n\nto clear the decks of NPP drivers so that PDP drivers could be\n\nfavored, it was up to plaintiffs to conduct the necessary discovery\n\nand    offer    the   evidence.    Liability       without    such   proof   would\n\neffectively preclude any post-election reorganization that happens\n\nto affect adversely employees connected to the previously dominant\n\nparty.    Cf. Marin-Piazza v. Aponte-Roque, 873 F.2d 432, 434 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).       The verdicts for the drivers (and for the spouses)\n\ncannot stand as against Rey and Pillich.\n\n               Driver claims against Sauri.          The claim of the seven\n\ndrivers against Sauri is this: that after their transfer to his\n\npool he harassed them because of their political affiliation--\n\n\n\ndrivers because he was a remnant of the former administration--is\nnot particularly probative of anything beyond her knowledge of his\npolitical affiliation.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fspecifically, by subjecting them but not PDP drivers to humiliating\n\nroll calls, by following them to the cafeteria on their breaks, by\n\nselectively   blaming    them   when   things     went   amiss,    by   falsely\n\naltering their time sheets and by forcing them to sit inside an\n\noffice that was too small.\n\n          Actions of informal harassment, as opposed to formal\n\nemployment actions like transfers or demotions, can be the basis\n\nfor   first   amendment     claims     if   the    motive    was    political\n\ndiscrimination; but this is so only if the discriminatory acts are\n\n\"sufficiently severe to cause reasonably hardy individuals to\n\ncompromise their political beliefs and associations in favor of the\n\nprevailing party.\"      Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque, 889 F.2d\n\n1209, 1217 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc).\n\n          This threshold is implicit in the rationale for granting\n\nRutan protection--to safeguard political speech and association--\n\nand distinguishes \"the wheat\" of real impairments from \"the chaff\n\nof minor irritants and frustrations\" in any workplace.             Agosto-de-\n\nFeliciano, 889 F.2d at 1214.         An ambiguous footnote in Rutan, 497\n\nU.S. at 76 n.8, could imply that even withholding of a birthday\n\nparty might be enough; but Rutan's text does not so suggest and our\n\ncases have \"continued to apply the Agosto-de-Feliciano standard,\"\n\nBisbal-Ramos, 467 F.3d at 22.7\n\n      7\n      Miranda Otero v.

There was no proof that Sauri ordered\n\nselective roll calls; they were conducted by a secretary and ceased\n\nwithin days after complaints were made.         The alleged casting of\n\nblame by Sauri concerns one offhand, isolated, sarcastic comment by\n\nSauri that the Castillo brothers would know the location of a\n\nmissing key; the drivers also testified that Sauri tended to\n\nsuspect them whenever a car broke down, but no specific incidents\n\nwere described.\n\n          The room assigned to the drivers waiting for tasks may\n\nwell have been too small but it was shared by all drivers, PDP and\n\nNPP alike.

As\n\nfor following the drivers to the cafeteria, Sauri agrees that he\n\ndid so on occasion because he was concerned that the seven drivers,\n\nor at least some of them, were abusing their breaks.                      None of this\n\nadds up to culpable harassment by Sauri.\n\n            Turning    to    the    time    sheets,         false    alterations       for\n\nimproper    purposes   would       be    close    to   fraud,       and   the   economic\n\nconsequences    for    the   drivers        could      be    serious.       But    Sauri\n\napparently reviewed time sheets as part of his job and made\n\nadjustments both for and against the seven drivers; the evidence is\n\nvery muddled but we are given no basis to infer that his changes\n\nwere deliberately false or formed a suspicious pattern.\n\n            Wrongdoing      might       perhaps   have      been    inferred      if   the\n\ndriver-plaintiffs had shown that the changes adversely affected\n\ntheir pay or tenure.         But it appears from the record that the\n\ndrivers had fixed salaries for their basic work and that Sauri\n\nconfirmed on the time sheets that they had satisfied all their work\n\nrequirements.     The drivers countered with only the vague and\n\nundetailed suggestion that somehow their benefits might have been\n\naffected.    This is hardly enough.\n\n            Unlike the verdict against Rey and Pillich, the verdict\n\nagainst Sauri has no single glaring flaw, and we are reluctant to\n\nsecond guess a jury on a confusing record.                      But even resolving\n\ndoubts in favor of the plaintiffs, what remains--after the hopeless\n\n\n\n                                          -17-\n\fallegations are stripped away--is just too thin to support a\n\nfinding   of    liability.   Allowing     a   judgment   to   rest    on    this\n\ncollection of complaints would \"trivialize the First Amendment.\"\n\nBart v. Telford, 677 F.2d 622, 625 (7th Cir. 1982).\n\n            Perez' claim against Motta.       Perez' claim is by far the\n\nmost straightforward discrimination claim presented.            Perez, then\n\nserving as a probationary employee doing legal work, says that\n\nMotta, the new department head and a PDP supporter, gave Perez a\n\nfailing evaluation because of Perez' affiliation with the NPP.               On\n\nappeal, Motta says that the evidence was insufficient.               We think\n\nthat the case is close but that the jury was within bounds in\n\nimposing liability.\n\n            Perez testified that she had been given a favorable\n\nevaluation prior to the PDP election, that Motta took over the\n\nlegal department in January 2001, and that Perez received no work\n\nfor about two weeks thereafter.     Then she got a batch of contracts\n\nto review, which took about three days, and thereafter got no new\n\nassignments until February 27, when Motta gave her a new evaluation\n\nranking   her    unsatisfactory.    In    consequence,    Perez      lost   her\n\nposition.\n\n            Perez also claimed that she had sought repeatedly to\n\ncontact Motta during the intervening weeks, first by leaving\n\nmessages with her secretary and later by slipping a memo under\n\nMotta's office door.     Perez said that her evaluation meeting with\n\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fMotta lasted only five minutes, while her prior evaluation meeting\n\nlasted over an hour.   Perez also alleged that Motta had made two\n\npolitically charged remarks (during a single incident) prior to the\n\ngeneral election.\n\n          Motta   responded   by   giving   detailed   reasons   for   the\n\nevaluation: that Perez erroneously cited statutes, did not accept\n\nconstructive criticism, was frequently absent from the office\n\nwithout explanation, and did not fulfill tasks that she was asked\n\nto perform.   Motta denied making the hostile remarks attributed to\n\nher, claimed she did meet with Perez, and explained that Perez\n\nreceived work not from Motta but whenever contracts to review were\n\nforwarded by others.\n\n          On appeal, Motta argues that there was no direct evidence\n\nthat she was even aware of Perez' party affiliation, but based on\n\nPerez' testimony that she spoke openly about her political views\n\nand sat in the NPP portion of the de facto segregated cafeteria, a\n\nreasonable jury could infer that Motta, who worked alongside Perez\n\nfor about six months, was aware of Perez' affiliation.                 See\n\nPeguero-Moronta, 464 F.3d at 48.\n\n          The evidence that Motta gave an unduly low recommendation\n\nfor political reasons is more debatable. We must assume that Motta\n\nmade the two remarks that Perez reported.8      Worse still for Motta,\n\n     8\n      The first of these--that if someone put a bomb in the\nDepartment of Education, half of the NPP electorate would disappear\n--is not highly probative of likely discrimination; the second--\nthat if the PDP were successful in the elections then Motta would\n\n                                   -19-\n\fstronger motive evidence as to Motta's involvement with Garcia\n\n(which we discuss next) resulted not only in liability but also\n\nsubstantial punitive damages against Motta.       The jury was free to\n\ndraw   inferences   from   this   episode    as   well--including   the\n\nparticularly damaging testimony by Garcia that Motta indicated her\n\nintent to \"fire all the NPPs\" in the office.\n\n          That Perez was given a favorable evaluation immediately\n\nbefore the change in administration also could raise doubts about\n\nthe fairness of Motta's evaluation and therefore its motive,\n\nalthough this inference is tempered by the circumstances: in\n\nparticular, Perez' positive evaluation was rendered under the NPP\n\nregime on December 31, 2000, which was a Sunday, New Year's Eve,\n\nand only a few days before Rey began his term.        Still, the jury\n\ncould have found that the earlier evaluation was not a white-wash.\n\n          The most troubling concern about the verdict is that\n\nMotta's explanation for her evaluation is coherent and much of it\n\nnot directly contradicted.   But the jury was not obliged to credit\n\nMotta's good faith or veracity.          In addition to Perez' prior\n\nfavorable evaluation and the damaging motive evidence against\n\nMotta, the two contradicted each other directly as to whether Motta\n\nhad made the two remarks and whether she had evaded Perez; and the\n\njury may have been doubtful about Motta's explanation for Perez'\n\nprolonged idleness since Motta headed the office.\n\n\nbe \"chopping heads down\"--is more telling in relation to what\nhappened to Perez.\n\n                                  -20-\n\f            Thus, unlike the case of the drivers against Sauri, this\n\nclaim was about a concrete job loss and the dispute here was\n\nlargely about whom to believe.     Here our deference to the jury is\n\nat its zenith: they are closer to the gritty detail and see and\n\nhear the witnesses.    Rodriguez-Marin v. Rivera-Gonzalez, 438 F.3d\n\n72, 75 (1st Cir. 2006).   Neither story was implausible nor clearly\n\nconfirmed (or negated) by objective evidence, and so the jury's\n\njudgment as to who told the truth must stand.\n\n            Garcia's claim against Rey and Motta.     Garcia's claim is\n\nthat Rey and Motta fostered administrative charges against him\n\nbecause of Garcia's political support of the NPP.          Garcia held a\n\ntrust position and, when the new administration took over, Rey\n\nnotified Garcia that he would be returned to his career position as\n\nan administrative complaints investigator.          Trust positions are\n\noften   unprotected   under   Rutan;    anyway,   Garcia   does   not   now\n\nchallenge his re-assignment.\n\n            Rather, at trial in the district court, Garcia testified\n\nthat on the day he received the letter from Rey removing him from\n\nhis trust position, he encountered Motta--whom he had long known--\n\nwho said that she was going to fire all the NPP supporters and that\n\nshe was going to fire him \"and take you off your motor bike so you\n\nwon't do any more politics.\"     Garcia said that Motta repeated the\n\nthreat later that day. Thereafter, Garcia tendered his resignation\n\nto Motta.    In response, Garcia received a letter on February 13,\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f2001, from Rey saying that Garcia could not resign because of a\n\npending harassment complaint filed against him by another employee.\n\nA   previous    Secretary    of    Education    had   found    \"no   cause\"   to\n\ndiscipline Garcia for \"sexual harassment\" but it is unclear whether\n\nthe   earlier     complaint       remained     pending    on   other   charges\n\n(specifically, labor harassment).            Later Rey notified Garcia that\n\nhe intended to pursue the charges.\n\n            Thereafter, Rey signed a letter adding an additional\n\ncharge of insubordination, and Garcia was suspended with pay\n\npending a final disciplinary decision.            Both of the two \"intent\"\n\nletters appear to have been typed by one of Motta's secretaries.\n\nAfter a hearing before an examiner, who concluded that some but not\n\nall of the charges had basis in fact, Garcia was terminated on July\n\n16, 2002.\n\n            After Garcia brought his federal claim, the charges were\n\nsettled   within    the     administrative      process   on   terms   largely\n\n(although not wholly) favorable to Garcia: Garcia accepted a\n\nreprimand on one of the charges, was allowed to resign, and\n\nreceived full pay for the period between his termination and\n\nultimate resignation. As part of the settlement, Garcia agreed not\n\nto seek reinstatement or back pay in federal court but otherwise\n\nreserved his federal claim:\n\n            The agreements contained in this document do\n            not constitute a waiver of the claim filed by\n            the Appellant before the Federal District\n            Court of San Juan, Puerto Rico, except that\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\f           which regards the compensation for the wages\n           not received, as stated previously, and the\n           reinstatement to the position from which he\n           resigned, however, it does constitute a waiver\n           of any other cause of action that the\n           Appellant may have against the Agency, its\n           officers or employees in their official\n           capacity.\n\n           On this appeal, remarkably Rey and Motta first challenge\n\nthe verdict against them on the ground that the claim is barred by\n\nres judicata.   The res judicata argument rests on the assertion\n\nthat the settlement waiver provision block-quoted above disposed of\n\nthe present claim against Rey and Motta.               Res judicata is a\n\ndoubtful label for the issue,9 but the label does not matter; the\n\nquestion is the scope of the waiver provision.\n\n           The quoted language in the agreement makes clear that\n\nGarcia's   federal   court   claim    against   Rey   and   Motta   in   their\n\npersonal capacities was neither settled nor waived.            We find hard\n\nto understand, and impossible to accept, defendants' argument that\n\nthe agreement only purports to preserve claims unrelated to the\n\nadministrative charges. It reserves \"the claim\" filed by Garcia in\n\nfederal court and, although he offered multiple theories, the\n\n\n\n     9\n      Whether and when res judicata operates in administrative\nproceedings is complicated; so, too, the question when a settlement\nof administrative proceeding has res judicata effect.

Thomas, 525 U.S. 1098 (1999); see also\nUniv. of Tenn. v. Elliott, 478 U.S. 788, 799 (1986). See generally\n18B Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal Practice & Procedure:\nJurisdiction 2d § 4471.3 (2002).\n\n                                     -23-\n\fmisuse of the administrative proceedings was encompassed by his\n\nfederal complaint.\n\n           This argument is followed in the defendants' brief by\n\nfour paragraphs which mingle what might be a defense on the merits\n\nif it had been developed--\"Garcia failed to present evidence that\n\nthe actions of Rey or Motta were not reasonable with regards to the\n\ninitiation of the administrative proceedings nor did political\n\nanimus exist[].\"--with assertions that \"they are both entitled to\n\nqualified immunity.\"\n\n           In order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence,\n\nthe defendants would need to identify the weak elements in Garcia's\n\ncase, substantially develop the record evidence on the key issues,\n\nprovide relevant background and offer a serious analysis of the\n\ninferences that the jury might or might not reasonably have drawn.\n\nVirtually none of this is furnished in the brief--indeed, the four\n\nparagraphs are primarily directed to urging qualified immunity--a\n\nclaim to which we will return.\n\n           The failure to make a serious sufficiency argument may\n\nhave been a mistake--at least as to Rey.       That Rey formally caused\n\nthe charges against Garcia is patent; but, of course, he may merely\n\nhave followed procedures and taken advice from lawyers instead of\n\nacting from an improper motive.           Nor did he make inflammatory\n\nthreats   from   which   a   discriminatory   intent   could   readily   be\n\n\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\finferred.      Garcia's evidence of Rey's animus (e.g., that Rey\n\nappointed PDP partisans) is unimpressive.\n\n            The case against Motta is stronger but not airtight.\n\nGarcia testified about her threats (the award of punitive damages\n\nsuggests this was believed).       But all that links her directly to\n\nGarcia's travails are her secretary's initials on Rey's letters and\n\nMotta disclaimed involvement.       Yet the jury may not have believed\n\nher and, given her position and legal training, it might be\n\ninferred that she was Rey's natural advisor on whether charges\n\nshould be brought.\n\n            But the defendants' failure to develop the sufficiency\n\nissue on appeal and supply the necessary information is a fatal\n\nforfeiture.    Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n, 142 F.3d 26, 43\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).     Because of this, we cannot be sure that our own\n\ninitial hesitation has fairly captured the evidence on both sides.\n\nIn addition, the failure seriously to brief the sufficiency issue\n\nmeant   that   Garcia   was   handicapped   in   his   efforts    to   respond\n\nalthough he did make more of an effort than the defendants' brief\n\non this issue deserved.\n\n            Defendants'   four   paragraphs      do   more   clearly   make   a\n\ndifferent and simpler argument, namely, that qualified immunity\n\nprotects    them,   whatever   their   subjective      motives,   because     a\n\n\"reasonable\" official would have thought that there was a basis for\n\nthe charges.     Even here, background information is not supplied,\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\fbut in all events in political discrimination cases--where wrongful\n\nmotive is an element of the claim--the case law has regularly\n\nrejected this objective-reasonableness argument.10\n\n             Rey also disputes two of the district court's rulings\n\nadmitting evidence that Rey wanted excluded under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 403.       That rule requires district judges to weigh the\n\nprobative value of the challenged evidence against the unfair\n\nprejudice that would result if it were admitted.                        We review the\n\ndistrict judge's evidentiary rulings under Rule 403 for abuse of\n\ndiscretion. United States v. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n             At trial, Rey testified that beyond casting his vote for\n\nthe   PDP,   he   had   no   connection     to    the   party      or    to    partisan\n\nactivities.        He   claimed    not   to      be   aware   of    the       political\n\naffiliations of the plaintiffs, including Garcia--whom he removed\n\nfrom his trust position and reinstated as a career employee.                         On\n\ncross examination, plaintiffs' counsel was permitted to question\n\nRey about the trust officials he had appointed upon taking office;\n\nof course, they were revealed to be PDP supporters, although Rey\n\ndenied knowing their affiliations.\n\n             On   appeal,    Rey   argues     that    because      he    was    legally\n\nentitled to prefer PDP members when selecting these senior policy-\n\n      10\n      Rivera-Torres v. Ortiz Velez, 341 F.3d 86, 96-97 (1st Cir.\n2003), cert. denied, 541 U.S. 972 (2004); Feliciano-Angulo v.\nRivera-Cruz, 858 F.2d 40, 45-47 (1st Cir. 1988). But see Crawford-\nEl v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 611 (1998) (Scalia, J., dissenting).\n\n                                      -26-\n\fmaking officials, allowing that line of questioning was error. But\n\nRey   also   claimed     that     he    was   entirely     independent    of   party\n\npolitics, and the questions were quite relevant in impeaching Rey\n\nas to his own (seemingly unnecessary) defense.                      In short, the\n\nquestions went directly to Rey's own characterization of his\n\nrelationship to partisan politics.\n\n             This is also true of evidence that Garcia adduced from\n\nPillich,     who   was   called    as    a    hostile    witness.      Pillich    was\n\nquestioned about a paragraph in her affidavit in another case that\n\nelaborated on her knowledge of Rey's participation and involvement\n\nin PDP partisan activities. Rey says that Pillich's allegations in\n\nthe prior case were not \"resolved or adjudicated\"; but it was for\n\nthe   jury    to   evaluate     whether       Pillich's    testimony     should    be\n\nbelieved.\n\n             Attorneys' Fees. Because attorneys' fees depend in large\n\npart on which parties won the case and the extent of their victory,\n\nsee Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 434-37 (1983), they will\n\nnow have to be recalculated, but we address now two concerns raised\n\nby defendants that are unlikely to disappear on remand.\n\n             Part of the fees calculation is the selection of an\n\nappropriate hourly rate for each attorney.                 Rates should be \"those\n\nprevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of\n\nreasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.\"                   Blum v.\n\nStenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 n.11 (1984).                 Defendants argue that the\n\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fhourly rates accepted by the district judge were excessive under\n\nthat standard.    But we review fee awards only for \"manifest abuse\n\nof discretion.\" Diaz-Rivera v. Rivera-Rodriguez, 377 F.3d 119, 124\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            The order granting attorneys' fees cites precisely the\n\nfactors that the Supreme Court has deemed relevant.           Defendants\n\npoint to prior cases that have authorized lower rates, but each\n\ncase is unique and rates inflate over time; indeed, the district\n\ncourt reduced the total award by two percent because much work had\n\noccurred in earlier years.       The rates in this case do not fall\n\noutside the trial court's \"extremely broad\" discretion. Lipsett v.\n\nBlanco, 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n            Defendants also argue that the documentation provided by\n\nplaintiffs' counsel was not contemporaneous. Counsel never claimed\n\nit was; the exhibit to their motion said it was \"prepared from\n\ncontemporaneous time records,\" adjusted to filter out work done for\n\nunsuccessful plaintiffs or on unsuccessful claims. If defendants\n\nsuspected    tampering   or   inaccuracy,   they   should   have   sought\n\ndiscovery.    Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d\n\n288, 297 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            The judgments in favor of the drivers (and spouses) are\n\nreversed; those in favor of Perez and Garcia are affirmed.           The\n\naward of counsel fees is vacated and remanded for reconsideration\n\n\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\fin light of the reversal of the judgments as to the drivers.   All\n\nparties will bear their own costs and attorneys' fees on appeal.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -29-\n\f",

The governor-elect chose Cesar Rey-Hernandez to serve as Secretary of Education in the new administration, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> and Rey took office on January 8, 2001. Events, mostly occurring after Rey took office, led certain employees of the department to file section 1983 claims, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000), in the federal district court for Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>The suit was filed against Rey and others by a group of drivers (and two of their spouses<sup>[1]</sup>), by a probationary attorney (Edith Perez-Posso) and by Luis Garcia-Gonzalez, an investigator who had served the secretary in the previous administration. Each plaintiff claimed to have suffered injury resulting from political discrimination in violation of the first amendment and subject to redress under section 1983. <i>Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill.,</i> 497 U.S. 62, 74-76, 110 S.Ct. 2729, 111 L.Ed.2d 52 (1990).</p>\n<p>The case was tried twice. On the first attempt, in May and June 2004, the jury deadlocked and a mistrial was declared. In a retrial in October and November 2005, the jury returned a verdict largely in the plaintiffs' favor on November 23, 2005. Because the case embraced four different \"mini trials\" with different parties and different episodes, we do no more here than summarize the verdicts as modified after post-trial motions.</p>\n<blockquote>1. Seven drivers obtained verdicts against Rey and Lizzette Pillich-Otero, who was Rey's Assistant Secretary for Human Resources, based on the drivers' transfer to a central transportation pool and loss of overtime pay. The awards ranged from $1 to $25,000 in compensatory damages with nominal awards for punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. The same seven drivers prevailed against Jose Rivera-Sauri, the supervisor of the office to which they were transferred, for alleged acts of harassment. Sauri was held liable with Rey and Pillich with no allocation of damages as between transfer and harassment claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. Edith Perez-Posso, who worked as a probationary attorney in the legal division of the department, was awarded $11,000 plus nominal punitive damages against Carmen Motta-Montanez, the new director of the division who had evaluated and terminated Perez-Posso.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. Luis Garcia-Gonzalez was awarded $10,000 in compensatory damages against Rey and Motta and a further $10,000 in punitive damages against Motta. Garcia had accused both of fostering administrative charges against him that led to temporary suspension and delayed his intended retirement.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court also granted equitable relief in light of the jury's findings. Specifically, the court ordered that a plan be adopted to ensure that overtime work not be distributed to career drivers based on political affiliation; that Perez be reinstated; and that an admonishment be expunged from Garcia's employment file. Plaintiffs' counsel were awarded attorneys' fees in the amount of $949,631.40.</p>\n<p>All four defendants (Rey, Motta, Pillich and Sauri) now appeal, contesting the money judgments against them and the award of attorneys' fees. The current education secretary, who has succeeded Rey, seeks review only of the attorneys' fees awarded against the secretary in his official capacity. No one has sought to overturn the equitable relief. Before examining the four different episodes one by one, we begin with the common legal framework.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*39</span> The Supreme Court, in a set of decisions beginning with <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), has declared it to be a violation of the first amendment for government officials to take adverse actionsat least of a certain level of severity and with certain exceptionsagainst other government employees based on their political party affiliation.<sup>[2]</sup> The rationale is to avoid chilling the employees' rights of political free speech and association. <i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 73, 110 S.Ct. 2729.</p>\n<p>Inevitably, the case law recognizes that political affiliation is a legitimate touch-stone for policy-makers or those who serve in a confidential capacity. <i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 367-68, 496 S.Ct. 2673. (Often, but not always, this category overlaps with those not protected by civil service laws, called \"trust\" employees in Puerto Rico.) Nor does liability attach where an adverse employment action, even though resting in part on political motives, would have been taken anyway for permissible reasons (<i>e.g.,</i> misconduct or incompetence). <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 285-87, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977).</p>\n<p>A prima facie case requires evidence that \"(1) the plaintiff and the defendant belong to opposing political affiliations; (2) the defendant has knowledge of the plaintiff's . . . affiliation; (3) . . . a challenged employment action [occurred]; and (4) . . . `political affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor'\" behind it. <i>Peguero-Moronta v. Santiago,</i> 464 F.3d 29, 48 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Gonzalez-De-Blasini v. Family Dept.,</i> 377 F.3d 81, 85-86 (1st Cir.2004)). A defendant may contest this showing, offer a <i>Mt. Healthy</i> defense or both.</p>\n<p>The usual vehicle for such claims against state actors is section 1983, whose remedy embraces actual and (sometimes) punitive damages, as well as attorneys' fees.<sup>[3]</sup> Because of the eleventh amendment, the damages claims are usually brought against individual government officials in their personal capacities while equitable relief runs against officers in their official capacities (<i>i.e.,</i> effectively against the state entity itself). <i>Will v. Mich. Dep't of State Police,</i> 491 U.S. 58, 66, 109 S.Ct. 2304, 105 L.Ed.2d 45 (1989); <i>Quern v. Jordan,</i> 440 U.S. 332, 337, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979).</p>\n<p>Where the sufficiency of the evidence is contested, the question is whether, drawing reasonable inferences and resolving credibility in favor of the prevailing party, a rational jury could have found in favor of the plaintiff. <i>Bisbal-Ramos v. City of Mayaguez,</i> 467 F.3d 16, 22 (1st Cir.2006). Other issues, such as jury instructions or evidentiary rulings, are judged on appeal by the standards applicable to the issue. <i>E.g., </i><i>Diaz-Rivera v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> 377 F.3d 119, 123 (1st Cir.2004) (evidentiary issues).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*40</span> <i>Driver claims against Rey and Pillich.</i> Prior to December 2000, all seven driver-plaintiffs worked at the Office of the Secretary, on the twelfth floor of the main Department of Education building in San Juan. All were affiliated with the NPP. Primarily, they drove department officials, but in practice, their work included many other dutieseverything from messenger service to answering the phonesand each of them performed a substantial amount of overtime work, in some cases almost doubling their base salaries.</p>\n<p>When Rey took office in January 2001, two of the seven drivers had transferred to another facility<sup>[4]</sup> but the other five testified that they then received less work and that several PDP members appeared on the twelfth floor and were doing some of the duties that the seven had earlier done. In February 2001 Rey approved a plan whereby drivers, whether assigned to the twelfth floor or not, were re-assigned to a general poolultimately comprising some 25 driverscentrally supervised in an annex to the main building.</p>\n<p>The seven drivers were reassigned to this pool effective February 20, 2001. In the subsequent weeks, several more PDP drivers were assigned work on the twelfth floor and thereafter enjoyed substantial overtime. Various officials on the twelfth floor often sought assignment of particular drivers who were PDP members and the overtime flowed to these drivers. None of the seven driver-plaintiffs thereafter enjoyed substantial overtime.</p>\n<p>The drivers' theory at trial was that the sequence of events just described added up to a plan, for which Rey and Pillich were responsible, to displace the NPP drivers on the twelfth floor (and the two brothers who had transferred to Naranjito) with PDP drivers who would thereafter enjoy the overtime, and that the motive was political discrimination against the former and in favor of the latter. Rey and Pillich say that the evidence for such a determination was lacking.</p>\n<p>The jury could have concluded that overtime did shift from the five drivers who initially remained on the twelfth floor to PDP drivers and that the two brothers who had transferred (see note 4, above) were seriously inconvenienced by their re-transfer to the pool, impairing their ability to keep non-government evening jobs. That there was no entitlement to overtime or to a particular location is no barrier under the precedents and their rationale. <i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 72, 110 S.Ct. 2729.</p>\n<p>Probably the jury was also entitled to conclude that the NPP affiliation of the seven was sufficiently well known that Rey and Pillich were aware of it, <i>cf. </i><i>Peguero-Moronta,</i> 464 F.3d at 48; perhaps, also, that after the transfer the defendants were aware that overtime previously available to the NPP drivers now went to PDP drivers. No one disputes that the pool plan was approved by Rey and the transfers (pursuant to the plan) of all seven driver-plaintiffs were signed by Pillich.</p>\n<p>But fatally, there is no evidence that Rey or Pillich conceived the pool plan or transfers as a means of favoring PDP drivers over NPP drivers or that they approved or fostered the re-direction of twelfth floor work or overtime to PDP drivers. The pool arrangements merely centralized supervision of the drivers. So far as the record reveals, the PDP drivers achieved such benefits almost entirely as a result of decisions by various other twelfth floor officials who, on an individual basis, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> requested particular drivers generally or for specific assignments.</p>\n<p>On this record, Rey and Pillich cannot be held liable for discrimination by others. Section 1983 does not impose purely supervisory liability, <i>Rizzo v. Goode,</i> 423 U.S. 362, 375-77, 96 S.Ct. 598, 46 L.Ed.2d 561 (1976); it aims at \"persons who have actually abused their positions of authority,\" <i>Dunham v. Crosby,</i> 435 F.2d 1177, 1180 (1st Cir.1970), and hence \"only persons who were directly involved in the wrongdoing may be held liable.\" <i>Kostka v. Hogg,</i> 560 F.2d 37, 39 (1st Cir.1977). Exceptions exist but are either irrelevant here or have not been invoked.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>True enough, a couple of PDP members showed up on the twelfth floor early in the new administration to do some of the work done by the NPP drivers; but there was no proof as to who had assigned them (or that they earned overtime pay). Three more appeared after the February transfer, but again there is no proof who sought them. Plaintiffs at trial pointed to two more PDP drivers, but one was clearly requested by the Office of Communications, and another appears to have worked in San German, not in San Juan.</p>\n<p>Pillich in an administrative capacity signed off for overtime earned by various PDP drivers on the twelfth floor but there is no indication that she chose the drivers. Indeed, in some cases the officials who actually ordered the overtime were Pillich's superiors in the department. The sign-offs suggest that Pillich knew that PDP drivers were doing well at the expense of NPP drivers but not that she caused them to be so favored.</p>\n<p>On its face, the pool plan was a plausible piece of agency reorganization, centralizing some 25 or so drivers including both NPP and PDP members under one office. If Rey or Pillich had instigated or approved the subsequent favoring of PDP members, it might be inferred that they had conceived the plan for this purpose. But there was no such evidence. The officials who systematically summoned PDP drivers for overtime might perhaps have been sued but they were not.</p>\n<p>The drivers did show, and the jury was free to believe, that defendants were committed political partisans. More pertinent to a discrimination claim, Pillich (but not Rey) was accused of uttering two arguably hostile political remarks and the jury may have credited the testimony (although the remarks were pretty mild by current standards).<sup>[6]</sup> But this hardly shows that either Rey or Pillich devised the pool plan to mask a discriminatory scheme to be executed by others.</p>\n<p>Contrast this with <i>Fernandez v. Chardon,</i> 681 F.2d 42 (1st Cir.1982), which also concerned a facially neutral policy promulgated by a then-Secretary of Education. Although the policy had the ultimate result of demoting employees of one party in favor of those belonging to the other, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> \"critical evidence\" against the then-secretary, <i>id.</i> at 56, comprised his comments that his party would ensure that its political opponents would not fill any vacancies.</p>\n<p>If the reorganization in this case was hatched as a plan to clear the decks of NPP drivers so that PDP drivers could be favored, it was up to plaintiffs to conduct the necessary discovery and offer the evidence. Liability without such proof would effectively preclude any post-election reorganization that happens to affect adversely employees connected to the previously dominant party. <i>Cf. </i><i>Marin-Piazza v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 873 F.2d 432, 434 (1st Cir. 1989). The verdicts for the drivers (and for the spouses) cannot stand as against Rey and Pillich.</p>\n<p><i>Driver claims against Sauri.</i> The claim of the seven drivers against Sauri is this: that after their transfer to his pool he harassed them because of their political affiliationspecifically, by subjecting them but not PDP drivers to humiliating roll calls, by following them to the cafeteria on their breaks, by selectively blaming them when things went amiss, by falsely altering their time sheets and by forcing them to sit inside an office that was too small.</p>\n<p>Actions of informal harassment, as opposed to formal employment actions like transfers or demotions, can be the basis for first amendment claims if the motive was political discrimination; but this is so only if the discriminatory acts are \"sufficiently severe to cause reasonably hardy individuals to compromise their political beliefs and associations in favor of the prevailing party.\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> 889 F.2d 1209, 1217 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).</p>\n<p>This threshold is implicit in the rationale for granting <i>Rutan</i> protectionto safeguard political speech and association and distinguishes \"the wheat\" of real impairments from \"the chaff of minor irritants and frustrations\" in any workplace. <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1214. An ambiguous footnote in <i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 76 n. 8, 110 S.Ct. 2729, could imply that even withholding of a birthday party might be enough; but <i>Rutan</i>'s text does not so suggest and our cases have \"continued to apply the <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano</i> standard,\" <i>Bisbal-Ramos,</i> 467 F.3d at 22.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>If everything alleged by the drivers was supported by the record, we would agree such actions could, taken together, be deemed by a jury sufficiently weighty to discourage political affiliation or speech; and then, if improper motivation were expressed or reasonably inferred, a first amendment claim would be made out although it is puzzling how such harassment could have caused substantial economic damages unless altering the time sheets caused a loss of pay (for which no proof was offered).</p>\n<p>But the drivers' case substantially weakens as one examines the evidence. There was no proof that Sauri ordered selective roll calls; they were conducted by a secretary and ceased within days after complaints were made. The alleged casting of blame by Sauri concerns <i>one</i> offhand, isolated, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> sarcastic comment by Sauri that the Castillo brothers would know the location of a missing key; the drivers also testified that Sauri tended to suspect them whenever a car broke down, but no specific incidents were described.</p>\n<p>The room assigned to the drivers waiting for tasks may well have been too small but it was shared by all drivers, PDP and NPP alike. The district judge found no evidence to suggest that Sauri discriminated with respect to the allocation of duties. As for following the drivers to the cafeteria, Sauri agrees that he did so on occasion because he was concerned that the seven drivers, or at least some of them, were abusing their breaks. None of this adds up to culpable harassment by Sauri.</p>\n<p>Turning to the time sheets, false alterations for improper purposes would be close to fraud, and the economic consequences for the drivers could be serious. But Sauri apparently reviewed time sheets as part of his job and made adjustments both for and against the seven drivers; the evidence is very muddled but we are given no basis to infer that his changes were deliberately false or formed a suspicious pattern.</p>\n<p>Wrongdoing might perhaps have been inferred if the driver-plaintiffs had shown that the changes adversely affected their pay or tenure. But it appears from the record that the drivers had fixed salaries for their basic work and that Sauri confirmed on the time sheets that they had satisfied all their work requirements. The drivers countered with only the vague and undetailed suggestion that somehow their benefits might have been affected. This is hardly enough.</p>\n<p>Unlike the verdict against Rey and Pillich, the verdict against Sauri has no single glaring flaw, and we are reluctant to second guess a jury on a confusing record. But even resolving doubts in favor of the plaintiffs, what remainsafter the hopeless allegations are stripped awayis just too thin to support a finding of liability. Allowing a judgment to rest on this collection of complaints would \"trivialize the First Amendment.\" <i>Bart v. Telford,</i> 677 F.2d 622, 625 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p><i>Perez' claim against Motta.</i> Perez' claim is by far the most straightforward discrimination claim presented. Perez, then serving as a probationary employee doing legal work, says that Motta, the new department head and a PDP supporter, gave Perez a failing evaluation because of Perez' affiliation with the NPP. On appeal, Motta says that the evidence was insufficient. We think that the case is close but that the jury was within bounds in imposing liability.</p>\n<p>Perez testified that she had been given a favorable evaluation prior to the PDP election, that Motta took over the legal department in January 2001, and that Perez received no work for about two weeks thereafter. Then she got a batch of contracts to review, which took about three days, and thereafter got no new assignments until February 27, when Motta gave her a new evaluation ranking her unsatisfactory. In consequence, Perez lost her position.</p>\n<p>Perez also claimed that she had sought repeatedly to contact Motta during the intervening weeks, first by leaving messages with her secretary and later by slipping a memo under Motta's office door. Perez said that her evaluation meeting with Motta lasted only five minutes, while her prior evaluation meeting lasted over an hour. Perez also alleged that Motta had made two politically charged remarks (during a single incident) prior to the general election.</p>\n<p>Motta responded by giving detailed reasons for the evaluation: that Perez erroneously <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> cited statutes, did not accept constructive criticism, was frequently absent from the office without explanation, and did not fulfill tasks that she was asked to perform. Motta denied making the hostile remarks attributed to her, claimed she did meet with Perez, and explained that Perez received work not from Motta but whenever contracts to review were forwarded by others.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Motta argues that there was no direct evidence that she was even aware of Perez' party affiliation, but based on Perez' testimony that she spoke openly about her political views and sat in the NPP portion of the de facto segregated cafeteria, a reasonable jury could infer that Motta, who worked alongside Perez for about six months, was aware of Perez' affiliation. <i>See </i><i>Peguero-Moronta,</i> 464 F.3d at 48.</p>\n<p>The evidence that Motta gave an unduly low recommendation for political reasons is more debatable. We must assume that Motta made the two remarks that Perez reported.<sup>[8]</sup> Worse still for Motta, stronger motive evidence as to Motta's involvement with Garcia (which we discuss next) resulted not only in liability but also substantial punitive damages against Motta. The jury was free to draw inferences from this episode as wellincluding the particularly damaging testimony by Garcia that Motta indicated her intent to \"fire all the NPPs\" in the office.</p>\n<p>That Perez was given a favorable evaluation immediately before the change in administration also could raise doubts about the fairness of Motta's evaluation and therefore its motive, although this inference is tempered by the circumstances: in particular, Perez' positive evaluation was rendered under the NPP regime on December 31, 2000, which was a Sunday, New Year's Eve, and only a few days before Rey began his term. Still, the jury could have found that the earlier evaluation was not a white-wash.</p>\n<p>The most troubling concern about the verdict is that Motta's explanation for her evaluation is coherent and much of it not directly contradicted. But the jury was not obliged to credit Motta's good faith or veracity. In addition to Perez' prior favorable evaluation and the damaging motive evidence against Motta, the two contradicted each other directly as to whether Motta had made the two remarks and whether she had evaded Perez; and the jury may have been doubtful about Motta's explanation for Perez' prolonged idleness since Motta headed the office.</p>\n<p>Thus, unlike the case of the drivers against Sauri, this claim was about a concrete job loss and the dispute here was largely about whom to believe. Here our deference to the jury is at its zenith: they are closer to the gritty detail and see and hear the witnesses. <i>Rodriguez-Marin v. Rivera-Gonzalez,</i> 438 F.3d 72, 75 (1st Cir. 2006). Neither story was implausible nor clearly confirmed (or negated) by objective evidence, and so the jury's judgment as to who told the truth must stand.</p>\n<p><i>Garcia's claim against Rey and Motta.</i> Garcia's claim is that Rey and Motta fostered administrative charges against him because of Garcia's political support of the NPP. Garcia held a trust position and, when the new administration took over, Rey notified Garcia that he would be returned to his career position as an administrative complaints investigator. Trust <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> positions are often unprotected under <i>Rutan;</i> anyway, Garcia does not now challenge his re-assignment.</p>\n<p>Rather, at trial in the district court, Garcia testified that on the day he received the letter from Rey removing him from his trust position, he encountered Motta whom he had long knownwho said that she was going to fire all the NPP supporters and that she was going to fire him \"and take you off your motor bike so you won't do any more politics.\" Garcia said that Motta repeated the threat later that day. Thereafter, Garcia tendered his resignation to Motta. In response, Garcia received a letter on February 13, 2001, from Rey saying that Garcia could not resign because of a pending harassment complaint filed against him by another employee. A previous Secretary of Education had found \"no cause\" to discipline Garcia for \"sexual harassment\" but it is unclear whether the earlier complaint remained pending on other charges (specifically, labor harassment). Later Rey notified Garcia that he intended to pursue the charges.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, Rey signed a letter adding an additional charge of insubordination, and Garcia was suspended with pay pending a final disciplinary decision. Both of the two \"intent\" letters appear to have been typed by one of Motta's secretaries. After a hearing before an examiner, who concluded that some but not all of the charges had basis in fact, Garcia was terminated on July 16, 2002.</p>\n<p>After Garcia brought his federal claim, the charges were settled within the administrative process on terms largely (although not wholly) favorable to Garcia: Garcia accepted a reprimand on one of the charges, was allowed to resign, and received full pay for the period between his termination and ultimate resignation. As part of the settlement, Garcia agreed not to seek reinstatement or back pay in federal court but otherwise reserved his federal claim:</p>\n<blockquote>The agreements contained in this document do not constitute a waiver of the claim filed by the Appellant before the Federal District Court of San Juan, Puerto Rico, except that which regards the compensation for the wages not received, as stated previously, and the reinstatement to the position from which he resigned, however, it does constitute a waiver of any other cause of action that the Appellant may have against the Agency, its officers or employees in their official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p>On this appeal, remarkably Rey and Motta first challenge the verdict against them on the ground that the claim is barred by res judicata. The res judicata argument rests on the assertion that the settlement waiver provision block-quoted above disposed of the present claim against Rey and Motta. Res judicata is a doubtful label for the issue,<sup>[9]</sup> but the label does not matter; the question is the scope of the waiver provision.</p>\n<p>The quoted language in the agreement makes clear that Garcia's federal court claim against Rey and Motta in their personal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> capacities was neither settled nor waived. We find hard to understand, and impossible to accept, defendants' argument that the agreement only purports to preserve claims unrelated to the administrative charges. It reserves \"the claim\" filed by Garcia in federal court and, although he offered multiple theories, the misuse of the administrative proceedings was encompassed by his federal complaint.</p>\n<p>This argument is followed in the defendants' brief by four paragraphs which mingle what might be a defense on the merits if it had been developed\"Garcia failed to present evidence that the actions of Rey or Motta were not reasonable with regards to the initiation of the administrative proceedings nor did political animus exist[].\"with assertions that \"they are both entitled to qualified immunity.\"</p>\n<p>In order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendants would need to identify the weak elements in Garcia's case, substantially develop the record evidence on the key issues, provide relevant background and offer a serious analysis of the inferences that the jury might or might not reasonably have drawn. Virtually none of this is furnished in the brief indeed, the four paragraphs are primarily directed to urging qualified immunitya claim to which we will return.</p>\n<p>The failure to make a serious sufficiency argument may have been a mistakeat least as to Rey. That Rey formally caused the charges against Garcia is patent; but, of course, he <i>may</i> merely have followed procedures and taken advice from lawyers instead of acting from an improper motive. Nor did he make inflammatory threats from which a discriminatory intent could readily be inferred. Garcia's evidence of Rey's animus (<i>e.g.,</i> that Rey appointed PDP partisans) is unimpressive.</p>\n<p>The case against Motta is stronger but not airtight. Garcia testified about her threats (the award of punitive damages suggests this was believed). But all that links her directly to Garcia's travails are her secretary's initials on Rey's letters and Motta disclaimed involvement. Yet the jury may not have believed her and, given her position and legal training, it might be inferred that she was Rey's natural advisor on whether charges should be brought.</p>\n<p>But the defendants' failure to develop the sufficiency issue on appeal and supply the necessary information is a fatal forfeiture. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 43 (1st Cir.1998). Because of this, we cannot be sure that our own initial hesitation has fairly captured the evidence on both sides. In addition, the failure seriously to brief the sufficiency issue meant that Garcia was handicapped in his efforts to respond although he did make more of an effort than the defendants' brief on this issue deserved.</p>\n<p>Defendants' four paragraphs do more clearly make a different and simpler argument, namely, that qualified immunity protects them, whatever their subjective motives, because a \"reasonable\" official would have thought that there was a basis for the charges. Even here, background information is not supplied, but in all events in political discrimination cases where wrongful motive is an <i>element</i> of the claimthe case law has regularly rejected this objective-reasonableness argument.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> Rey also disputes two of the district court's rulings admitting evidence that Rey wanted excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. That rule requires district judges to weigh the probative value of the challenged evidence against the unfair prejudice that would result if it were admitted. We review the district judge's evidentiary rulings under Rule 403 for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p>At trial, Rey testified that beyond casting his vote for the PDP, he had no connection to the party or to partisan activities. He claimed not to be aware of the political affiliations of the plaintiffs, including Garciawhom he removed from his trust position and reinstated as a career employee. On cross examination, plaintiffs' counsel was permitted to question Rey about the trust officials he had appointed upon taking office; of course, they were revealed to be PDP supporters, although Rey denied knowing their affiliations.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Rey argues that because he was legally entitled to prefer PDP members when selecting these senior policy-making officials, allowing that line of questioning was error. But Rey also claimed that he was entirely independent of party politics, and the questions were quite relevant in impeaching Rey as to his own (seemingly unnecessary) defense. In short, the questions went directly to Rey's own characterization of his relationship to partisan politics.</p>\n<p>This is also true of evidence that Garcia adduced from Pillich, who was called as a hostile witness. Pillich was questioned about a paragraph in her affidavit in another case that elaborated on her knowledge of Rey's participation and involvement in PDP partisan activities. Rey says that Pillich's allegations in the prior case were not \"resolved or adjudicated\"; but it was for the jury to evaluate whether Pillich's testimony should be believed.</p>\n<p><i>Attorneys' Fees.</i> Because attorneys' fees depend in large part on which parties won the case and the extent of their victory, <i>see </i><i>Hensley v. Eckerhart,</i> 461 U.S. 424, 434-37, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), they will now have to be recalculated, but we address now two concerns raised by defendants that are unlikely to disappear on remand.</p>\n<p>Part of the fees calculation is the selection of an appropriate hourly rate for each attorney. Rates should be \"those prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience and reputation.\" <i>Blum v. Stenson,</i> 465 U.S. 886, 895 n. 11, 104 S.Ct. 1541, 79 L.Ed.2d 891 (1984). Defendants argue that the hourly rates accepted by the district judge were excessive under that standard. But we review fee awards only for \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>Diaz-Rivera v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> 377 F.3d 119, 124 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>The order granting attorneys' fees cites precisely the factors that the Supreme Court has deemed relevant. Defendants point to prior cases that have authorized lower rates, but each case is unique and rates inflate over time; indeed, the district court reduced the total award by two percent because much work had occurred in earlier years. The rates in this case do not fall outside the trial court's \"extremely broad\" discretion. <i>Lipsett v. Blanco,</i> 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1992).</p>\n<p>Defendants also argue that the documentation provided by plaintiffs' counsel was not contemporaneous. Counsel never claimed it was; the exhibit to their motion <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> said it was \"prepared from contemporaneous time records,\" adjusted to filter out work done for unsuccessful plaintiffs or on unsuccessful claims. If defendants suspected tampering or inaccuracy, they should have sought discovery. <i>Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico,</i> 247 F.3d 288, 297 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n<p>The judgments in favor of the drivers (and spouses) are reversed; those in favor of Perez and Garcia are affirmed. The award of counsel fees is vacated and remanded for reconsideration in light of the reversal of the judgments as to the drivers. All parties will bear their own costs and attorneys' fees on appeal.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The spouses filed pendent claims under articles 1802 and 1803 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, P.R.

The governor-elect chose Cesar Rey-Hernandez to serve as Secretary of Education in the new administration, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*38</span> and Rey took office on January 8, 2001. Events, mostly occurring after Rey took office, led certain employees of the department to file section 1983 claims, 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000), in the federal district court for Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>The suit was filed against Rey and others by a group of drivers (and two of their spouses<sup>[1]</sup>), by a probationary attorney (Edith Perez-Posso) and by Luis Garcia-Gonzalez, an investigator who had served the secretary in the previous administration. Each plaintiff claimed to have suffered injury resulting from political discrimination in violation of the first amendment and subject to redress under section 1983. <i>Rutan v.

In a retrial in October and November 2005, the jury returned a verdict largely in the plaintiffs' favor on November 23, 2005. Because the case embraced four different \"mini trials\" with different parties and different episodes, we do no more here than summarize the verdicts as modified after post-trial motions.</p>\n<blockquote>1. Seven drivers obtained verdicts against Rey and Lizzette Pillich-Otero, who was Rey's Assistant Secretary for Human Resources, based on the drivers' transfer to a central transportation pool and loss of overtime pay. The awards ranged from $1 to $25,000 in compensatory damages with nominal awards for punitive damages.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. The same seven drivers prevailed against Jose Rivera-Sauri, the supervisor of the office to which they were transferred, for alleged acts of harassment. Sauri was held liable with Rey and Pillich with no allocation of damages as between transfer and harassment claims.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. Edith Perez-Posso, who worked as a probationary attorney in the legal division of the department, was awarded $11,000 plus nominal punitive damages against Carmen Motta-Montanez, the new director of the division who had evaluated and terminated Perez-Posso.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. Luis Garcia-Gonzalez was awarded $10,000 in compensatory damages against Rey and Motta and a further $10,000 in punitive damages against Motta. Garcia had accused both of fostering administrative charges against him that led to temporary suspension and delayed his intended retirement.</blockquote>\n<p>The district court also granted equitable relief in light of the jury's findings. Specifically, the court ordered that a plan be adopted to ensure that overtime work not be distributed to career drivers based on political affiliation; that Perez be reinstated; and that an admonishment be expunged from Garcia's employment file. Plaintiffs' counsel were awarded attorneys' fees in the amount of $949,631.40.</p>\n<p>All four defendants (Rey, Motta, Pillich and Sauri) now appeal, contesting the money judgments against them and the award of attorneys' fees. The current education secretary, who has succeeded Rey, seeks review only of the attorneys' fees awarded against the secretary in his official capacity. No one has sought to overturn the equitable relief.

All were affiliated with the NPP. Primarily, they drove department officials, but in practice, their work included many other dutieseverything from messenger service to answering the phonesand each of them performed a substantial amount of overtime work, in some cases almost doubling their base salaries.</p>\n<p>When Rey took office in January 2001, two of the seven drivers had transferred to another facility<sup>[4]</sup> but the other five testified that they then received less work and that several PDP members appeared on the twelfth floor and were doing some of the duties that the seven had earlier done. In February 2001 Rey approved a plan whereby drivers, whether assigned to the twelfth floor or not, were re-assigned to a general poolultimately comprising some 25 driverscentrally supervised in an annex to the main building.</p>\n<p>The seven drivers were reassigned to this pool effective February 20, 2001. In the subsequent weeks, several more PDP drivers were assigned work on the twelfth floor and thereafter enjoyed substantial overtime. Various officials on the twelfth floor often sought assignment of particular drivers who were PDP members and the overtime flowed to these drivers. None of the seven driver-plaintiffs thereafter enjoyed substantial overtime.</p>\n<p>The drivers' theory at trial was that the sequence of events just described added up to a plan, for which Rey and Pillich were responsible, to displace the NPP drivers on the twelfth floor (and the two brothers who had transferred to Naranjito) with PDP drivers who would thereafter enjoy the overtime, and that the motive was political discrimination against the former and in favor of the latter. Rey and Pillich say that the evidence for such a determination was lacking.</p>\n<p>The jury could have concluded that overtime did shift from the five drivers who initially remained on the twelfth floor to PDP drivers and that the two brothers who had transferred (see note 4, above) were seriously inconvenienced by their re-transfer to the pool, impairing their ability to keep non-government evening jobs. That there was no entitlement to overtime or to a particular location is no barrier under the precedents and their rationale. <i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112472\"><a href=\"/opinion/112472/rutan-v-republican-party-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2729</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>Probably the jury was also entitled to conclude that the NPP affiliation of the seven was sufficiently well known that Rey and Pillich were aware of it, <i>cf. </i><i>Peguero-Moronta,</i> 464 F.3d at 48; perhaps, also, that after the transfer the defendants were aware that overtime previously available to the NPP drivers now went to PDP drivers. No one disputes that the pool plan was approved by Rey and the transfers (pursuant to the plan) of all seven driver-plaintiffs were signed by Pillich.</p>\n<p>But fatally, there is no evidence that Rey or Pillich conceived the pool plan or transfers as a means of favoring PDP drivers over NPP drivers or that they approved or fostered the re-direction of twelfth floor work or overtime to PDP drivers. The pool arrangements merely centralized supervision of the drivers. So far as the record reveals, the PDP drivers achieved such benefits almost entirely as a result of decisions by various other twelfth floor officials who, on an individual basis, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*41</span> requested particular drivers generally or for specific assignments.</p>\n<p>On this record, Rey and Pillich cannot be held liable for discrimination by others. Section 1983 does not impose purely supervisory liability, <i>Rizzo v. Goode,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109349\"><a href=\"/opinion/109349/rizzo-v-goode/\"><span class=\"volume\">423</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">362</span></a></span>, 375-77, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109349\"><a href=\"/opinion/109349/rizzo-v-goode/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">561</span></a></span> (1976); it aims at \"persons who have actually abused their positions of authority,\" <i>Dunham v. Crosby,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"293866\"><a href=\"/opinion/293866/kenneth-t-dunham-v-philip-b-crosby-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1177</span></a></span>, 1180 (1st Cir.1970), and hence \"only persons who were directly involved in the wrongdoing may be held liable.\" <i>Kostka v. Hogg,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"348313\"><a href=\"/opinion/348313/alan-s-kostka-v-david-w-hogg/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.1977). Exceptions exist but are either irrelevant here or have not been invoked.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>True enough, a couple of PDP members showed up on the twelfth floor early in the new administration to do some of the work done by the NPP drivers; but there was no proof as to who had assigned them (or that they earned overtime pay). Three more appeared after the February transfer, but again there is no proof who sought them. Plaintiffs at trial pointed to two more PDP drivers, but one was clearly requested by the Office of Communications, and another appears to have worked in San German, not in San Juan.</p>\n<p>Pillich in an administrative capacity signed off for overtime earned by various PDP drivers on the twelfth floor but there is no indication that she chose the drivers. Indeed, in some cases the officials who actually ordered the overtime were Pillich's superiors in the department. The sign-offs suggest that Pillich knew that PDP drivers were doing well at the expense of NPP drivers but not that she caused them to be so favored.</p>\n<p>On its face, the pool plan was a plausible piece of agency reorganization, centralizing some 25 or so drivers including both NPP and PDP members under one office. If Rey or Pillich had instigated or approved the subsequent favoring of PDP members, it might be inferred that they had conceived the plan for this purpose. But there was no such evidence. The officials who systematically summoned PDP drivers for overtime might perhaps have been sued but they were not.</p>\n<p>The drivers did show, and the jury was free to believe, that defendants were committed political partisans. More pertinent to a discrimination claim, Pillich (but not Rey) was accused of uttering two arguably hostile political remarks and the jury may have credited the testimony (although the remarks were pretty mild by current standards).<sup>[6]</sup> But this hardly shows that either Rey or Pillich devised the pool plan to mask a discriminatory scheme to be executed by others.</p>\n<p>Contrast this with <i>Fernandez v. Chardon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405331\"><a href=\"/opinion/405331/rafael-rivera-fernandez-v-carlos-chardon-etc-juan-fumero-soto/\"><span class=\"volume\">681</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">42</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1982), which also concerned a facially neutral policy promulgated by a then-Secretary of Education. Although the policy had the ultimate result of demoting employees of one party in favor of those belonging to the other, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> \"critical evidence\" against the then-secretary, <i>id.</i> at 56, comprised his comments that his party would ensure that its political opponents would not fill any vacancies.</p>\n<p>If the reorganization in this case was hatched as a plan to clear the decks of NPP drivers so that PDP drivers could be favored, it was up to plaintiffs to conduct the necessary discovery and offer the evidence. Liability without such proof would effectively preclude any post-election reorganization that happens to affect adversely employees connected to the previously dominant party. <i>Cf. </i><i>Marin-Piazza v. Aponte-Roque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522146\"><a href=\"/opinion/522146/magda-l-marin-piazza-v-awilda-aponte-roque/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 434 (1st Cir. 1989). The verdicts for the drivers (and for the spouses) cannot stand as against Rey and Pillich.</p>\n<p><i>Driver claims against Sauri.</i> The claim of the seven drivers against Sauri is this: that after their transfer to his pool he harassed them because of their political affiliationspecifically, by subjecting them but not PDP drivers to humiliating roll calls, by following them to the cafeteria on their breaks, by selectively blaming them when things went amiss, by falsely altering their time sheets and by forcing them to sit inside an office that was too small.</p>\n<p>Actions of informal harassment, as opposed to formal employment actions like transfers or demotions, can be the basis for first amendment claims if the motive was political discrimination; but this is so only if the discriminatory acts are \"sufficiently severe to cause reasonably hardy individuals to compromise their political beliefs and associations in favor of the prevailing party.\" <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano v. Aponte-Roque,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532523\"><a href=\"/opinion/532523/maria-m-agosto-de-feliciano-v-awilda-aponte-roque-etc-maria-teresa/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1209</span></a></span>, 1217 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc).</p>\n<p>This threshold is implicit in the rationale for granting <i>Rutan</i> protectionto safeguard political speech and association and distinguishes \"the wheat\" of real impairments from \"the chaff of minor irritants and frustrations\" in any workplace. <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano,</i> 889 F.2d at 1214. An ambiguous footnote in <i>Rutan,</i> 497 U.S. at 76 n. 8, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112472\"><a href=\"/opinion/112472/rutan-v-republican-party-of-ill/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2729</span></a></span>, could imply that even withholding of a birthday party might be enough; but <i>Rutan</i>'s text does not so suggest and our cases have \"continued to apply the <i>Agosto-de-Feliciano</i> standard,\" <i>Bisbal-Ramos,</i> 467 F.3d at 22.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>If everything alleged by the drivers was supported by the record, we would agree such actions could, taken together, be deemed by a jury sufficiently weighty to discourage political affiliation or speech; and then, if improper motivation were expressed or reasonably inferred, a first amendment claim would be made out although it is puzzling how such harassment could have caused substantial economic damages unless altering the time sheets caused a loss of pay (for which no proof was offered).</p>\n<p>But the drivers' case substantially weakens as one examines the evidence. There was no proof that Sauri ordered selective roll calls; they were conducted by a secretary and ceased within days after complaints were made. The alleged casting of blame by Sauri concerns <i>one</i> offhand, isolated, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> sarcastic comment by Sauri that the Castillo brothers would know the location of a missing key; the drivers also testified that Sauri tended to suspect them whenever a car broke down, but no specific incidents were described.</p>\n<p>The room assigned to the drivers waiting for tasks may well have been too small but it was shared by all drivers, PDP and NPP alike. The district judge found no evidence to suggest that Sauri discriminated with respect to the allocation of duties. As for following the drivers to the cafeteria, Sauri agrees that he did so on occasion because he was concerned that the seven drivers, or at least some of them, were abusing their breaks. None of this adds up to culpable harassment by Sauri.</p>\n<p>Turning to the time sheets, false alterations for improper purposes would be close to fraud, and the economic consequences for the drivers could be serious. But Sauri apparently reviewed time sheets as part of his job and made adjustments both for and against the seven drivers; the evidence is very muddled but we are given no basis to infer that his changes were deliberately false or formed a suspicious pattern.</p>\n<p>Wrongdoing might perhaps have been inferred if the driver-plaintiffs had shown that the changes adversely affected their pay or tenure. But it appears from the record that the drivers had fixed salaries for their basic work and that Sauri confirmed on the time sheets that they had satisfied all their work requirements. The drivers countered with only the vague and undetailed suggestion that somehow their benefits might have been affected. This is hardly enough.</p>\n<p>Unlike the verdict against Rey and Pillich, the verdict against Sauri has no single glaring flaw, and we are reluctant to second guess a jury on a confusing record. But even resolving doubts in favor of the plaintiffs, what remainsafter the hopeless allegations are stripped awayis just too thin to support a finding of liability. Allowing a judgment to rest on this collection of complaints would \"trivialize the First Amendment.\" <i>Bart v. Telford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403624\"><a href=\"/opinion/403624/mary-a-bart-v-william-c-telford/\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 625 (7th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p><i>Perez' claim against Motta.</i> Perez' claim is by far the most straightforward discrimination claim presented. Perez, then serving as a probationary employee doing legal work, says that Motta, the new department head and a PDP supporter, gave Perez a failing evaluation because of Perez' affiliation with the NPP. On appeal, Motta says that the evidence was insufficient. We think that the case is close but that the jury was within bounds in imposing liability.</p>\n<p>Perez testified that she had been given a favorable evaluation prior to the PDP election, that Motta took over the legal department in January 2001, and that Perez received no work for about two weeks thereafter. Then she got a batch of contracts to review, which took about three days, and thereafter got no new assignments until February 27, when Motta gave her a new evaluation ranking her unsatisfactory. In consequence, Perez lost her position.</p>\n<p>Perez also claimed that she had sought repeatedly to contact Motta during the intervening weeks, first by leaving messages with her secretary and later by slipping a memo under Motta's office door. Perez said that her evaluation meeting with Motta lasted only five minutes, while her prior evaluation meeting lasted over an hour. Perez also alleged that Motta had made two politically charged remarks (during a single incident) prior to the general election.</p>\n<p>Motta responded by giving detailed reasons for the evaluation: that Perez erroneously <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> cited statutes, did not accept constructive criticism, was frequently absent from the office without explanation, and did not fulfill tasks that she was asked to perform. Motta denied making the hostile remarks attributed to her, claimed she did meet with Perez, and explained that Perez received work not from Motta but whenever contracts to review were forwarded by others.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Motta argues that there was no direct evidence that she was even aware of Perez' party affiliation, but based on Perez' testimony that she spoke openly about her political views and sat in the NPP portion of the de facto segregated cafeteria, a reasonable jury could infer that Motta, who worked alongside Perez for about six months, was aware of Perez' affiliation. <i>See </i><i>Peguero-Moronta,</i> 464 F.3d at 48.</p>\n<p>The evidence that Motta gave an unduly low recommendation for political reasons is more debatable. We must assume that Motta made the two remarks that Perez reported.<sup>[8]</sup> Worse still for Motta, stronger motive evidence as to Motta's involvement with Garcia (which we discuss next) resulted not only in liability but also substantial punitive damages against Motta. The jury was free to draw inferences from this episode as wellincluding the particularly damaging testimony by Garcia that Motta indicated her intent to \"fire all the NPPs\" in the office.</p>\n<p>That Perez was given a favorable evaluation immediately before the change in administration also could raise doubts about the fairness of Motta's evaluation and therefore its motive, although this inference is tempered by the circumstances: in particular, Perez' positive evaluation was rendered under the NPP regime on December 31, 2000, which was a Sunday, New Year's Eve, and only a few days before Rey began his term. Still, the jury could have found that the earlier evaluation was not a white-wash.</p>\n<p>The most troubling concern about the verdict is that Motta's explanation for her evaluation is coherent and much of it not directly contradicted. But the jury was not obliged to credit Motta's good faith or veracity. In addition to Perez' prior favorable evaluation and the damaging motive evidence against Motta, the two contradicted each other directly as to whether Motta had made the two remarks and whether she had evaded Perez; and the jury may have been doubtful about Motta's explanation for Perez' prolonged idleness since Motta headed the office.</p>\n<p>Thus, unlike the case of the drivers against Sauri, this claim was about a concrete job loss and the dispute here was largely about whom to believe. Here our deference to the jury is at its zenith: they are closer to the gritty detail and see and hear the witnesses. <i>Rodriguez-Marin v. Rivera-Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202064\"><a href=\"/opinion/202064/rodriguez-marin-v-rivera-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">438</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">72</span></a></span>, 75 (1st Cir. 2006). Neither story was implausible nor clearly confirmed (or negated) by objective evidence, and so the jury's judgment as to who told the truth must stand.</p>\n<p><i>Garcia's claim against Rey and Motta.</i> Garcia's claim is that Rey and Motta fostered administrative charges against him because of Garcia's political support of the NPP. Garcia held a trust position and, when the new administration took over, Rey notified Garcia that he would be returned to his career position as an administrative complaints investigator. Trust <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> positions are often unprotected under <i>Rutan;</i> anyway, Garcia does not now challenge his re-assignment.</p>\n<p>Rather, at trial in the district court, Garcia testified that on the day he received the letter from Rey removing him from his trust position, he encountered Motta whom he had long knownwho said that she was going to fire all the NPP supporters and that she was going to fire him \"and take you off your motor bike so you won't do any more politics.\" Garcia said that Motta repeated the threat later that day. Thereafter, Garcia tendered his resignation to Motta. In response, Garcia received a letter on February 13, 2001, from Rey saying that Garcia could not resign because of a pending harassment complaint filed against him by another employee. A previous Secretary of Education had found \"no cause\" to discipline Garcia for \"sexual harassment\" but it is unclear whether the earlier complaint remained pending on other charges (specifically, labor harassment). Later Rey notified Garcia that he intended to pursue the charges.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, Rey signed a letter adding an additional charge of insubordination, and Garcia was suspended with pay pending a final disciplinary decision. Both of the two \"intent\" letters appear to have been typed by one of Motta's secretaries. After a hearing before an examiner, who concluded that some but not all of the charges had basis in fact, Garcia was terminated on July 16, 2002.</p>\n<p>After Garcia brought his federal claim, the charges were settled within the administrative process on terms largely (although not wholly) favorable to Garcia: Garcia accepted a reprimand on one of the charges, was allowed to resign, and received full pay for the period between his termination and ultimate resignation. As part of the settlement, Garcia agreed not to seek reinstatement or back pay in federal court but otherwise reserved his federal claim:</p>\n<blockquote>The agreements contained in this document do not constitute a waiver of the claim filed by the Appellant before the Federal District Court of San Juan, Puerto Rico, except that which regards the compensation for the wages not received, as stated previously, and the reinstatement to the position from which he resigned, however, it does constitute a waiver of any other cause of action that the Appellant may have against the Agency, its officers or employees in their official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p>On this appeal, remarkably Rey and Motta first challenge the verdict against them on the ground that the claim is barred by res judicata. The res judicata argument rests on the assertion that the settlement waiver provision block-quoted above disposed of the present claim against Rey and Motta. Res judicata is a doubtful label for the issue,<sup>[9]</sup> but the label does not matter; the question is the scope of the waiver provision.</p>\n<p>The quoted language in the agreement makes clear that Garcia's federal court claim against Rey and Motta in their personal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> capacities was neither settled nor waived. We find hard to understand, and impossible to accept, defendants' argument that the agreement only purports to preserve claims unrelated to the administrative charges. It reserves \"the claim\" filed by Garcia in federal court and, although he offered multiple theories, the misuse of the administrative proceedings was encompassed by his federal complaint.</p>\n<p>This argument is followed in the defendants' brief by four paragraphs which mingle what might be a defense on the merits if it had been developed\"Garcia failed to present evidence that the actions of Rey or Motta were not reasonable with regards to the initiation of the administrative proceedings nor did political animus exist[].\"with assertions that \"they are both entitled to qualified immunity.\"</p>\n<p>In order to challenge the sufficiency of the evidence, the defendants would need to identify the weak elements in Garcia's case, substantially develop the record evidence on the key issues, provide relevant background and offer a serious analysis of the inferences that the jury might or might not reasonably have drawn. Virtually none of this is furnished in the brief indeed, the four paragraphs are primarily directed to urging qualified immunitya claim to which we will return.</p>\n<p>The failure to make a serious sufficiency argument may have been a mistakeat least as to Rey. That Rey formally caused the charges against Garcia is patent; but, of course, he <i>may</i> merely have followed procedures and taken advice from lawyers instead of acting from an improper motive. Nor did he make inflammatory threats from which a discriminatory intent could readily be inferred. Garcia's evidence of Rey's animus (<i>e.g.,</i> that Rey appointed PDP partisans) is unimpressive.</p>\n<p>The case against Motta is stronger but not airtight. Garcia testified about her threats (the award of punitive damages suggests this was believed). But all that links her directly to Garcia's travails are her secretary's initials on Rey's letters and Motta disclaimed involvement. Yet the jury may not have believed her and, given her position and legal training, it might be inferred that she was Rey's natural advisor on whether charges should be brought.</p>\n<p>But the defendants' failure to develop the sufficiency issue on appeal and supply the necessary information is a fatal forfeiture. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197918\"><a href=\"/opinion/197918/massachusetts-school-v-american-bar/\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 43 (1st Cir.1998). Because of this, we cannot be sure that our own initial hesitation has fairly captured the evidence on both sides. In addition, the failure seriously to brief the sufficiency issue meant that Garcia was handicapped in his efforts to respond although he did make more of an effort than the defendants' brief on this issue deserved.</p>\n<p>Defendants' four paragraphs do more clearly make a different and simpler argument, namely, that qualified immunity protects them, whatever their subjective motives, because a \"reasonable\" official would have thought that there was a basis for the charges. Even here, background information is not supplied, but in all events in political discrimination cases where wrongful motive is an <i>element</i> of the claimthe case law has regularly rejected this objective-reasonableness argument.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> Rey also disputes two of the district court's rulings admitting evidence that Rey wanted excluded under Federal Rule of Evidence 403. That rule requires district judges to weigh the probative value of the challenged evidence against the unfair prejudice that would result if it were admitted. We review the district judge's evidentiary rulings under Rule 403 for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Bradshaw,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199842\"><a href=\"/opinion/199842/united-states-v-bradshaw/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 284 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p>At trial, Rey testified that beyond casting his vote for the PDP, he had no connection to the party or to partisan activities. He claimed not to be aware of the political affiliations of the plaintiffs, including Garciawhom he removed from his trust position and reinstated as a career employee. On cross examination, plaintiffs' counsel was permitted to question Rey about the trust officials he had appointed upon taking office; of course, they were revealed to be PDP supporters, although Rey denied knowing their affiliations.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Rey argues that because he was legally entitled to prefer PDP members when selecting these senior policy-making officials, allowing that line of questioning was error. But Rey also claimed that he was entirely independent of party politics, and the questions were quite relevant in impeaching Rey as to his own (seemingly unnecessary) defense. In short, the questions went directly to Rey's own characterization of his relationship to partisan politics.</p>\n<p>This is also true of evidence that Garcia adduced from Pillich, who was called as a hostile witness. Pillich was questioned about a paragraph in her affidavit in another case that elaborated on her knowledge of Rey's participation and involvement in PDP partisan activities. Rey says that Pillich's allegations in the prior case were not \"resolved or adjudicated\"; but it was for the jury to evaluate whether Pillich's testimony should be believed.</p>\n<p><i>Attorneys' Fees.</i> Because attorneys' fees depend in large part on which parties won the case and the extent of their victory, <i>see </i><i>Hensley v.

Defendants point to prior cases that have authorized lower rates, but each case is unique and rates inflate over time; indeed, the district court reduced the total award by two percent because much work had occurred in earlier years.
