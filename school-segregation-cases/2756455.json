The trial court granted\r\nthe State’s motion and denied Bell’s motion.  Bell appeals the trial court’s ruling and seeks\r\nsummary judgment in its favor.  In support, Bell asserts the trial court erred in finding (1)\r\nBell’s end user common line charges, special access charges, and operator assistance\r\ncharges are Texas receipts for state franchise tax apportionment purposes; (2) the\r\nComptroller’s application of the franchise tax apportionment statute and rules to Bell did\r\nnot violate equal protection guarantees; and (3) certain testimony by Bell’s experts was\r\nproperly excluded.  We affirm.<span></span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Background</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>In December 2002, Bell filed suit to recover $43,136,577.39</span><span> in franchise taxes and\r\ninterest </span><span>paid under protest to the Comptroller.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  </span><span>For calendar years 1996-2001,</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> the\r\nComptroller apportioned Bell’s charges for customer access to its local telephone network\r\nto complete long distance calls and pay-per-use services such as operator assistance as\r\nTexas receipts.  Bell asserts these charges </span><span>are exempt from apportionment as Texas\r\nreceipts because they constitute “receipts from interstate calls” or “revenues from calls in\r\ninterstate commerce.”  </span><span><span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>This case necessarily involves technical and legal issues unique to the telephone\r\nindustry.  Events that occurred in the telephone industry nationwide and in Texas from the\r\nearly 1980s through 2001 comprise the backdrop for understanding the issues\r\nunderscoring this appeal.  As a result, </span>it is necessary that we describe in greater detail\r\nBell’s operation during the period at issue as well as the applicable regulatory history\r\nunderlying the franchise tax exemptions sought by Bell.</p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>I.<span>        </span>The Antitrust Consent Decree</span>  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Before 1982, American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T)  dominated the\r\nnational telecommunications industry.  <i>AT&amp;T Corp. v. Iowa Utilities Bd.</i>, 525 U.S. 366, 414,\r\n119 S.Ct. 721, 142 L.Ed.2d 835 (1999).  AT&amp;T and its corporate affiliates, known as the\r\n“Bell System,” virtually controlled all long-distance telephone service, most local telephone\r\nservice, and a substantial amount of all telephone equipment manufacturing.  <i>See United\r\nStates v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </i>552 F.Supp. 131, 222-23 (D.D.C. 1982), <i>aff’d sub nom.\r\nMaryland v. United States</i>, 460 U.S. 1001, 103 S.Ct. 1240, 75 L.Ed.2d 472 (1983). \r\nHowever, in 1982, AT&amp;T entered into an antitrust consent decree, known as the\r\nModification of Final Judgment (MFJ) that ended its industry dominance.  552 F.Supp. at\r\n160-170, 222-234.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Under the MFJ, AT&amp;T was required to divest itself of local exchange subsidiaries\r\nand was grouped into regional operating companies which became known as the “Bell\r\nOperating Companies (BOCs).”  <i>See </i>47 U.S.C. § 153 (4) (2001); <i>SBC Communications,\r\nInc. v. F.C.C., </i>154 F.3d 226, 230 (5<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1998).  Bell was a BOC and provided\r\ntelecommunications services for customers physically located in Kansas, Arkansas,\r\nOklahoma, Missouri, and Texas.  The United States was then divided into 161 Local\r\nAccess Transport Areas (LATAs)</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> within which BOCs were permitted to operate and\r\nprovide local telephone service.  154 F.3d at 231.  Within each LATA were local exchange\r\ncarriers (LECs)</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> that connected their customers’ telephones to their  networks and facilities. \r\nBell operates as an LEC in LATAs in Texas and other states.   <span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Because the MFJ permitted BOCs and/or LECs to retain their state-regulated, local\r\nservice monopolies, they became subject to various restrictions on their lines of business. \r\nThe restrictions were intended to ensure that the BOCs would not use their monopoly\r\ncontrol over LECs to impede competition in other markets.  <i>United States v. Western Elec.\r\nCo.</i>, 12 F.3d 225, 229 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  For instance, an LEC might find it particularly easy\r\nto attract local customers to contract for its long distance service and use its control of local\r\nservice to place its long distance competitors at a disadvantage.  <i>Iowa Utilities Board, </i>525\r\nU.S. at 416.  Thus, one such restriction prohibited LECs from offering any long distance\r\nservice between LATAs, or interLATA service.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  <i>See Id.; SBC Communications, </i>154 F.3d\r\nat 230; <i>Western Elec. Co., </i>12 F.3d at 228.  Thus, during the relevant time period, Bell was\r\nprohibited from providing any long distance telephone services.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>II.<span>       </span>Long Distance Telephone Service</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>Because LECs such as Bell were prohibited from providing long distance telephone\r\nservice, long distance calls or interLATA calls were transmitted by interexchange carriers\r\n(IXCs).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  <i>AT&amp;T Communications of Texas, L.P. v. Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.</i><span>, </span>186\r\nS.W.3d 517, 521-22 (Tex. 2006).  Under the MFJ, each LEC was allowed to transmit\r\ntelecommunications information only between points within a single LATA, providing what\r\nis, basically, the traditional local telephone service.  The MFJ required LECs to provide\r\ntheir customers and IXCs equal exchange access</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> to their network facilities for the purpose\r\nof permitting IXCs to carry on their long distance telephone business. <span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Thus, when a customer dialed a number in another LATA, the customer’s LEC\r\nwould first transmit the signal to an IXC’s Point of Presence (POP).  In a typical interLATA\r\nlong distance call, the originating caller’s LEC transports the signal from the caller’s\r\ntelephone over the local loop</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> to the LEC’s central office where the call is switched and\r\ntransported by a trunk line to the IXC’s POP.  This occurs nearly instantaneously. <i>\r\n</i>Typically, the LEC has switched the caller to their IXC before the caller has completed\r\ndialing the long distance number.  Once the signal reaches the IXC’s long distance switch,\r\nthe IXC then switches the signal to its trunk facilities for transmission out-of-state to the\r\nlocal switch of a second LEC serving the receiving party.  The second LEC switches the\r\nsignal to its local loop and ultimately the call is received.  The second LEC then reverses\r\nthe process and a circuit is established over which the two parties can communicate.<span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>III.<span>      </span>Access and Operator Charges</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>An IXC’s cost of replicating Bell’s local network and facilities to provide long distance\r\nservice from the LEC’s premises was prohibitive.  Thus, IXCs needed access to Bell’s\r\nnetwork in order to sell long distance services to their customers, and the IXC’s customers\r\nneeded access to the LEC’s network to complete long distance services purchased from\r\nIXCs.  To recompense Bell for costs associated with maintaining its facilities and\r\nequipment utilized by IXCs and the IXCs’ customers, the Federal Communications\r\nCommission</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  adopted uniform access charge rules.  The FCC’s rules required LECs to\r\nrecord their revenues in accordance with specified accounting rules and deposit accounts,\r\ndetermine what fraction of the LEC’s regulated expenses and investments in its facilities\r\nor network should be allocated to providing interstate access, and set charges or tariffs</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>Bell could charge its customers and IXCs.  <i>See </i>Access Charge Reform, CC Docket No.\r\n96-262, First Report and Order, 12 FCC Red 15982, 15998-99 (1997) (<i>Access Charge\r\nReform Order</i>), <i>aff’d</i>, <i>Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. F.C.C., </i>153 F.3d 523 (8<sup>th</sup> Cir.\r\n1998).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span> At issue, here, are Bell’s revenues deposited in two FCC denominated deposit\r\naccounts for Network Access Revenues</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> and a customer account for various pay-per-use\r\nservices as follows:    </span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>A.<span>       </span>End User Common Line Charges</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The End User Common Line Charge (EUCL) is a flat rate charge designed to\r\nrecover a portion of Bell’s cost of providing the local loop to transport customers’ long\r\ndistance calls to IXC POPs.  Bell’s EUCL revenues are recorded in its 5081 Account.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> \r\n<i>See </i>47 C.F.R. § 32.5081 (2001).  The EUCL charge is paid by local subscribers whether\r\nany long distance call is actually made or received. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>B.<span>       </span>Special Access Charges</span>   </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell also charges a fixed monthly fee for access to dedicated telephone lines or\r\ncircuits installed by Bell within the local exchange network that are used to transport long\r\ndistance calls directly from customers to their IXC POP.  Dedicated lines transport a\r\ncustomer’s long distance call directly through Bell’s central office to the IXC’s POP without\r\nbeing switched.  Bell’s revenues from customer access to dedicated lines is  accounted for\r\nin Account 5083.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  <i>See </i>47 C.F.R. § 32.5082 (2001).    </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>C.<span>       </span>Operator Assistance Charges</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Although Bell is prohibited from offering long distance telephone service, Bell is\r\npermitted to offer directory and operator assistance to customers making long distance\r\ncalls.  For instance, these charges occur when a customer located in Texas using a Texas\r\nphone facility while placing an interstate intraLATA call dials a Bell operator for directory\r\nassistance or assistance to complete the long distance call.  The charges are pay-per-use\r\ncharges.  These revenues are deposited in Account 5160.1.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  47 C.F.R. § 32.5160 (1995).</span></p>\r\n<p><span>    <span>       </span><span>IV.<span>      </span>Texas’s Franchise Tax and Current Controversy</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>Texas’s franchise tax is imposed upon all domestic and foreign corporations doing\r\nbusiness in Texas.  § 171.001.  The granting of the privilege to transact business in Texas\r\nconfers economic benefits, including the opportunity to realize gross income and the right\r\nto invoke the protection of local law.  <i>Bullock v. National Bancshares Corp., </i>584 S.W.2d\r\n268, 270 (Tex. 1979), <i>cert. denied</i>, 444 U.S. 1016, 100 S.Ct. 667, 62 L.Ed.2d 645 (1980). \r\nThe Texas franchise tax is a tax on the value of this privilege.  <i>Id. </i></span></p>\r\n<p><span><i><span>          </span></i>During calender years 1995-2001, Bell was an LEC in a number of states including\r\nTexas.  Because Bell conducted business inside and outside of Texas, its franchise tax\r\nwas calculated by an apportionment formula.  Its company-wide taxable capital (net worth)\r\nand taxable earned surplus (net income) were apportioned between Bell’s business done\r\nin Texas and business done elsewhere to obtain a correct assessment of Texas franchise\r\ntaxes.  This calculation and the resulting effect of having a larger proportion of gross\r\nreceipts from business done in Texas may be stated as follows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Simply described, “net taxable earned surplus” is determined by (1) adjusting\r\nthe amount of a corporate taxpayer’s federal taxable income to yield “taxable\r\nearned surplus,” (2) “apportioning” or attributing the taxable earned surplus\r\nto Texas; and (3) subtracting various allowable deductions from the\r\napportioned taxable earned surplus.  Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 171.110(a)\r\n(West Supp. 2004). . . .</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>Under tax code sections 171.106 and 171.110(2), taxable earned surplus is\r\nto be “apportioned” to Texas by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of\r\nwhich is the corporation’s “gross receipts from business done in this state,”\r\nas determined under section 171.1032, tax code, and the denominator of\r\nwhich is the corporation’s “gross receipts from its entire business,” as\r\ndetermined under section 171.1051.  Id. at §§ 171.106(b), 171.110(a)(2).\r\n[footnote omitted].  Thus, the larger the corporation’s “gross receipts from\r\nbusiness done in this state,” the larger the apportionment factor, and the\r\nlarger percentage of its taxable earned surplus is subject to the franchise tax.<i></i></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><i>Anderson-Clayton Bros. Funeral Home, Inc. v. Strayhorn, </i>149 S.W.3d 166, 169\r\n(Tex.App.–Austin 2004, pet. denied).</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>As in <i>Anderson-Clayton, </i>the center of the present dispute is the apportionment of\r\nBell’s receipts as either Texas or non-Texas receipts.  If Bell shows that more of its receipts\r\nin any tax year were not “gross receipts for business done in Texas” or were subject to an\r\nexemption from apportionment as Texas receipts, then the lesser the apportionment factor\r\nand consequently the lesser percentage of its taxable earned surplus is subject to the\r\nTexas franchise tax, <i>i.e.,</i> Bell owes less state franchise taxes.  Conversely, if the opposite\r\nis true, then the larger the apportionment factor and the greater its taxable earned surplus\r\nsubject to the Texas franchise tax.  Doing more business in Texas generally results in\r\nhigher franchise taxes. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><i><span>          </span></i>The earned surplus apportionment statute in existence between 1995-2001 provided\r\nthat Texas receipts are from “business done in Texas” as follows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>171.1032.

Admin. Code § 3.549(e)(43); § 3.557(e)(39).  Bell next asserts that apportioning its\r\naccess and operator assistance charges as Texas receipts violates equal protection\r\nguarantees because Bell does not receive preferential tax treatment received by IXCs and\r\ntransportation companies under the Comptroller’s Rules.

Bell also asserts that providing access for an\r\ninterstate, long distance call is inseparable from the call itself because the call is technically\r\nan uninterrupted transmission across state lines and Bell’s local loop is necessary to the\r\norigination and termination of such calls.  Accordingly, the validity of Bell’s assertion hinges\r\nupon whether its access service revenue is revenue from interstate calls or commerce.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span>     <span>      </span><span>1.<span>       </span>1933-1952 – Early Attorney General Opinions </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Our analysis begins with two Attorney General Opinions both of which address the\r\nissue before us prior to the adoption of the Comptroller’s Rule exempting interstate calls\r\nin 1975.  In January 1940, the Attorney General was asked for a determination whether the\r\ngross receipts of domestic telephone companies from interstate calls were subject to the\r\nTexas gross receipts tax.  Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. O-1878, 1 (1940).  The domestic\r\ncompanies operated wholly within Texas and provided long distance service to their\r\ncustomers.  They transmitted interstate long distance calls over their lines to the Texas\r\nborder where their calls were picked up by another company who transmitted the calls to\r\nan out-of-state recipient.  The domestic company was paid for the use of their lines within\r\nTexas, and the out-of-state company was paid a commission for completing the call\r\noutside Texas.  <i>Id. </i>at 2.  In determining that the charges were “interstate” in nature and not\r\nsubject to state tax, the Attorney General stated:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Under the facts here, the “gross receipts” sought to be taxed, were derived\r\nnot from tolls on calls originating and ending within the confines of the State\r\nof Texas, but rather from tolls on calls originating in Texas and terminating\r\nin other states, or vice versa,  – in other words, in interstate commerce.  The\r\nfact that the telephone company in question receives only such part of the\r\ntolls as represents payment for the facilities and services furnished by it in\r\ntransmitting the call from or to the borders of the State does not prevent such\r\nreceipts from being stamped with the interstate commerce feature.      </span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><i>Id. </i>at 4.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In January 1952, the Attorney General was asked for a determination whether the\r\ngross receipts of a domestic telephone company from calls that were routed from points\r\nin Texas through New Mexico and back to Texas were subject to the Texas gross receipts\r\ntax.  Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. V-1383, 1 (1952).  The Attorney General determined that the\r\ncalls routed through New Mexico had to be “treated as transactions constituting interstate\r\ncommerce”; <i>id. </i>at 5, and opined that the gross receipts tax was inapplicable because the\r\ntax was not apportioned between the interstate and intrastate segments of the call.  <i>Id. </i>at\r\n6-7.  The 1952 Opinion also indicated that, if there was apportionment, access services\r\ncould be subject to a state tax as follows:  </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Although the gross receipts derived from the interstate business are not\r\nsubject to this tax, that portion of the receipts representing wholly intrastate\r\nbusiness which can be separated or segregated from the gross receipts is\r\nsubject to the tax.  51 Am. Jur. 777, 779, 804, Taxation, Secs. 872, 874, 907,\r\n908.  Therefore, the receipts from “loop services” and from charges <i>received\r\nunder contracts or agreements for the use of lines, equipment or facilities in\r\nTexas </i>are subject to the tax even though such services may be incidental to\r\nan interstate communication.

In the 1940 Opinion, the domestic\r\ntelephone companies offered interstate long distance service to their customers and\r\ntransmitted calls across state lines to complete the long distance service.  Op. Tex. Att’y\r\nGen. No. O-1878, 1 (1940).  Because completion of the service owed by the domestic\r\ntelephone company was interstate in nature,<i> </i>its revenues were considered derived from\r\ninterstate commerce.  <i>Id.</i> at 4. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In the 1952 Opinion, the Attorney General recognized that, although the domestic\r\ntelephone company’s calls were interstate transactions, a portion of its receipts would be\r\ntaxable as Texas receipts if the state’s tax apportioned the company’s  “receipts from ‘loop\r\nservices’ and from charges received <i>under contracts or agreements for the use of lines,\r\nequipment or facilities in Texas</i>.”  Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. V-1383, 6-7 (1952).  In the 1952</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Opinion, the Attorney General did not describe a contract for a service to be delivered in\r\nanother state but a contract for the use of facilities and/or equipment located in Texas.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>2.<span>       </span>1972-2000 – Comptroller’s Rules and Policies </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>In 1972, the Comptroller adopted an adjudicatory rule that “revenues from interstate\r\ntoll charges are not ‘business done in Texas.’” <i> See </i>Comptroller Hearing No. 5587 (1972).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> \r\nIn Hearing No. 5587, four telephone companies sought a refund of franchise tax payments\r\ndetermined by apportioning charges from their long distance telephone service as Texas\r\nreceipts.  All the telephone companies provided both local and long distance service to\r\ntheir customers.  After considering the 1940 and 1952 Opinions and relevant case law, the\r\nComptroller held that “[r]evenues from interstate toll charges are not ‘business done in\r\nTexas.’”  In 1975, the Comptroller adopted a Franchise Tax Rule identical in its import to\r\nthe Rule applicable here, <i>i.e.,</i> “[r]eceipts of a telephone company in Texas from interstate\r\ncalls are not Texas receipts.”  Comptroller Rule 3.51 (1976).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  <i>Accord </i>Comptroller Rule\r\n3.403(c)(2) (1979).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In 1983, the Comptroller adopted a Franchise Tax Rule similar to the 1952 Opinion\r\nas follows:  “[b]usiness within this state also includes fixed periodic access and equipment\r\ncharges for equipment located in Texas whether used for intrastate or interstate\r\ncommunications.” <i>See </i>Comptroller Rule 3.56 (1983).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  And, in conformity therewith, the\r\nComptroller responded to a request by Bell for clarification in 1989 with a Letter Ruling\r\nstating:   “access charges [are] for intrastate service, for access to the local network by the\r\nlong distance carrier.  These are not charges for interstate service provided by\r\nSouthwestern Bell.”  Comptroller Letter Ruling (1989).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In three successive Letter Rulings, the Comptroller adhered to its policy that access\r\nservice charges for use of a telephone company’s local network and facilities were Texas\r\nreceipts.  Comptroller Letter Ruling (1998); Comptroller Letter Ruling (1994); Comproller\r\nLetter Ruling (1992).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Thus, since the adoption of Franchise Tax Rule 3.56 in 1983, the\r\nComptroller consistently treated access charges as intrastate services—Texas receipts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>However, in 2000, the Comptroller differentiated between the apportionment of\r\naccess charges paid by IXCs and EUCLs for franchise tax purposes finding that access\r\ncharges paid to LECs by IXCs were non-Texas receipts while access charges paid to LECs\r\nby end users, EUCLs, remained Texas receipts.  <i>See</i> Tex. Comp. Pub. Acct’s. Hearing No.\r\n35,677 (2000).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  In an earlier unrelated proceeding, Hearing No. 35,677, the Comptroller\r\ndetermined that, under a literal translation of Rule 3.557(e)(39), access charges paid by\r\nIXCs to LECs were “revenue from an interstate telephone call” because IXCs incurred an\r\naccess charge when an actual interstate telephone call was made,<i> i.e., </i>the access charge\r\nwas based on the interstate minutes of use of the LEC’s network by the IXC.  *19-20.  On\r\nthe other hand, the Comptroller determined EUCLs paid by end users to LECs were not\r\n“revenue from an interstate telephone call” because LECs billed EUCLs even if no\r\ninterstate telephone call was made by or to the customer,<i> i.e., </i>the EUCL was a fixed\r\ncharge to all telephone customers to compensate LECs for use of the network to be able\r\nto place and receive interstate telephone calls. *19-20.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Thus, in 1972, the Comptroller initially recognized the policy that revenues from\r\ninterstate long distance calls were not “business done in Texas,” and, in 1975, adopted a\r\nconforming franchise tax Rule, <i>i.e.</i>, receipts “from interstate calls are not Texas receipts.” \r\nSince 1983, the Comptroller consistently recognized through Rule, Letter Rulings, and\r\nadjudication that EUCLs were not “revenue from an interstate telephone call” but\r\napportionable under the franchise tax statutes as Texas receipts.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>3.<span>       </span><i>Interstate Commerce – Analogous Texas and Federal Cases</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Analogous case law also supports the proposition originally stated in the 1952\r\nOpinion that underlies the Comptroller’s subsequent Rules, Letter Rulings, and\r\nAdjudicatory Ruling related to EUCLs.  That is, where a service contract is for the use of\r\ntelephone facilities located in Texas, performance of the contract is intrastate.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>For instance, in <i>Clark v. Atlantic Pipe Line Co.</i>, 134 S.W.2d 322\r\n(Tex.Civ.App.–Austin 1939, writ ref’d), oil shippers contracted directly with Atlantic Pipe\r\nLine (“Atlantic”) to ship oil from locations in Texas and other states to Texas Gulf ports\r\nwhere the oil was to be loaded onto ocean-going vessels and shipped to other states or\r\nforeign countries.  <i>Id.</i> at 324-25.  Although recognizing that the phrase “business done in\r\nTexas” was “broad enough to include that segregated portion of interstate business which\r\nis wholly performed within the State,” the court held that Texas could not tax Atlantic’s\r\nproceeds from shipping oil in, or through, Texas because the oil’s shipment would not be\r\ncompleted until it reached another state or foreign country. <i> Id</i>. at 328.  The court held as\r\nfollows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>We hold that the language, “business done in Texas,” as employed in this\r\nstatute was intended to mean business begun and completed in Texas, and\r\nnot business begun in Texas and completed in some other state or foreign\r\nnation, or vice versa.  In other words, that it means intrastate business.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><i>Id.</i>  </span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Thus, Atlantic engaged in “interstate business” by contracting directly with oil\r\nshippers to ship their oil through its pipeline located in Texas to an ocean vessel destined\r\nfor delivery in another state or foreign country.  Atlantic’s “business” was not providing the\r\noil shippers with access to, or leasing, its pipeline in order for the oil shippers to ship the\r\noil themselves.  In the first instance, Atlantic is engaged in interstate commerce because\r\nthe “business” of shipping the oil is not complete until the oil is delivered in another state\r\nor country.  In the second instance, Atlantic would be engaged in intrastate commerce\r\nbecause the “business” of providing access to, or leasing, facilities in Texas begins and\r\nends with the facilities in Texas.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><i>Bullock v. Enserch Exploration, Inc.</i>, 614 S.W.2d 215 (Tex.Civ.App.–Austin 1981,\r\nwrit ref’d n.r.e.), <i>cert. denied</i>, 455 U.S. 946, 102 S.Ct. 1445, 71 L.Ed.2d 659 (1982), is also\r\ninstructive.  In <i>Bullock</i>,  the “critical issue [was] whether [Enserch’s] sale of natural gas with\r\ndeliveries [by pipeline] in Texas to interstate companies for resale outside of Texas\r\nconstituted “business done in Texas.”  <i>Id. </i>at 216.  The court held that the sale of gas by\r\na Texas gas company to an interstate pipeline company for resale outside of Texas\r\nrepresented “gross receipts from its business in Texas.”  614 S.W.2d at 217.  Enserch had\r\nneither a contract for the sale of gas to an out-of-state purchaser nor a contract to ship gas\r\nproduced in Texas out of state.  There simply was no interstate component to Enserch’s\r\nbusiness – Texas gas was shipped and sold in Texas.</span></p>\r\n<p><span>  <span>         </span>United States Supreme Court opinions determining what business constitutes\r\n“interstate commerce” are also instructive.  <i>See Atlantic Pipe Line Co.</i>, 134 S.W.2d at 327. \r\nFor instance, in <i>People of State of New York ex rel. Pennsylvania R.R. Co. v. Knight, </i>192\r\nU.S. 21, 24 S.Ct. 202, 48 L.Ed. 325 (1904), a company operating a ferry located in New\r\nYork established a cab stand at the ferry station whose sole business was to bring the\r\ncompany’s passengers to and from the ferry. <i> </i>192 U.S. at 22 .  Charges for the taxi service\r\nwere separate from the company’s charges for further transportation by ferry across state\r\nlines, and no part of the receipts from the cab service were received as compensation for\r\nany service outside the State of New York.  <i>Id.  </i>The <i>Knight </i>court held that the cab service\r\nwas “an independent local service, preliminary or subsequent to any interstate\r\ntransportation” constituting intrastate commerce. <i> Id.</i> at  26-28.  The <i>Knight </i>court reasoned\r\nas follows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>As we have seen, the cab service is rendered wholly within the state, and\r\nhas no contractual or necessary relation to interstate transportation.  It is\r\neither preliminary or subsequent thereto.  It is independently contracted for,\r\nand not necessarily connected therewith.  But when service is wholly within\r\na state, it is presumably subject to state control.  The burden is on him who\r\nasserts that, though actually within, it is legally outside, the state; and unless\r\nthe interstate character is established, locality determines the questions of\r\njurisdiction.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><i>Id.</i> at 27.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Here, like <i>Knight</i>, Bell’s access services are independently contracted for and wholly\r\nperformed in Texas.  Moreover, because Bell was required to provide network access to\r\nall its customers seeking local or long distance service, it was legally prohibited at the time\r\nfrom engaging in <i>any </i>long distance service or competing with any long distance carrier and\r\ncharged its customers EUCLs whether they made or received any long distance calls, its\r\nservice did not bear any necessary relation or connection to the provision of any interstate\r\nlong distance telephone service.  Bell’s network facilities were mere instrumentalities of\r\ncommerce whereby Bell exacted a fee for its customers’ use of its lines and switches\r\nlocated in Texas to complete their long distance telephone business with an IXC.  As such,\r\nBell’s service is intrastate; <i>see Detroit International Bridge Co. v. Corporation Tax Appeal\r\nBoard of Michigan</i>, 294 U.S. 83, 85, 55 S.Ct. 332, 79 L.Ed. 777 (1935) (toll bridge is an\r\n“instrumentality which others may use in conducting foreign commerce”); <i>Henderson\r\nBridge Co. v. Kentucky</i>, 166 U.S. 150, 153-54, 17 S.Ct. 532, 41 L.Ed. 953 (1897),</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> <i>i.e.</i>,\r\nBell’s  local service customers and IXCs merely paid Bell for the privilege of using its Texas\r\nfacilities so that they, in turn, could engage in interstate commerce<i>.  Id.</i></span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span><i>  </i>Accordingly, we\r\nfind as reasonable the Comptroller’s <i>ad hoc </i>rule recognized in the 2000 Hearing and\r\napplied here.     </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In addition, where, as here, the Comptroller has adopted an <i>ad hoc </i>rule that has a\r\nretroactive effect, <i>Grocers Supply Company, Inc. v. Sharp, </i>978 S.W.2d 638, 643-44\r\n(Tex.App.–Austin 1998, pet. denied), “the reviewing court must also determine whether\r\napplication of the new policy to a party who relied on the old is so unfair as to be arbitrary\r\nand capricious.”  <i>Microcomputer Technology Institute v. Riley</i>, 139 F.3d 1044, 1050 (5<sup>th</sup> Cir.\r\n1998) (citing 1 K. Davis &amp; R. Pierce, Jr., Administrative Law Treatise § 3.5 at 120 (1994)). \r\nBecause the Comptroller’s <i>ad hoc </i>rule is consistent with the Attorney General’s\r\nlongstanding interpretation rendered in the 1952 Opinion, agency policy interpretations\r\nsince 1983 and applicable state and federal caselaw, we find the retroactive application\r\nof the <i>ad hoc </i>rule regarding LECs non-exempt status for access charges is not “so unfair\r\nas to be arbitrary and capricious.”  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell contends the access charges are “revenues from interstate calls” because an\r\ninterstate long distance call cannot originate or terminate without access to Bell’s local loop\r\nand long distance calls are by nature uninterrupted transmissions of an electronic signal. \r\nHowever, under these circumstances, whether a voice transmission may be uninterrupted\r\nis a distinction without a difference<i>.  See Knight</i>, 192 U.S. at 26-28; <i>Bullock</i>, 613 S.W.2d\r\nat 216-17. When state taxation of activities or property within a state is at issue, “[i]t is no\r\nlonger a question of actual interruption of the operation of commerce,” and the fact that the\r\ninterstate activities could not be conducted without the local activities is not conclusive. \r\n<i>Memphis Natural Gas Co. v. Stone, </i>335 U.S. 80, 95-96, 68 S.Ct. 1475, 92 L.Ed.2d 1832\r\n(1948).  “Rather, a prohibited tax exaction is one beyond the power of the state because\r\nthe taxable event is outside its boundaries or for a privilege the state cannot grant.”  <i>Id</i>. \r\nHere, the privilege to conduct business in Texas is a privilege Texas can grant and the\r\ntaxable event is confined to Texas – payment of a service charge to Bell by a Texas\r\ncustomer for the use of, or access to, Bell’s facilities located in Texas. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span> Moreover, the FCC’s interpretation of the nature of the “interconnection” provided\r\nby Bell when granting access to its network also supports this result.  As discussed earlier,\r\nduring the relevant time period, Bell was required to provide local telephone service and/or\r\noffer local access for long-distance service.  <i>See </i>47 U.S.C. § 153 (2001).  This duty\r\nincluded providing for an “interconnection” between Bell’s network and the “facilities and\r\nequipment” of IXCs.  <i>See</i> <i>id. </i>at § 15.  The FCC has interpreted the term “interconnection”\r\nto be the “physical linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic.”  <i>Competitive\r\nTelecommunications Ass’n v. F.C.C.</i>, 117 F.3d 1068, 1071-72 (8<sup>th</sup> Cir. 1997).  <i>See\r\nSouthwestern Bell Telephone, L.P. v. Missouri Public Service Com’n</i>, 530 F.3d 676, 684\r\n(8<sup>th</sup> Cir. 2008).  The FCC’s interpretation of the term “interconnection” does not include the\r\ntransmission or routing of telephone calls.  <i>Competitive Telecommunications Ass’n, </i>117\r\nF.3d at 1071-72.  Thus, Bell offers IXCs access to its telephone exchange service or\r\nfacilities “for the <i>purpose</i> of origination and termination of telephone toll service.”  47\r\nU.S.C. § 153(a)(16) (2001) (emphasis added).  Although the access service Bell offers to\r\nits local customers may also include the transmission of their calls over its local network\r\nto the IXC’s POP,</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> for practical and business purposes, Bell’s transmission ceases when\r\nits service is completed at the IXC’s POP where Bell “interconnects” with the IXC’s long\r\ndistance facilities.  Thus, the EUCLs and special access charges are local charges for a\r\nservice that begins at the local customers’ premises and ends at the IXC’s POP in Texas,\r\n<i>i.e</i>., begins and ends in Texas.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Although the parties acknowledge that an “interstate telephone call is a complete\r\nend-to-end communication that crosses state lines,” Bell’s access service is not a part of\r\nthe interstate service provided by the IXC.  In a business and practical sense, Bell leases\r\nits network to its customer for the purpose of originating and terminating long distance\r\ncalls. Moreover, Bell supplies no more than an “interconnection” at the IXC’s POP and\r\ndoes not transmit or share in the IXC’s transmission of the call across state lines.  Bell’s\r\naccess service is completed when its local customer’s call reaches the IXC’s POP, and\r\nagain, when Bell’s lines pick up the return signal at the IXC’s POP and transports the signal\r\nto the customer’s premises.  As such, Bell’s role is prepatory and incidental to any\r\ninterstate commerce being conducted between the IXC and its customer.  Although the\r\ntelecommunications industry is highly technical, we must not lose sight of the fact that\r\n“taxation is a practical matter, and that what constitutes commerce, manufacture, or\r\nproduction is to be determined upon practical considerations.”  <i>Utah Power &amp; Light Co.</i>,\r\n286 U.S. at 178-79. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell also asserts the access charges are interstate rather than intrastate because\r\naccess charges are federally tariffed charges created under the auspices of the FCC. \r\nHowever, there is no federal mandate giving the FCC exclusive jurisdiction over the\r\nregulation or taxation of telecommunications companies.  Simply because the FCC\r\nregulates telephone companies does not mean that the regulated activities are solely, or\r\nnecessarily, interstate.  Congress may regulate purely intrastate telephone activity to\r\nprotect interstate commerce.  <i>See United States v. Lopez</i>, 514 U.S. 549, 558, 115 S.Ct.\r\n1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995); <i>United States v. Gilbert</i>, 181 F.3d 152, 158 (1<sup>st</sup> Cir. 1999)\r\n(discussing the “long standing” line of cases holding Congress may regulate purely\r\nintrastate telephone activity under the Commerce Clause).  Moreover, the Federal\r\nTelecommunications Act of 1996 disclaims authority over state taxation.  110 Stat. 56, 144\r\n(“nothing in this Act . . . shall be construed to modify, impair, or supersede . . . any State\r\nor local law pertaining to taxation”).  “Federal regulation does not preclude state taxation\r\nand state taxation does not preclude federal regulation.”  <i>Polish Nat. Alliance of United\r\nStates v. N.L.R.B.</i>, 322 U.S. 643, 649, 64 S.Ct. 1196, 88 L.Ed. 1509 (1944).  Thus, we\r\ndecline to disturb the Comptroller’s determination that, while the FCC’s regulation and\r\nclassification of access charges is informative, it is not determinative.  <i>See </i>Comp. Pub.\r\nAcct’s Hearing No. 35,677, *20 (2000).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>C.<span>       </span>Operator Assistance Service Charges</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell also asserts that its revenues from operator assistance charges are revenues\r\nfrom “interstate calls” or “calls in interstate commerce.”  These services primarily involve\r\ndirectory assistance, busy interrupt, and zero transfer operator assistance.  As described\r\nby Bell’s corporate representative on deposition, these “miscellaneous services [are]\r\nassociated with [a customer] trying to make or place an interstate call.”  They are pay-per-use charges for the use of Bell’s facilities and personnel located in Texas.  As such, these\r\nservice charges do not represent revenue from a “call,” either intrastate or interstate.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell urges this Court to adopt a rule whereby its access service and operator\r\nassistance receipts would be excluded from apportionment as Texas receipts so long as\r\nthey <i>enable</i> customers to make “interstate calls” or “calls in interstate commerce.”</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Bell’s\r\nproposed rule would require an amendment to the Comptroller’s Rule and eviscerate the\r\nexisting exemptions – “receipts <i>that enable </i>interstate calls” is a far more expansive\r\nexemption than “receipts <i>from</i> interstate calls.”  Bell has failed to meet its burden of proof\r\nin establishing that these access and operator assistance charges are exempt from\r\napportionment as Texas receipts.<span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Accordingly, Bell’s first issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>IV.<span>      </span>Equal Protection</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell argues that apportioning its access and operator assistance charges as Texas\r\nreceipts for franchise tax purposes violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United\r\nStates Constitution.  U.S. Const. amend. XIV.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Bell asserts that, although it is similarly\r\nsituated, IXCs and transportation companies receive preferential treatment because their\r\nreceipts from intrastate “legs” of interstate telephone service and/or transportation are not\r\napportioned as Texas receipts.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Bell also contends that LECs are similar to IXCs because\r\nthey both participate in the transmission of an interstate phone call utilizing like equipment\r\nand facilities located in Texas.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Although states generally have broad powers to impose and collect taxes,\r\nclassifications among taxpayers may not be arbitrary, unreasonable, or capricious.<i>  See\r\nHurt v. Cooper</i>, 130 Tex. 433, 110 S.W.2d 896, 901 (1937); <i>Upjohn Co. v. Rylander</i>, 38\r\nS.W.3d 600, 609 (Tex.App.–Austin 2000, pet. denied).  Although all persons falling within\r\nthe same class must be taxed alike, a classification will not be found deficient unless it has\r\nno rational basis.<i>  Upjohn</i>, 38 S.W.3d at 609<i>.</i></span></p>\r\n<p><span><i><span>          </span></i>Despite that LECs and IXCs may utilize similar equipment and facilities to transmit\r\ntelephone calls, Bell has failed to establish the lack of any rational basis for distinguishing\r\nbetween LECs and IXCs for tax purposes.  The business activities of LECs and IXCs are\r\ndissimilar because each operates in separate and distinct areas.  LECs charge local\r\ncustomers <i>and </i>IXCs<i> </i>for access to, or use of, its intrastate facilities and equipment to\r\ntransmit the call from the customer’s premises to an IXC’s POP.  Once the call reaches the\r\nIXC’s POP, the IXC then utilizes its facilities and equipment to transmit its customer’s call\r\nout of state. The customer contracts with the LEC for local service and access service to\r\ncomplete long distance calls and independently contracts with an IXC for long distance\r\nservice.  That Bell provides a different service than the IXC and Bell’s service is intrastate\r\nrather than interstate establishes rational bases for distinguishing an LEC such as Bell from\r\nIXCs for franchise tax classification purposes.  <i>See Westcott Communications, Inc.</i>, 104\r\nS.W.3d 141, 150 (Tex.App.–Austin 2003, pet. denied).  Moreover, an LEC cannot engage\r\nin the service supplied by the IXC.  Because Bell was permitted to maintain its monopoly\r\non “local” telephone service, it was legally prohibited from providing any interstate long\r\ndistance service to its local customers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Regarding transportation companies, the differences are even more striking.  Not\r\nonly do the two industries offer different services that neither can engage in on their own,\r\nthey do not utilize similar equipment or facilities.  Moreover, that telephone services may\r\nbe analogous to transportation services in the abstract is an insufficient basis for\r\ncontending there is no rational basis for differing tax classifications.  <i>See Westcott, </i>104\r\nS.W.3d at 150.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>To the extent Bell contends it is treated differently from IXCs because these services\r\nare classified by the Comptroller as intrastate rather than interstate, we have already\r\naddressed the issue.  Accordingly, Bell has failed to establish that the Comptroller makes\r\nan arbitrary and unreasonable distinction between these taxpayers and issue two is also\r\noverruled.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>V.<span>       </span>Summary Judgment Evidence</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell contends the trial court improperly excluded non-expert testimony in the\r\nsummary judgment proceedings below.  While Bell notes the Comptroller objected to\r\n“selected testimony” of two witnesses, Bell does not identify the specific testimony\r\nimproperly excluded by the trial court and states, “[t]he trial court improperly sustained\r\n<i>some</i> of these objections.”  Bell did not file a written response to the Comptroller’s\r\nobjections nor move for reconsideration of the trial court’s decision to sustain the\r\nComptroller’s objections to the affidavits of the two witnesses.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>An appellant bears the burden of bringing forth a record that demonstrates the trial\r\ncourt abused its discretion when it sustained an appellee’s objections to the summary\r\njudgment evidence<i>.  Cantu v. Horany</i>, 195 S.W.3d 867, 871 (Tex.App.–Dallas 2006, no\r\npet.)  Where the record fails to show that a party objected to the trial court’s ruling\r\nsustaining an opponent’s objection to his or her summary judgment evidence, the party has\r\nnot preserved the right to complain on appeal about the trial court’s ruling. <i> Id</i>.   </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Because Bell objects to “some” but not all of the possible grounds for the trial court’s\r\nruling that sustained the objection, Bell has waived the issue.  <i>See Malone v.

Moreover, there\r\nis nothing in the record to show that Bell filed a written response to the Comptroller’s\r\nwritten Objections to Plaintiff’s Summary Judgment Evidence nor filed a motion for\r\nreconsideration of the trial court’s order sustaining the Comptroller’s objections.  Neither\r\nwere Bell’s issues preserved.

The trial court granted\r\nthe State’s motion and denied Bell’s motion.  Bell appeals the trial court’s ruling and seeks\r\nsummary judgment in its favor.  In support, Bell asserts the trial court erred in finding (1)\r\nBell’s end user common line charges, special access charges, and operator assistance\r\ncharges are Texas receipts for state franchise tax apportionment purposes; (2) the\r\nComptroller’s application of the franchise tax apportionment statute and rules to Bell did\r\nnot violate equal protection guarantees; and (3) certain testimony by Bell’s experts was\r\nproperly excluded.

Bell was a BOC and provided\r\ntelecommunications services for customers physically located in Kansas, Arkansas,\r\nOklahoma, Missouri, and Texas.  The United States was then divided into 161 Local\r\nAccess Transport Areas (LATAs)</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> within which BOCs were permitted to operate and\r\nprovide local telephone service.  154 F.3d at 231.  Within each LATA were local exchange\r\ncarriers (LECs)</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> that connected their customers’ telephones to their  networks and facilities. \r\nBell operates as an LEC in LATAs in Texas and other states.   <span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Because the MFJ permitted BOCs and/or LECs to retain their state-regulated, local\r\nservice monopolies, they became subject to various restrictions on their lines of business. \r\nThe restrictions were intended to ensure that the BOCs would not use their monopoly\r\ncontrol over LECs to impede competition in other markets.  <i>United States v.

For instance, an LEC might find it particularly easy\r\nto attract local customers to contract for its long distance service and use its control of local\r\nservice to place its long distance competitors at a disadvantage.  <i>Iowa Utilities Board, </i>525\r\nU.S. at 416.  Thus, one such restriction prohibited LECs from offering any long distance\r\nservice between LATAs, or interLATA service.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  <i>See Id.; SBC Communications, </i>154 F.3d\r\nat 230; <i>Western Elec.

Southwestern Bell Telephone Co.</i><span>, </span><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></span>, 521-22 (Tex. 2006).  Under the MFJ, each LEC was allowed to transmit\r\ntelecommunications information only between points within a single LATA, providing what\r\nis, basically, the traditional local telephone service.  The MFJ required LECs to provide\r\ntheir customers and IXCs equal exchange access</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> to their network facilities for the purpose\r\nof permitting IXCs to carry on their long distance telephone business. <span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Thus, when a customer dialed a number in another LATA, the customer’s LEC\r\nwould first transmit the signal to an IXC’s Point of Presence (POP).  In a typical interLATA\r\nlong distance call, the originating caller’s LEC transports the signal from the caller’s\r\ntelephone over the local loop</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> to the LEC’s central office where the call is switched and\r\ntransported by a trunk line to the IXC’s POP.  This occurs nearly instantaneously. <i>\r\n</i>Typically, the LEC has switched the caller to their IXC before the caller has completed\r\ndialing the long distance number.  Once the signal reaches the IXC’s long distance switch,\r\nthe IXC then switches the signal to its trunk facilities for transmission out-of-state to the\r\nlocal switch of a second LEC serving the receiving party.  The second LEC switches the\r\nsignal to its local loop and ultimately the call is received.  The second LEC then reverses\r\nthe process and a circuit is established over which the two parties can communicate.<span></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span>III.<span>      </span>Access and Operator Charges</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>An IXC’s cost of replicating Bell’s local network and facilities to provide long distance\r\nservice from the LEC’s premises was prohibitive.  Thus, IXCs needed access to Bell’s\r\nnetwork in order to sell long distance services to their customers, and the IXC’s customers\r\nneeded access to the LEC’s network to complete long distance services purchased from\r\nIXCs.  To recompense Bell for costs associated with maintaining its facilities and\r\nequipment utilized by IXCs and the IXCs’ customers, the Federal Communications\r\nCommission</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  adopted uniform access charge rules.  The FCC’s rules required LECs to\r\nrecord their revenues in accordance with specified accounting rules and deposit accounts,\r\ndetermine what fraction of the LEC’s regulated expenses and investments in its facilities\r\nor network should be allocated to providing interstate access, and set charges or tariffs</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>Bell could charge its customers and IXCs.  <i>See </i>Access Charge Reform, CC Docket No.\r\n96-262, First Report and Order, 12 FCC Red 15982, 15998-99 (1997) (<i>Access Charge\r\nReform Order</i>), <i>aff’d</i>, <i>Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v.

Because Bell conducted business inside and outside of Texas, its franchise tax\r\nwas calculated by an apportionment formula.  Its company-wide taxable capital (net worth)\r\nand taxable earned surplus (net income) were apportioned between Bell’s business done\r\nin Texas and business done elsewhere to obtain a correct assessment of Texas franchise\r\ntaxes.  This calculation and the resulting effect of having a larger proportion of gross\r\nreceipts from business done in Texas may be stated as follows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Simply described, “net taxable earned surplus” is determined by (1) adjusting\r\nthe amount of a corporate taxpayer’s federal taxable income to yield “taxable\r\nearned surplus,” (2) “apportioning” or attributing the taxable earned surplus\r\nto Texas; and (3) subtracting various allowable deductions from the\r\napportioned taxable earned surplus.  Tex. Tax Code Ann. § 171.110(a)\r\n(West Supp. 2004). . . .</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span>Under tax code sections 171.106 and 171.110(2), taxable earned surplus is\r\nto be “apportioned” to Texas by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of\r\nwhich is the corporation’s “gross receipts from business done in this state,”\r\nas determined under section 171.1032, tax code, and the denominator of\r\nwhich is the corporation’s “gross receipts from its entire business,” as\r\ndetermined under section 171.1051.  Id. at §§ 171.106(b), 171.110(a)(2).\r\n[footnote omitted].  Thus, the larger the corporation’s “gross receipts from\r\nbusiness done in this state,” the larger the apportionment factor, and the\r\nlarger percentage of its taxable earned surplus is subject to the franchise tax.<i></i></span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><i>Anderson-Clayton Bros.

If Bell shows that more of its receipts\r\nin any tax year were not “gross receipts for business done in Texas” or were subject to an\r\nexemption from apportionment as Texas receipts, then the lesser the apportionment factor\r\nand consequently the lesser percentage of its taxable earned surplus is subject to the\r\nTexas franchise tax, <i>i.e.,</i> Bell owes less state franchise taxes.  Conversely, if the opposite\r\nis true, then the larger the apportionment factor and the greater its taxable earned surplus\r\nsubject to the Texas franchise tax.  Doing more business in Texas generally results in\r\nhigher franchise taxes. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><i><span>          </span></i>The earned surplus apportionment statute in existence between 1995-2001 provided\r\nthat Texas receipts are from “business done in Texas” as follows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>171.1032.

The Comptroller established the following exemption when\r\napportioning the taxable capital (net worth) component of the franchise tax for telephone\r\ncompanies as follows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Telephone company receipts.

Bell also contends\r\nthese charges are exempt from apportionment as Texas receipts because they constitute\r\n“receipts from interstate calls” or “revenues from calls in interstate commerce.”  <i>See </i>34\r\nTex. Admin. Code § 3.549(e)(43); § 3.557(e)(39).  Bell next asserts that apportioning its\r\naccess and operator assistance charges as Texas receipts violates equal protection\r\nguarantees because Bell does not receive preferential tax treatment received by IXCs and\r\ntransportation companies under the Comptroller’s Rules.  Finally, Bell contends that the\r\ntrial court improperly excluded some of its summary judgment evidence. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>I.<span>        </span>Standard of Review</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>When, as here, parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, each party in\r\nsupport of its motion necessarily takes the position that there is no genuine issue of fact\r\nin the case and that it is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  <i>City of Pflugerville v.\r\nCapital Metropolitan Transp.

Bell also asserts that providing access for an\r\ninterstate, long distance call is inseparable from the call itself because the call is technically\r\nan uninterrupted transmission across state lines and Bell’s local loop is necessary to the\r\norigination and termination of such calls.  Accordingly, the validity of Bell’s assertion hinges\r\nupon whether its access service revenue is revenue from interstate calls or commerce.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span>     <span>      </span><span>1.<span>       </span>1933-1952 – Early Attorney General Opinions </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Our analysis begins with two Attorney General Opinions both of which address the\r\nissue before us prior to the adoption of the Comptroller’s Rule exempting interstate calls\r\nin 1975.  In January 1940, the Attorney General was asked for a determination whether the\r\ngross receipts of domestic telephone companies from interstate calls were subject to the\r\nTexas gross receipts tax.  Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. O-1878, 1 (1940).  The domestic\r\ncompanies operated wholly within Texas and provided long distance service to their\r\ncustomers.  They transmitted interstate long distance calls over their lines to the Texas\r\nborder where their calls were picked up by another company who transmitted the calls to\r\nan out-of-state recipient.  The domestic company was paid for the use of their lines within\r\nTexas, and the out-of-state company was paid a commission for completing the call\r\noutside Texas.  <i>Id. </i>at 2.  In determining that the charges were “interstate” in nature and not\r\nsubject to state tax, the Attorney General stated:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Under the facts here, the “gross receipts” sought to be taxed, were derived\r\nnot from tolls on calls originating and ending within the confines of the State\r\nof Texas, but rather from tolls on calls originating in Texas and terminating\r\nin other states, or vice versa,  – in other words, in interstate commerce.  The\r\nfact that the telephone company in question receives only such part of the\r\ntolls as represents payment for the facilities and services furnished by it in\r\ntransmitting the call from or to the borders of the State does not prevent such\r\nreceipts from being stamped with the interstate commerce feature.      </span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><i>Id. </i>at 4.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In January 1952, the Attorney General was asked for a determination whether the\r\ngross receipts of a domestic telephone company from calls that were routed from points\r\nin Texas through New Mexico and back to Texas were subject to the Texas gross receipts\r\ntax.  Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. V-1383, 1 (1952).  The Attorney General determined that the\r\ncalls routed through New Mexico had to be “treated as transactions constituting interstate\r\ncommerce”; <i>id. </i>at 5, and opined that the gross receipts tax was inapplicable because the\r\ntax was not apportioned between the interstate and intrastate segments of the call.  <i>Id. </i>at\r\n6-7.  The 1952 Opinion also indicated that, if there was apportionment, access services\r\ncould be subject to a state tax as follows:  </span></p>\r\n<p><span>Although the gross receipts derived from the interstate business are not\r\nsubject to this tax, that portion of the receipts representing wholly intrastate\r\nbusiness which can be separated or segregated from the gross receipts is\r\nsubject to the tax.  51 Am. Jur. 777, 779, 804, Taxation, Secs. 872, 874, 907,\r\n908.  Therefore, the receipts from “loop services” and from charges <i>received\r\nunder contracts or agreements for the use of lines, equipment or facilities in\r\nTexas </i>are subject to the tax even though such services may be incidental to\r\nan interstate communication. [citation omitted].</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><i>See id.</i> (Emphasis added).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> </span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>The defining difference between the two Opinions is that, in the 1940 Opinion, the\r\nAttorney General is describing a service contract that requires transmission between two\r\nstates for its completion, and in the 1952 Opinion, the Attorney General is describing a\r\nservice contract that is fully performed within Texas.  In the 1940 Opinion, the domestic\r\ntelephone companies offered interstate long distance service to their customers and\r\ntransmitted calls across state lines to complete the long distance service.  Op. Tex. Att’y\r\nGen. No. O-1878, 1 (1940).  Because completion of the service owed by the domestic\r\ntelephone company was interstate in nature,<i> </i>its revenues were considered derived from\r\ninterstate commerce.  <i>Id.</i> at 4. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In the 1952 Opinion, the Attorney General recognized that, although the domestic\r\ntelephone company’s calls were interstate transactions, a portion of its receipts would be\r\ntaxable as Texas receipts if the state’s tax apportioned the company’s  “receipts from ‘loop\r\nservices’ and from charges received <i>under contracts or agreements for the use of lines,\r\nequipment or facilities in Texas</i>.”  Op. Tex. Att’y Gen. No. V-1383, 6-7 (1952).  In the 1952</span></p>\r\n<p><span>Opinion, the Attorney General did not describe a contract for a service to be delivered in\r\nanother state but a contract for the use of facilities and/or equipment located in Texas.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>2.<span>       </span>1972-2000 – Comptroller’s Rules and Policies </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span><span>          </span></span>In 1972, the Comptroller adopted an adjudicatory rule that “revenues from interstate\r\ntoll charges are not ‘business done in Texas.’” <i> See </i>Comptroller Hearing No. 5587 (1972).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> \r\nIn Hearing No. 5587, four telephone companies sought a refund of franchise tax payments\r\ndetermined by apportioning charges from their long distance telephone service as Texas\r\nreceipts.  All the telephone companies provided both local and long distance service to\r\ntheir customers.  After considering the 1940 and 1952 Opinions and relevant case law, the\r\nComptroller held that “[r]evenues from interstate toll charges are not ‘business done in\r\nTexas.’”  In 1975, the Comptroller adopted a Franchise Tax Rule identical in its import to\r\nthe Rule applicable here, <i>i.e.,</i> “[r]eceipts of a telephone company in Texas from interstate\r\ncalls are not Texas receipts.”  Comptroller Rule 3.51 (1976).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  <i>Accord </i>Comptroller Rule\r\n3.403(c)(2) (1979).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In 1983, the Comptroller adopted a Franchise Tax Rule similar to the 1952 Opinion\r\nas follows:  “[b]usiness within this state also includes fixed periodic access and equipment\r\ncharges for equipment located in Texas whether used for intrastate or interstate\r\ncommunications.” <i>See </i>Comptroller Rule 3.56 (1983).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  And, in conformity therewith, the\r\nComptroller responded to a request by Bell for clarification in 1989 with a Letter Ruling\r\nstating:   “access charges [are] for intrastate service, for access to the local network by the\r\nlong distance carrier.  These are not charges for interstate service provided by\r\nSouthwestern Bell.”  Comptroller Letter Ruling (1989).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>In three successive Letter Rulings, the Comptroller adhered to its policy that access\r\nservice charges for use of a telephone company’s local network and facilities were Texas\r\nreceipts.  Comptroller Letter Ruling (1998); Comptroller Letter Ruling (1994); Comproller\r\nLetter Ruling (1992).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Thus, since the adoption of Franchise Tax Rule 3.56 in 1983, the\r\nComptroller consistently treated access charges as intrastate services—Texas receipts.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>However, in 2000, the Comptroller differentiated between the apportionment of\r\naccess charges paid by IXCs and EUCLs for franchise tax purposes finding that access\r\ncharges paid to LECs by IXCs were non-Texas receipts while access charges paid to LECs\r\nby end users, EUCLs, remained Texas receipts.  <i>See</i> Tex. Comp. Pub. Acct’s. Hearing No.\r\n35,677 (2000).</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  In an earlier unrelated proceeding, Hearing No. 35,677, the Comptroller\r\ndetermined that, under a literal translation of Rule 3.557(e)(39), access charges paid by\r\nIXCs to LECs were “revenue from an interstate telephone call” because IXCs incurred an\r\naccess charge when an actual interstate telephone call was made,<i> i.e., </i>the access charge\r\nwas based on the interstate minutes of use of the LEC’s network by the IXC.  *19-20.  On\r\nthe other hand, the Comptroller determined EUCLs paid by end users to LECs were not\r\n“revenue from an interstate telephone call” because LECs billed EUCLs even if no\r\ninterstate telephone call was made by or to the customer,<i> i.e., </i>the EUCL was a fixed\r\ncharge to all telephone customers to compensate LECs for use of the network to be able\r\nto place and receive interstate telephone calls. *19-20.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Thus, in 1972, the Comptroller initially recognized the policy that revenues from\r\ninterstate long distance calls were not “business done in Texas,” and, in 1975, adopted a\r\nconforming franchise tax Rule, <i>i.e.</i>, receipts “from interstate calls are not Texas receipts.” \r\nSince 1983, the Comptroller consistently recognized through Rule, Letter Rulings, and\r\nadjudication that EUCLs were not “revenue from an interstate telephone call” but\r\napportionable under the franchise tax statutes as Texas receipts.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>3.<span>       </span><i>Interstate Commerce – Analogous Texas and Federal Cases</i></span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Analogous case law also supports the proposition originally stated in the 1952\r\nOpinion that underlies the Comptroller’s subsequent Rules, Letter Rulings, and\r\nAdjudicatory Ruling related to EUCLs.  That is, where a service contract is for the use of\r\ntelephone facilities located in Texas, performance of the contract is intrastate.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>For instance, in <i>Clark v. Atlantic Pipe Line Co.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3968101\"><a href=\"/opinion/4197444/clark-v-atlantic-pipe-line-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.W.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">322</span></a></span>\r\n(Tex.Civ.App.–Austin 1939, writ ref’d), oil shippers contracted directly with Atlantic Pipe\r\nLine (“Atlantic”) to ship oil from locations in Texas and other states to Texas Gulf ports\r\nwhere the oil was to be loaded onto ocean-going vessels and shipped to other states or\r\nforeign countries.  <i>Id.</i> at 324-25.  Although recognizing that the phrase “business done in\r\nTexas” was “broad enough to include that segregated portion of interstate business which\r\nis wholly performed within the State,” the court held that Texas could not tax Atlantic’s\r\nproceeds from shipping oil in, or through, Texas because the oil’s shipment would not be\r\ncompleted until it reached another state or foreign country. <i> Id</i>. at 328.  The court held as\r\nfollows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>We hold that the language, “business done in Texas,” as employed in this\r\nstatute was intended to mean business begun and completed in Texas, and\r\nnot business begun in Texas and completed in some other state or foreign\r\nnation, or vice versa.  In other words, that it means intrastate business.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><i>Id.</i>  </span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Thus, Atlantic engaged in “interstate business” by contracting directly with oil\r\nshippers to ship their oil through its pipeline located in Texas to an ocean vessel destined\r\nfor delivery in another state or foreign country.  Atlantic’s “business” was not providing the\r\noil shippers with access to, or leasing, its pipeline in order for the oil shippers to ship the\r\noil themselves.  In the first instance, Atlantic is engaged in interstate commerce because\r\nthe “business” of shipping the oil is not complete until the oil is delivered in another state\r\nor country.  In the second instance, Atlantic would be engaged in intrastate commerce\r\nbecause the “business” of providing access to, or leasing, facilities in Texas begins and\r\nends with the facilities in Texas.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><i>Bullock v.

Charges for the taxi service\r\nwere separate from the company’s charges for further transportation by ferry across state\r\nlines, and no part of the receipts from the cab service were received as compensation for\r\nany service outside the State of New York.  <i>Id.  </i>The <i>Knight </i>court held that the cab service\r\nwas “an independent local service, preliminary or subsequent to any interstate\r\ntransportation” constituting intrastate commerce. <i> Id.</i> at  26-28.  The <i>Knight </i>court reasoned\r\nas follows:</span></p>\r\n<p><span>As we have seen, the cab service is rendered wholly within the state, and\r\nhas no contractual or necessary relation to interstate transportation.  It is\r\neither preliminary or subsequent thereto.  It is independently contracted for,\r\nand not necessarily connected therewith.  But when service is wholly within\r\na state, it is presumably subject to state control.  The burden is on him who\r\nasserts that, though actually within, it is legally outside, the state; and unless\r\nthe interstate character is established, locality determines the questions of\r\njurisdiction.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><i>Id.</i> at 27.</span></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Here, like <i>Knight</i>, Bell’s access services are independently contracted for and wholly\r\nperformed in Texas.  Moreover, because Bell was required to provide network access to\r\nall its customers seeking local or long distance service, it was legally prohibited at the time\r\nfrom engaging in <i>any </i>long distance service or competing with any long distance carrier and\r\ncharged its customers EUCLs whether they made or received any long distance calls, its\r\nservice did not bear any necessary relation or connection to the provision of any interstate\r\nlong distance telephone service.  Bell’s network facilities were mere instrumentalities of\r\ncommerce whereby Bell exacted a fee for its customers’ use of its lines and switches\r\nlocated in Texas to complete their long distance telephone business with an IXC.

When state taxation of activities or property within a state is at issue, “[i]t is no\r\nlonger a question of actual interruption of the operation of commerce,” and the fact that the\r\ninterstate activities could not be conducted without the local activities is not conclusive. \r\n<i>Memphis Natural Gas Co. v.

As discussed earlier,\r\nduring the relevant time period, Bell was required to provide local telephone service and/or\r\noffer local access for long-distance service.  <i>See </i>47 U.S.C. § 153 (2001).  This duty\r\nincluded providing for an “interconnection” between Bell’s network and the “facilities and\r\nequipment” of IXCs.  <i>See</i> <i>id. </i>at § 15.  The FCC has interpreted the term “interconnection”\r\nto be the “physical linking of two networks for the mutual exchange of traffic.”  <i>Competitive\r\nTelecommunications Ass’n v.

The FCC’s interpretation of the term “interconnection” does not include the\r\ntransmission or routing of telephone calls.  <i>Competitive Telecommunications Ass’n, </i>117\r\nF.3d at 1071-72.  Thus, Bell offers IXCs access to its telephone exchange service or\r\nfacilities “for the <i>purpose</i> of origination and termination of telephone toll service.”  47\r\nU.S.C. § 153(a)(16) (2001) (emphasis added).  Although the access service Bell offers to\r\nits local customers may also include the transmission of their calls over its local network\r\nto the IXC’s POP,</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span> for practical and business purposes, Bell’s transmission ceases when\r\nits service is completed at the IXC’s POP where Bell “interconnects” with the IXC’s long\r\ndistance facilities.  Thus, the EUCLs and special access charges are local charges for a\r\nservice that begins at the local customers’ premises and ends at the IXC’s POP in Texas,\r\n<i>i.e</i>., begins and ends in Texas.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Although the parties acknowledge that an “interstate telephone call is a complete\r\nend-to-end communication that crosses state lines,” Bell’s access service is not a part of\r\nthe interstate service provided by the IXC.  In a business and practical sense, Bell leases\r\nits network to its customer for the purpose of originating and terminating long distance\r\ncalls. Moreover, Bell supplies no more than an “interconnection” at the IXC’s POP and\r\ndoes not transmit or share in the IXC’s transmission of the call across state lines.  Bell’s\r\naccess service is completed when its local customer’s call reaches the IXC’s POP, and\r\nagain, when Bell’s lines pick up the return signal at the IXC’s POP and transports the signal\r\nto the customer’s premises.  As such, Bell’s role is prepatory and incidental to any\r\ninterstate commerce being conducted between the IXC and its customer.  Although the\r\ntelecommunications industry is highly technical, we must not lose sight of the fact that\r\n“taxation is a practical matter, and that what constitutes commerce, manufacture, or\r\nproduction is to be determined upon practical considerations.”  <i>Utah Power &amp; Light Co.</i>,\r\n286 U.S. at 178-79. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell also asserts the access charges are interstate rather than intrastate because\r\naccess charges are federally tariffed charges created under the auspices of the FCC. \r\nHowever, there is no federal mandate giving the FCC exclusive jurisdiction over the\r\nregulation or taxation of telecommunications companies.  Simply because the FCC\r\nregulates telephone companies does not mean that the regulated activities are solely, or\r\nnecessarily, interstate.  Congress may regulate purely intrastate telephone activity to\r\nprotect interstate commerce.  <i>See United States v.

Thus, we\r\ndecline to disturb the Comptroller’s determination that, while the FCC’s regulation and\r\nclassification of access charges is informative, it is not determinative.  <i>See </i>Comp.

As described\r\nby Bell’s corporate representative on deposition, these “miscellaneous services [are]\r\nassociated with [a customer] trying to make or place an interstate call.”  They are pay-per-use charges for the use of Bell’s facilities and personnel located in Texas.  As such, these\r\nservice charges do not represent revenue from a “call,” either intrastate or interstate.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell urges this Court to adopt a rule whereby its access service and operator\r\nassistance receipts would be excluded from apportionment as Texas receipts so long as\r\nthey <i>enable</i> customers to make “interstate calls” or “calls in interstate commerce.”</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n<span>  Bell’s\r\nproposed rule would require an amendment to the Comptroller’s Rule and eviscerate the\r\nexisting exemptions – “receipts <i>that enable </i>interstate calls” is a far more expansive\r\nexemption than “receipts <i>from</i> interstate calls.”  Bell has failed to meet its burden of proof\r\nin establishing that these access and operator assistance charges are exempt from\r\napportionment as Texas receipts.<span> </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Accordingly, Bell’s first issue is overruled.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>IV.<span>      </span>Equal Protection</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell argues that apportioning its access and operator assistance charges as Texas\r\nreceipts for franchise tax purposes violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United\r\nStates Constitution.

Although all persons falling within\r\nthe same class must be taxed alike, a classification will not be found deficient unless it has\r\nno rational basis.<i>  Upjohn</i>, 38 S.W.3d at 609<i>.</i></span></p>\r\n<p><span><i><span>          </span></i>Despite that LECs and IXCs may utilize similar equipment and facilities to transmit\r\ntelephone calls, Bell has failed to establish the lack of any rational basis for distinguishing\r\nbetween LECs and IXCs for tax purposes.  The business activities of LECs and IXCs are\r\ndissimilar because each operates in separate and distinct areas.  LECs charge local\r\ncustomers <i>and </i>IXCs<i> </i>for access to, or use of, its intrastate facilities and equipment to\r\ntransmit the call from the customer’s premises to an IXC’s POP.  Once the call reaches the\r\nIXC’s POP, the IXC then utilizes its facilities and equipment to transmit its customer’s call\r\nout of state. The customer contracts with the LEC for local service and access service to\r\ncomplete long distance calls and independently contracts with an IXC for long distance\r\nservice.  That Bell provides a different service than the IXC and Bell’s service is intrastate\r\nrather than interstate establishes rational bases for distinguishing an LEC such as Bell from\r\nIXCs for franchise tax classification purposes.  <i>See Westcott Communications, Inc.</i>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1616159\"><a href=\"/opinion/1616159/westcott-communications-inc-v-strayhorn/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span>\r\n<span class=\"reporter\">S.W.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">141</span></a></span>, 150 (Tex.App.–Austin 2003, pet. denied).  Moreover, an LEC cannot engage\r\nin the service supplied by the IXC.  Because Bell was permitted to maintain its monopoly\r\non “local” telephone service, it was legally prohibited from providing any interstate long\r\ndistance service to its local customers. </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Regarding transportation companies, the differences are even more striking.  Not\r\nonly do the two industries offer different services that neither can engage in on their own,\r\nthey do not utilize similar equipment or facilities.  Moreover, that telephone services may\r\nbe analogous to transportation services in the abstract is an insufficient basis for\r\ncontending there is no rational basis for differing tax classifications.  <i>See Westcott, </i>104\r\nS.W.3d at 150.</span>\r\n\r\n\r\n</p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>To the extent Bell contends it is treated differently from IXCs because these services\r\nare classified by the Comptroller as intrastate rather than interstate, we have already\r\naddressed the issue.  Accordingly, Bell has failed to establish that the Comptroller makes\r\nan arbitrary and unreasonable distinction between these taxpayers and issue two is also\r\noverruled.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span><span>V.<span>       </span>Summary Judgment Evidence</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>Bell contends the trial court improperly excluded non-expert testimony in the\r\nsummary judgment proceedings below.  While Bell notes the Comptroller objected to\r\n“selected testimony” of two witnesses, Bell does not identify the specific testimony\r\nimproperly excluded by the trial court and states, “[t]he trial court improperly sustained\r\n<i>some</i> of these objections.”  Bell did not file a written response to the Comptroller’s\r\nobjections nor move for reconsideration of the trial court’s decision to sustain the\r\nComptroller’s objections to the affidavits of the two witnesses.  </span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>          </span>An appellant bears the burden of bringing forth a record that demonstrates the trial\r\ncourt abused its discretion when it sustained an appellee’s objections to the summary\r\njudgment evidence<i>.
