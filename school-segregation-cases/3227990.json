Those statutes also \"provide for deferred taxation by charging a lower-than-normal rate while land is used in an approved manner and recapturing all or part of the reduction when the land is converted to another use.\" Note, J.L.

The theory underlying those enactments is that lower taxes will prevent the sale and conversion of the land to more intensive use. Note, J.L. Ref. 429.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs and the citizens of the town of Guilford are obviously divided on the issue of their open space amendment and the tax preference it entails. \"[T]axation is an intensely practical matter.\"<em>State Tax Commission</em> v. <em>Gales,</em> <cross_reference>222 Md. 543</cross_reference>,<cross_reference>560</cross_reference>. But to paraphrase Holmes, J., the task of the law is the drawing of lines. In so doing, it is possible to commit errors of judgment in the accommodation of principle, but perhaps this is the best that the law can afford. <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Wisconsin,</em><cross_reference>270 U.S. 230</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>241</cross_reference> (dissenting opinion). As one commentator put it, \"[a] preferential tax raises a controversial <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 57</span> \npolitical issue, as any tax favoritism would. However, it is not unreasonable for the general body politic to support preferential taxation of open land. Support would be reasonable where land use is controlled and the community is serious and careful about planning, so that the landowner cannot remove the restriction virtually at his discretion. True, the speculative value of the land may still be realized, but it also may not be, and the public, not the landowner, determines when. Furthermore, preferential taxation for open land does not seem grossly unfair when the benefit theory of taxation is applied. Clearly, open land places a comparatively light burden on schools, police and fire departments, and the many other governmental facilities conventionally supported by the property tax. If the public, in its need for open space and its need to control sprawl, seriously restricts the right to convert the land to a higher use, it seems only fair that the public should pay by way of a tax preference for that it has gained.\" Hagman, op. cit., 639-40.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs ask the court to declare &#167; <cross_reference>12-504a</cross_reference>\nunconstitutional as violative of the equal protection clause of the <cross_reference>fourteenth</cross_reference> amendment of the United States constitution. They argue that the ten-year decrease in the conveyance tax bears no rational relationship to the legislative goal of &#167; <cross_reference>12-107a</cross_reference>, and that the ten-year decrease discriminates, without reason, on the length of the ownership of the land. The plaintiffs also make an equal protection argument against Guilford's open space amendment and ask that &#167; <cross_reference>12-107e</cross_reference> be struck down.</p>\n<p>It has been suggested that there is no federal constitutional basis for a challenge to the Connecticut preferential assessment scheme. The equal protection clause of the <cross_reference>fourteenth</cross_reference> amendment merely requires that taxation of property not be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 58</span> \npatently arbitrary and that rates be uniform within classes. Hagman, op. cit., 641 n. 43; see Newhouse, Constitutional Uniformity and Equality in State Taxation, pp. 603, 605-606.</p>\n<p>State constitutional provisions, however, must also be examined with respect to tax assessment schemes. In other states, state constitutional requirements of uniformity and equality in taxation have constituted a factor in deciding whether any type of open land taxation scheme might be adopted. Hagman, op. cit., 640-41. First, when the state constitution requires property assessments to be based on \"just,\" \"full,\" \"market,\" or \"true\" valuation, then tax statutes based on \"use\" value are open to constitutional challenge. Hagman, op. cit., 641. The Connecticut constitution does not seem to require \"just valuation\"; consequently, that ground of challenge would not seem to be available in Connecticut. Second, some state constitutions require uniformity in taxation. Such a provision would prohibit unreasonable classifications and partial exemptions. Hagman, op. cit., 641. It does not appear that the Connecticut constitution contains such a provision. Moreover, reasonable classifications and exemptions appear to be approved in<em>Bassett</em> v. <em>Rose,</em> <cross_reference>141 Conn. 129</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>The Connecticut Supreme Court has never ruled on the constitutionality of &#167; <cross_reference>12-504a</cross_reference> of the General Statutes. Nor has it ever ruled on the constitutionality of the other real estate taxes set forth in chapter 223 of the General Statutes. See, e.g.,<em>McKinney</em> v. <em>Coventry,</em> <cross_reference>32 Conn. Sup. 82</cross_reference> (constitutionality of &#167; <cross_reference>12-504a</cross_reference> raised, but not decided);<em>Alling Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Massinin,</em> <cross_reference>31 Conn. Sup. 154</cross_reference>\n(conveyance tax of &#167; <cross_reference>12-494</cross_reference> mentioned without disapproval). For the plaintiffs to prevail on this appeal, it must be shown that the conveyance tax bears no rational relation to the legislative intent. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 59</span> \nIt is not relevant whether the tax statute is wise;<em>State ex rel. Kirby</em> v. <em>Board of Fire Commissioners,</em><cross_reference>129 Conn. 419</cross_reference>; it must only be rational. Experts are divided as to the relative merits or wisdom of this type of legislation. See Marsele  Calabrese, \"Taxation of Open Spaces: Its Pros and Cons,\" 18 Conn. Government 1; Hagman, op. cit., 429.</p>\n<p>It is questionable whether the plaintiffs have made a showing that the tax is not rationally related to the legislative intent. First, it must be conceded that the state has taxing powers. <em>First Federal</em><em>Savings  Loan Assn.</em> v. <em>Connelly,</em> <cross_reference>142 Conn. 483</cross_reference>. Second, any conveyance tax, no matter how insignificant or variable over time, might serve to deter some persons from conveying their land, thus keeping the land as open space. Third, the variation in tax depending on the length of time the land is held is not so clearly irrational that it should be struck down. A high tax imposed on a conveyance for all time, for example, might unduly impede the marketability of the land. Also, the laws in this country are replete with examples of variations in tax rates depending on length of ownership, e.g., the federal tax laws relating to short and long term capital gains. <em>Guinn</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <cross_reference>238 U.S. 347</cross_reference>, relied on by the plaintiffs, is inapposite. That case involved the denial of the right of vote to blacks in violation of the <cross_reference>fifteenth</cross_reference> amendment to the United States constitution. In any event, voting is a fundamental right which may not be abridged without a compelling state interest &#8212; a much higher constitutional standard than the applied to the taxing powers. An analogous argument was presented to the courts with respect to a city ordinance which affected the city's grand list. In <em>Bassett</em> v. <em>Rose,</em><cross_reference>141 Conn. 129</cross_reference>, the town of Milford taxed all property except new construction built between October 1, 1950, and June 30, 1952. Such a tax exemption <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 60</span> \nbased on length of ownership was upheld. The Connecticut Supreme Court stated (pp. 133-34): \"Legislatures have broad powers of taxation. They may prescribe the conditions, means and methods of the assessment, levy and collection of taxes.... They may classify taxpayers if there is a reasonable basis for the classification and all persons in any one class are treated uniformly.... The classification is permissible if it bears a reasonable relation to a legitimate purpose of governmental action.... The question under consideration here is whether the special act is discriminatory. It is not if it treats all persons who are in the same class on an equal basis and if there is a reasonable distinction between the members of that class and all others. The class of persons affected by the special act is made up of those who owned property in Milford on October 1, 1950. They are all treated alike. It is not unreasonable to segregate them from persons who owned property at some time prior to that date or from those who owned property at some subsequent date....\" (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs here have vigorously argued that all similarly situated have not been treated alike. Here, however, all persons who have owned their land for the same amount of time are treated in the same way. Thus, by analogy to <em>Bassett</em> v. <em>Rose,</em>\nsupra, the provision in &#167; <cross_reference>12-504a</cross_reference> concerning length of ownership and the tax preference scheme in general cannot be considered unconstitutional as a violation of the <cross_reference>fourteenth</cross_reference> amendment to the United States constitution. Thus, the court concludes that the equal protection clause could not affect the statute in question.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also argue that &#167; <cross_reference>12-107e</cross_reference> (a) be declared unconstitutionally void for vagueness on the ground that the statute offers no guidelines \"which demonstrate how and in what manner the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 61</span> \nplanning commission's recommendations are to be arrived at.\" The court cannot agree with that contention. The \"how and in what manner\" is set forth in General Statutes &#167;&#167; <cross_reference>8-23</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>12-107e</cross_reference>. Section<cross_reference>12-107e</cross_reference> allows the commission to designate areas as open space land as part of its plan of development, and &#167; <cross_reference>8-23</cross_reference> sets forth how such a plan is to be created, including provisions as to its content, publication, notice, hearings on the proposed amendment and final adoption. The guidelines as to what land may be designated as open land, i.e., how the commission's recommendations are to be arrived at, may be found in &#167;&#167; <cross_reference>12-107a</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>12-107b</cross_reference> (c). Section<cross_reference>12-107a</cross_reference> sets forth the legislative purpose in passing the open space provision, and such purpose must rule and guide the commission's designation of any land as open space. Furthermore, &#167; <cross_reference>12-107b</cross_reference> (c) defines the term \"open space.\" Obviously, for the commission to declare any land as open space, it must first make a finding that such land meets the statutory criteria. Thus, the statute fixes a limit on the commission's activities and thereby saves the statute from being void for vagueness.</p>\n<p>Paragraph three (e) of the complaint alleges that \"[t]he amendment, as applied, will effect a taking of property without just compensation in violation of the Federal Constitution.\" The Connecticut constitution, article <cross_reference>first</cross_reference>, &#167; <cross_reference>11</cross_reference>, provides that \"[t]he property of no person shall be taken for public use, without just compensation therefor.\" To constitute a \"taking\" within this constitutional provision, the owner must be excluded from his private use and possession, and an authority exercising a right of eminent domain must assume the use and possession of the land for a public purpose. <em>Carl Roessler,</em><em>Inc.</em> v. <em>Ives,</em> <cross_reference>156 Conn. 131</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>140</cross_reference>. The court finds no taking in this case. The plaintiffs are not prevented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 62</span> \nfrom using their land. Nor is there any evidence that the open space amendment has destroyed the value of their land. Therefore, it cannot be said that there has been a confiscatory taking by the municipality. Cf. <em>State National Bank</em> v. <em>Planning</em><em> Zoning Commission,</em> <cross_reference>156 Conn. 99</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also make the claim that the open space amendment adopted by the commission goes beyond the scope of authority and the intent of &#167; <cross_reference>12-107e</cross_reference> of the General Statutes. They argue that the commission went beyond the intent of the enabling statute when they designated \"all land in the Town of Guilford\" as open space, with certain exceptions. Whether the commission chooses to describe the proposed open space by designating each individual parcel or by creating boundaries is beside the point, so long as all of the land so designated as open space land is within the definition of &#167; <cross_reference>12-107b</cross_reference> (c).</p>\n<p>It should be emphasized that the amendment does not confer a tax advantage on any lots located in subdivisions. That appears valid since \"[i]f subdivision is allowed it is presumed that a planning decision to permit development has been made, and the tax advantage given to restrain development ceases to have any validity.\" Hagman, op. cit., 650.</p>\n<p>The Connecticut Supreme Court has held that a court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commission, so long as the regulation in question is in furtherance of a proper purpose. <em>First Hartford</em><em>Realty Corporation</em> v. <em>Plan  Zoning Commission,</em><cross_reference>165 Conn. 533</cross_reference>; <em>Teuscher</em> v. <em>Zoning Board of</em><em>Appeals,</em> <cross_reference>154 Conn. 650</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>659</cross_reference>; <em>Young</em> v. <em>Town Planning</em><em> Zoning Commission,</em> <cross_reference>151 Conn. 235</cross_reference>; <em>Zandri</em>\nv. <em>Zoning Commission,</em> <cross_reference>150 Conn. 646</cross_reference>. For the legislation to be found unconstitutional, the plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing its unconstitutionality <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 63</span> \nbeyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Adams</em> v. <em>Rubinow,</em><cross_reference>157 Conn. 150</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>152-53</cross_reference>; <em>Hardware Mutual Casualty</em><em>Co.</em> v. <em>Premo,</em> <cross_reference>153 Conn. 465</cross_reference>, <cross_reference>470</cross_reference>.</p>\n<p></opinion_text>   The court concludes that in passing the open space amendment the commission did not act illegally, arbitrarily or in abuse of the discretion vested in it.</p>\n<p>For the reasons stated herein, the plaintiffs' appeal must be and is hereby dismissed.</p>",

In other states, state constitutional requirements of uniformity and equality in taxation have constituted a factor in deciding whether any type of open land taxation scheme might be adopted. Hagman, op. cit., 640-41. First, when the state constitution requires property assessments to be based on \"just,\" \"full,\" \"market,\" or \"true\" valuation, then tax statutes based on \"use\" value are open to constitutional challenge. Hagman, op. cit., 641. The Connecticut constitution does not seem to require \"just valuation\"; consequently, that ground of challenge would not seem to be available in Connecticut. Second, some state constitutions require uniformity in taxation. Such a provision would prohibit unreasonable classifications and partial exemptions. Hagman, op. cit., 641. It does not appear that the Connecticut constitution contains such a provision. Moreover, reasonable classifications and exemptions appear to be approved in<em>Bassett</em> v. <em>Rose,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2094485\"><a href=\"/opinion/2094485/bassett-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span></cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>The Connecticut Supreme Court has never ruled on the constitutionality of &#167; <cross_reference>12-504a</cross_reference> of the General Statutes. Nor has it ever ruled on the constitutionality of the other real estate taxes set forth in chapter 223 of the General Statutes. See, e.g.,<em>McKinney</em> v. <em>Coventry,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">32</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn. Super. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></span></cross_reference> (constitutionality of &#167; <cross_reference>12-504a</cross_reference> raised, but not decided);<em>Alling Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Massinin,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">31</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn. Super. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">154</span></span></cross_reference>\n(conveyance tax of &#167; <cross_reference>12-494</cross_reference> mentioned without disapproval). For the plaintiffs to prevail on this appeal, it must be shown that the conveyance tax bears no rational relation to the legislative intent. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 59</span> \nIt is not relevant whether the tax statute is wise;<em>State ex rel. Kirby</em> v. <em>Board of Fire Commissioners,</em><cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"3323624\"><a href=\"/opinion/3328153/state-ex-rel-kirby-v-board-of-fire-commissioners/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span></cross_reference>; it must only be rational. Experts are divided as to the relative merits or wisdom of this type of legislation. See Marsele  Calabrese, \"Taxation of Open Spaces: Its Pros and Cons,\" 18 Conn. Government 1; Hagman, op. cit., 429.</p>\n<p>It is questionable whether the plaintiffs have made a showing that the tax is not rationally related to the legislative intent. First, it must be conceded that the state has taxing powers. <em>First Federal</em><em>Savings  Loan Assn.</em> v. <em>Connelly,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">142</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></span></cross_reference>. Second, any conveyance tax, no matter how insignificant or variable over time, might serve to deter some persons from conveying their land, thus keeping the land as open space. Third, the variation in tax depending on the length of time the land is held is not so clearly irrational that it should be struck down. A high tax imposed on a conveyance for all time, for example, might unduly impede the marketability of the land. Also, the laws in this country are replete with examples of variations in tax rates depending on length of ownership, e.g., the federal tax laws relating to short and long term capital gains. <em>Guinn</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"98516\"><a href=\"/opinion/98516/guinn-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">238</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span></cross_reference>, relied on by the plaintiffs, is inapposite. That case involved the denial of the right of vote to blacks in violation of the <cross_reference>fifteenth</cross_reference> amendment to the United States constitution. In any event, voting is a fundamental right which may not be abridged without a compelling state interest &#8212; a much higher constitutional standard than the applied to the taxing powers. An analogous argument was presented to the courts with respect to a city ordinance which affected the city's grand list. In <em>Bassett</em> v. <em>Rose,</em><cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2094485\"><a href=\"/opinion/2094485/bassett-v-rose/\"><span class=\"volume\">141</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">129</span></a></span></cross_reference>, the town of Milford taxed all property except new construction built between October 1, 1950, and June 30, 1952. Such a tax exemption <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 60</span> \nbased on length of ownership was upheld. The Connecticut Supreme Court stated (pp. 133-34): \"Legislatures have broad powers of taxation. They may prescribe the conditions, means and methods of the assessment, levy and collection of taxes.... They may classify taxpayers if there is a reasonable basis for the classification and all persons in any one class are treated uniformly.... The classification is permissible if it bears a reasonable relation to a legitimate purpose of governmental action.... The question under consideration here is whether the special act is discriminatory. It is not if it treats all persons who are in the same class on an equal basis and if there is a reasonable distinction between the members of that class and all others. The class of persons affected by the special act is made up of those who owned property in Milford on October 1, 1950. They are all treated alike. It is not unreasonable to segregate them from persons who owned property at some time prior to that date or from those who owned property at some subsequent date....\" (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs here have vigorously argued that all similarly situated have not been treated alike. Here, however, all persons who have owned their land for the same amount of time are treated in the same way. Thus, by analogy to <em>Bassett</em> v. <em>Rose,</em>\nsupra, the provision in &#167; <cross_reference>12-504a</cross_reference> concerning length of ownership and the tax preference scheme in general cannot be considered unconstitutional as a violation of the <cross_reference>fourteenth</cross_reference> amendment to the United States constitution. Thus, the court concludes that the equal protection clause could not affect the statute in question.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also argue that &#167; <cross_reference>12-107e</cross_reference> (a) be declared unconstitutionally void for vagueness on the ground that the statute offers no guidelines \"which demonstrate how and in what manner the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 61</span> \nplanning commission's recommendations are to be arrived at.\" The court cannot agree with that contention. The \"how and in what manner\" is set forth in General Statutes &#167;&#167; <cross_reference>8-23</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>12-107e</cross_reference>. Section<cross_reference>12-107e</cross_reference> allows the commission to designate areas as open space land as part of its plan of development, and &#167; <cross_reference>8-23</cross_reference> sets forth how such a plan is to be created, including provisions as to its content, publication, notice, hearings on the proposed amendment and final adoption. The guidelines as to what land may be designated as open land, i.e., how the commission's recommendations are to be arrived at, may be found in &#167;&#167; <cross_reference>12-107a</cross_reference> and <cross_reference>12-107b</cross_reference> (c). Section<cross_reference>12-107a</cross_reference> sets forth the legislative purpose in passing the open space provision, and such purpose must rule and guide the commission's designation of any land as open space. Furthermore, &#167; <cross_reference>12-107b</cross_reference> (c) defines the term \"open space.\" Obviously, for the commission to declare any land as open space, it must first make a finding that such land meets the statutory criteria. Thus, the statute fixes a limit on the commission's activities and thereby saves the statute from being void for vagueness.</p>\n<p>Paragraph three (e) of the complaint alleges that \"[t]he amendment, as applied, will effect a taking of property without just compensation in violation of the Federal Constitution.\" The Connecticut constitution, article <cross_reference>first</cross_reference>, &#167; <cross_reference>11</cross_reference>, provides that \"[t]he property of no person shall be taken for public use, without just compensation therefor.\" To constitute a \"taking\" within this constitutional provision, the owner must be excluded from his private use and possession, and an authority exercising a right of eminent domain must assume the use and possession of the land for a public purpose. <em>Carl Roessler,</em><em>Inc.</em> v. <em>Ives,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1992342\"><a href=\"/opinion/1992342/carl-roessler-inc-v-ives/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>140</cross_reference>. The court finds no taking in this case. The plaintiffs are not prevented <span class=\"star-pagination\">*Page 62</span> \nfrom using their land. Nor is there any evidence that the open space amendment has destroyed the value of their land. Therefore, it cannot be said that there has been a confiscatory taking by the municipality. Cf. <em>State National Bank</em> v. <em>Planning</em><em> Zoning Commission,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1992656\"><a href=\"/opinion/1992656/state-national-bank-v-planning-zoning-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">99</span></a></span></cross_reference>.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs also make the claim that the open space amendment adopted by the commission goes beyond the scope of authority and the intent of &#167; <cross_reference>12-107e</cross_reference> of the General Statutes. They argue that the commission went beyond the intent of the enabling statute when they designated \"all land in the Town of Guilford\" as open space, with certain exceptions. Whether the commission chooses to describe the proposed open space by designating each individual parcel or by creating boundaries is beside the point, so long as all of the land so designated as open space land is within the definition of &#167; <cross_reference>12-107b</cross_reference> (c).</p>\n<p>It should be emphasized that the amendment does not confer a tax advantage on any lots located in subdivisions. That appears valid since \"[i]f subdivision is allowed it is presumed that a planning decision to permit development has been made, and the tax advantage given to restrain development ceases to have any validity.\" Hagman, op. cit., 650.</p>\n<p>The Connecticut Supreme Court has held that a court shall not substitute its judgment for that of the commission, so long as the regulation in question is in furtherance of a proper purpose. <em>First Hartford</em><em>Realty Corporation</em> v. <em>Plan  Zoning Commission,</em><cross_reference><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">165</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></span></cross_reference>; <em>Teuscher</em> v. <em>Zoning Board of</em><em>Appeals,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1995167\"><a href=\"/opinion/1995167/teuscher-v-zoning-board-of-appeals/\"><span class=\"volume\">154</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">650</span></a></span></cross_reference>, <cross_reference>659</cross_reference>; <em>Young</em> v. <em>Town Planning</em><em> Zoning Commission,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2184693\"><a href=\"/opinion/2184693/young-v-town-planning-zoning-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">235</span></a></span></cross_reference>; <em>Zandri</em>\nv. <em>Zoning Commission,</em> <cross_reference><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1462606\"><a href=\"/opinion/1462606/zandri-v-zoning-commission/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">646</span></a></span></cross_reference>.
