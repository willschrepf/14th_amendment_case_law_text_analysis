          "plain_text": "                             UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                             FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\n\n\n\n    EILEEN E. JENKINS,\n\n         Plaintiff,\n\n                 v.                                          Civil Action No. 15-2080 (JEB)\n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,\n\n          Defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        For the past 25 years Plaintiff Eileen Jenkins has built a career as an architect for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia. In 2011, her particular office was consolidated into D.C. General Services,\n\nConstruction Division. Jenkins’s lateral transfer into that Division is the foundation for many of\n\nher grievances today. Because she was transferred “as is,” Plaintiff was required to apply for a\n\nnew position within General Services in order to move onto the new D.C. pay scale. In 2014,\n\nshe applied for two such jobs as a Project Manager – one of which was grade 13 on that pay\n\nscale, and the other of which was grade 14. Jenkins was offered only the lower position, which\n\nshe subsequently declined.\n\n        This case largely arises out of her non-selection for the grade 14 post, a decision that she\n\nalleges was the result of both race discrimination, in violation of Title VII and the District of\n\nColumbia Human Rights Act, and age discrimination, in violation of the Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act. Jenkins further claims that she was subjected to a hostile workplace at the\n\nDivision, also in violation of Title VII. The District now moves for summary judgment on all\n\ncounts, claiming that no reasonable jury could find Plaintiff’s non-selection discriminatory or her\n                                                  1 \n \n\fwork environment hostile. This Court agrees and will grant Defendant’s Motion.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Because the District is moving for summary judgment, the Court describes the facts in\n\nthe light most favorable to Jenkins. See Talavera v. Shah, 638 F.3d 303, 308 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\nIn 1992, Plaintiff was hired by the Design and Engineering Unit of the D.C. Public Schools as an\n\narchitect. In 2008, that Unit was reorganized into the Office of Public Education Facilities\n\nModernization (OPEFM). See ECF No. 20-1, Exh. B (Notification of Personnel Action). Three\n\nyears later, Jenkins’s job was again restructured when the OPEFM became part of the District of\n\nColumbia General Services, Construction Division (DGS). Id. at 20. For the transfers to both\n\nOPEFM and DGS, Jenkins was transferred “as is,” meaning that her pay plan, title, grade, and\n\nstep remained the same. See ECF No. 23 (Opposition to MSJ) at 6. At the time of her\n\nassignment to DGS, Jenkins was a grade 14, step 7 architect under the Education Service System\n\n(EG) pay scale. See Notification of Personnel Action.\n\n       In order to transfer from the EG scale to that used by DGS – the Career Service (CS)\n\nscale – Jenkins was told that she was required to apply for an open position within the\n\nConstruction Division. Beginning in 2012, DGS posted numerous job openings for internal\n\ncandidates, including multiple positions for grade 13 and 14 Project Managers. See ECF No. 20-\n\n1, Exh. C (Vacancies List). Although these vacancies were open to all employees, Jenkins did\n\nnot apply for any. Id. Instead, she seems to have directed her energies toward contesting the\n\nterms of her lateral transfer. For example, Jenkins sent a series of emails and letters to D.C.\n\nCouncil members and to the mayor of the District, all of which discussed her alleged “pay\n\ndisparity,” ECF No. 23-3 (Email to Mayor Muriel Bowser) at 2, and perceived lack of adequate\n\ncompensation. See ECF No. 23-3 (Email to D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson); id. (Letter\n\n\n\n                                                 2 \n \n\fto Council Member Kenyan McDuffie). The Court notes that, interestingly, none of these\n\ncommunications mentioned race or age discrimination as a basis for her disputes with DGS.\n\n       In March 2014, Jenkins finally submitted applications for two of the available DGS\n\npositions – Project Manager CS-14, #24562, and Project Manager CS-13, #24563 – both of\n\nwhich would have transferred her to the Career Service pay scale. See Opp. at 9. On March 26,\n\n2014, DGS offered Plaintiff the CS-13 Project Manager position. See ECF No. 23-10 (Selection\n\nCertificate for CS-13). Even though this move might seem to have demoted her (from a grade 14\n\nto a grade 13), the EG and CS pay scales are different. In fact, if accepted, this job would have\n\nincreased Jenkins’s salary from $81,642 to $86,056, as well as making her eligible for an\n\nadditional 3% cost-of-living increase. See ECF No. 20-1, Exh. G (Offer of CS-13 Position).\n\nJenkins nonetheless rejected the CS-13 offer, expressing her discontent with DGS’s decision not\n\nto select her for the CS-14 position. See ECF No. 23-5 (Letter from Jenkins to June Locker).\n\n       In June 2014, Plaintiff filed a charge with the D.C. Office of Human Rights, alleging race\n\nand age discrimination. See Opp. at 10. DCOHR dismissed the charge and transferred the case\n\nto the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Id. The EEOC, in turn, did not sustain\n\nJenkins’s charges and sent her a Dismissal and Notice of Rights on September 1, 2015. Id.\n\nAlthough neither party has submitted the EEOC filings or records, the District does not argue\n\nthat Jenkins failed to administratively exhaust her claims. The Court therefore proceeds under\n\nthe assumption that this has properly occurred.\n\n       On December 1, 2015, Jenkins filed suit in this Court. Her Complaint alleges that she\n\nwas treated differently by DGS because of her race, in violation of Title VII and the D.C. Human\n\nRights Act, an assertion she bases largely on her non-selection for the CS-14 position. See\n\nCompl., ¶¶ 28-38. She also alleges age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in\n\n\n\n                                                  3 \n \n\fEmployment Act, stating that “less experienced similarly situated Architects and/or Project\n\nManagers under the age of 40 were hired at a higher pay scale and/or paid a higher wage than\n\n[Jenkins] for same or similar [work] performed during the relevant period.” Id., ¶¶ 45-52.\n\nFinally, Jenkins brings a hostile-workplace claim under Title VII, alleging that as a result of her\n\nrace and age, her “supervisors routinely humiliated [her] and engaged in [a] persistent pattern of\n\nsevere and pervasive harassment.” Id., ¶¶ 58-65. The District has now moved for summary\n\njudgment on all counts, asserting that there is no record evidence supporting any of Jenkins’s\n\nallegations. See ECF No. 20 (MSJ).\n\nII.    Legal Standard\n\n       Summary judgment may be granted if “the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute\n\nas to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(a); see also Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986); Holcomb v.\n\nPowell, 433 F.3d 889, 895 (D.C. Cir. 2006). A fact is “material” if it is capable of affecting the\n\nsubstantive outcome of the litigation. See Liberty Lobby, 477 U.S. at 248; Holcomb, 433 F.3d at\n\n895. A dispute is “genuine” if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict\n\nfor the nonmoving party. See Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007).\n\n       When a motion for summary judgment is under consideration, “[t]he evidence of the non-\n\nmovant is to be believed, and all justifiable inferences are to be drawn in his favor.” Liberty\n\nLobby, 477 U.S. at 255; see also Mastro v. PEPCO, 447 F.3d 843, 850 (D.C. Cir. 2006); Aka v.\n\nWash. Hosp. Ctr., 156 F.3d 1284, 1288 (D.C. Cir. 1998) (en banc). On a motion for summary\n\njudgment, the Court must “eschew making credibility determinations or weighing the evidence.”\n\nCzekalski v. Peters, 475 F.3d 360, 363 (D.C. Cir. 2007). The non-moving party’s opposition,\n\nhowever, must consist of more than mere unsupported allegations or denials and must be\n\n\n\n                                                 4 \n \n\fsupported by affidavits, declarations, or other competent evidence, setting forth specific facts\n\nshowing that there is a genuine issue for trial. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e); Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986). The non-movant is required to provide evidence that would\n\npermit a reasonable jury to find in his favor. See Laningham v. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, 1242\n\n(D.C. Cir. 1987).\n\nIII.   Analysis\n\n       There are a few issues to address before proceeding to Plaintiff’s more substantive\n\nclaims. First, the Court can easily dispose of her allegation that the District violated 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1981. See Compl., ¶ 1. As Defendant notes in its Motion – and Jenkins concedes in her\n\nresponse – a plaintiff cannot sue a municipality under § 1981. See MSJ at 10; Opp. at 1. The\n\nDistrict is correct that the Supreme Court has held that 42 U.S.C. § 1983, not § 1981, provides\n\nthe exclusive remedy for discrimination and retaliation claims when the alleged violation is by a\n\nstate actor. See Jett v. Dallas Independent School District, 491 U.S. 701, 109 (1989); Olatunji v.\n\nD.C., 958 F. Supp. 2d 27, 36–37 (D.D.C. 2013). The Court will therefore grant the District’s\n\nMotion with respect to this count.\n\n       Second, there is the question of which decisions, precisely, Jenkins alleges were the result\n\nof race and age discrimination. Although her Complaint largely addresses her non-selection for\n\nthe CS-14 position, it also makes certain broader allegations regarding her employment.\n\nSpecifically, she asserts that she did not “have her pay scale properly changed,” “[was] not being\n\npaid commensurate with her duties,” and was “demoted in paygrade.” Compl., ¶ 30. Plaintiff\n\ndoes not, however, offer any record evidence to connect these grievances with any race or age\n\ndiscrimination. Jenkins also generally contends that the District “limited, segregated and\n\nclassified her in a way that deprived her of employment opportunities and otherwise adversely\n\n\n\n                                                 5 \n \n\faffected her status as an employee because of her race.” Id. She provides no evidentiary support\n\nfor this unspecified claim beyond the denial of her CS-14 application. As this Circuit has held,\n\n“[T]he burden on a defendant moving for summary judgment may be discharged without factual\n\ndisproof of the plaintiff's case; the defendant need only identify the ways in which the plaintiff\n\nhas failed to come forward with sufficient evidence to support a reasonable jury to find in her\n\nfavor on one or more essential elements of her claim.” Grimes v. D.C., 794 F.3d 83, 93 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2015). Here, Jenkins’s filings fall far below this “sufficient evidence” bar on claims\n\nunrelated to the CS-14 position.\n\n       Additionally, Plaintiff’s briefing itself appears to concede that the only act at issue is her\n\nnon-selection for the CS-14 opening. See Opp. at 11 (stating that the position at issue is CS-14,\n\n#24562); id. at 21, 24-25 (discussing discrimination count only in context of non-selection for\n\nCS-14 position). Indeed, in addressing the District’s Statement of Facts, Jenkins expressly\n\nasserts that her claim is not based on the city’s hiring decisions outside of the positions for which\n\nshe applied. Id. at 7, 11. The Court will, consequently, consider her other claims as forfeited or\n\ninsufficiently supported, and it will only address her non-selection as a CS-14 Project Manager\n\nand her hostile-work-environment claim.\n\n       A. Race Discrimination\n\n               1. Legal Standard\n\n       Jenkins alleges race discrimination under both Title VII and the DCHRA. These statutes\n\nprohibit “employers from intentionally discriminating on the basis of race with respect to the\n\n‘benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions’ of employment.” Ayissi–Etoh v. Fannie Mae, 712\n\nF.3d 572, 576 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Because the same analytic framework governs discrimination\n\nclaims under both laws, the Court will consider Jenkins’s allegations of racial discrimination\n\n\n\n                                                  6 \n \n\funder the federal standard. See McFadden v. Ballard Spahr Andrews & Ingersoll, LLP, 611 F.3d\n\n1, 3, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (Title VII analysis applies to discrimination claims under DCHRA).\n\n       To make out a claim under Title VII, a plaintiff may rely on direct or circumstantial\n\nevidence that “permits an inference of discrimination.” Holcomb, 433 F.3d at 899. Where, as in\n\nthis case, the plaintiff proffers only circumstantial support, her claim is governed by the familiar\n\nframework set out in McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792 (1973). Under this test,\n\na plaintiff must first make out a prima facie case by showing that “(1) she is a member of a\n\nprotected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the unfavorable action\n\ngives rise to an inference of discrimination.” Wiley v. Glassman, 511 F.3d 151, 155 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007) (citation omitted). In doing so, the plaintiff must show that “race, color, religion, sex, or\n\nnational origin was a motivating factor” for the adverse employment practice, even if other\n\nfactors contributed. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m); Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, 539 U.S. 90, 101-\n\n02 (2003).\n\n       Once a plaintiff has made out his prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant\n\nto come forward with a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged action. See\n\nTexas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 254–55 (1981). If the employer\n\narticulates such a justification for its hiring decision, “the burden-shifting framework” then “falls\n\naway, and the ‘central question’ becomes whether ‘the employee produced sufficient evidence\n\nfor a reasonable jury to find that the employer’s asserted nondiscriminatory reason was not the\n\nactual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee.’” Allen v.\n\nJohnson, 795 F.3d 34, 39 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (quoting Brady v. Office of Sergeant at Arms, 520\n\nF.3d 490, 494 (D.C. Cir. 2008)). At the summary-judgment stage, therefore, the inquiry\n\ntypically collapses into one simple question: Given all the evidence, could a reasonable jury\n\n\n\n                                                  7 \n \n\fconclude that the defendant engaged in intentional discrimination against the plaintiff? See\n\nBrady, 520 F.3d 490 at 494. That is not to say, however, that evidence of a prima facie case is\n\nwholly shunted from the inquiry on a motion for summary judgment. On the contrary, in\n\nanswering the sufficient-evidence question, the Court must consider “the total circumstances of\n\nthe case,” including strengths and weaknesses in “the plaintiff’s prima facie case,” along with\n\nother evidence adduced by both parties during discovery. See Evans v. Sebelius, 716 F.3d 617,\n\n620 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (citing Hamilton v. Geithner, 666 F.3d 1344, 1351 (D.C. Cir. 2012)).\n\n                2. Merits\n\n        Jenkins alleges that DGS did not select her as a CS-14 Project Manager because she is\n\nblack. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that she applied for “a position she was qualified for and\n\nwas not chosen based on her protected trait,” and that the record supports an inference that “it is\n\nmore likely than not that a discriminatory reason motivated [her] employer.” Opp. at 22-23. The\n\nDistrict responds that Jenkins has failed to make out a prima facie case of race discrimination. It\n\nadditionally argues that, assuming she did make such a showing, DGS made its hiring decisions\n\nfor legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons, including that “management considered the internal\n\ncandidates hired for the CS-14 positions to have a more extensive project management\n\nbackground than Jenkins.” Reply at 2-3. Defendant contends that as Jenkins has not established\n\na triable issue of fact with respect to this rationale being pretext, the District is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment. Id. at 3.\n\n        The city is correct that the record does not support an inference of race discrimination.\n\nIndeed, the evidence does not even back up a number of Jenkins’s factual assertions. Plaintiff\n\ncontends, for instance, that the District “did not even consider her for the Project Manager CS-14\n\nposition, a position she was qualified for,” citing to her April 22, 2014, letter to the hiring\n\n\n\n                                                    8 \n \n\fofficial, June Locker, in which Jenkins wrote that she “was only considered for the grade 13\n\nposition, without the benefit of interviewing/discussing my qualifications for the grade 14\n\nposition.” Opp. at 23; Letter to June Locker. Yet Plaintiff neglects to address two other exhibits\n\nshe herself submitted showing that she was in fact considered for the CS-14 opening. See Exh.\n\nD (Email from Cecilia Bankins) (stating that Jenkins was referred to Locker “for both the CS-13\n\nand CS-14 positions”); Exh. P (Selection Certificate for CS-14 Posting) (listing Jenkins as a\n\n“candidate submitted for consideration”). Although the Court does not typically weigh\n\nconflicting evidence at summary judgment, Jenkins’s statement that she was “not even\n\nconsider[ed]” for the CS-14 position is undermined by her own submissions. This allegation\n\nthus cannot support a race-discrimination claim.\n\n       Another of Jenkins’s assertions regarding her non-selection for the CS-14 position is even\n\nmore egregiously off the mark. Plaintiff states that she was treated “less favorably because she is\n\nAfrican American,” reciting the standard that “a showing that a member outside of the protected\n\nclass received a promotion instead of the plaintiff is sufficient to create an inference of\n\ndiscrimination.” Opp. at 22 (citing McCaskey v. Henry, 461 F. App’x 268, 270 (4th Cir. 2012)).\n\nShe maintains that “it is undisputed that Robbie Stewart, Anthony Goodman and Cassidy Mullen\n\nare white and were the selections to fill the DGS – Project Manager CS-14, #24562 positions.”\n\nId. Jenkins then cites to three exhibits, none of which suggests that those three individuals were\n\nactually selected. See Exh. D (Letter from Cecelia Bankins to Eileen Jenkins); Exh. E (Letter to\n\nJune Locker from Eileen Jenkins); Exh. T (Personnel List). Another of Plaintiff’s exhibits does,\n\nhowever, show who was hired for the #24562 openings – Eupert Braithwaite, Ugur Ertem,\n\nDwight Goupal, and Emmanuel Nnnoli. See Exh. P (Selection Certificate for Posting #24562,\n\nCS-14). The Division’s personnel list (also submitted by Jenkins) establishes that none of these\n\n\n\n                                                  9 \n \n\findividuals is, in fact, white. Instead, the list supports the District’s assertion that DGS “selected\n\nfour minorities,” Reply at 4, as Braithwaite, Goupal, and Nnoli are black, and Ertem is Asian.\n\nSee Personnel List. All Jenkins had to do in order to correctly determine the race of those\n\nselected for the CS-14, #24562 position was to reference her own evidence. Her clear\n\nmisstatement of the evidence is alarming and borders on the sanctionable.\n\n       Looking at the actual record in this case, it becomes clear that the race of the individuals\n\nselected for the CS-14 positions presents a formidable obstacle to Plaintiff’s Title VII claim.\n\nBecause the District has presented a non-discriminatory rationale – namely, that DGS selected\n\nbetter-qualified internal candidates for the CS-14 position – Jenkins must show that this\n\njustification was a pretext for race discrimination. At this stage, the question for the Court is\n\nwhether a reasonable jury could infer that her non-selection for the CS-14 position was in fact\n\ndue to discriminatory animus. With respect to this inquiry, the fact that a contested position was\n\nfilled by members of the same race “cuts strongly against any inference of discrimination.”\n\nMurray v. Gilmore, 406 F.3d 708, 715 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (noting that although plaintiff may make\n\nout prima facie case without showing that she was passed over for candidate outside of her\n\nprotected class, hiring of individual within that class is highly relevant to determining whether\n\nplaintiff can show pretext).\n\n       Here, Jenkins asserts that she can show discrimination because she had “more experience\n\nthan four individuals who were white.” ECF 23-19 (Declaration of Eileen Jenkins). Yet, in light\n\nof the races of the candidates who were actually hired for the CS-14, # 24562 Project Manager\n\npositions, this argument is simply nonsensical. With respect to the three black hirees, moreover,\n\nthe selection of individuals within Jenkins’s protected class largely undermines any possible\n\ninference of discriminatory animus. With respect to the one Asian hire, Ugur Ertem, Jenkins\n\n\n\n                                                  10 \n \n\fmust rebut the District’s contention that Ertem was a stronger internal candidate. This she\n\ncannot do. According to the Personnel List, Ertem was already at a grade-15 level and in a\n\nsupervisory position within the Division when he was selected as a CS-14 Project Manager. See\n\nPersonnel List at 2. In order to “establish discriminatory intent” by “comparing qualifications,” a\n\nplaintiff must show that she is “significantly better qualified than the person who obtained the\n\nposition.” Hussain v. Nicholson, 435 F.3d 359, 365 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). Plaintiff\n\nfalls far short of this standard, as she provides no explanation of why she, as a grade 14 architect,\n\nwas in fact better qualified than Ertem (or any other candidate) for the contested position.\n\n       Jenkins may well believe that she was “overqualified” for the CS-13 opening and “better\n\nsuited” for the CS-14 position. See Opp. at 10. Yet this Court does not sit as a “super-personnel\n\ndepartment that reexamines an entity’s business decisions.” Fischbach v. D.C. Dep’t of Corr., 86\n\nF.3d 1180, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1996), and thus declines to second guess the District’s hiring\n\npractices in the absence of any support for Jenkins’s claim of discriminatory intent. Looking at\n\nall the evidence in toto, as the Court must after Defendant offers a non-discriminatory rationale,\n\nit is abundantly clear that no reasonable jury could infer that she was “treated differently based\n\nupon her status as an African-American.” Opp. at 23. Because there is no triable issue of fact as\n\nto the District’s proffered explanation, the Court will grant the Motion for Summary Judgment\n\non this count.\n\n       B. Age Discrimination\n\n       To prevail on a claim of age discrimination, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she “suffered\n\nan adverse employment action”; and (2) that the employer took that action “because of” her age.\n\nBrady, 520 F.3d at 493; see also Wilson v. Cox, 753 F.3d 244, 247 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (noting that\n\ncourts “generally apply the same approach in ADEA cases . . . as [they] do in Title VII cases”).\n\n\n\n                                                 11 \n \n\fAs with Title VII, once an employer has proffered a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its\n\naction, the only question for the Court is “whether the plaintiff produced sufficient evidence for a\n\nreasonable jury to find that the employer's asserted non-discriminatory reason was not the actual\n\nreason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff on a prohibited\n\nbasis.” Adeyemi v. District of Columbia, 525 F.3d 1222, 1226 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n       Here, Jenkins asserts that the District hired “individuals who were younger than Plaintiff\n\nto fill the position of CS-14 Project Manager.” Opp. at 25; id. at 26 (stating that “District chose\n\nfour younger employees for CS-14 Project Manager positions”). Once again, Plaintiff provides\n\nno evidence to support this allegation, and that omission is sufficient to doom her claim. The\n\nDistrict, however, has also done itself no favors by failing to submit records establishing the ages\n\nof the four individuals selected for the CS-14 position. The city asserts that “all applicants” for\n\nthe open positions “were over forty years of age,” but then cites only to its own general counsel’s\n\nletter to the EEOC. See MSJ at 13. Such legal advocacy cannot, at summary judgment, pass for\n\nrecord evidence establishing that there is no triable issue of fact.\n\n       Yet, even assuming that the four individuals hired for the CS-14 position were under the\n\nage of 40, Jenkins’s age-discrimination claim still cannot proceed. This is because the District\n\noffers a non-discriminatory rationale for its hiring decision – namely, that the individuals\n\nselected were either at a higher grade than CS-14 or already in a supervisory position. See Reply\n\nat 5. Because the District offers such an explanation, the burden shifts to Plaintiff to demonstrate\n\npretext. She does not succeed.\n\n       As just mentioned, the personnel list shows that the four individuals hired for the CS-14,\n\n# 24562 openings were each at either a higher pay grade than Jenkins or in a supervisory position\n\nat the time they were selected. Three of the four were already at the CS-15 level and thus took a\n\n\n\n                                                  12 \n \n\fgrade demotion when they accepted the CS-14 posting. The other, Emmannuel Nnoli, was at the\n\nCS-14 grade at the time of selection, but was already in a supervisory role within the Division.\n\nSee Personnel List. Jenkins, meanwhile, was an EG grade-14 architect with no supervisory title.\n\nAlthough, as already indicated, the grades are not equivalent across pay scales, a CS-13 was paid\n\nmore than an EG-14, and the CS pay scale was considerably higher overall. See ECF No. 20-1\n\nat 29, 58 (EG and CS pay scales). Yet Plaintiff provides no explanation for why she was better,\n\nor even equally, qualified for the CS-14 position than the four individuals selected. Although\n\nJenkins asserts that she had over “10 years’ experience at the time and degrees in Architecture\n\nand Construction,” Opp. at 27, she is unable to show that such experience casts any doubt upon\n\nDefendant’s decision to hire candidates who already held higher-paying positions within the\n\nDivision. Because Jenkins provides no evidence supporting an inference that the District’s\n\nhiring decision was based on age rather than legitimate reasons, she cannot establish a material\n\nissue of triable fact with respect to her ADEA claim.\n\n       C. Hostile Work Environment\n\n       In addition to alleging that her non-selection for the CS-14 position was the result of\n\ndiscrimination, Jenkins also contends that the District violated Title VII by creating “a hostile or\n\nabusive work environment that is discriminatory.” Opp. at 27. In support of this position, she\n\nbroadly asserts that she “was routinely and continually subjected to harassing conduct,” Compl.,\n\n¶ 59, and that in particular, “while working on an assignment,” her supervisor, Maurice Dunn,\n\n“yelled and berated [her] in front of her co-workers.” Opp. at 11.\n\n       An office becomes “hostile” for the purposes of Title VII only if the allegedly offensive\n\nconduct “permeate[s] [the workplace] with ‘discriminatory . . . intimidation, ridicule, and insult\n\nthat is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and\n\n\n\n                                                 13 \n \n\fcreate an abusive work environment.” Harris v. Forklift Sys. Inc., 510 U.S. 17, 21-22 (1993)\n\n(internal quotation omitted). The Supreme Court has explained that determining whether a\n\nhostile workplace exists has both subjective and objective components, with the latter judged\n\n“from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position, considering all the\n\ncircumstances.” Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., 523 U.S. 75, 81 (1998) (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted).\n\n       Here, the District has not challenged Jenkins’s subjective belief that she experienced a\n\nhostile work environment. What remains, consequently, is for the Court to determine the\n\nobjective reasonableness of her allegations. Considering the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto Plaintiff, the record shows no basis upon which a reasonable jury could find in her favor.\n\nIndeed, Jenkins’s assertions regarding the alleged workplace harassment and abuse do not\n\napproach the standard for establishing such a claim.\n\n         First, her generalized claim regarding harassing conduct lacks any specific evidentiary\n\nsupport. Plaintiff’s perfunctory statement that she was once “yelled [at] and berated” in front of\n\nher co-workers, moreover, does not rise to the level of “severe or pervasive” abuse. See ECF\n\nNo. 23 (Response to Interrogatories) at 8-9. Although many employees may wish it were\n\notherwise, Title VII sets a high bar for the types of behavior that create a hostile workplace. As\n\ncourts have repeatedly held, a plaintiff cannot prevail simply by alleging that she was subject to\n\nhumiliation or one specific instance of mistreatment. Aldrich v. Burwell, 197 F. Supp. 3d 124,\n\n135 (D.D.C. 2016) (stating that hostile work environment typically arises not “from discrete\n\nacts,” but from “several individual acts that . . . become actionable due to their ‘cumulative\n\neffect’”); Pitts v. Howard Univ., 111 F. Supp. 3d 9, 24 (D.D.C. 2015) (noting that conduct\n\nalleged “must be extreme to amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment,”\n\n\n\n                                                 14 \n \n\fand thus satisfy hostile-environment standard). Title VII does not establish a “general civility\n\ncode for the American workplace,” and the behavior alleged here is not “so objectively offensive\n\nas to alter the conditions” of Jenkins’s employment. See Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80-81 (internal\n\nquotation omitted).\n\n        Second, and more fundamentally, Jenkins seems to ignore the requirement that, in order\n\nto violate Title VII, the “intimidation, ridicule, [or] insult” must be discriminatory – i.e.,\n\n“because of the employee’s protected status.” Peters v. District of Columbia, 873 F. Supp. 2d\n\n158, 188–89 (D.D.C. 2012) (citation omitted). Court have “routinely held that hostile behavior,\n\nno matter how unjustified or egregious, cannot support a claim of hostile work environment\n\nunless there exists some linkage between the hostile behavior and the plaintiff's membership in a\n\nprotected class.” Na’im v. Clinton, 626 F. Supp. 2d 63, 73 (D.D.C. 2009); see Baloch v.\n\nKempthorne, 550 F.3d 1191, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (upholding summary judgment on plaintiff's\n\nhostile-work-environment claim in part because “none of the comments or actions directed at\n\n[plaintiff] expressly focused on his race, religion, age, or disability”); Chaple v. Johnson, 453 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 63, 73-74 (D.D.C. 2006) (observing that “[i]t must be clear that the hostile work\n\nenvironment was the result of discrimination based on a protected status”). Here, Plaintiff\n\nsubmits not a shred of evidence that the alleged episode of yelling was related to unlawful\n\ndiscrimination, and she offers only the conclusory statement that the general and unspecified\n\nharassment was “based on her race (African American) and her age.” Compl., ¶ 63. Because\n\nJenkins is unable to show a “correlation to the claimed ground[s] of discrimination,” she presents\n\nno issue of triable fact for a jury with respect to this count. See Bryant v. Brownlee, 265 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 52, 63 (D.D.C. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15 \n \n\fIV.    Conclusion\n\n       Although Jenkins may feel aggrieved by the circumstances of her bureaucratic transfers,\n\nshe fails to demonstrate a triable issue of fact with respect race or age discrimination, or her\n\nhostile-work-environment claim. For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the District\n\nis entitled to summary judgment and will grant its Motion. A separate Order consistent with this\n\nOpinion will be issued this day.\n\n\n\n                                                              /s/ James E.

JENKINS,\n\n         Plaintiff,\n\n                 v.                                          Civil Action No. 15-2080 (JEB)\n    DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA,\n\n          Defendant.\n\n\n\n\n                                  MEMORANDUM OPINION\n\n        For the past 25 years Plaintiff Eileen Jenkins has built a career as an architect for the\n\nDistrict of Columbia. In 2011, her particular office was consolidated into D.C. General Services,\n\nConstruction Division. Jenkins’s lateral transfer into that Division is the foundation for many of\n\nher grievances today. Because she was transferred “as is,” Plaintiff was required to apply for a\n\nnew position within General Services in order to move onto the new D.C. pay scale. In 2014,\n\nshe applied for two such jobs as a Project Manager – one of which was grade 13 on that pay\n\nscale, and the other of which was grade 14. Jenkins was offered only the lower position, which\n\nshe subsequently declined.\n\n        This case largely arises out of her non-selection for the grade 14 post, a decision that she\n\nalleges was the result of both race discrimination, in violation of Title VII and the District of\n\nColumbia Human Rights Act, and age discrimination, in violation of the Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act. Jenkins further claims that she was subjected to a hostile workplace at the\n\nDivision, also in violation of Title VII. The District now moves for summary judgment on all\n\ncounts, claiming that no reasonable jury could find Plaintiff’s non-selection discriminatory or her\n                                                  1 \n \n\fwork environment hostile. This Court agrees and will grant Defendant’s Motion.\n\nI.     Background\n\n       Because the District is moving for summary judgment, the Court describes the facts in\n\nthe light most favorable to Jenkins. See Talavera v. Shah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"213518\"><a href=\"/opinion/213518/talavera-v-shah/\"><span class=\"volume\">638</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 308 (D.C. Cir. 2011).\n\nIn 1992, Plaintiff was hired by the Design and Engineering Unit of the D.C. Public Schools as an\n\narchitect. In 2008, that Unit was reorganized into the Office of Public Education Facilities\n\nModernization (OPEFM). See ECF No. 20-1, Exh. B (Notification of Personnel Action). Three\n\nyears later, Jenkins’s job was again restructured when the OPEFM became part of the District of\n\nColumbia General Services, Construction Division (DGS). Id. at 20. For the transfers to both\n\nOPEFM and DGS, Jenkins was transferred “as is,” meaning that her pay plan, title, grade, and\n\nstep remained the same. See ECF No. 23 (Opposition to MSJ) at 6. At the time of her\n\nassignment to DGS, Jenkins was a grade 14, step 7 architect under the Education Service System\n\n(EG) pay scale. See Notification of Personnel Action.\n\n       In order to transfer from the EG scale to that used by DGS – the Career Service (CS)\n\nscale – Jenkins was told that she was required to apply for an open position within the\n\nConstruction Division. Beginning in 2012, DGS posted numerous job openings for internal\n\ncandidates, including multiple positions for grade 13 and 14 Project Managers. See ECF No. 20-\n\n1, Exh. C (Vacancies List). Although these vacancies were open to all employees, Jenkins did\n\nnot apply for any. Id. Instead, she seems to have directed her energies toward contesting the\n\nterms of her lateral transfer. For example, Jenkins sent a series of emails and letters to D.C.\n\nCouncil members and to the mayor of the District, all of which discussed her alleged “pay\n\ndisparity,” ECF No. 23-3 (Email to Mayor Muriel Bowser) at 2, and perceived lack of adequate\n\ncompensation. See ECF No. 23-3 (Email to D.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson); id. (Letter\n\n\n\n                                                 2 \n \n\fto Council Member Kenyan McDuffie). The Court notes that, interestingly, none of these\n\ncommunications mentioned race or age discrimination as a basis for her disputes with DGS.\n\n       In March 2014, Jenkins finally submitted applications for two of the available DGS\n\npositions – Project Manager CS-14, #24562, and Project Manager CS-13, #24563 – both of\n\nwhich would have transferred her to the Career Service pay scale. See Opp. at 9. On March 26,\n\n2014, DGS offered Plaintiff the CS-13 Project Manager position. See ECF No. 23-10 (Selection\n\nCertificate for CS-13). Even though this move might seem to have demoted her (from a grade 14\n\nto a grade 13), the EG and CS pay scales are different. In fact, if accepted, this job would have\n\nincreased Jenkins’s salary from $81,642 to $86,056, as well as making her eligible for an\n\nadditional 3% cost-of-living increase. See ECF No. 20-1, Exh. G (Offer of CS-13 Position).\n\nJenkins nonetheless rejected the CS-13 offer, expressing her discontent with DGS’s decision not\n\nto select her for the CS-14 position. See ECF No. 23-5 (Letter from Jenkins to June Locker).\n\n       In June 2014, Plaintiff filed a charge with the D.C. Office of Human Rights, alleging race\n\nand age discrimination. See Opp. at 10. DCOHR dismissed the charge and transferred the case\n\nto the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Id. The EEOC, in turn, did not sustain\n\nJenkins’s charges and sent her a Dismissal and Notice of Rights on September 1, 2015. Id.\n\nAlthough neither party has submitted the EEOC filings or records, the District does not argue\n\nthat Jenkins failed to administratively exhaust her claims. The Court therefore proceeds under\n\nthe assumption that this has properly occurred.\n\n       On December 1, 2015, Jenkins filed suit in this Court. Her Complaint alleges that she\n\nwas treated differently by DGS because of her race, in violation of Title VII and the D.C. Human\n\nRights Act, an assertion she bases largely on her non-selection for the CS-14 position. See\n\nCompl., ¶¶ 28-38. She also alleges age discrimination under the Age Discrimination in\n\n\n\n                                                  3 \n \n\fEmployment Act, stating that “less experienced similarly situated Architects and/or Project\n\nManagers under the age of 40 were hired at a higher pay scale and/or paid a higher wage than\n\n[Jenkins] for same or similar [work] performed during the relevant period.” Id., ¶¶ 45-52.\n\nFinally, Jenkins brings a hostile-workplace claim under Title VII, alleging that as a result of her\n\nrace and age, her “supervisors routinely humiliated [her] and engaged in [a] persistent pattern of\n\nsevere and pervasive harassment.” Id., ¶¶ 58-65. The District has now moved for summary\n\njudgment on all counts, asserting that there is no record evidence supporting any of Jenkins’s\n\nallegations. See ECF No. 20 (MSJ).\n\nII.

Cir. 1987).\n\nIII.   Analysis\n\n       There are a few issues to address before proceeding to Plaintiff’s more substantive\n\nclaims. First, the Court can easily dispose of her allegation that the District violated 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1981. See Compl., ¶ 1. As Defendant notes in its Motion – and Jenkins concedes in her\n\nresponse – a plaintiff cannot sue a municipality under § 1981. See MSJ at 10; Opp. at 1. The\n\nDistrict is correct that the Supreme Court has held that 42 U.S.C. § 1983, not § 1981, provides\n\nthe exclusive remedy for discrimination and retaliation claims when the alleged violation is by a\n\nstate actor. See Jett v. Dallas Independent School District, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112313\"><a href=\"/opinion/112313/jett-v-dallas-independent-school-dist/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">701</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 109 (1989); Olatunji v.\n\nD.C., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">958</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36–37 (D.D.C. 2013). The Court will therefore grant the District’s\n\nMotion with respect to this count.\n\n       Second, there is the question of which decisions, precisely, Jenkins alleges were the result\n\nof race and age discrimination. Although her Complaint largely addresses her non-selection for\n\nthe CS-14 position, it also makes certain broader allegations regarding her employment.\n\nSpecifically, she asserts that she did not “have her pay scale properly changed,” “[was] not being\n\npaid commensurate with her duties,” and was “demoted in paygrade.” Compl., ¶ 30. Plaintiff\n\ndoes not, however, offer any record evidence to connect these grievances with any race or age\n\ndiscrimination. Jenkins also generally contends that the District “limited, segregated and\n\nclassified her in a way that deprived her of employment opportunities and otherwise adversely\n\n\n\n                                                 5 \n \n\faffected her status as an employee because of her race.” Id. She provides no evidentiary support\n\nfor this unspecified claim beyond the denial of her CS-14 application. As this Circuit has held,\n\n“[T]he burden on a defendant moving for summary judgment may be discharged without factual\n\ndisproof of the plaintiff's case; the defendant need only identify the ways in which the plaintiff\n\nhas failed to come forward with sufficient evidence to support a reasonable jury to find in her\n\nfavor on one or more essential elements of her claim.” Grimes v. D.C., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">794</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93 (D.C.\n\nCir. 2015). Here, Jenkins’s filings fall far below this “sufficient evidence” bar on claims\n\nunrelated to the CS-14 position.\n\n       Additionally, Plaintiff’s briefing itself appears to concede that the only act at issue is her\n\nnon-selection for the CS-14 opening. See Opp. at 11 (stating that the position at issue is CS-14,\n\n#24562); id. at 21, 24-25 (discussing discrimination count only in context of non-selection for\n\nCS-14 position). Indeed, in addressing the District’s Statement of Facts, Jenkins expressly\n\nasserts that her claim is not based on the city’s hiring decisions outside of the positions for which\n\nshe applied. Id. at 7, 11. The Court will, consequently, consider her other claims as forfeited or\n\ninsufficiently supported, and it will only address her non-selection as a CS-14 Project Manager\n\nand her hostile-work-environment claim.\n\n       A. Race Discrimination\n\n               1. Legal Standard\n\n       Jenkins alleges race discrimination under both Title VII and the DCHRA. These statutes\n\nprohibit “employers from intentionally discriminating on the basis of race with respect to the\n\n‘benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions’ of employment.” Ayissi–Etoh v. Fannie Mae, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">712</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">572</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 576 (D.C. Cir. 2013). Because the same analytic framework governs discrimination\n\nclaims under both laws, the Court will consider Jenkins’s allegations of racial discrimination\n\n\n\n                                                  6 \n \n\funder the federal standard.

Under this test,\n\na plaintiff must first make out a prima facie case by showing that “(1) she is a member of a\n\nprotected class; (2) she suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) the unfavorable action\n\ngives rise to an inference of discrimination.” Wiley v. Glassman, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187050\"><a href=\"/opinion/187050/wiley-v-glassman/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 155 (D.C. Cir.\n\n2007) (citation omitted). In doing so, the plaintiff must show that “race, color, religion, sex, or\n\nnational origin was a motivating factor” for the adverse employment practice, even if other\n\nfactors contributed. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(m); Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"130146\"><a href=\"/opinion/130146/desert-palace-inc-v-costa/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101-\n\n02 (2003).\n\n       Once a plaintiff has made out his prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant\n\nto come forward with a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged action. See\n\nTexas Dep’t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110424\"><a href=\"/opinion/110424/texas-dept-of-community-affairs-v-burdine/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">248</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 254–55 (1981). If the employer\n\narticulates such a justification for its hiring decision, “the burden-shifting framework” then “falls\n\naway, and the ‘central question’ becomes whether ‘the employee produced sufficient evidence\n\nfor a reasonable jury to find that the employer’s asserted nondiscriminatory reason was not the\n\nactual reason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the employee.’” Allen v.\n\nJohnson, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">795</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 39 (D.C.

That is not to say, however, that evidence of a prima facie case is\n\nwholly shunted from the inquiry on a motion for summary judgment. On the contrary, in\n\nanswering the sufficient-evidence question, the Court must consider “the total circumstances of\n\nthe case,” including strengths and weaknesses in “the plaintiff’s prima facie case,” along with\n\nother evidence adduced by both parties during discovery. See Evans v. Sebelius, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">716</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">617</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n620 (D.C.

Cir. 2012)).\n\n                2. Merits\n\n        Jenkins alleges that DGS did not select her as a CS-14 Project Manager because she is\n\nblack. Specifically, Plaintiff asserts that she applied for “a position she was qualified for and\n\nwas not chosen based on her protected trait,” and that the record supports an inference that “it is\n\nmore likely than not that a discriminatory reason motivated [her] employer.” Opp. at 22-23. The\n\nDistrict responds that Jenkins has failed to make out a prima facie case of race discrimination. It\n\nadditionally argues that, assuming she did make such a showing, DGS made its hiring decisions\n\nfor legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons, including that “management considered the internal\n\ncandidates hired for the CS-14 positions to have a more extensive project management\n\nbackground than Jenkins.” Reply at 2-3. Defendant contends that as Jenkins has not established\n\na triable issue of fact with respect to this rationale being pretext, the District is entitled to\n\nsummary judgment. Id. at 3.\n\n        The city is correct that the record does not support an inference of race discrimination.\n\nIndeed, the evidence does not even back up a number of Jenkins’s factual assertions. Plaintiff\n\ncontends, for instance, that the District “did not even consider her for the Project Manager CS-14\n\nposition, a position she was qualified for,” citing to her April 22, 2014, letter to the hiring\n\n\n\n                                                    8 \n \n\fofficial, June Locker, in which Jenkins wrote that she “was only considered for the grade 13\n\nposition, without the benefit of interviewing/discussing my qualifications for the grade 14\n\nposition.” Opp. at 23; Letter to June Locker. Yet Plaintiff neglects to address two other exhibits\n\nshe herself submitted showing that she was in fact considered for the CS-14 opening. See Exh.\n\nD (Email from Cecilia Bankins) (stating that Jenkins was referred to Locker “for both the CS-13\n\nand CS-14 positions”); Exh. P (Selection Certificate for CS-14 Posting) (listing Jenkins as a\n\n“candidate submitted for consideration”). Although the Court does not typically weigh\n\nconflicting evidence at summary judgment, Jenkins’s statement that she was “not even\n\nconsider[ed]” for the CS-14 position is undermined by her own submissions. This allegation\n\nthus cannot support a race-discrimination claim.\n\n       Another of Jenkins’s assertions regarding her non-selection for the CS-14 position is even\n\nmore egregiously off the mark. Plaintiff states that she was treated “less favorably because she is\n\nAfrican American,” reciting the standard that “a showing that a member outside of the protected\n\nclass received a promotion instead of the plaintiff is sufficient to create an inference of\n\ndiscrimination.” Opp. at 22 (citing McCaskey v. Henry, 461 F. App’x 268, 270 (4th Cir. 2012)).\n\nShe maintains that “it is undisputed that Robbie Stewart, Anthony Goodman and Cassidy Mullen\n\nare white and were the selections to fill the DGS – Project Manager CS-14, #24562 positions.”\n\nId. Jenkins then cites to three exhibits, none of which suggests that those three individuals were\n\nactually selected. See Exh. D (Letter from Cecelia Bankins to Eileen Jenkins); Exh. E (Letter to\n\nJune Locker from Eileen Jenkins); Exh. T (Personnel List). Another of Plaintiff’s exhibits does,\n\nhowever, show who was hired for the #24562 openings – Eupert Braithwaite, Ugur Ertem,\n\nDwight Goupal, and Emmanuel Nnnoli. See Exh. P (Selection Certificate for Posting #24562,\n\nCS-14). The Division’s personnel list (also submitted by Jenkins) establishes that none of these\n\n\n\n                                                  9 \n \n\findividuals is, in fact, white. Instead, the list supports the District’s assertion that DGS “selected\n\nfour minorities,” Reply at 4, as Braithwaite, Goupal, and Nnoli are black, and Ertem is Asian.\n\nSee Personnel List. All Jenkins had to do in order to correctly determine the race of those\n\nselected for the CS-14, #24562 position was to reference her own evidence. Her clear\n\nmisstatement of the evidence is alarming and borders on the sanctionable.\n\n       Looking at the actual record in this case, it becomes clear that the race of the individuals\n\nselected for the CS-14 positions presents a formidable obstacle to Plaintiff’s Title VII claim.\n\nBecause the District has presented a non-discriminatory rationale – namely, that DGS selected\n\nbetter-qualified internal candidates for the CS-14 position – Jenkins must show that this\n\njustification was a pretext for race discrimination. At this stage, the question for the Court is\n\nwhether a reasonable jury could infer that her non-selection for the CS-14 position was in fact\n\ndue to discriminatory animus. With respect to this inquiry, the fact that a contested position was\n\nfilled by members of the same race “cuts strongly against any inference of discrimination.”\n\nMurray v. Gilmore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186451\"><a href=\"/opinion/186451/murray-lucy-v-gilmore-david/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 715 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (noting that although plaintiff may make\n\nout prima facie case without showing that she was passed over for candidate outside of her\n\nprotected class, hiring of individual within that class is highly relevant to determining whether\n\nplaintiff can show pretext).\n\n       Here, Jenkins asserts that she can show discrimination because she had “more experience\n\nthan four individuals who were white.” ECF 23-19 (Declaration of Eileen Jenkins). Yet, in light\n\nof the races of the candidates who were actually hired for the CS-14, # 24562 Project Manager\n\npositions, this argument is simply nonsensical. With respect to the three black hirees, moreover,\n\nthe selection of individuals within Jenkins’s protected class largely undermines any possible\n\ninference of discriminatory animus. With respect to the one Asian hire, Ugur Ertem, Jenkins\n\n\n\n                                                  10 \n \n\fmust rebut the District’s contention that Ertem was a stronger internal candidate. This she\n\ncannot do. According to the Personnel List, Ertem was already at a grade-15 level and in a\n\nsupervisory position within the Division when he was selected as a CS-14 Project Manager. See\n\nPersonnel List at 2. In order to “establish discriminatory intent” by “comparing qualifications,” a\n\nplaintiff must show that she is “significantly better qualified than the person who obtained the\n\nposition.” Hussain v. Nicholson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"186580\"><a href=\"/opinion/186580/hussain-mohammed-v-nicholson-r-james/\"><span class=\"volume\">435</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">359</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 365 (D.C. Cir. 2006) (citation omitted). Plaintiff\n\nfalls far short of this standard, as she provides no explanation of why she, as a grade 14 architect,\n\nwas in fact better qualified than Ertem (or any other candidate) for the contested position.\n\n       Jenkins may well believe that she was “overqualified” for the CS-13 opening and “better\n\nsuited” for the CS-14 position. See Opp. at 10. Yet this Court does not sit as a “super-personnel\n\ndepartment that reexamines an entity’s business decisions.” Fischbach v. D.C. Dep’t of Corr., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"720519\"><a href=\"/opinion/720519/ronald-j-fischbach-v-district-of-columbia-department-of-corrections-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1180</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1183 (D.C. Cir. 1996), and thus declines to second guess the District’s hiring\n\npractices in the absence of any support for Jenkins’s claim of discriminatory intent. Looking at\n\nall the evidence in toto, as the Court must after Defendant offers a non-discriminatory rationale,\n\nit is abundantly clear that no reasonable jury could infer that she was “treated differently based\n\nupon her status as an African-American.” Opp. at 23. Because there is no triable issue of fact as\n\nto the District’s proffered explanation, the Court will grant the Motion for Summary Judgment\n\non this count.\n\n       B. Age Discrimination\n\n       To prevail on a claim of age discrimination, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she “suffered\n\nan adverse employment action”; and (2) that the employer took that action “because of” her age.\n\nBrady, 520 F.3d at 493; see also Wilson v. Cox, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">753</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 247 (D.C. Cir. 2014) (noting that\n\ncourts “generally apply the same approach in ADEA cases . . . as [they] do in Title VII cases”).\n\n\n\n                                                 11 \n \n\fAs with Title VII, once an employer has proffered a legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its\n\naction, the only question for the Court is “whether the plaintiff produced sufficient evidence for a\n\nreasonable jury to find that the employer's asserted non-discriminatory reason was not the actual\n\nreason and that the employer intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff on a prohibited\n\nbasis.” Adeyemi v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"187159\"><a href=\"/opinion/187159/adeyemi-v-district-of-columbia/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1222</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1226 (D.C. Cir. 2008).\n\n       Here, Jenkins asserts that the District hired “individuals who were younger than Plaintiff\n\nto fill the position of CS-14 Project Manager.” Opp. at 25; id. at 26 (stating that “District chose\n\nfour younger employees for CS-14 Project Manager positions”). Once again, Plaintiff provides\n\nno evidence to support this allegation, and that omission is sufficient to doom her claim. The\n\nDistrict, however, has also done itself no favors by failing to submit records establishing the ages\n\nof the four individuals selected for the CS-14 position. The city asserts that “all applicants” for\n\nthe open positions “were over forty years of age,” but then cites only to its own general counsel’s\n\nletter to the EEOC. See MSJ at 13. Such legal advocacy cannot, at summary judgment, pass for\n\nrecord evidence establishing that there is no triable issue of fact.\n\n       Yet, even assuming that the four individuals hired for the CS-14 position were under the\n\nage of 40, Jenkins’s age-discrimination claim still cannot proceed. This is because the District\n\noffers a non-discriminatory rationale for its hiring decision – namely, that the individuals\n\nselected were either at a higher grade than CS-14 or already in a supervisory position. See Reply\n\nat 5. Because the District offers such an explanation, the burden shifts to Plaintiff to demonstrate\n\npretext. She does not succeed.\n\n       As just mentioned, the personnel list shows that the four individuals hired for the CS-14,\n\n# 24562 openings were each at either a higher pay grade than Jenkins or in a supervisory position\n\nat the time they were selected. Three of the four were already at the CS-15 level and thus took a\n\n\n\n                                                  12 \n \n\fgrade demotion when they accepted the CS-14 posting. The other, Emmannuel Nnoli, was at the\n\nCS-14 grade at the time of selection, but was already in a supervisory role within the Division.\n\nSee Personnel List. Jenkins, meanwhile, was an EG grade-14 architect with no supervisory title.\n\nAlthough, as already indicated, the grades are not equivalent across pay scales, a CS-13 was paid\n\nmore than an EG-14, and the CS pay scale was considerably higher overall. See ECF No. 20-1\n\nat 29, 58 (EG and CS pay scales). Yet Plaintiff provides no explanation for why she was better,\n\nor even equally, qualified for the CS-14 position than the four individuals selected. Although\n\nJenkins asserts that she had over “10 years’ experience at the time and degrees in Architecture\n\nand Construction,” Opp. at 27, she is unable to show that such experience casts any doubt upon\n\nDefendant’s decision to hire candidates who already held higher-paying positions within the\n\nDivision. Because Jenkins provides no evidence supporting an inference that the District’s\n\nhiring decision was based on age rather than legitimate reasons, she cannot establish a material\n\nissue of triable fact with respect to her ADEA claim.\n\n       C. Hostile Work Environment\n\n       In addition to alleging that her non-selection for the CS-14 position was the result of\n\ndiscrimination, Jenkins also contends that the District violated Title VII by creating “a hostile or\n\nabusive work environment that is discriminatory.” Opp. at 27. In support of this position, she\n\nbroadly asserts that she “was routinely and continually subjected to harassing conduct,” Compl.,\n\n¶ 59, and that in particular, “while working on an assignment,” her supervisor, Maurice Dunn,\n\n“yelled and berated [her] in front of her co-workers.” Opp. at 11.\n\n       An office becomes “hostile” for the purposes of Title VII only if the allegedly offensive\n\nconduct “permeate[s] [the workplace] with ‘discriminatory . . . intimidation, ridicule, and insult\n\nthat is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim’s employment and\n\n\n\n                                                 13 \n \n\fcreate an abusive work environment.” Harris v. Forklift Sys. Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112911\"><a href=\"/opinion/112911/harris-v-forklift-systems-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 21-22 (1993)\n\n(internal quotation omitted). The Supreme Court has explained that determining whether a\n\nhostile workplace exists has both subjective and objective components, with the latter judged\n\n“from the perspective of a reasonable person in the plaintiff’s position, considering all the\n\ncircumstances.” Oncale v. Sundowner Offshore Servs., Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118181\"><a href=\"/opinion/118181/oncale-v-sundowner-offshore-services-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 81 (1998) (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted).\n\n       Here, the District has not challenged Jenkins’s subjective belief that she experienced a\n\nhostile work environment. What remains, consequently, is for the Court to determine the\n\nobjective reasonableness of her allegations. Considering the evidence in the light most favorable\n\nto Plaintiff, the record shows no basis upon which a reasonable jury could find in her favor.\n\nIndeed, Jenkins’s assertions regarding the alleged workplace harassment and abuse do not\n\napproach the standard for establishing such a claim.\n\n         First, her generalized claim regarding harassing conduct lacks any specific evidentiary\n\nsupport. Plaintiff’s perfunctory statement that she was once “yelled [at] and berated” in front of\n\nher co-workers, moreover, does not rise to the level of “severe or pervasive” abuse. See ECF\n\nNo. 23 (Response to Interrogatories) at 8-9. Although many employees may wish it were\n\notherwise, Title VII sets a high bar for the types of behavior that create a hostile workplace. As\n\ncourts have repeatedly held, a plaintiff cannot prevail simply by alleging that she was subject to\n\nhumiliation or one specific instance of mistreatment. Aldrich v. Burwell, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">197</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n135 (D.D.C. 2016) (stating that hostile work environment typically arises not “from discrete\n\nacts,” but from “several individual acts that . . . become actionable due to their ‘cumulative\n\neffect’”); Pitts v. Howard Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Title VII does not establish a “general civility\n\ncode for the American workplace,” and the behavior alleged here is not “so objectively offensive\n\nas to alter the conditions” of Jenkins’s employment. See Oncale, 523 U.S. at 80-81 (internal\n\nquotation omitted).\n\n        Second, and more fundamentally, Jenkins seems to ignore the requirement that, in order\n\nto violate Title VII, the “intimidation, ridicule, [or] insult” must be discriminatory – i.e.,\n\n“because of the employee’s protected status.” Peters v. District of Columbia, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Cir. 2008) (upholding summary judgment on plaintiff's\n\nhostile-work-environment claim in part because “none of the comments or actions directed at\n\n[plaintiff] expressly focused on his race, religion, age, or disability”); Chaple v. Johnson, 453 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 63, 73-74 (D.D.C. 2006) (observing that “[i]t must be clear that the hostile work\n\nenvironment was the result of discrimination based on a protected status”). Here, Plaintiff\n\nsubmits not a shred of evidence that the alleged episode of yelling was related to unlawful\n\ndiscrimination, and she offers only the conclusory statement that the general and unspecified\n\nharassment was “based on her race (African American) and her age.” Compl., ¶ 63. Because\n\nJenkins is unable to show a “correlation to the claimed ground[s] of discrimination,” she presents\n\nno issue of triable fact for a jury with respect to this count. See Bryant v. Brownlee, 265 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 52, 63 (D.D.C. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n                                                  15 \n \n\fIV.    Conclusion\n\n       Although Jenkins may feel aggrieved by the circumstances of her bureaucratic transfers,\n\nshe fails to demonstrate a triable issue of fact with respect race or age discrimination, or her\n\nhostile-work-environment claim. For the foregoing reasons, the Court concludes that the District\n\nis entitled to summary judgment and will grant its Motion. A separate Order consistent with this\n\nOpinion will be issued this day.\n\n\n\n                                                              /s/ James E.
