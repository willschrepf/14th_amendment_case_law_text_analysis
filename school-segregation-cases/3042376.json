Record No. 2175-14-3                                  JUDGE WESLEY G. RUSSELL, JR.\n                                                                                 MARCH 8, 2016\n            COMMONWEALTH OF VIRGINIA\n\n\n                             FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF PITTSYLVANIA COUNTY\n                                           Stacey W. Moreau, Judge\n\n                            James C. Martin (Martin & Martin Law Firm, on brief), for\n                            appellant.\n\n                            Eugene Murphy, Senior Assistant Attorney General (Mark R.\n                            Herring, Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.\n\n\n                    Appellant entered a conditional guilty plea to the charge that he illegally possessed a firearm\n\n            in violation of Code § 18.2-308.2 after having been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense\n\n            that would have been a felony if he had been an adult. Pursuant to the terms of the conditional\n\n            guilty plea, appellant preserved for appellate review his arguments that the trial court erred in\n\n            applying Code § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions to him, that Code\n\n            § 18.2-308.2 is unconstitutional as applied to him, and that this Court’s prior interpretation of Code\n\n            § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions renders the statute vague to the point that a\n\n            citizen is not on notice as to what the law actually is. For the reasons that follow, we disagree with\n\n            appellant and affirm his conviction for violating Code § 18.2-308.2.\n\n                                                       BACKGROUND\n\n                    In 2012, while seventeen years old, appellant was adjudicated delinquent for two instances\n\n            of violating Code § 18.2-248(G), possession with intent to distribute imitation cocaine. The\n\fviolations of Code § 18.2-248(G) would have been non-violent felonies if appellant had been an\n\nadult when he committed the offenses. Appellant does not dispute that he was over the age of\n\nfifteen at the time of the conduct underlying the delinquency adjudications.1\n\n       On December 31, 2013, when investigating another matter at appellant’s residence, police\n\nofficers discovered two firearms, specifically two operable long guns. At the time of the discovery,\n\nappellant acknowledged his possession of them, stating that he was keeping them for someone else\n\nwho was going to use them to go hunting. Appellant was charged with violation of Code\n\n§ 18.2-308.2 and with grand larceny unrelated to the firearms.2\n\n       In the trial court, the parties agreed that appellant had been previously adjudicated\n\ndelinquent of offenses that would have been non-violent felonies if he had been an adult, that he\n\nwas over the age of fourteen when he committed the offenses, and that, on December 31, 2013, he\n\nwas under the age of twenty-nine when he was found to possess the firearms. Recognizing that\n\nthese facts provided a sufficient evidentiary basis for convicting him of the violation of Code\n\n§ 18.2-308.2, appellant entered a conditional guilty plea.3 The trial court accepted the conditional\n\nguilty plea and, citing our decision in Carter v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 116, 562 S.E.2d 331\n\n\n       1\n         At trial, appellant stipulated that he was over fourteen, the age specified in Code\n§ 18.2-308.2(A)(iii), at the time of the underlying offenses. At argument, he did not dispute that\nhe was at least fifteen at the time of the offenses, which is significant for the reasons detailed in\nSection II (D), infra.\n       2\n          Appellant was convicted of grand larceny and sentenced to three years, all suspended,\nfor that crime. The grand larceny charge is not a subject of this appeal.\n       3\n          Appellant initially pled not guilty and raised constitutional challenges to Code\n§ 18.2-308.2 by way of pretrial motion. Only after the trial court rejected his constitutional\nchallenges did he seek to change his plea. With the consent of the trial court and the\nCommonwealth, he entered a conditional guilty plea. See Code § 19.2-254 (“With the approval\nof the court and the consent of the Commonwealth, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of\nguilty in a misdemeanor or felony case in circuit court, reserving the right, on appeal from the\njudgment, to a review of the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion. If the\ndefendant prevails on appeal, he shall be allowed to withdraw his plea.”).\n                                                 -2-\n\f(2002), applied the statute’s mandatory minimum sentencing provisions to appellant. As a result,\n\nthe trial court sentenced appellant to two years of incarceration.\n\n        Appellant’s conditional guilty plea preserved his ability to challenge on appeal aspects of\n\nboth his sentence and his conviction. Specifically, appellant retained the ability to argue that the\n\ntrial court erred in applying Code § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions to him,\n\nthat Code § 18.2-308.2 is unconstitutional as applied to him, and that this Court’s prior\n\ninterpretation of Code § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions renders the statute\n\nunconstitutionally vague.\n\n        Appellant noted and perfected his appeal, asserting the following assignments of error:\n\n                1.      The trial court erred in ruling that in prosecutions for the\n                violation of Va. Code § 18.2-308.2 where the predicate offense is a\n                delinquent act, the mandatory minimum sentence provisions are\n                nonetheless applicable.\n\n                2.      The trial court erred in failing to rule that Va. Code\n                § 18.2-308.2 is unconstitutional as applied to cases involving\n                predicate delinquent acts in that it unreasonably infringes upon the\n                Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms pursuant to the Second\n                Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (as applied to\n                the states through the Fourteenth Amendment) and Article I, § 13\n                of the Constitution of Virginia.[4]\n\n                3.      Va. Code § 18.2-308.2 is unconstitutional to the extent that\n                it purports to apply mandatory minimum sentences to cases\n                involving predicate delinquent acts as it fails to give reasonable\n                notice as to the applicability of any such mandatory minimum\n                provisions to delinquent act cases and is thus at best void for\n                vagueness.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n         The Virginia Supreme Court has held that, in general, “the protection of the right to bear\narms expressed in Article I, § 13 of the Constitution of Virginia is co-extensive with the rights\nprovided by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution . . . .” DiGiacinto v.\nRector & Visitors of George Mason Univ., 281 Va. 127, 134, 704 S.E.2d 365, 369 (2011).\nAccordingly, our analysis of appellant’s Second Amendment claim applies with equal force to\nhis Article I, § 13 claim.\n                                                -3-\n\f                                           ANALYSIS\n\n I. Application of Code § 18.2-308.2’s Mandatory Minimum Sentence Provisions to Appellant\n\n       Appellant’s first assignment of error presents a question of statutory interpretation. “[A]n\n\nissue of statutory interpretation is a pure question of law which [an appellate court] review[s] de\n\nnovo.” Conyers v. Martial Arts World of Richmond, Inc., 273 Va. 96, 104, 639 S.E.2d 174, 178\n\n(2007) (citations omitted).\n\n       Code § 18.2-308.2(A) provides as follows:\n\n               It shall be unlawful for (i) any person who has been convicted of a\n               felony; (ii) any person adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile 14 years\n               of age or older at the time of the offense of murder in violation of\n               § 18.2-31 or 18.2-32, kidnapping in violation of § 18.2-47, robbery\n               by the threat or presentation of firearms in violation of § 18.2-58,\n               or rape in violation of § 18.2-61; or (iii) any person under the age\n               of 29 who was adjudicated delinquent as a juvenile 14 years of age\n               or older at the time of the offense of a delinquent act which would\n               be a felony if committed by an adult, other than those felonies set\n               forth in clause (ii), whether such conviction or adjudication\n               occurred under the laws of the Commonwealth, or any other state,\n               the District of Columbia, the United States or any territory thereof,\n               to knowingly and intentionally possess or transport any firearm or\n               ammunition for a firearm, any stun weapon as defined by\n               § 18.2-308.1, or any explosive material, or to knowingly and\n               intentionally carry about his person, hidden from common\n               observation, any weapon described in subsection A of § 18.2-308.\n               However, such person may possess in his residence or the curtilage\n               thereof a stun weapon as defined by § 18.2-308.1. Any person who\n               violates this section shall be guilty of a Class 6 felony. However,\n               any person who violates this section by knowingly and\n               intentionally possessing or transporting any firearm and who was\n               previously convicted of a violent felony as defined in § 17.1-805\n               shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment\n               of five years. Any person who violates this section by knowingly\n               and intentionally possessing or transporting any firearm and who\n               was previously convicted of any other felony within the prior 10\n               years shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of\n               imprisonment of two years. The mandatory minimum terms of\n               imprisonment prescribed for violations of this section shall be\n               served consecutively with any other sentence.\n\n(Emphasis added).\n                                                -4-\n\f        Pursuant to the statutory language, adults who are convicted of felonies and juveniles\n\nadjudicated delinquent for offenses within certain parameters fall within the statute’s prohibition,\n\nand therefore, possession of a firearm by such a person is a Class 6 felony. Recognizing that\n\n“convicted of a felony” and “adjudicated delinquent” are not synonymous, the General Assembly\n\nidentified them separately in subparts (i), (ii), and (iii).\n\n        In addition to establishing the prohibition, the statute provides for mandatory minimum\n\nsentences in two instances: (1) offenders “previously convicted of a violent felony as defined in\n\n§ 17.1-805 shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five years . . . ;”\n\nand (2) offenders “previously convicted of any other felony within the prior 10 years shall be\n\nsentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of two years.” Unlike the prohibition\n\nportion of the statute, the mandatory minimum provisions of the statute make no express mention\n\nof delinquency adjudications.\n\n        Appellant argues that, because his predicate offenses were delinquency adjudications and\n\nthe mandatory minimum provisions do not mention delinquency adjudications, he should not\n\nhave received a mandatory minimum sentence. Rather, the trial court should have had all of the\n\n“normal” sentencing options it would have had for a Class 6 felony that was not subject to a\n\nmandatory minimum.\n\n        Appellant acknowledges that this Court has rejected this argument in a published opinion,\n\nCarter v. Commonwealth, 38 Va. App. 116, 562 S.E.2d 331 (2002).5 In Carter, we held that\n\n                in fashioning a statute to protect the public from the threat of\n                dangerously armed felons, the legislature expressly included within\n                the statutory proscription all persons previously “found guilty,”\n                while juveniles, of a “delinquent act,” deemed felonious.\n\n        5\n         Appellant notes that the underlying adjudications in Carter were for violent offenses and\nhis underlying adjudications were for non-violent offenses. Because the mandatory minimum\nprovisions apply to both violent and non-violent felonies, this distinction is immaterial to the\nquestion before us.\n                                               -5-\n\f               Subsequent reference in Code § 18.2-308.2(A) to “conviction or\n               adjudication” simply recognizes terms that sometimes differentiate\n               determinations of guilt in juvenile and adult prosecutions. Thus,\n               the inclusive language, “any person,” which appears in the\n               punishment provisions of the statute, clearly embraces anyone\n               found in violation of the prohibition. Contrary to defendant’s\n               argument, the statutory language promotes inclusion, not\n               exclusion. A different interpretation would exempt dangerous\n               felons, with demonstrated violent propensities, from a mandated\n               punishment intended to enhance public protection, a narrow and\n               illogical construction at odds with legislative intent.\n\nId. at 125, 562 S.E.2d at 335.\n\n       Carter’s holding dictates that we reject appellant’s argument. Recognizing this, appellant\n\nasks that we overrule Carter. This we cannot do. Butler v. Commonwealth, 64 Va. App. 7, 12,\n\n763 S.E.2d 829, 832 (2014) (“Under the interpanel accord doctrine, [a subsequent panel] lack[s]\n\nthe authority to revisit” prior published opinions of the Court of Appeals.); Startin v.\n\nCommonwealth, 56 Va. App. 26, 39 n.3, 690 S.E.2d 310, 316 n.3 (2010) (en banc) (noting that\n\npublished panel opinions of the Court of Appeals “bind all other three-judge panels under the\n\ninterpanel accord doctrine . . . ; [however,] they do not bind the Court sitting en banc”).\n\nAccordingly, consistent with Carter, we find that the trial court did not err in sentencing\n\nappellant pursuant to Code § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions.\n\n                   II. “As Applied” Challenge Under the Second Amendment\n\n       Appellant argues that, as applied to him, Code § 18.2-308.2’s prohibition on possessing\n\nfirearms violates the Second Amendment. Specifically, he contends that, although the statute’s ban\n\non convicted felons possessing firearms is presumptively valid, see District of Columbia v. Heller,\n\n554 U.S. 570, 626-27 (2008); DiGiacinto v. Rector & Visitors of George Mason Univ., 281 Va.\n\n127, 134, 704 S.E.2d 365, 369 (2011), its temporary ban on his possessing a firearm until he\n\nreaches the age of twenty-nine as a result of his adjudications of delinquency violates his Second\n\nAmendment right “to keep and bear arms.” Appellant’s constitutional challenge to a Virginia\n                                                -6-\n\fstatute presents a question of law that we review de novo. Toghill v. Commonwealth, 289 Va.\n\n220, 227, 768 S.E.2d 674, 678 (2015).\n\n                                    A. The Second Amendment\n\n       The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that “[a] well\n\nregulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep\n\nand bear arms, shall not be infringed.” In Heller, the United States Supreme Court conducted a\n\nlengthy historical analysis of its meaning and recognized that the Second Amendment right was\n\nan individual as opposed to collective right. Heller, 554 U.S. at 592. Although it did not limit\n\nthe right to only scenarios involving the defense of the home, the Court recognized that the core\n\nof the right was “the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth\n\nand home.” Id. at 635 (emphasis added); see also Kolbe v. Hogan, ___ F.3d. ___, ___, 2016\n\nU.S. App. LEXIS 1883, at *18 (4th Cir. Feb. 4, 2016) (stating that, under Heller, “the right of\n\nlaw-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth and home lies at the core of the\n\nSecond Amendment” right (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)).\n\n       Six years later, in McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561 U.S. 742 (2010), the Court found\n\nthat the Second Amendment right was incorporated against the states.6 Thus, state statutes that\n\narguably infringe upon the right are subject to constitutional challenge.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n         A four-justice plurality found that the right was incorporated against the states pursuant\nto the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, McDonald v. City of Chicago, 561\nU.S. 742, 767 (2010) (plurality opinion), while Justice Thomas found that it was incorporated\nagainst the states by the Fourteenth Amendment’s Privileges and Immunities Clause, id. at 806\n(Thomas, J., concurring). Accordingly, although a majority of justices did not agree on a\nrationale, a majority did agree that “the Second Amendment right is fully applicable to the\nStates.” Id. at 750.\n\n                                                 -7-\n\f                                  B. Heller and Levels of Scrutiny\n\n       Having recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right, the Supreme\n\nCourt also recognized that the right was subject to limitations, holding that “[l]ike most rights,\n\nthe right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.” Heller, 554 U.S. at 626. The\n\nCourt noted that, since the founding era, the right had been subject to various restrictions that\n\nwere not believed to suffer any constitutional infirmity. The Court made clear that its holding\n\ndid not call into question the legitimacy of these restrictions, noting that\n\n               [a]lthough we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis\n               today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our\n               opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions\n               on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or\n               laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as\n               schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions\n               and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n\nId. at 626-27. The Court emphasized that these categories were “presumptively lawful\n\nregulatory measures [but, were cited] only as examples; [the] list does not purport to be\n\nexhaustive.” Id. at 627 n.26.\n\n       Having found both that the right was subject to restriction and that such restrictions were\n\nsubject to constitutional challenge, the Court declined to set forth the appropriate level of\n\nscrutiny for courts to apply when addressing such challenges. Because of the breadth of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia’s gun ban, the Court simply noted that the challenged restrictions failed\n\nconstitutional muster “[u]nder any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to\n\nenumerated constitutional rights . . . .” Id. at 628.\n\n       Although it declined to set forth what the appropriate level of scrutiny is, the Court\n\nexpressly rejected two potential standards. First, the Court rejected that restrictions on the\n\nSecond Amendment right were subject to rational basis review, noting that “[i]f all that was\n\nrequired to overcome the right to keep and bear arms was a rational basis, the Second\n                                                 -8-\n\fAmendment would be redundant with the separate constitutional prohibitions on irrational laws,\n\nand would have no effect.” Id. at 628 n.27 (emphasis added). The Court also rejected the\n\n“interest-balancing inquiry” proposed in Justice Breyer’s dissent, commenting that\n\n               [w]e know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core\n               protection has been subjected to a freestanding “interest-\n               balancing” approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out\n               of the hands of government—even the Third Branch of\n               Government—the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether\n               the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee\n               subject to future judges’ assessments of its usefulness is no\n               constitutional guarantee at all. Constitutional rights are enshrined\n               with the scope they were understood to have when the people\n               adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even\n               future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an\n               “interest-balancing” approach to the prohibition of a peaceful\n               neo-Nazi march through Skokie. See National Socialist Party of\n               America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 97 S. Ct. 2205, 53 L. Ed. 2d 96\n               (1977) (per curiam). The First Amendment contains the freedom-\n               of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included\n               exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclosure of state secrets, but\n               not for the expression of extremely unpopular and wrong headed\n               views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is\n               the very product of an interest balancing by the people—which\n               Justice Breyer would now conduct for them anew. And whatever\n               else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other\n               interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms\n               in defense of hearth and home.\n\nId. at 634-35. Having made clear that neither rational basis review nor an interest balancing\n\napproach was appropriate, the Court reserved further explication on the appropriate standard of\n\nreview to future cases. Id. at 635.\n\n                   C. Determining Appropriate Level of Scrutiny after Heller\n\n       The Heller Court’s decision to not specify a level of scrutiny has led to much debate in\n\nthe academic literature as to what level of scrutiny is appropriate when considering a Second\n\nAmendment challenge to a statute. See, e.g., Stacey L. Sobel, The Tsunami of Legal\n\nUncertainty: What’s a Court to do Post-McDonald?, 21 Cornell J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 489, 490\n\n                                                -9-\n\f(2012) (noting that the Heller and McDonald decisions “left a number of critical issues\n\nunresolved, such as which standard of review to apply to Second Amendment legal challenges\n\nunder the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments” (footnotes omitted)); Robert A. Levy, Second\n\nAmendment Redux: Scrutiny, Incorporation and the Heller Paradox, 33 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol’y\n\n203, 206 (2010) (recognizing that, having concluded that the District of Columbia’s gun ban\n\nfailed under any appropriate level of scrutiny, the Heller Court “did not choose a specific\n\nstandard” for future challenges); Mark Tushnet, Permissible Gun Regulations After Heller:\n\nSpeculations About Method and Outcomes, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1425, 1426 (2009) (noting that,\n\nafter Heller, we know that “[a] complete ban on the possession of handguns for purposes of\n\nself-defense in the home is unconstitutional, and many longstanding forms of regulation—bans\n\non possession by felons and prohibitions on carrying firearms in ‘sensitive places’—are\n\nconstitutional. What we do not know is why.” (footnotes omitted)); and Andrew R. Gould, The\n\nHidden Second Amendment Framework within District of Columbia v. Heller, 62 Vand. L. Rev.\n\n1535, 1537 (2009) (“Thus, in resolving the question of whether the Second Amendment protects\n\nan individual right, the Court created a new mystery: How should courts review claims under the\n\nSecond Amendment?”).\n\n       The debate, however, is more than academic. Faced with Second Amendment challenges\n\nto gun statutes and regulations, different courts have applied different levels of scrutiny to the\n\nchallenged restrictions. Some courts have applied strict scrutiny. See, e.g., Kolbe, ___ F.3d at\n\n___, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 1883, at *35; Tyler v. Hillsdale County Sheriff’s Dep’t., 775 F.3d\n\n308, 328-29 (6th Cir. 2014), r’hrg en banc granted, opinion vacated, 2015 U.S. App. LEXIS\n\n6638 (Apr. 21, 2015) (recognizing that strict scrutiny is traditionally “appropriate for assessing a\n\nchallenge to an enumerated constitutional right” (citations omitted)). Others have applied\n\nintermediate scrutiny. See, e.g., United States v. Chester, 628 F.3d 673, 683 (4th Cir. 2010);\n                                                - 10 -\n\fUnited States v. Marzzarella, 614 F.3d 85, 97 (3d Cir. 2010); United States v. Skoien, 614 F.3d\n\n638, 641-42 (7th Cir. 2010) (en banc). In determining the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply,\n\nmany courts have concluded that certain restrictions should receive strict scrutiny, while other\n\nrestrictions need only be subject to intermediate scrutiny:\n\n               the appropriate level of scrutiny depends on the nature of the\n               conduct being regulated and the degree to which the challenged\n               law burdens the right. A regulation that threatens a right at the\n               core of the Second Amendment—for example, the right of a\n               law-abiding, responsible adult to possess and use a handgun to\n               defend his or her home and family—triggers strict scrutiny. A less\n               severe regulation—a regulation that does not encroach on the core\n               of the Second Amendment—requires a less demanding\n               means-ends showing. This more lenient level of scrutiny could be\n               called “intermediate” scrutiny, but regardless of the label, this level\n               requires the government to demonstrate a “reasonable fit” between\n               the challenged regulation and an important government objective.\n\nNRA, Inc. v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, ___ F.3d ___, ___, 2012\n\nU.S. App. LEXIS 26949, at *21-24 (5th Cir. 2012) (internal citations and quotation marks\n\nomitted). See also Chester, 628 F.3d at 682.\n\n       In addition to attempting to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply, many\n\ncourts have adopted a two-part framework to analyze Second Amendment challenges. As\n\nrecently described by the Unites States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a reviewing court\n\nfirst should\n\n               ask whether the challenged law imposes a burden on conduct\n               falling within the scope of the Second Amendment’s guarantee.\n               The answer to this question requires an historical inquiry into\n               whether the conduct at issue was understood to be within the scope\n               of the right at the time of ratification. If the answer to this initial\n               inquiry is no, the challenged law is valid. However, [i]f the\n               challenged regulation burdens conduct that was within the scope of\n               the Second Amendment as historically understood, then we move\n               to the second step of applying an appropriate form of means-end\n               scrutiny.\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\fKolbe, ___ F.3d at ___, 2016 U.S. App. LEXIS 1883, at *17 (internal citations and quotation\n\nmarks omitted) (alteration in original). Multiple federal circuit courts of appeal have adopted a\n\nsimilar two-part test. See, e.g., Fyock v. Sunnyvale, 779 F.3d 991, 996 (9th Cir. 2015); Ezell v.\n\nCity of Chicago, 651 F.3d 684, 701-03 (7th Cir. 2011); Heller v. District of Columbia, 670 F.3d\n\n1244, 1252 (D.C. Cir. 2011)7; United States v. Reese, 627 F.3d 792, 800-01 (10th Cir. 2010);\n\nand Marzzarella, 614 F.3d at 89.\n\n       Both in crafting the two-part test and in deliberating over the appropriate level of\n\nscrutiny, courts are attempting to resolve tension created by Heller. On the one hand, Heller\n\nmakes clear that the Second Amendment right provides an individual with protection from\n\ngovernment interference in the same manner that the First Amendment protects an individual’s\n\nFirst Amendment rights. Heller, 554 U.S. at 635. See also McDonald, 561 U.S. at 778\n\n(concluding that “the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to\n\nkeep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty”).\n\nYet, despite this recognition, the Court gave approval to blanket restrictions of the right when it\n\ndelineated its categories of “presumptively lawful regulatory measures,” Heller, 554 U.S. at 627\n\nn.26, some of which, if subjected to the case-by-case, means-ends analysis that characterizes\n\nstrict or even intermediate scrutiny, likely would fail to pass constitutional muster.\n\n       Although our review of appellant’s constitutional challenge is colored by this tension, we\n\nneed not resolve it in this case. For the reasons that follow, appellant’s challenge to the\n\ntemporary ban on his possession of firearms due to his felonious conduct fails because the\n\nrestriction is so closely analogous to the presumptively valid ban on possession of firearms by\n\n\n\n       7\n         This opinion, often referred to as Heller II, stems from the United States Supreme\nCourt’s remand of Heller for further proceedings consistent with the Court’s opinion.\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\ffelons as to merit no different result.8 Accordingly, we need not determine whether bans on\n\npossession of firearms by felons are permissible because such a restriction falls outside the scope\n\nof the Second Amendment right or may be sustained under the appropriate level of scrutiny,\n\nwhatever that may be.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         The Heller Court’s listing of presumptively lawful restrictions, including a ban on the\npossession of firearms by felons, and that listing’s restatement and adoption in McDonald has\nbeen criticized by Second Amendment scholars. Regarding the presumptively lawful restrictions\nand their restatement in McDonald, one Second Amendment scholar has written that the listing\nwas\n\n               unnecessary and irresponsible. . . . They had no basis in prior\n               Supreme Court case law and they were not supported by evidence\n               of the original meaning of the Second Amendment. . . .\n\n                       Consider . . . “[N]othing in our opinion should be taken to\n               cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of\n               firearms by felons and the mentally ill . . . .” This sounds\n               intuitively obvious, at least at first. But how “longstanding” are\n               these prohibitions? [The majority] either did not know, or decided\n               not to tell us in Heller. Apparently, however, the first general ban\n               on the possession of firearms by felons was enacted in 1968. This\n               was 177 years after the adoption of the Second Amendment and\n               less than a decade before the District of Columbia handgun ban\n               was enacted.\n\nNelson Lund, Two Faces of Judicial Restraint (Or Are There More?) in McDonald v. City of\nChicago, 63 U. Fla. L. Rev. 487, 502-03 (2011). See also Glenn Harlan Reynolds, Second\nAmendment Limitations, Georgetown J. L. & Pub.

Or, at least, it is not transforming–as it might have–into\na free pass for extensive limitations on firearms ownership. Though I doubt that the felons . . .\nlimitation on Second Amendment rights is in any danger of abandonment, it is coming in for\nmore judicial scrutiny.”).\n         Given the United States Supreme Court’s clear statements in both Heller and McDonald\nthat felon-in-possession bans are presumptively valid and the Virginia Supreme Court’s adoption\nof that language in DiGiacinto, we must assume that such a restriction is valid. It is up to those\ncourts, whose decisions are binding upon us, to revisit the specific language and its effects if they\nsee fit.\n                                                - 13 -\n\f                      D. Appellant’s Challenge to Code § 18.2-308.2(A)(iii)\n\n       As with any constitutional challenge to a Virginia statute, we begin with the proposition\n\nthat the acts of the General Assembly are presumed to be constitutional, and we “will not\n\ninvalidate a statute unless that statute clearly violates a provision of the United States or Virginia\n\nConstitutions.” Marshall v. N. Va. Transp. Auth., 275 Va. 419, 427, 657 S.E.2d 71, 75 (2008)\n\n(citations omitted). “[E]very reasonable doubt regarding the constitutionality of a legislative\n\nenactment must be resolved in favor of its validity.” Id. at 428, 657 S.E.2d at 75 (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n       Appellant does not dispute that Code § 18.2-308.2(A)(i)’s permanent ban on felons\n\npossessing firearms is valid, recognizing that it expressly falls within the scope of presumptively\n\nvalid regulations recognized by both the United States Supreme Court and the Virginia Supreme\n\nCourt. Heller, 554 U.S. at 626-27; DiGiacinto, 281 Va. at 134, 704 S.E.2d at 369. Rather, he\n\nattacks the statute’s temporary ban on firearm possession by non-violent juveniles who have\n\nbeen adjudicated delinquent for acts that were felonies if committed by adults, arguing that\n\n               although it is certainly reasonable for a felon to lose his gun rights,\n               the loss of such rights, even if only to age 29, by a citizen who\n               merely has a history as a non-violent juvenile delinquent is\n               irrational, endangers the public (more than it helps them) by\n               unreasonably reducing the number of citizens available for the\n               common defense, and is thus unconstitutional . . . .\n\n       Appellant stipulated that, as a juvenile, he violated Code § 18.2-248(G), possession with\n\nintent to distribute imitation cocaine, and that such violations would have constituted Class 6\n\nfelonies if appellant had been charged as an adult. The elements of the offense and the conduct\n\nnecessary to violate Code § 18.2-248(G) are the same whether the offender is tried as a juvenile or\n\nas an adult. Cf. Chardin v. Police Comm’r of Boston, 989 N.E.2d 392, 401 (Mass. 2013) (The\n\nfact that a juvenile offender cannot “be sentenced to the State prison does not change the nature\n\n                                                - 14 -\n\fof his offense, even though an ‘adjudication’ of delinquency generally is not a ‘conviction’ of a\n\ncrime. In other words, although the juvenile justice system did not treat [the juvenile offender]\n\nas a ‘criminal’ for his possession of a firearm without a license . . . he nonetheless committed an\n\nunlawful act that was a felony.” (citations omitted)), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 134 S. Ct. 525\n\n(2013). Thus, given his concession regarding the constitutionality of the ban on felons possessing\n\nfirearms, appellant necessarily has conceded that he engaged in conduct that appropriately could be\n\npunished by a lifetime ban on his possession of firearms.\n\n       Appellant offers no distinguishing feature of his juvenile adjudications that justifies finding\n\nthat the presumptively valid ban on possession of firearms by felons does not apply with equal force\n\nto juveniles who committed identical felonies.9 His only proffered justification, that the temporary\n\nban imposed by Code § 18.2-308.2(A)(iii) removes him from the pool of citizens who can provide\n\nfor “the common defense,” also would apply to felony convictions, whether the underlying offense\n\nwas committed by an adult or a juvenile who was tried as an adult, because those convicted would\n\nsimilarly be removed from the pool.\n\n       Furthermore, it is worth noting that juvenile adjudications were unknown at common law,\n\nunknown at the time of the ratification of the Second Amendment in 1791, and were still unknown\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          We recognize that juvenile adjudications differ from adult criminal proceedings in\nnumerous ways. See In re Gault, 387 U.S. 1, 14 (1967) (“From the inception of the juvenile\ncourt system, wide differences have been tolerated—indeed insisted upon—between the\nprocedural rights accorded to adults and those of juveniles. In practically all jurisdictions, there\nare rights granted to adults which are withheld from juveniles.”). Appellant, however, does not\nadvance any of those differences as a reason for finding the temporary ban on his possessing\nfirearms unconstitutional. Accordingly, we do not address those differences here.\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\fat the time of the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868.10 The advent of the juvenile\n\njustice system was largely a twentieth-century phenomenon.\n\n               The first separate and distinct juvenile court in the world was\n               established in Cook County (Chicago) in 1899 through passage of\n               the Illinois Juvenile Court Act. This Act created a separate court\n               for minors who committed criminal offenses and directed the\n               establishment of separate institutions for youths in order to\n               segregate them from adults, thus avoiding the mixing of juveniles\n               with adult criminals. The initiation of the juvenile justice system\n               in Virginia occurred in 1904 with the creation of authority for\n               judges to sentence juveniles to indeterminate sentences in separate,\n               privately run facilities, even though they were still tried in the\n               regular criminal justice system. In 1914, Virginia established\n               juvenile justice jurisdiction for courts by legislation that largely\n               paralleled the Illinois statute.\n\nJuvenile Law and Practice in Virginia, ¶ 1.1 (Robert E. Shepherd, Jr., ed., 1994 & Supp. 1999).\n\n       In both 1791 and 1868, Virginia adhered to the common law rule, meaning that\n\n               [a]n  infant, under seven years of age, is conclusively presumed to\n               be incapable of crime, and no evidence can be received to rebut the\n               presumption. Between seven and fourteen, he is within the age of\n               discretion, but still presumed doli incapax. This, however, is a\n               mere prima facie presumption which may be rebutted by evidence\n               of capacity sufficient to understand the nature of the act and its\n               consequences. The presumption of incapacity is very strong at\n               seven years of age, but it decreases with the progress of years. The\n               first point of inquiry is whether the accused was able to distinguish\n               between right and wrong, to understand the nature of the crime he\n               was committing, and that it was deserving severe punishment.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n          At oral argument, appellant argued that we should view his claim in the historical\ncontext of the Second Amendment right as understood at the time of ratification, stating that he\ndid not “know when else you would decide it.”\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\fLaw v. Commonwealth, 75 Va. 885, 888-89 (1881). At fifteen years of age, there was no\n\npresumption of incapacity and a defendant was treated as an adult.11 Appellant was seventeen at\n\nthe time of the adjudications and over fifteen at the time of the offenses. Applying the rule in\n\neffect at the time of ratification of either the Second Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nappellant would have been charged, tried, and punished as an adult.12 Accordingly, viewing the\n\nSecond Amendment right as a historical matter, a ban on possession by a juvenile who was\n\nadjudicated delinquent for a felonious act rests on the same footing as the presumptively\n\nconstitutional ban on a felon possessing firearms.13\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          If the government rebutted the presumption, children between seven and fourteen were\ncharged, tried, and punished as adults. For example, the Virginia Supreme Court noted an\nEnglish case where “a boy between eight and nine years of age . . . was executed for arson – it\nappearing he was actuated by malice and revenge, and had perpetrated the offence with craft and\ncunning.” Law, 75 Va. at 889.\n       12\n           That possession with intent to distribute imitation cocaine was not an offense in 1791\nor 1868 does not change the analysis. It is clear that the framers and ratifiers of the Second and\nFourteenth Amendments were familiar with the concept of felonies and the power of legislative\nbodies, such as the General Assembly, to criminalize conduct. To limit the requisite felonies to\nonly those in place in 1791 is the interpretive equivalent of limiting the right to keep and bear\narms only to muskets because more modern firearms came to be at a later point in time. We\nreject such a position. See Heller, 554 U.S. at 582 (“Some have made the argument, bordering\non the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the\nSecond Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First\nAmendment protects modern forms of communications and the Fourth Amendment applies to\nmodern forms of search, the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that\nconstitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.”).\n       13\n          We note that, despite this historical backdrop, the General Assembly did not ban\nappellant from ever again possessing firearms as a result of his juvenile adjudications. Rather,\nthe ban on his possession of firearms as a result of his juvenile adjudications was only\ntemporary. By the express terms of the statute, his ability to possess firearms would have been\nrestored when he reached the age of twenty-nine. Code § 18.2-308.2(A)(iii). Ironically,\nappellant’s subsequent conviction for grand larceny subjects him to the permanent ban on\npossession of firearms found in Code § 18.2-308(A)(i), a provision appellant concedes is\nconstitutional.\n                                                - 17 -\n\f       III. Appellant’s Notice Challenge to the Mandatory Minimum Sentence Provisions\n\n       In his third assignment of error, appellant attempts to constitutionalize the statutory\n\ninterpretation argument that underpins his first assignment of error. Specifically, he argues that,\n\nbecause the plain statutory text of Code § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions\n\ndoes not mention delinquency adjudications, a person in his situation is not provided notice that\n\nhe is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence. He argues that our decision in Carter, where we\n\napplied the mandatory minimum sentence provisions to a situation where the predicate offense\n\nwas a delinquency adjudication, is so divorced from the statutory text that it renders the statute\n\nvoid for vagueness.\n\n       Central to this argument is appellant’s position that a person is deemed to be on notice of\n\nstatutory prohibitions, but is not on notice of published court decisions interpreting those\n\nstatutes. Appellant, however, offered no direct authority for this position and provided no\n\nauthority from which such a conclusion reasonably could be analogized.\n\n                       Rule 5A:20(e) provide[s] . . . that the opening brief shall\n               include [t]he principles of law, the argument, and the authorities\n               relating to each question presented. Statements unsupported by\n               argument, authority, or citations to the record do not merit\n               appellate consideration. The [Virginia] Supreme Court concluded\n               that when a party’s failure to strictly adhere to the requirements of\n               Rule 5A:20(e) is significant, the Court of Appeals may . . . treat a\n               question presented as waived.\n\nAtkins v.

Moreau, Judge\n\n                            James C. Martin (Martin & Martin Law Firm, on brief), for\n                            appellant.\n\n                            Eugene Murphy, Senior Assistant Attorney General (Mark R.\n                            Herring, Attorney General, on brief), for appellee.\n\n\n                    Appellant entered a conditional guilty plea to the charge that he illegally possessed a firearm\n\n            in violation of Code § 18.2-308.2 after having been previously adjudicated delinquent for an offense\n\n            that would have been a felony if he had been an adult. Pursuant to the terms of the conditional\n\n            guilty plea, appellant preserved for appellate review his arguments that the trial court erred in\n\n            applying Code § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions to him, that Code\n\n            § 18.2-308.2 is unconstitutional as applied to him, and that this Court’s prior interpretation of Code\n\n            § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions renders the statute vague to the point that a\n\n            citizen is not on notice as to what the law actually is. For the reasons that follow, we disagree with\n\n            appellant and affirm his conviction for violating Code § 18.2-308.2.\n\n                                                       BACKGROUND\n\n                    In 2012, while seventeen years old, appellant was adjudicated delinquent for two instances\n\n            of violating Code § 18.2-248(G), possession with intent to distribute imitation cocaine. The\n\fviolations of Code § 18.2-248(G) would have been non-violent felonies if appellant had been an\n\nadult when he committed the offenses. Appellant does not dispute that he was over the age of\n\nfifteen at the time of the conduct underlying the delinquency adjudications.1\n\n       On December 31, 2013, when investigating another matter at appellant’s residence, police\n\nofficers discovered two firearms, specifically two operable long guns. At the time of the discovery,\n\nappellant acknowledged his possession of them, stating that he was keeping them for someone else\n\nwho was going to use them to go hunting. Appellant was charged with violation of Code\n\n§ 18.2-308.2 and with grand larceny unrelated to the firearms.2\n\n       In the trial court, the parties agreed that appellant had been previously adjudicated\n\ndelinquent of offenses that would have been non-violent felonies if he had been an adult, that he\n\nwas over the age of fourteen when he committed the offenses, and that, on December 31, 2013, he\n\nwas under the age of twenty-nine when he was found to possess the firearms. Recognizing that\n\nthese facts provided a sufficient evidentiary basis for convicting him of the violation of Code\n\n§ 18.2-308.2, appellant entered a conditional guilty plea.3 The trial court accepted the conditional\n\nguilty plea and, citing our decision in Carter v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1064681\"><a href=\"/opinion/1064681/carter-v-com/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.

At argument, he did not dispute that\nhe was at least fifteen at the time of the offenses, which is significant for the reasons detailed in\nSection II (D), infra.\n       2\n          Appellant was convicted of grand larceny and sentenced to three years, all suspended,\nfor that crime. The grand larceny charge is not a subject of this appeal.\n       3\n          Appellant initially pled not guilty and raised constitutional challenges to Code\n§ 18.2-308.2 by way of pretrial motion. Only after the trial court rejected his constitutional\nchallenges did he seek to change his plea. With the consent of the trial court and the\nCommonwealth, he entered a conditional guilty plea. See Code § 19.2-254 (“With the approval\nof the court and the consent of the Commonwealth, a defendant may enter a conditional plea of\nguilty in a misdemeanor or felony case in circuit court, reserving the right, on appeal from the\njudgment, to a review of the adverse determination of any specified pretrial motion. If the\ndefendant prevails on appeal, he shall be allowed to withdraw his plea.”).\n                                                 -2-\n\f(2002), applied the statute’s mandatory minimum sentencing provisions to appellant. As a result,\n\nthe trial court sentenced appellant to two years of incarceration.\n\n        Appellant’s conditional guilty plea preserved his ability to challenge on appeal aspects of\n\nboth his sentence and his conviction. Specifically, appellant retained the ability to argue that the\n\ntrial court erred in applying Code § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions to him,\n\nthat Code § 18.2-308.2 is unconstitutional as applied to him, and that this Court’s prior\n\ninterpretation of Code § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions renders the statute\n\nunconstitutionally vague.\n\n        Appellant noted and perfected his appeal, asserting the following assignments of error:\n\n                1.      The trial court erred in ruling that in prosecutions for the\n                violation of Va. Code § 18.2-308.2 where the predicate offense is a\n                delinquent act, the mandatory minimum sentence provisions are\n                nonetheless applicable.\n\n                2.      The trial court erred in failing to rule that Va. Code\n                § 18.2-308.2 is unconstitutional as applied to cases involving\n                predicate delinquent acts in that it unreasonably infringes upon the\n                Right of the People to Keep and Bear Arms pursuant to the Second\n                Amendment to the Constitution of the United States (as applied to\n                the states through the Fourteenth Amendment) and Article I, § 13\n                of the Constitution of Virginia.[4]\n\n                3.      Va. Code § 18.2-308.2 is unconstitutional to the extent that\n                it purports to apply mandatory minimum sentences to cases\n                involving predicate delinquent acts as it fails to give reasonable\n                notice as to the applicability of any such mandatory minimum\n                provisions to delinquent act cases and is thus at best void for\n                vagueness.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n         The Virginia Supreme Court has held that, in general, “the protection of the right to bear\narms expressed in Article I, § 13 of the Constitution of Virginia is co-extensive with the rights\nprovided by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution . . . .” DiGiacinto v.\nRector & Visitors of George Mason Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">127</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1058103\"><a href=\"/opinion/1058103/digiacinto-v-rector-and-visitors-of-gmu/\"><span class=\"volume\">704</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">365</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 369 (2011).\nAccordingly, our analysis of appellant’s Second Amendment claim applies with equal force to\nhis Article I, § 13 claim.\n                                                -3-\n\f                                           ANALYSIS\n\n I.

Recognizing that\n\n“convicted of a felony” and “adjudicated delinquent” are not synonymous, the General Assembly\n\nidentified them separately in subparts (i), (ii), and (iii).\n\n        In addition to establishing the prohibition, the statute provides for mandatory minimum\n\nsentences in two instances: (1) offenders “previously convicted of a violent felony as defined in\n\n§ 17.1-805 shall be sentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of five years . . . ;”\n\nand (2) offenders “previously convicted of any other felony within the prior 10 years shall be\n\nsentenced to a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of two years.” Unlike the prohibition\n\nportion of the statute, the mandatory minimum provisions of the statute make no express mention\n\nof delinquency adjudications.\n\n        Appellant argues that, because his predicate offenses were delinquency adjudications and\n\nthe mandatory minimum provisions do not mention delinquency adjudications, he should not\n\nhave received a mandatory minimum sentence. Rather, the trial court should have had all of the\n\n“normal” sentencing options it would have had for a Class 6 felony that was not subject to a\n\nmandatory minimum.\n\n        Appellant acknowledges that this Court has rejected this argument in a published opinion,\n\nCarter v.

Because the mandatory minimum\nprovisions apply to both violent and non-violent felonies, this distinction is immaterial to the\nquestion before us.\n                                               -5-\n\f               Subsequent reference in Code § 18.2-308.2(A) to “conviction or\n               adjudication” simply recognizes terms that sometimes differentiate\n               determinations of guilt in juvenile and adult prosecutions. Thus,\n               the inclusive language, “any person,” which appears in the\n               punishment provisions of the statute, clearly embraces anyone\n               found in violation of the prohibition. Contrary to defendant’s\n               argument, the statutory language promotes inclusion, not\n               exclusion. A different interpretation would exempt dangerous\n               felons, with demonstrated violent propensities, from a mandated\n               punishment intended to enhance public protection, a narrow and\n               illogical construction at odds with legislative intent.\n\nId. at 125, 562 S.E.2d at 335.\n\n       Carter’s holding dictates that we reject appellant’s argument.

Although it did not limit\n\nthe right to only scenarios involving the defense of the home, the Court recognized that the core\n\nof the right was “the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms in defense of hearth\n\nand home.” Id. at 635 (emphasis added); see also Kolbe v.

Heller and Levels of Scrutiny\n\n       Having recognized that the Second Amendment protects an individual right, the Supreme\n\nCourt also recognized that the right was subject to limitations, holding that “[l]ike most rights,\n\nthe right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited.” Heller, 554 U.S. at 626. The\n\nCourt noted that, since the founding era, the right had been subject to various restrictions that\n\nwere not believed to suffer any constitutional infirmity. The Court made clear that its holding\n\ndid not call into question the legitimacy of these restrictions, noting that\n\n               [a]lthough we do not undertake an exhaustive historical analysis\n               today of the full scope of the Second Amendment, nothing in our\n               opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions\n               on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or\n               laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as\n               schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions\n               and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.\n\nId. at 626-27. The Court emphasized that these categories were “presumptively lawful\n\nregulatory measures [but, were cited] only as examples; [the] list does not purport to be\n\nexhaustive.” Id. at 627 n.26.\n\n       Having found both that the right was subject to restriction and that such restrictions were\n\nsubject to constitutional challenge, the Court declined to set forth the appropriate level of\n\nscrutiny for courts to apply when addressing such challenges. Because of the breadth of the\n\nDistrict of Columbia’s gun ban, the Court simply noted that the challenged restrictions failed\n\nconstitutional muster “[u]nder any of the standards of scrutiny that we have applied to\n\nenumerated constitutional rights . . . .” Id. at 628.\n\n       Although it declined to set forth what the appropriate level of scrutiny is, the Court\n\nexpressly rejected two potential standards. First, the Court rejected that restrictions on the\n\nSecond Amendment right were subject to rational basis review, noting that “[i]f all that was\n\nrequired to overcome the right to keep and bear arms was a rational basis, the Second\n                                                 -8-\n\fAmendment would be redundant with the separate constitutional prohibitions on irrational laws,\n\nand would have no effect.” Id. at 628 n.27 (emphasis added). The Court also rejected the\n\n“interest-balancing inquiry” proposed in Justice Breyer’s dissent, commenting that\n\n               [w]e know of no other enumerated constitutional right whose core\n               protection has been subjected to a freestanding “interest-\n               balancing” approach. The very enumeration of the right takes out\n               of the hands of government—even the Third Branch of\n               Government—the power to decide on a case-by-case basis whether\n               the right is really worth insisting upon. A constitutional guarantee\n               subject to future judges’ assessments of its usefulness is no\n               constitutional guarantee at all. Constitutional rights are enshrined\n               with the scope they were understood to have when the people\n               adopted them, whether or not future legislatures or (yes) even\n               future judges think that scope too broad. We would not apply an\n               “interest-balancing” approach to the prohibition of a peaceful\n               neo-Nazi march through Skokie.

The First Amendment contains the freedom-\n               of-speech guarantee that the people ratified, which included\n               exceptions for obscenity, libel, and disclosure of state secrets, but\n               not for the expression of extremely unpopular and wrong headed\n               views. The Second Amendment is no different. Like the First, it is\n               the very product of an interest balancing by the people—which\n               Justice Breyer would now conduct for them anew. And whatever\n               else it leaves to future evaluation, it surely elevates above all other\n               interests the right of law-abiding, responsible citizens to use arms\n               in defense of hearth and home.\n\nId. at 634-35.

Id. at 635.\n\n                   C. Determining Appropriate Level of Scrutiny after Heller\n\n       The Heller Court’s decision to not specify a level of scrutiny has led to much debate in\n\nthe academic literature as to what level of scrutiny is appropriate when considering a Second\n\nAmendment challenge to a statute. See, e.g., Stacey L. Sobel, The Tsunami of Legal\n\nUncertainty: What’s a Court to do Post-McDonald?, 21 Cornell J.L. & Pub. Pol’y 489, 490\n\n                                                -9-\n\f(2012) (noting that the Heller and McDonald decisions “left a number of critical issues\n\nunresolved, such as which standard of review to apply to Second Amendment legal challenges\n\nunder the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments” (footnotes omitted)); Robert A. Levy, Second\n\nAmendment Redux: Scrutiny, Incorporation and the Heller Paradox, 33 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol’y\n\n203, 206 (2010) (recognizing that, having concluded that the District of Columbia’s gun ban\n\nfailed under any appropriate level of scrutiny, the Heller Court “did not choose a specific\n\nstandard” for future challenges); Mark Tushnet, Permissible Gun Regulations After Heller:\n\nSpeculations About Method and Outcomes, 56 UCLA L. Rev. 1425, 1426 (2009) (noting that,\n\nafter Heller, we know that “[a] complete ban on the possession of handguns for purposes of\n\nself-defense in the home is unconstitutional, and many longstanding forms of regulation—bans\n\non possession by felons and prohibitions on carrying firearms in ‘sensitive places’—are\n\nconstitutional. What we do not know is why.” (footnotes omitted)); and Andrew R. Gould, The\n\nHidden Second Amendment Framework within District of Columbia v. Heller, 62 Vand. L. Rev.\n\n1535, 1537 (2009) (“Thus, in resolving the question of whether the Second Amendment protects\n\nan individual right, the Court created a new mystery: How should courts review claims under the\n\nSecond Amendment?”).\n\n       The debate, however, is more than academic. Faced with Second Amendment challenges\n\nto gun statutes and regulations, different courts have applied different levels of scrutiny to the\n\nchallenged restrictions. Some courts have applied strict scrutiny.

In determining the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply,\n\nmany courts have concluded that certain restrictions should receive strict scrutiny, while other\n\nrestrictions need only be subject to intermediate scrutiny:\n\n               the appropriate level of scrutiny depends on the nature of the\n               conduct being regulated and the degree to which the challenged\n               law burdens the right. A regulation that threatens a right at the\n               core of the Second Amendment—for example, the right of a\n               law-abiding, responsible adult to possess and use a handgun to\n               defend his or her home and family—triggers strict scrutiny. A less\n               severe regulation—a regulation that does not encroach on the core\n               of the Second Amendment—requires a less demanding\n               means-ends showing. This more lenient level of scrutiny could be\n               called “intermediate” scrutiny, but regardless of the label, this level\n               requires the government to demonstrate a “reasonable fit” between\n               the challenged regulation and an important government objective.\n\nNRA, Inc. v.

See also Chester, 628 F.3d at 682.\n\n       In addition to attempting to determine the appropriate level of scrutiny to apply, many\n\ncourts have adopted a two-part framework to analyze Second Amendment challenges. As\n\nrecently described by the Unites States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, a reviewing court\n\nfirst should\n\n               ask whether the challenged law imposes a burden on conduct\n               falling within the scope of the Second Amendment’s guarantee.\n               The answer to this question requires an historical inquiry into\n               whether the conduct at issue was understood to be within the scope\n               of the right at the time of ratification. If the answer to this initial\n               inquiry is no, the challenged law is valid. However, [i]f the\n               challenged regulation burdens conduct that was within the scope of\n               the Second Amendment as historically understood, then we move\n               to the second step of applying an appropriate form of means-end\n               scrutiny.\n\n\n\n                                               - 11 -\n\fKolbe, ___ F.3d at ___, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2016</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S. App. LEXIS</span> <span class=\"page\">1883</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *17 (internal citations and quotation\n\nmarks omitted) (alteration in original).

On the one hand, Heller\n\nmakes clear that the Second Amendment right provides an individual with protection from\n\ngovernment interference in the same manner that the First Amendment protects an individual’s\n\nFirst Amendment rights. Heller, 554 U.S. at 635. See also McDonald, 561 U.S. at 778\n\n(concluding that “the Framers and ratifiers of the Fourteenth Amendment counted the right to\n\nkeep and bear arms among those fundamental rights necessary to our system of ordered liberty”).\n\nYet, despite this recognition, the Court gave approval to blanket restrictions of the right when it\n\ndelineated its categories of “presumptively lawful regulatory measures,” Heller, 554 U.S. at 627\n\nn.26, some of which, if subjected to the case-by-case, means-ends analysis that characterizes\n\nstrict or even intermediate scrutiny, likely would fail to pass constitutional muster.\n\n       Although our review of appellant’s constitutional challenge is colored by this tension, we\n\nneed not resolve it in this case. For the reasons that follow, appellant’s challenge to the\n\ntemporary ban on his possession of firearms due to his felonious conduct fails because the\n\nrestriction is so closely analogous to the presumptively valid ban on possession of firearms by\n\n\n\n       7\n         This opinion, often referred to as Heller II, stems from the United States Supreme\nCourt’s remand of Heller for further proceedings consistent with the Court’s opinion.\n\n                                                - 12 -\n\ffelons as to merit no different result.8 Accordingly, we need not determine whether bans on\n\npossession of firearms by felons are permissible because such a restriction falls outside the scope\n\nof the Second Amendment right or may be sustained under the appropriate level of scrutiny,\n\nwhatever that may be.\n\n\n\n\n       8\n         The Heller Court’s listing of presumptively lawful restrictions, including a ban on the\npossession of firearms by felons, and that listing’s restatement and adoption in McDonald has\nbeen criticized by Second Amendment scholars. Regarding the presumptively lawful restrictions\nand their restatement in McDonald, one Second Amendment scholar has written that the listing\nwas\n\n               unnecessary and irresponsible. . . . They had no basis in prior\n               Supreme Court case law and they were not supported by evidence\n               of the original meaning of the Second Amendment. . . .\n\n                       Consider . . . “[N]othing in our opinion should be taken to\n               cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of\n               firearms by felons and the mentally ill . . . .” This sounds\n               intuitively obvious, at least at first. But how “longstanding” are\n               these prohibitions? [The majority] either did not know, or decided\n               not to tell us in Heller. Apparently, however, the first general ban\n               on the possession of firearms by felons was enacted in 1968. This\n               was 177 years after the adoption of the Second Amendment and\n               less than a decade before the District of Columbia handgun ban\n               was enacted.\n\nNelson Lund, Two Faces of Judicial Restraint (Or Are There More?) in McDonald v.

Rather, he\n\nattacks the statute’s temporary ban on firearm possession by non-violent juveniles who have\n\nbeen adjudicated delinquent for acts that were felonies if committed by adults, arguing that\n\n               although it is certainly reasonable for a felon to lose his gun rights,\n               the loss of such rights, even if only to age 29, by a citizen who\n               merely has a history as a non-violent juvenile delinquent is\n               irrational, endangers the public (more than it helps them) by\n               unreasonably reducing the number of citizens available for the\n               common defense, and is thus unconstitutional . . . .\n\n       Appellant stipulated that, as a juvenile, he violated Code § 18.2-248(G), possession with\n\nintent to distribute imitation cocaine, and that such violations would have constituted Class 6\n\nfelonies if appellant had been charged as an adult.

Thus, given his concession regarding the constitutionality of the ban on felons possessing\n\nfirearms, appellant necessarily has conceded that he engaged in conduct that appropriately could be\n\npunished by a lifetime ban on his possession of firearms.\n\n       Appellant offers no distinguishing feature of his juvenile adjudications that justifies finding\n\nthat the presumptively valid ban on possession of firearms by felons does not apply with equal force\n\nto juveniles who committed identical felonies.9 His only proffered justification, that the temporary\n\nban imposed by Code § 18.2-308.2(A)(iii) removes him from the pool of citizens who can provide\n\nfor “the common defense,” also would apply to felony convictions, whether the underlying offense\n\nwas committed by an adult or a juvenile who was tried as an adult, because those convicted would\n\nsimilarly be removed from the pool.\n\n       Furthermore, it is worth noting that juvenile adjudications were unknown at common law,\n\nunknown at the time of the ratification of the Second Amendment in 1791, and were still unknown\n\n\n\n\n       9\n          We recognize that juvenile adjudications differ from adult criminal proceedings in\nnumerous ways. See In re Gault, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107439\"><a href=\"/opinion/107439/in-re-gault/\"><span class=\"volume\">387</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 14 (1967) (“From the inception of the juvenile\ncourt system, wide differences have been tolerated—indeed insisted upon—between the\nprocedural rights accorded to adults and those of juveniles. In practically all jurisdictions, there\nare rights granted to adults which are withheld from juveniles.”). Appellant, however, does not\nadvance any of those differences as a reason for finding the temporary ban on his possessing\nfirearms unconstitutional. Accordingly, we do not address those differences here.\n\n                                                - 15 -\n\fat the time of the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868.10 The advent of the juvenile\n\njustice system was largely a twentieth-century phenomenon.\n\n               The first separate and distinct juvenile court in the world was\n               established in Cook County (Chicago) in 1899 through passage of\n               the Illinois Juvenile Court Act. This Act created a separate court\n               for minors who committed criminal offenses and directed the\n               establishment of separate institutions for youths in order to\n               segregate them from adults, thus avoiding the mixing of juveniles\n               with adult criminals. The initiation of the juvenile justice system\n               in Virginia occurred in 1904 with the creation of authority for\n               judges to sentence juveniles to indeterminate sentences in separate,\n               privately run facilities, even though they were still tried in the\n               regular criminal justice system. In 1914, Virginia established\n               juvenile justice jurisdiction for courts by legislation that largely\n               paralleled the Illinois statute.\n\nJuvenile Law and Practice in Virginia, ¶ 1.1 (Robert E. Shepherd, Jr., ed., 1994 & Supp. 1999).\n\n       In both 1791 and 1868, Virginia adhered to the common law rule, meaning that\n\n               [a]n  infant, under seven years of age, is conclusively presumed to\n               be incapable of crime, and no evidence can be received to rebut the\n               presumption. Between seven and fourteen, he is within the age of\n               discretion, but still presumed doli incapax. This, however, is a\n               mere prima facie presumption which may be rebutted by evidence\n               of capacity sufficient to understand the nature of the act and its\n               consequences. The presumption of incapacity is very strong at\n               seven years of age, but it decreases with the progress of years. The\n               first point of inquiry is whether the accused was able to distinguish\n               between right and wrong, to understand the nature of the crime he\n               was committing, and that it was deserving severe punishment.\n\n\n\n\n       10\n          At oral argument, appellant argued that we should view his claim in the historical\ncontext of the Second Amendment right as understood at the time of ratification, stating that he\ndid not “know when else you would decide it.”\n\n                                               - 16 -\n\fLaw v. Commonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Va.</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 888-89 (1881). At fifteen years of age, there was no\n\npresumption of incapacity and a defendant was treated as an adult.11 Appellant was seventeen at\n\nthe time of the adjudications and over fifteen at the time of the offenses. Applying the rule in\n\neffect at the time of ratification of either the Second Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment,\n\nappellant would have been charged, tried, and punished as an adult.12 Accordingly, viewing the\n\nSecond Amendment right as a historical matter, a ban on possession by a juvenile who was\n\nadjudicated delinquent for a felonious act rests on the same footing as the presumptively\n\nconstitutional ban on a felon possessing firearms.13\n\n\n\n\n       11\n          If the government rebutted the presumption, children between seven and fourteen were\ncharged, tried, and punished as adults. For example, the Virginia Supreme Court noted an\nEnglish case where “a boy between eight and nine years of age . . . was executed for arson – it\nappearing he was actuated by malice and revenge, and had perpetrated the offence with craft and\ncunning.” Law, 75 Va. at 889.\n       12\n           That possession with intent to distribute imitation cocaine was not an offense in 1791\nor 1868 does not change the analysis. It is clear that the framers and ratifiers of the Second and\nFourteenth Amendments were familiar with the concept of felonies and the power of legislative\nbodies, such as the General Assembly, to criminalize conduct. To limit the requisite felonies to\nonly those in place in 1791 is the interpretive equivalent of limiting the right to keep and bear\narms only to muskets because more modern firearms came to be at a later point in time. We\nreject such a position. See Heller, 554 U.S. at 582 (“Some have made the argument, bordering\non the frivolous, that only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the\nSecond Amendment. We do not interpret constitutional rights that way. Just as the First\nAmendment protects modern forms of communications and the Fourth Amendment applies to\nmodern forms of search, the Second Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that\nconstitute bearable arms, even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding.”).\n       13\n          We note that, despite this historical backdrop, the General Assembly did not ban\nappellant from ever again possessing firearms as a result of his juvenile adjudications. Rather,\nthe ban on his possession of firearms as a result of his juvenile adjudications was only\ntemporary. By the express terms of the statute, his ability to possess firearms would have been\nrestored when he reached the age of twenty-nine. Code § 18.2-308.2(A)(iii). Ironically,\nappellant’s subsequent conviction for grand larceny subjects him to the permanent ban on\npossession of firearms found in Code § 18.2-308(A)(i), a provision appellant concedes is\nconstitutional.\n                                                - 17 -\n\f       III. Appellant’s Notice Challenge to the Mandatory Minimum Sentence Provisions\n\n       In his third assignment of error, appellant attempts to constitutionalize the statutory\n\ninterpretation argument that underpins his first assignment of error. Specifically, he argues that,\n\nbecause the plain statutory text of Code § 18.2-308.2’s mandatory minimum sentence provisions\n\ndoes not mention delinquency adjudications, a person in his situation is not provided notice that\n\nhe is subject to a mandatory minimum sentence. He argues that our decision in Carter, where we\n\napplied the mandatory minimum sentence provisions to a situation where the predicate offense\n\nwas a delinquency adjudication, is so divorced from the statutory text that it renders the statute\n\nvoid for vagueness.\n\n       Central to this argument is appellant’s position that a person is deemed to be on notice of\n\nstatutory prohibitions, but is not on notice of published court decisions interpreting those\n\nstatutes. Appellant, however, offered no direct authority for this position and provided no\n\nauthority from which such a conclusion reasonably could be analogized.\n\n                       Rule 5A:20(e) provide[s] . . . that the opening brief shall\n               include [t]he principles of law, the argument, and the authorities\n               relating to each question presented. Statements unsupported by\n               argument, authority, or citations to the record do not merit\n               appellate consideration. The [Virginia] Supreme Court concluded\n               that when a party’s failure to strictly adhere to the requirements of\n               Rule 5A:20(e) is significant, the Court of Appeals may . . . treat a\n               question presented as waived.\n\nAtkins v.
