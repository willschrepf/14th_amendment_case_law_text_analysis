After the codification of 1925, the\npopulation bracket was made referable to each preceding\nFederal census, and the statute has remained the same since\nthat time with the exception of an amendment in 1959, permit-\nting the disannexation of improved territory \"within the\ncorporate limits of any city in this state of five hundred\nand ninety-six thousand (596,000) or more population accord-\ning to the last preceding Federal census, . . which is non-\ntaxable to the city and which is conti ous and adjoining the\nlines of any such city.\" Acts 1959, 5rth Lag., p. 563, ch.\n254, Sec.1.\n\fHonorable George L. Preston, page 3 (WW-1054)\n\n\n     The title of the amendatory bill under consideration makes\nno reference to the fact that the bill omits the provisions\nof the 1959 amendment and we are of the opinion that H.B. No.\n738 is contrary to Section 35 of Article III of the Constitu-\ntion of Texas and Is invalid to the extent that it attempts to\nexclude that provision. The rule is stated in Volume 39 of\nTexas Jurisprudence at page 103:\n          I,\n           . . . Thus a title that expresses a\n     purpose to change a prior law by adding or\n     extending a provision or conferring a right\n     does not warrant an amendment that omits or\n     restricts a provision of the original act or\n     destroys a previously existing right. . . .\n           \"A title expressing a purpose to amend\n     a statute in a certain particular is deceptive\n     and misleading in so far as the body of the act\n     purports to tmend the prior law in other particu-\n     lars.          Citing the following cases: Ward\n     Cattle 4 Pasture Co. v. Carpenter, 109 Tex. 103,\n     200 S.W. 521 (1918); Lone Star Gas Co. v. Birdwell,\n     74 S.W.2d 294 (Clv.App. 1934); Holman et al v.\n     Pabst, 27 S.W.2d 340 (Civ.App. 1930, error ref.);\n     Holman v. Cowden & Sutherland, 1.58 S.W. 571 (Civ.\n     App. 1913, error ref,.).\n     However, this defect does not render the bill unconstitu-\ntional, but will only cause the 1959 amendment to remain in\neffect.\n     Following the enacting clause, there should be added a\nprovision to this effect: - \"Section 1 of Article 1266, as\namended in 1959, is to be amended so as to hereinafter read\nas follows: \"\n     Another problem is presented by that provision of H.B.\nNo. 738 which would permit the governing body of any city\ncoming within the specified population bracket, by ordinance\nduly passed, to dlsannex \"any territoryof any extent, whether\nimproved or unimproved, lying within twenty-five hundred feet\nfrom the thread of any navigable stream. . . .'I The addition\nof this quoted provision is the only change made in Article\n1266, other than the omission of the 1959 amendment mention-\ned above.\n\fHonorable George L. Preston, page & (WW-1054)\n\n\n     The constitutionality of Article 1266 as it existed\nprior to 1959, was upheld in City of San Antonio v. State\nex rel. Criner, 270 S.W.2d 460 (Civ.App. 1954 error refT).\nBy quo warrant0 proceeding, an ordinance detahhing approxi-\nmately 65 square miles of territory from the city was in-\nvalidated. On appeal, the constitutionality of Article 1266\nwas challenged on the ground that it violated Section 56 of\nArticle III of the Constitution of Texas, which provides\nin part that the Legislature cannot pass any local or special\nlaw regulating the affairs of cities. (The city's contention\nthat the area detached was unimproved within the meaning of\nArticle 1266 was overruled.) With regard to the constitutional\nobjection posed, we quote at length from the per curiam opinion:\n          1x\n           . . . In 1923 the City of Dallas was the\n     only city which fell within the population bracket\n     fixed by this statute. Since such time however the\n     cities of San Antonio, Fort Worth and Houston have\n     grown into such bracket. It is therefore an establish-\n     ed fact that this statute has elasticity and is not\n     one which could never apply to a city not qualified\n     at the time of the passage of the statute.\n          \"In Miller v. El Paso County, 136 Tex. 370,\n     150 S.W.2d 1000,1002, the Supreme Court said:\n\n              \"'Resort to population brackets for\n         the purpose of classifying subjects for\n         legislation is permissible where the spread\n         of population is broad enough to include or\n         segregate a substantial class, and where\n         the population bears some real relation to\n         the subject of legislation and affords a\n         fair basis for the classification.'\n          \"In Rexar County v. Tynan, 128 Tex. 223,\n    97 S.W.2d 467, 469, (Comm.App.,Sec.A), the Court\n    said:\n              \"'The Legislature may, upon a proper\n         and reasonable classification, enact a\n         general law which at the time of its\n         enactment is applicable to only one county;\n         provided its application is not so in-\n         flexibly fixed as to prevent S.tever being\n         applicable to other counties.'\n          \"We also quote from Rodriguez v. Gonzales,\n     148 Tex. 537, 227 S.W.2d 791, 793, where the Court\n     stated:\n\fHonorable George L. Preston, page 5 (WW-1054)\n\n\n              \"'The primary and ultimate test of\n         whether a law is general or special is\n         whether there Is a reasonable basis for\n         the classification made by the law, and\n         whether the law operates equally on all\n         within the class. Bexar County v. Tynan,\n         128 Tex. 223, 97 S.W.2d 467; Miller V.\n         El Paso County, 136 Tex. 370, 150 S.W.\n         2d 1000; 1 Sutherland (2nd Ed.), Statutory\n         Construction, Sec. 203. If the classifi-\n         cation made by the law \"is not based upon\n         a reasonable and substantial difference in\n         kind, situation OP circumstance bearing a\n         proper relation to the purpose of the\n         statute,\" it is a special law.'\n         \"It is our opinion that Art. 1266 meets the\n    requirements of these decisions. The statute is\n    not closed but it Is one into which cities not\n    only may but have grown. Appellants as much as\n    concede that the statute is not invalid on the\n    ground that It is too restrictive but base their\n    principal argument upon the ground that the classi-\n    fication of the statute has no proper relation to the\n    purpose of the statute. With this we do not agree.\n         \"The number of problems which a city has and\n    their complexity increase with amazing alacrity\n    as a city grows in size. To meet these problems\n    the Legislature enacts various laws which It deems\n    appropriate to cities of a given size. Art. 1266\n    is one of these laws. It applies to the four\n    largest cities in Texas and provides that they may\n    not detach territory unless it exceeds three acres\n    in size and is unimproved. On the other hand, the\n    Legislature has provided that cities incorporated\n    under general laws. usually less than 5,000 popula-\n    tion, may detach if there is at least 10 acres\n    which is uninhabited as defined in such statute.\n         \"The record in this case reflects a very\n    sound basis for the distinction drawn by the\n    Legislature as reflected by Arts. 1266 and 973.\n    The nature of the improvements on this territory,\n    sewers, gas, water, telephone, power facilities\n    and paved roads are but the usual and customary\n\fHonorable George L. Preston, page 6 (WW-1054)\n\n\n     improvements to be found within the limits of\n     all large cities such as San Antonio, Dallas,\n     Houston and Fort Worth. Small towns as those\n     affected by Art. 973 are not so likely to be\n     as highly improved and hence are the subject of\n     different legislative treatment in this respect.\n          \"In our opinion there is a legitimate\n     relationship between the size of a city and the\n     privilege of detaching a portion of its terri-\n     tory and that Art. 1266, based upon such relation-\n     ship, is a valid statute. Whether it is wise or\n     unwise is exclusively a legislative matter.\n          \"We have no hesitancy in saying, however,\n     that a city dweller who becomes accustomed to\n     city services and privileges such as water,\n     sewer, garbage, schools and fire and police\n     protection or who has improved his property\n     in reliance upon city zoning laws is entitled\n     to reasonable safeguards against the overnight\n     destruction of these advantages and that the\n     enforcement of Art. 1266 will have this wholesome\n     effect.\"\n     We are of the opinion that H.B. No. 738 is violative of\nSection 56 of Article III of the Constitution of Texas because\nthe classification of the bill has no proper relation to the\npurpose of the Statute. While there may well be, as announced\nin the City of San Antonio case, supra, \"a legitimate relation-\nship between the size of a city and the privilege of detaching\na portion of its territory,\" we believe that the legitimacy is\nattributable to the fact that the legislation there reviewed\nhad as its purpose the granting of permission to cities the\npower to make reasonable, orderly alterations of its boundaries\nby the exclusion of property not necessary for, nor benefited\nby, inclusion within the corporate limits.\n     But the avowed purpose of H.B. No. 738 is \"the importance\nof fostering commerce and industry along the navigable streams\nof this State, . . .' and we can perceive of no distinguishing\ncharacteristics between cities of the population expressed in\nthe bill and those of lesser population, where both have\nnavigable streams within their limits, that would impart legiti-\nmacy to the classification. The rule was pronounced in Leonard\nv. Road Maintenance District No. 1, 187 Ark. 599, 61 S.Wm\nn--m33)    and cited with approval in Miller v. El Paso County,\n136 Tex. $70, 150 S.W.2d 1000 (19&l), as follows:\n\f            .   .   .\n\n\n\n\nHonorable George L. Preston, page 7 (WW- 1059\n\n\n              . 'The rule is that a classlfica-\n    tion cannot be adopted arbitrarily upon a\n    ground which has no foundation in difference\n    of situation or circumstances of the munici-\n    palities placed in the different classes. There\n    must be some reasonable relation between the\n    situation of municipalities classified and the\n    purposes and objects to be attained. There must\n    be something * * * which in some reasonable\n    degree accounts for the division into classes.'\"\nIn Oliver v. city of Burlington, 75 N.J.L. 227, 67 Atl. 43,\n(1907) a statute granting to cities of the third class\nauthority to lease their wharves was held to be void because\nit was local or special. We quote from the court's opinion:\n          0 . . . In this case there has been no\n     reason assigned, nor is it apparent, why all\n     cities should not have the power to lease their\n     wharves as well as cities of the third class.\n     Population cannot have any just reference to\n     this distinction between these classes by which\n     the one is separated from the others. There is\n     no natural connection between the number of people\n      ina city and its right to lease its wharves. The\n     classification made by a statute is justified or\n     not, by considering whether the statute is thereby\n     rendered general :r special, not whether it is wise\n     or unwise.           Cf. Christoph v. Chilton, 205\n     WIS. 418, 23-ii.i. 134 (1931).\n     In view of the above authorities, H.B. No. 738 is unconsti-\ntutional as local and special legislation.\n     In our opinion, there is also a serious question as to\nwhether H.B. No. 738 is violative of the due process section\nof the Constitution of Texas, to the extent that it would\nallow summary diaannexation of improved property lying within\ntwenty-five hundred feet from the thread of any navigable\nstream.\n     In H.B. No. 738 no standard is provided, other than that\nthe property lie within twenty-five hundred feet of a navigable\nstream; nor is there opportunity for notice, hearing or remon-\nstrance by the owners of the property affected. The proposed\namendment would afford no reasonable safeguard against the\novernight destruction of those advantages accruing to a city\ndweller who has become accustomed to city services and privileges\nsuch as water, sewer, grabage, schools and fire and police\n\f                                               .   ,\n\n\n\n\nHonorable George L.

State, supra, at page\n6 of this opinion.\n\n\n                          SUMMARY\n         H.B. No. 738 violates Section 35 of\n         Article III of the Constitution of\n         Texas in that the title of the Act\n         fails to reflect that a provision of\n         the amended Act is omitted; however,\n         this defect does not render the bill\n         unconstitutional but will only cause\n         the 1959 amendment to remain in effect.\n         H.B. No. 738 is unconstitutional as it\n         violates Section 56 of Article III of the\n         Texas Constitution, because the classifi-\n         cation of the Act has no proper relation\n         to the purpose of the Act.\n                          Yours very truly,\n                          WILL ,WILSON\n                          Attorney General of Texas\n\n\n                               L-Le.+.)-zc:u\n                          BY\n                               Dudley D.

Preston, page 3 (WW-1054)\n\n\n     The title of the amendatory bill under consideration makes\nno reference to the fact that the bill omits the provisions\nof the 1959 amendment and we are of the opinion that H.B. No.\n738 is contrary to Section 35 of Article III of the Constitu-\ntion of Texas and Is invalid to the extent that it attempts to\nexclude that provision. The rule is stated in Volume 39 of\nTexas Jurisprudence at page 103:\n          I,\n           . . . Thus a title that expresses a\n     purpose to change a prior law by adding or\n     extending a provision or conferring a right\n     does not warrant an amendment that omits or\n     restricts a provision of the original act or\n     destroys a previously existing right. . . .\n           \"A title expressing a purpose to amend\n     a statute in a certain particular is deceptive\n     and misleading in so far as the body of the act\n     purports to tmend the prior law in other particu-\n     lars.

On appeal, the constitutionality of Article 1266\nwas challenged on the ground that it violated Section 56 of\nArticle III of the Constitution of Texas, which provides\nin part that the Legislature cannot pass any local or special\nlaw regulating the affairs of cities. (The city's contention\nthat the area detached was unimproved within the meaning of\nArticle 1266 was overruled.) With regard to the constitutional\nobjection posed, we quote at length from the per curiam opinion:\n          1x\n           . . . In 1923 the City of Dallas was the\n     only city which fell within the population bracket\n     fixed by this statute. Since such time however the\n     cities of San Antonio, Fort Worth and Houston have\n     grown into such bracket. It is therefore an establish-\n     ed fact that this statute has elasticity and is not\n     one which could never apply to a city not qualified\n     at the time of the passage of the statute.\n          \"In Miller v.

The statute is\n    not closed but it Is one into which cities not\n    only may but have grown. Appellants as much as\n    concede that the statute is not invalid on the\n    ground that It is too restrictive but base their\n    principal argument upon the ground that the classi-\n    fication of the statute has no proper relation to the\n    purpose of the statute. With this we do not agree.\n         \"The number of problems which a city has and\n    their complexity increase with amazing alacrity\n    as a city grows in size. To meet these problems\n    the Legislature enacts various laws which It deems\n    appropriate to cities of a given size. Art. 1266\n    is one of these laws. It applies to the four\n    largest cities in Texas and provides that they may\n    not detach territory unless it exceeds three acres\n    in size and is unimproved. On the other hand, the\n    Legislature has provided that cities incorporated\n    under general laws. usually less than 5,000 popula-\n    tion, may detach if there is at least 10 acres\n    which is uninhabited as defined in such statute.\n         \"The record in this case reflects a very\n    sound basis for the distinction drawn by the\n    Legislature as reflected by Arts. 1266 and 973.\n    The nature of the improvements on this territory,\n    sewers, gas, water, telephone, power facilities\n    and paved roads are but the usual and customary\n\fHonorable George L.

Small towns as those\n     affected by Art. 973 are not so likely to be\n     as highly improved and hence are the subject of\n     different legislative treatment in this respect.\n          \"In our opinion there is a legitimate\n     relationship between the size of a city and the\n     privilege of detaching a portion of its terri-\n     tory and that Art. 1266, based upon such relation-\n     ship, is a valid statute. Whether it is wise or\n     unwise is exclusively a legislative matter.\n          \"We have no hesitancy in saying, however,\n     that a city dweller who becomes accustomed to\n     city services and privileges such as water,\n     sewer, garbage, schools and fire and police\n     protection or who has improved his property\n     in reliance upon city zoning laws is entitled\n     to reasonable safeguards against the overnight\n     destruction of these advantages and that the\n     enforcement of Art. 1266 will have this wholesome\n     effect.\"\n     We are of the opinion that H.B. No. 738 is violative of\nSection 56 of Article III of the Constitution of Texas because\nthe classification of the bill has no proper relation to the\npurpose of the Statute. While there may well be, as announced\nin the City of San Antonio case, supra, \"a legitimate relation-\nship between the size of a city and the privilege of detaching\na portion of its territory,\" we believe that the legitimacy is\nattributable to the fact that the legislation there reviewed\nhad as its purpose the granting of permission to cities the\npower to make reasonable, orderly alterations of its boundaries\nby the exclusion of property not necessary for, nor benefited\nby, inclusion within the corporate limits.\n     But the avowed purpose of H.B. No. 738 is \"the importance\nof fostering commerce and industry along the navigable streams\nof this State, . . .' and we can perceive of no distinguishing\ncharacteristics between cities of the population expressed in\nthe bill and those of lesser population, where both have\nnavigable streams within their limits, that would impart legiti-\nmacy to the classification.

We quote from the court's opinion:\n          0 . . . In this case there has been no\n     reason assigned, nor is it apparent, why all\n     cities should not have the power to lease their\n     wharves as well as cities of the third class.\n     Population cannot have any just reference to\n     this distinction between these classes by which\n     the one is separated from the others. There is\n     no natural connection between the number of people\n      ina city and its right to lease its wharves. The\n     classification made by a statute is justified or\n     not, by considering whether the statute is thereby\n     rendered general :r special, not whether it is wise\n     or unwise.           Cf. Christoph v. Chilton, 205\n     WIS. 418, 23-ii.i. 134 (1931).\n     In view of the above authorities, H.B. No. 738 is unconsti-\ntutional as local and special legislation.\n     In our opinion, there is also a serious question as to\nwhether H.B. No. 738 is violative of the due process section\nof the Constitution of Texas, to the extent that it would\nallow summary diaannexation of improved property lying within\ntwenty-five hundred feet from the thread of any navigable\nstream.\n     In H.B. No. 738 no standard is provided, other than that\nthe property lie within twenty-five hundred feet of a navigable\nstream; nor is there opportunity for notice, hearing or remon-\nstrance by the owners of the property affected. The proposed\namendment would afford no reasonable safeguard against the\novernight destruction of those advantages accruing to a city\ndweller who has become accustomed to city services and privileges\nsuch as water, sewer, grabage, schools and fire and police\n\f                                               .   ,\n\n\n\n\nHonorable George L.
