MARTIN,\nJ. (pp. 10-19), delivered a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n                                       _________________\n                                           OPINION\n                                       _________________\n        ROGERS, Circuit Judge. In this case we are required to decide the constitutionality of\nTennessee’s statute making available the purchase of automobile license plates with a “Choose\nLife” inscription, but not making available the purchase of automobile license plates with a\n“pro-choice” or pro-abortion rights message. See TENN. CODE ANN. § 55-4-306. Although this\nexercise of government one-sidedness with respect to a very contentious political issue may be\nill-advised, we are unable to conclude that the Tennessee statute contravenes the First Amendment.\nGovernment can express public policy views by enlisting private volunteers to disseminate its\nmessage, and there is no principle under which the First Amendment can be read to prohibit\ngovernment from doing so because the views are particularly controversial or politically divisive.\nWe accordingly reverse the judgment of the district court invalidating the statute on First\nAmendment grounds.\n                                                  I.\n        Tennessee statutory law authorizes the sale of premium-priced license plates bearing special\nlogotypes to raise revenue for specific “departments, agencies, charities, programs and other\nactivities impacting Tennessee.” TENN. CODE ANN. § 55-4-201(j). The statute authorizing issuance\nof these license plates earmarks half of their respective profits for named non-profit groups\ncommitted to advancing the causes publicized on the plates. Id. § 55-4-215 to -217.\n       The State of Tennessee takes the other half of the profits. See id. § 55-4-215(a)(2)-(3). Forty\npercent (of the total profits) goes to the Tennessee arts commission, while the remaining 10 percent\ngoes to the state’s highway fund. Id. Tennessee will not issue a new specialty license plate until\ncustomers place at least one thousand advance orders. See id. § 55-4-201(h)(1).\n        The Tennessee legislature has determined the price of specialty plates by statute. In general,\nthey cost the same as a non-specialty plate plus a $35.00 fee (if the government issues the plate on\nor after September 1, 2002, as in this case). See id. § 55-4-203(d).\n        In 2003, the Tennessee legislature passed a law (hereinafter “the Act”) authorizing issuance\nof a specialty license plate with a “Choose Life” logotype “designed in consultation with a\nrepresentative of New Life Resources.” See id. § 55-4-306(b). Half of the profits go to New Life\nResources, Inc. (New Life). See id. § 55-4-306(c)-(d). New Life’s half “shall be used exclusively\nfor counseling and financial assistance, including food, clothing, and medical assistance for pregnant\nwomen in Tennessee.” Id. § 55-4-306(c). The Act strictly regulates the precise activities that these\nprofits shall fund. See id. § 55-4-306(d). It also provides a comprehensive list of dozens of groups\nthat must share in a portion of these profits. See id. It is undisputed that during legislative\nconsideration of the Act, Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee “lobbied for an\namendment authorizing a ‘Pro-Choice’ specialty license plate . . . , but the measure was defeated.”\nJA 231.\n\fNo. 04-6393                Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                         Page 3\n\n\n         The plaintiffs in this action, the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee and others,\nfiled a civil action in federal district court challenging the Act as facially unconstitutional, naming\nthe Governor of Tennessee as defendant. New Life intervened as a defendant. The district court\ngranted summary judgment to the plaintiffs, enjoining enforcement of the Act. The district court\nheld that the authorization of the “Choose Life” license plate was not purely government speech.\nRelying largely upon Fourth Circuit precedent, the district court held that “both the State and the\nindividual vehicle owner are speaking”—a “mixture” of government and private speech. JA 33-34\n(citing Planned Parenthood of S.C., Inc. v. Rose, 361 F.3d 786, 793-94 (4th Cir. 2004); Sons of\nConfederate Veterans, Inc. v. Comm’r of the Va. Dep’t of Motor Vehicles, 288 F.3d 610, 615 (4th\nCir. 2002)). Reasoning that providing for such “mixed” speech is not constitutional if doing so is\ndiscriminatory as to viewpoint, the district court found that the statute was clearly discriminatory\nas to viewpoint and enjoined enforcement of the Act. The district court expressly refrained,\nhowever, from reaching the question of whether the entire specialty license plate program was\nunconstitutional.\n        New Life appeals. Although the Tennessee state defendants have not appealed, they have\nfiled a brief urging this court not to strike down Tennessee’s specialty license plate scheme in its\nentirety.\n                                                           II.\n        First, the district court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction in this case by the Tax\nInjunction Act (TIA), 28 U.S.C. § 1341, as argued by New Life. New Life claims that the extra cost\nfor a “Choose Life” specialty license plate constitutes a tax that may not, under the TIA, be enjoined\nby a federal district court if a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in Tennessee courts.\n Even making the somewhat artificial assumption that it is really the payments that are being\nchallenged in this case,1 the payments are most closely analogous to payments for simple purchases\nfrom the government. Ordinary purchase payments are not taxes under the TIA, and neither is the\nextra payment for a specialty license plate. It follows that the TIA did not deprive the district court\nof subject matter jurisdiction in this case.\n      This conclusion is supported by the longstanding distinction drawn in various legal contexts\nbetween taxes and ordinary debts. The Supreme Court for instance explained in New Jersey v.\nAnderson, 203 U.S. 483, 492 (1906):\n         Generally speaking, a tax is a pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property for\n         the purpose of supporting the Government. We think this exaction is of that\n         character. It is required to be paid by the corporation after organization in invitum.[2]\n         The amount is fixed by the statute, to be paid on the outstanding capital stock of the\n         corporation each year, and capable of being enforced by action against the will of the\n         taxpayer. As was said by Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court in Meriwether v.\n         Garrett, 102 U.S. 472, 513:\n\n         1\n            Compare Hibbs v. Winn, 542 U.S. 88 (2004). In Hibbs, the Supreme Court held that the TIA did not bar an\nEstablishment Clause challenge to a state income-tax credit for payments to certain organizations that give tuition grants\nto students attending religious schools. The Court explained that “in enacting the TIA, Congress trained its attention\non taxpayers who sought to avoid paying their tax bill by pursuing a challenge route other than the one specified by the\ntaxing authority.” Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 104-05. The Court also noted that cases applying the TIA generally “involved\nplaintiffs who mounted federal litigation to avoid paying state taxes (or to gain a refund of such taxes).” Id. at 106.\nPlaintiffs in this case are of course not seeking to avoid paying for a “Choose Life” license plate, and it is therefore at\nleast questionable whether the TIA would apply even if the payment for the license plates were a “tax.” We need not\nreach the issue, however, because of our determination that no tax is involved here.\n         2\n             “In invitum” means “[a]gainst an unwilling person.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 787 (7th ed. 1999).\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.            Page 4\n\n\n               “Taxes are not debts. . . . Debts are obligations for the payment of\n               money founded upon contract, express or implied. Taxes are imposts\n               levied for the support of the Government, or for some special purpose\n               authorized by it. The consent of the taxpayer is not necessary to their\n               enforcement. They operate in invitum. Nor is their nature affected by\n               the fact that in some States—and we believe in Tennessee—an action\n               of debt may be instituted for their recovery. The form of procedure\n               cannot change their character.”\nSee also Fla. Cent. & Peninsular R.R. Co. v. Reynolds, 183 U.S. 471, 475 (1902) (“tax” defined as\n“enforced” contribution and distinguished from ordinary contractual debt); Patton v. Brady, 184\nU.S. 608, 619 (1902) (same); Alaska Consol. Canneries v. Territory of Alaska, 16 F.2d 256, 257 (9th\nCir. 1926) (same).\n        The Fifth Circuit has relied upon the definition of tax in Anderson to hold that a challenge\nto the collection of lease rent payments was not subject to the Tax Injunction Act. The Fifth Circuit\nexplained,\n       The State contends that the leases are in fact taxes, and thus the federal courts are\n       barred by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, from entertaining a challenge\n       to the State’s actions to collect on the leases. This contention is without merit. The\n       lease obligations are a creature of contract, not a mandatory obligation imposed by\n       the state as taxes are.\nLipscomb v. Columbus Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., 269 F.3d 494, 500 n.13 (5th Cir. 2001). The\nanalysis would apply a fortiori to ordinary purchases, like the purchase of government bonds, or the\npurchase of a souvenir at a state park gift store. Such purchase payments can hardly be termed\n“taxes” as opposed to ordinary payments on voluntary contracts. This conclusion follows,\nmoreover, regardless of what the government does with the sales income.\n        In this case, Tennessee’s sale of specialty plates creates contractual debts to pay but imposes\nno tax. Instead of using its sovereign power to coerce sales, Tennessee induces willing purchases\nas would any ordinary market participant. The government confers all the same driving privileges\non people who forgo specialty plates to buy standard-issue plates. Drivers’ only motive for buying\nsuch plates, therefore, must rest with the attractiveness of the “Choose Life” message as Tennessee\nhas marketed it, not a desire to obey Tennessee’s will. Under Anderson and Lipscomb, these sales\nconstitute regular contractual payments, not taxes.\n        We recognize that there is some case law to the effect that cases like this one are precluded\nby the Tax Injunction Act. See Henderson v. Stalder, 407 F.3d 351, 354-60 (5th Cir. 2005); NARAL\nPro-Choice Ohio v. Taft, No. 1:05 CV 1064, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 21394, at *16-*26 (N.D. Ohio\nSept. 27, 2005). These cases proceed on the questionable assumption that the applicable test is the\none for differentiating between a regulatory fee and a tax. See generally Hedgepeth v. Tenn., 215\nF.3d 608 (6th Cir. 2000). This test was created to answer a different question: whether a regulatory\nfee, often directed to a segregated fund for a special use related to the basis for imposing the fee, is\nor is not a tax for TIA purposes. See generally San Juan Cellular Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n\nof P.R., 967 F.2d 683 (1st Cir. 1992). The classic non-tax regulatory fee\n       is imposed by an agency upon those subject to its regulation. It may serve regulatory\n       purposes directly by, for example, deliberately discouraging particular conduct by\n       making it more expensive. Or, it may serve such purposes indirectly by, for\n       example, raising money placed in a special fund to help defray the agency's\n       regulation-related expenses.\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.            Page 5\n\n\nId. at 685 (citations omitted) (Breyer, J.). In contrast, a purchase price cannot be said to be\n“imposed by an agency upon those subject to its regulation.” Instead it is merely a contract price.\nThe test for determining which compelled exactions are taxes and which are fees cannot logically\nbe used to determine whether a payment is a compelled exaction in the first place. Under the\nSupreme Court’s basic definition of a tax, logically applied in Lipscomb, the TIA does not preclude\nfederal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims in this case.\n          Eight judges of the Fifth Circuit accordingly dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc\nin Henderson. 434 F.3d 352 (5th Cir. 2005) (Davis, J. dissenting). In an opinion with which we are\nin substantial agreement, the dissent acknowledged the accepted test for distinguishing between a\nregulatory fee and a tax, but explained that “this does not mean that the extra charge for a specialty\nplate must be one or the other.” Id. at 355. It does not follow, in other words, that if “the charge is\nnot a regulatory fee . . . it must be a tax.” Id. Relying in part on the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning in\nBidart Brothers v. Calif. Apple Comm’n, 73 F.3d 925 (9th Cir. 1996), the Fifth Circuit dissent\nreasoned that, “the relevant question is whether this charge is a tax and if the answer to this question\nis no, the TIA does not apply regardless of whether the charge is characterized as a regulatory fee,\na charitable donation or something else.” Henderson, 434 F.3d at 355. Thus even though the Fifth\nCircuit dissent found the charge for the Louisiana “Choose Life” plate not to be a regulatory fee, the\ncharge was not a tax either, in part because “the charge is not ‘imposed’ by the legislature; because\nit is entirely optional and voluntary on the part of Louisiana citizens electing to pay the extra charge\nfor a specialty plate.” Id. at 356.\n                                                  III.\n        On the merits we are faced with a purely legal issue: whether a government-crafted message\ndisseminated by private volunteers creates a “forum” for speech that must be viewpoint neutral. No\nsuch requirement applies, at least with respect to state-produced specialty license plates like those\nat issue in this case.\n       A.       The “Choose Life” Specialty License Plate Bears a Government-Crafted Message\n        “Choose Life,” as it is to appear on the face of Tennessee specialty license plates, is a\ngovernment-crafted message. See Johanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass’n, 125 S. Ct. 2055 (2005).\nJohanns stands for the proposition that when the government determines an overarching message\nand retains power to approve every word disseminated at its behest, the message must be attributed\nto the government for First Amendment purposes. See id. at 2062-66. In this case, Johanns\nrequires the court to conclude that “Choose Life” is Tennessee’s message because the Act\ndetermines the overarching message and Tennessee approves every word on such plates.\n        In Johanns, the Supreme Court held that federal government promotional campaigns to\nencourage beef consumption constituted government speech because the “message of the\npromotional campaigns is effectively controlled by the Federal Government itself.” Id. at 2062. In\nthese campaigns, however, the federal government did not explicitly credit itself as the speaker. See\nid. at 2059 (messages bore the attribution, “Funded by America’s Beef Producers”).\n        More specifically, the “message set out in the beef promotions” counted as government\nspeech because “from beginning to end [it is] the message established by the Federal Government.”\nId. at 2062. Congress “directed the implementation of a coordinated program of promotion” that\nincludes paid advertising to advance the “image and desirability of beef and beef products.” Id. at\n2062-63 (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress and the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture\nenunciated “the overarching message and some of its elements,” while leaving the “remaining\ndetails to an entity whose members are answerable to the Secretary.” Id. at 2063. Also, the\n“Secretary exercises final approval authority over every word used in every promotional campaign.”\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.             Page 6\n\n\nId. The Supreme Court concluded that when “the government sets the overall message to be\ncommunicated and approves every word that is disseminated,” it is government speech. Id.\n        Johanns supports classifying “Choose Life” on specialty license plates as the State’s own\nmessage. The Tennessee legislature chose the “Choose Life” plate’s overarching message and\napproved every word to be disseminated. Tennessee set the overall message and the specific\nmessage when it spelled out in the statute that these plates would bear the words “Choose Life.”\nTENN. CODE ANN. § 55-4-306. Tennessee, like the Secretary of Agriculture in Johanns, leaves some\nof the “remaining details to an entity whose members are answerable” to the State government.\nTennessee delegates partial responsibility for the design of the plate to New Life, but retains a veto\nover its design. See id. § 55-4-306(b). The “Choose Life” plate must be issued in a design\nconfiguration distinctive to its category and determined by the commissioner. Id. § 55-4-202(b)(2).\nThus, Tennessee’s statutory law, and its power to withdraw authorization for any license plate, gives\nthe State the right to wield “final approval authority over every word used” on the “Choose Life”\nplate. As in Johanns, here Tennessee “sets the overall message to be communicated and approves\nevery word that is disseminated” on the “Choose Life” plate. It is Tennessee’s own message.\n        Plaintiffs argue that “Choose Life” on specialty plates should be treated not as Tennessee’s\nown message but as “mixed” speech subject to a viewpoint-neutrality requirement. Plaintiffs point\nto the following undisputed facts to support their view: (1) Tennessee produces over one hundred\nspecialty plates in support of diverse groups, ideologies, activities, and colleges; (2) a private anti-\nabortion group, New Life, collaborates with the State to produce the “Choose Life” plate; and (3)\nvehicles are associated with their owners, creating the impression that a “Choose Life” license plate\nattached to a vehicle represents the vehicle owner’s viewpoint. These facts are however consistent\nwith the determination that “Choose Life” on a Tennessee specialty plate is a government-crafted\nmessage.\n         First, there is nothing implausible about the notion that Tennessee would use its license plate\nprogram to convey messages regarding over one hundred groups, ideologies, activities, and colleges.\nGovernment in this age is large and involved in practically every aspect of life. At least where\nTennessee does not blatantly contradict itself in the messages it sends by approving such plates,\nthere is no reason to doubt that a group’s ability to secure a specialty plate amounts to state approval.\nIt is noteworthy that Tennessee has produced plates for respectable institutions such as Penn State\nUniversity but has issued no plates for groups of wide disrepute such as the Ku Klux Klan or the\nAmerican Nazi Party. Plaintiffs’ position implies that Tennessee must provide specialty plates for\nthese hate groups in order for it constitutionally to provide specialty plates supporting any\ninstitution. Such an argument falls of its own weight.\n        Second, as Johanns makes clear, the participation of New Life in designing the “Choose\nLife” logotype has little or no relevance to whether a plate expresses a government message. See\n125 S. Ct. at 2062-63. In Johanns the Supreme Court upheld the beef marketing scheme as\ngovernment speech even though the development of details was left to an entity “answerable” to the\nSecretary of Agriculture. Id. So long as Tennessee sets the overall message and approves its details,\nthe message must be attributed to Tennessee for First Amendment purposes. See id.\n        Third, Johanns also says that a government-crafted message is government speech even if\nthe government does not explicitly credit itself as the speaker. Many of the promotional messages\nin Johanns bore the attribution “Funded by America’s Beef Producers.” Id. at 2059. The Supreme\nCourt explained that the tagline, “standing alone, is not sufficiently specific to convince a reasonable\nfactfinder that any particular beef producer, or all beef producers, would be tarred with the content\nof each trademarked ad.” Id. at 2065-66. This was true even though the message was presumably\nconveyed in private media containing mostly privately-sponsored advertising. In contrast, the\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.           Page 7\n\n\nmedium in this case, a government-issued license plate that every reasonable person knows to be\ngovernment-issued, a fortiori conveys a government message.\n       B.      Dissemination of a Government-Crafted Message by Private Volunteers Does Not\n               Create a “Forum” for Speech Requiring Viewpoint Neutrality\n         Plaintiffs’ most intuitively inviting argument—that the government must be viewpoint\nneutral when it relies on like-minded volunteers to disseminate its message—cannot in the end\ninvalidate the Act. Plaintiffs point to the following facts to support this aspect of their argument:\n(a) the government must receive one thousand advance customer orders for the “Choose Life” plate\nor Tennessee will not manufacture it; (b) the “Choose Life” message is communicated by private\ncitizens’ affirmatively purchasing the plates and attaching them to their privately-owned vehicles;\n(c) the Tennessee government devotes no funds to disseminating the “Choose Life” message, but\nrather raises money by selling these plates to customers who wish to have “Choose Life” plates on\ntheir cars. While it is true that such voluntary dissemination itself qualifies as expressive conduct,\nthe government’s reliance on private volunteers to express its policies does not create a “forum” for\nspeech requiring viewpoint neutrality.\n         This conclusion is supported by negative inference from the one Supreme Court case dealing\nwith license plate speech. In Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977), New Hampshire embossed\nits state motto, “Live Free or Die,” on standard-issue license plates in the same way that Tennessee\nwould stamp “Choose Life” on specialty plates. See id. at 707. The Wooley Court characterized\n“Live Free or Die” as “the State’s ideological message,” id. at 715, and the State’s “official view,”\nid. at 717. The Supreme Court held that New Hampshire could not constitutionally prosecute\nvehicle owners for covering up the motto on their license plates, because by doing so the State\nwould be unconstitutionally forcing automobile owners to adhere to an ideological point of view\nthey disagreed with. Nowhere did the Court suggest that the State’s message could not be so\ndisseminated by those who did not object to the State’s motto, or even hint that the State could not\nput the message on state-issued license plates. “Choose Life” is Tennessee’s public message, just\nas “Live Free or Die” communicated New Hampshire’s individualist values and state pride. The evil\nin Wooley was that the automobile owners were compelled to disseminate the message; here\nautomobile owners are not only not compelled, they have to pay extra to disseminate the message.\n        In general, the government does not create a “forum” for expression when it seeks to have\nprivate entities disseminate its message. In Johanns, for instance, the federal government paid for\nthe “Beef. It’s What’s for Dinner” message and other promotional messages. 125 S.Ct. at 2059.\nAlthough these involved “print and television messages,” id. at 2059, presumably published or\nbroadcasted by hired private entities, the Court classified this and the rest of the beef promotions as\ngovernment speech for First Amendment purposes. See id. at 2058, 2062-66. Likewise, in Rust v.\nSullivan, the federal government allocated Title X funds to doctors for family planning counseling\nbut forbade such doctors from discussing abortion with the program’s patients. 500 U.S. 173, 178-\n83 (1991). In Rust, the Court recognized that when “the government disburses public funds to\nprivate entities to convey a governmental message, it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to\nensure that its message is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee.” Rosenberger v. Rector &\nVisitors of the Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 833 (1995) (interpreting Rust). If in this case Tennessee\ndrivers were paid by the government to display “Choose Life” plates, the Act would unquestionably\nbe constitutional.\n        In this case, however, the carriers of Tennessee’s message are unpaid. They are volunteers.\nRather then receiving government money, they pay out of their own pockets for the privilege of\nputting the government-crafted message on their private property. Plaintiffs argue that this fact\ndemonstrates that “Choose Life” is not purely the government’s message but also the speech of the\ncustomers who purchase and display these plates—thus creating a “forum” for speech. While it is\n\fNo. 04-6393                Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                    Page 8\n\n\ntrue that volunteers’ display of “Choose Life” plates expresses agreement with Tennessee, that fact\ndoes not mean that a First Amendment “forum” for speech has been created.\n        The doctors in Rust disagreed with the government’s anti-abortion policy. But if they had\nbeen true believers in the policy and had volunteered to work in the program free of charge, the\nspeech restrictions in Rust would still have expressed the government’s anti-abortion\nviewpoint—and therefore qualified for government speech treatment. Similarly, the publications\nand television stations in Johanns that published or broadcasted beef advertisements would have\nconveyed a government-crafted message even if they had done so for free. There is nothing in the\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Rust or Johanns that implies that the government has less right to\ncontrol expressions of its policies when it relies on unpaid private people. No constitutionally\nsignificant distinction exists between volunteer disseminators and paid disseminators.\n        Plaintiffs’ view that volunteer dissemination of a government-crafted message creates a\n“forum,” if accepted, would force the government to produce messages that fight against its policies,\nor render unconstitutional a large swath of government actions that nearly everyone would consider\ndesirable and legitimate. Government can certainly speak out on public issues supported by a broad\nconsensus, even though individuals have a First Amendment right not to express agreement. For\ninstance, government can distribute pins  that say “Register and Vote,” issue postage stamps during\nWorld War II that say “Win the War,”3 and sell license plates that say “Spay or Neuter your Pets.”4\nCitizens clearly have the First Amendment right to oppose such widely-accepted views, but that\nright cannot conceivably require the government to distribute “Don’t Vote” pins, to issue postage\nstamps in 1942 that say “Stop the War,” or to sell license plates that say “Spaying or Neutering your\nPet is Cruel.”\n       We cannot affirm the district court in this case without either (1) effectively invalidating all\nsuch hitherto-accepted forms of privately disseminated government speech, or (2) distinguishing\nthese examples from the “Choose Life” specialty license plates.\n        Neither the district court nor the plaintiffs on appeal attempt to articulate a basis for\ndistinguishing these examples. Government-printed pamphlets or pins saying “Register and Vote”\nor “Buy U.S. Bonds” are clearly government-crafted messages distributed by private individuals\nwho have a First Amendment right not to disseminate them if they don’t want to. Postage stamps\nsaying “Win the War” or “Support Our Troops” are clearly government-crafted messages\ndisseminated by private individuals who, under Wooley, also presumably have a First Amendment\nnot to buy or use them if they don’t want to. And license plates saying for instance “Spay or Neuter\nyour Pets” are even more obviously indistinguishable from the license plates at issue in this case.\nIndeed, the State of Tennessee in this appeal, not advocating reversal of the district court’s\ninjunction but urging us not to invalidate the entire specialty license plate program, offers no tenable\nbasis for drawing a distinction between the dozens of government messages available on Tennessee\nplates and the “Choose Life” message.\n\n\n         3\n           See Scott Catalogue No. 905 (1942). The example is hardly unusual, as United States postage stamps have\ncarried a variety of government-crafted advocacy messages over the years. Examples include “Give Me Liberty or Give\nMe Death” (Scott No. 1144 (1961)), “Register and Vote” (Scott No. 1394 (1968)), “Giving Blood Saves Lives” (Scott\nNo. 1425 (1971)), “Organ and Tissue Donation: Share Your Life . . .” (Scott No. 3227 (1998)), and “Breast Cancer, Fund\nthe Fight, Find a Cure” (Scott No. B1 (1998)). See also Scott No. 1129 (“World Peace Through World Trade”), No.\n1142 (“And this be our Motto, in God is our Trust”), No. 1320 (“We appreciate our Servicemen”), No. 1343 (“Law and\nOrder”), No. 1438 (“Prevent Drug Abuse”), No. 1455 (“Family Planning”), No. 1802 (“Honoring Vietnam Veterans”),\nNo. 1831 (“Organized Labor Proud and Free”), No. 1927 (“Alcoholism You Can Beat It!”), No. 2102 (“Take a Bite out\nof Crime”).\n         4\n             See KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 186.162(2)(y) (2005).\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.           Page 9\n\n\n        Of course the unstated distinction is that the “Choose Life” message is highly controversial.\nWith respect to the “Choose Life” message, much more than in the above examples, there are large\nnumbers of participants in the public discourse with an opposing view. Such a distinction, however,\nis entirely indefensible as a matter of First Amendment law, however much it might properly\nmotivate the Tennessee legislature as a matter of policy. Such a distinction would fly in the face of\nthe fundamental free speech principle that views expressed by substantial numbers are treated no\ndifferently by the First Amendment than extreme or way-out-of-the-mainstream views. Government\nspeech disseminated by private volunteers, in other words, cannot have its constitutionality under\nthe First Amendment depend on the small number of objectors to the government’s message, or the\nextreme nature of their views.\n        In the absence of a tenable distinction, invalidating the Act in this case would effectively\ninvalidate not only all those government specialty license plate provisions that involve a message\nthat anyone might disagree with, but also effectively invalidate all manner of other long-accepted\npractices in the form of government-crafted messages disseminated by private volunteers. We are\nnot provided with a sound legal basis for making such a leap.\n        We recognize that the Fourth Circuit has invalidated a nearly identical specialty license plate\nlaw in South Carolina. See Planned Parenthood of S.C., Inc., v. Rose, 361 F.3d 786 (4th Cir. 2004).\nIn Rose Judge Michael enunciated a rationale that neither of the other two panel judges joined,\nalthough both concurred in the judgment. See id. at 800 (Luttig, J., concurring in the judgment); id.\nat 801 (Gregory, J., concurring in the judgment). The reasoning of the Fourth Circuit judges is not\npersuasive, primarily for two reasons.\n        First, the Fourth Circuit opinions in Rose are in tension with the intervening case of Johanns.\nJohanns sets forth an authoritative test for determining when speech may be attributed to the\ngovernment for First Amendment purposes. Rose relied instead on a pre-Johanns four-factor test\nof the Fourth Circuit’s own devising that led to an “indeterminate result” on the crucial issue of\nwhether “Choose Life” specialty plates express a government message. Id. at 793. The Johanns\nstandard, by contrast, classifies the “Choose Life” message as government speech.\n       Second, none of the separate Fourth Circuit opinions explains how that court would treat\nsuch unexceptional examples of government-provided, privately disseminated speech as those\ndescribed above. Without an articulated basis for distinguishing such examples, following the\nFourth Circuit’s lead in this case would invalidate wide swaths of previously accepted exercises of\ngovernment speech. With no Supreme Court case requiring us to take such a step, we decline to do\nso.\n                                                 IV.\n     For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s order enjoining enforcement of the Act is\nREVERSED and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNo. 04-6393                Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.

MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur\nin the Court’s holding that the district court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction in this\ncase by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341. With respect to the merits of the case, I would\nhold that Tennessee has unconstitutionally discriminated on the basis 1of viewpoint and would affirm\nthe district court’s decision enjoining the Choose Life license plate.\n         I believe that there are two major flaws with the majority’s analysis in this case. First, the\nmajority fails to properly characterize the specialty license plate program. It seems apparent to me\nthat the state created the specialty license plate program to facilitate private speech (notwithstanding\nthe government speech aspects inherent in the issuance of a license plate), and not to promote a\ngovernmental message. This fact, even conceding that there must necessarily be some governmental2\nspeech involved in the issuance of license plates, requires that the government be viewpoint neutral.\nSecond, the majority errs by applying First Amendment compelled speech/subsidy doctrine to a case\nwhere, as the majority admits with respect to its analysis of the Tax Injunction Act, nothing is\ncompelled. Because we are not dealing with compelled speech or compelled subsidies, I do not\nbelieve that the so-called government speech inquiry is wholly determinative of whether the First\nAmendment has been violated. Although the government may generally speak and control its own\nmessage, it may not suppress contrary messages because        of their viewpoint in a forum designed to\nencourage a diversity of views from private speakers.3\n\n\n\n\n         1\n           Perhaps of some interest, when this opinion is filed, at least three circuits (4th, 5th, and 6th) will have spoken\non the issue, reaching at least three different conclusions, via at least sixteen separate opinions. Additionally, on March\n6, 2006, in a non-precedential opinion, the Second Circuit addressed a near identical lawsuit — albeit in a different\nprocedural posture — with the parties in reversed positions. See Children First Foundation, Inc. v. Martinez, 2006 WL\n544502 (2d Cir. March 6, 2006) (unpublished). The Children First Foundation sued the state of New York when it\ndenied the foundation’s application for a Choose Life license plate. According to the foundation, the state committed\nunconstitutional viewpoint discrimination when it denied the application “based on their disagreement with [the] life-\naffirming viewpoint expressed by the plate.” Id. at *1. The district court denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss based\non qualified immunity and the Second Circuit affirmed. The court noted that the state attempted to justify its decision\nbased on the “government speech doctrine,” but held that “custom license plates involve, at a minimum, some private\nspeech” and that “it would not have been reasonable for defendants to conclude this doctrine permitted viewpoint\ndiscrimination in this case.” Id.\n         2\n            See Planned Parenthood of South Carolina, Inc. v. Rose, 361 F.3d 786 (4th Cir. 2004). The Fourth Circuit\nhas held that specialty license plates embody a mixture of government speech and private speech. Id. at 793 (Opinion\nof Michael, J.) (“[T]he Choose Life plate embodies a mixture of private and government speech.”); id. at 800 (Luttig,\nJ., concurring in the judgment) (“[V]anity license plates are quintessential examples of such hybrid speech.”). I agree\nthat this is an adequate characterization of the nature of the specialty license plate. And, I agree that when faced with\nsuch a program, the government must remain viewpoint neutral. I find it more informative, however, to look beyond\nthe specific “Choose Life” plate at issue and examine the purpose of the entire license plate forum. I would not limit\nmy analysis to the inquiry — as the majority here does — of whether the Choose Life license plate alone is government\nor private speech. I believe that the majority errs in labeling the license plate as pure government speech and I also\nbelieve that it errs in not taking into account the nature of the license plate forum.\n         3\n            It also bears mentioning that the State of Tennessee is not even a party to this appeal. The state acquiesced\nin the district court’s decision and has appeared solely in response to the intervenors to request that we not strike down\nthe entire license plate program. The party advocating the Choose Life license plate is a private organization.\n\fNo. 04-6393               Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                       Page 11\n\n\n                                                           I.\n         A.       Tennessee’s speciality license plate program is a forum designed to encourage\n                  private speech, not a government program established to promote a governmental\n                  message.\n        The majority focuses on the Choose Life license plate without considering the license plate\nprogram as a whole and frames the question as “whether a government-crafted message\ndisseminated by private volunteers creates a ‘forum’ for speech that must be viewpoint neutral.”\nThis is itself a loaded question. First, it puts the cart before the horse by already deciding that the\nmessage is purely a governmental message. Second, by so phrasing, there is no doubt that the\nanswer is “no.” When the government crafts a message and disseminates it, the simple act of the\ngovernment speaking does not create a forum that invites competing          viewpoints. Although the\nmajority answers this question, it is not determinative of the case.4 Putting aside the question as to\nwhether specialty license plates represent “a government-crafted message” — and I do not believe\nthat they do — the proper question is not whether when the government speaks must it always allow\nothers to speak, but whether a forum exists in which speech is occurring, and if so, whether the\ngovernment may suppress a disfavored message based on its viewpoint.\n        Thus, I would start by determining the overall purpose of the speciality license plate\nprogram. When this is done, viewing the license plate program as a whole, and taking account of\nthe fact that the government engages in speech by providing the actual license plates, it becomes\nclear that the speciality license plate “program was designed to facilitate private speech, not to\npromote a governmental message.” Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 542 (2001);\nRosenberger v. Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 U.S. 819, 834 (1995). This conclusion, in\ncontrast to the majority’s, would require Tennessee’s license plate program to be viewpoint neutral.\n        Tennessee requires all motor vehicles to have a license plate. Motorists can choose from\nordinary license plates created by the Tennessee government or they can pay extra for personalized\nand specialty license plates. There are several standard Tennessee plates and there are\napproximately 150 specialty plates. As the majority notes, the specialty plates are created in\nconsultation with private organizations and half of the profits may be devoted to the private non-\nprofit organizations sponsoring the plates.\n        In my opinion, the fact that the state has permitted approximately 150 private organizations\nto create specialty license plates and the manner in which the state operates its license plate program\ndemonstrates that the forum was created to facilitate private speech. See Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at\n829-30 (analyzing forum); Good News Club v. Milford Cent. Sch. Dist., 533 U.S. 98 (2001)\n(applying forum analysis where private speech occurs on government property); Lamb’s Chapel v.\nCenter Moriches Union Free Sch. Dist., 508 U.S. 384, 390-91 (1993) (same); Sons of Confederate\n\n\n         4\n           Moreover, the manner in which the majority presents and answers the question is misleading — are we really\nto conclude that the Tennessee government has established a program to disseminate all of the individual messages on\nthe various license plates. That is, did the Tennessee government decide to establish a program promoting Penn State\nAlumni Pride and seek out private volunteers to transmit this message to the public at large? Did the Tennessee\ngovernment decide to establish a program promoting the University of Florida (the University of Tennessee’s arch-rival\nin football, see Gator Hater, http://www.gator-haters.com/Tennessee/index_TN.shtml (last visited March 10, 2006) (a\nwebsite run by University of Tennessee fans dedicated to their rivalry with the University of Florida, including news,\njokes, and recipes for cooking alligator meat)), and does the State seek out private volunteers to promote the University\nof Florida to its citizens? It is a nice academic exercise to hypothesize that the license plate program is a governmental\nprogram to disseminate through private volunteers all of the state’s various messages, but it seems to me to be a\nconclusion that only judges banished to our ivory towers and shut off from the real world could reach. See also Children\nFirst Foundation, 2006 WL 544502 (holding that no reasonable person would believe that the government speech\ndoctrine permits viewpoint discrimination in the specialty license plate context).\n\fNo. 04-6393               Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                        Page 12\n\n\nVeterans, Inc. v. Commissioner of the Va. Dep’t. of Motor Vehicles, 288 F.3d 610, 622 (4th Cir.\n2002) (noting that where private speech is at issue, restrictions must be viewpoint neutral regardless\nof type of forum); Planned Parenthood of South Carolina, Inc. v. Rose, 361 F.3d 7865(4th Cir. 2004)\n(same). The organizations with specialty license plates are numerous and diverse. The majority\nclaims, however, in concluding that all of the license plates are pure government speech, that “there\nis nothing implausible about the notion that Tennessee would use its license plate program to convey\nmessages regarding over one hundred groups, ideologies, activities,     and colleges.” There may be\nnothing implausible about the majority’s concept in the abstract;6 here, however, the evidence is\nclear that Tennessee wished to create a forum for private speakers. It cannot be ignored that the\nlicense plates represent a wide-array of viewpoints, some arguably conflicting, and many not\ngermane to any governmental interest. See Legal Services Corp., 531 U.S. at 543 (“And in\nRosenberger, the fact that student newspapers expressed many different points of view was an\nimportant foundation for the Court’s decision to invalidate viewpoint-based restrictions.”) (citing\nRosenberger, 515 U.S. at 836); Sons of Confederate Veterans, Inc. v. Commissioner of the Va.\nDep’t. of Motor Vehicles, 305 F.3d 241, 242-43 (4th Cir. 2002) (Williams, J., concurring in the\ndenial of rehearing en banc) (“In essence, the Commonwealth has opened its license plates to myriad\nprivate speakers but wishes to restrict the message one of those speakers would express based on\nits disagreement with the viewpoint contained therein.”).\n        In addition to acknowledging the viewpoints already expressed in the forum, it is helpful to\nlook at how Tennessee actually operates the forum in practice. First, the State’s own application for\na “personalized,” “specialty,” or “special” license plate advertises, “SHOW YOUR SCHOOL\nSPIRIT” (emphasis added) and “SUPPORT YOUR CAUSE AND COMMUNITY.” (emphasis\nadded). It does not say, “SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT’S MESSAGE.” Additionally, a June\n22, 2005 press release from the Governor’s office informs that the state “currently issues nearly 150\ndifferent license plates to reflect drivers’ special interests, 7such as schools, wildlife preservation,\nparks, the arts and children’s hospitals.” (emphasis added).\n\n         5\n          The plates include for “Clubs/Groups”: Alpha Kappa Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, Ducks\nUnlimited, Fraternal Order of Police, Int’l Assoc. of Firefighters, Kappa Alpha Psi, Mothers Against Drunk Driving,\nMasons, Omega Psi Phi, Phi Beta Sigma, Tennessee Police Benevolent Association, and Zeta Phi Beta.

Code Ann. § 55-4-202.\n         6\n          I wonder whether there is a number at which the majority would concede that private speech is at work.\nMaryland has approximately 500 different specialty license plates. Would that be enough to demonstrate that the state\nis encouraging private speech?\n         7\n          It is also curious that the government, if it wished to speak and promote a message, would first require at least\n1,000 individuals to pay the government before it agreed to disseminate the message. See also Sons of Confederate\nVeterans, 288 F.3d at 620 (“If the General Assembly intends to speak, it is curious that it requires the guaranteed\n\fNo. 04-6393               Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                        Page 13\n\n\n        I would contrast specialty plates with Tennessee’s own plates where it does intend to convey\na governmental message. For example, a new Tennessee plate issued in January 2006 was issued\nbecause “[Governor] Bredesen felt strongly [that the plate] should reflect the natural beauty of the\nstate.” Press Release, available at http://tennessee.gov/safety/newsreleases/newplate.htm (last\nvisited March 10, 2006). Bredesen stated that he wanted “this new plate to reflect the magnificence\nof our state, as well as to serve as a symbol of the pride Tennesseans feel to live on such a beautiful\nland.” That same press release notes that “[t]he Tennessee Department of Safety issues\napproximately 5.4 million passenger auto plates each year . . . . In addition, the state currently issues\nnearly 150 different license plates to reflect drivers’ special interests, such as schools, wildlife\npreservation, parks, the arts and children’s hospitals.” Id.\n        Although there may be nothing “implausible” about a government establishing a license plate\nprogram in order to promote purely governmental messages, I believe the majority ignores the\nreality of the situation here — Tennessee is not promoting its own messages, but rather has\n“expend[ed] funds [or provided governmental property in the form of the license plate itself] to\nencourage a diversity of views from private   speakers.” Legal Services Corp., 531 U.S. at 542\n(quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834).8 In this case, “[a] page of history is worth a volume of\nlogic.” N.Y. Trust Co. v. Eisner, 256 U.S. 345, 349 (1921) (Holmes, J.).\n         B.       The majority errs by applying the compelled speech/subsidy doctrine in a case where\n                  nothing is compelled.\n       Aside from having mischaracterized the purpose of the specialty license plate program, the\nmajority also applies the wrong First Amendment doctrine. For purposes of the Tax Injunction Act\ninquiry, the majority properly concludes that the payments for specialty license plates are voluntary\nand not compelled. Nevertheless, when it turns to the merits of the First Amendment inquiry, the\nmajority ironically treats this case as if it were a compelled speech or compelled subsidy case. I part\nways with the majority because it I do not agree that Johanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass’n, 125 S. Ct.\n2055 (2005) is controlling, and the majority relies almost exclusively on Johanns. The majority\napparently takes Johanns to mean that the sleeping doctrine of “government speech” has been\nawakened and now controls all First Amendment analysis. I disagree.\n        Johanns is a case that addresses compelled subsidies — that is, the government forced\nsomeone to give it money to pay for speech. In Johanns, the Supreme Court described the “two\ncategories of [compelled speech] cases.” Id. at 2060. The first category is true compelled speech\ncases — i.e., cases where “an individual is obliged personally to express a message he disagrees\nwith, imposed by the government.” Id. In this category, the Court has taken a strong stand and\ninvalidated “outright compulsion.” Id.; see West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624\n\n\ncollection of a designated amount of money from private persons before its ‘speech’ is triggered.”). In fact, in this case,\nTennessee does not expend any funds of its own. The entire license plate is funded by the private purchasers. All that\nTennessee provides is the medium — the actual metal license plate — for the groups to design and display their\nmessages. And in providing this medium, the government has created a means by which favored groups can promote\ntheir messages and raise funds, but the government has prevented a disfavored group from having the same access to\nthe forum. Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, however, adopting this approach does not mean that the state has to\nauthorize a plate for every individual or group that requests one. The state may adopt reasonable and viewpoint neutral\nregulations to administer the license plate program in a manner consistent with the program’s objectives.\n         8\n           Although I would not necessarily find the following points controlling, there is also additional support for my\nconclusion that the messages are not governmental in nature. Many of the messages are not germane to governance (for\nexample, the plates promoting antiques, numerous out-of-state universities, Ducks Unlimited, and various others). The\nFellowship of Christian Athletes may beg other First Amendment questions if it is promoted by the government. I would\nalso question whether Tennessee wishes to promote the Sons of Confederate Veterans plate, bearing the Confederate\nFlag as its design. I find it telling that in this appeal, the state did not claim to be “promoting” these messages.\n\fNo. 04-6393               Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                       Page 14\n\n\n(1943) (prohibiting state from requiring schoolchildren to recite the Pledge of Allegiance while\nsaluting the American flag, on pain of expulsion); Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705 (1977) (holding\nthat requiring the plaintiffs to bear the state’s motto, “Live Free or Die,” was impermissible\ncompulsion of expression). The second category of cases is compelled subsidy cases — that is,\ncases “in which an individual is required by the government to subsidize a message he disagrees\nwith.” Johanns, 125 S. Ct. at 2060. There are two subcategories to the compelled subsidy cases:\n(a) compelled subsidies to support a private entity’s political message, see Keller v. State Bar of\nCal., 496 U.S. 1 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Ed., 431 U.S. 209 (1977), and (b) compelled\nsubsidies to support the government’s message. It is in this subcategory — compelled subsidies to\nsupport the government’s message — that Johanns fits.9 Thus, in compelled subsidy cases, the\ndeterminative issue is whether the speech is the government’s (which is immune from First\nAmendment challenge) or a private entity’s speech, which is unconstitutional, see Keller, 491 U.S.\n1; Abood, 431 U.S. 209.\n        The reason is simple when one thinks of what the First Amendment harm is in each situation.\nWhen there is a compelled subsidy, the harm is being forced to give the government money to pay\nfor someone else’s message. When that message is another private message (despite tangential\ngovernment involvement), the First Amendment is violated. See Keller, 496 U.S. 1; Abood, 431\nU.S. 209; see also 5 The Founders’ Constitution, § 37, A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom,\np. 77 (1987), codified in 1786 at Va. Code Ann. § 57-1 (Lexis 2003) (where in 1779, Thomas\nJefferson wrote that “to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propogation of\nopinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical”). When the message is the government’s\nown, however, the harm is alleviated for First Amendment purposes. This is because, of course, the\ngovernment must be able to tax and spend in order to function. See Board of Regents of Univ. of\nWis. Sys. v. Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 229 (2000) (“The government, as a general rule, may support\nvalid programs and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on protesting parties. Within this\nbroader principle it seems inevitable that funds raised by the government will be spent for speech\nand other expression to advocate and defend its own policies.”); see also Keller, 496 U.S. at 12-13\n(“If every citizen were to have a right to insist that no one paid by public funds express a view with\nwhich he disagreed, debate over issues of great concern to the public would be limited to those in\nthe private sector, and the process of government as we know it radically transformed.”). The First\nAmendment harm in this case, however, has nothing to do with being forced to speak or to subsidize\na message. Rather, the harm is being denied the opportunity to speak on the same terms as other\nprivate citizens within a government sponsored forum. In this situation, whether the particular\nChoose Life message is the government’s      own or private speech, the First Amendment harm is not\nalleviated for the persons denied access.10 Thus, the government speech doctrine, a la Johanns, is\nnot the determinative question in this case. The specialty license plate issue at hand does not involve\ncompelled speech. It does not involve a compelled subsidy for a private entity. And, it does not\ninvolve a compelled subsidy to support a government message.\n       The majority here, however, extrapolates the so-called government speech doctrine from the\ncompelled subsidy context of Johanns, and applies it, apparently, without limit, in all First\nAmendment cases. I disagree with this approach. First, if the majority’s analysis applied to\nBarnette, Wooley, Keller, and Abood, the outcomes of all of those cases certainly could have been\n\n         9\n           See also United States v. United Foods, Inc., 533 U.S. 405, 411 (2001) (“First Amendment values are at\nserious risk if the government can compel a particular citizen, or a discrete group of citizens, to pay special subsidies\nfor speech on the side that it favors . . .”).\n         10\n            This is particularly why the question is not whether a hypothetically government-sponsored message itself\n“creates” a forum. When the majority answers “no” to the misleading question it poses, the proper First Amendment\nquestion is still not answered because there are another one-hundred fifty other private speakers in the broader license\nplate forum.\n\fNo. 04-6393                Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                          Page 15\n\n\ndifferent. The majority here found several facts relevant to its decision. First, the government\n“crafted” the message. The same could be said in the earlier cases. The Pledge of Allegiance is the\ngovernment’s message. New Hampshire’s government “crafted” its own motto. Based on the\nmajority’s broad interpretation of government involvement in speech, the fact that the government\ncompelled membership and dues payments in Keller and Abood, could be interpreted to fall within\nthe majority’s understanding of government speech. The government had ultimate control over all\nof these messages. In each of those cases, the facts the majority found relevant here would indicate\nthat the message was the government’s own. But, this was not the approach the Supreme Court\ntook, and I would not take it here either, because it ignores the First Amendment interests at issue.\n        The government speech doctrine, as it is used in Johanns, is more appropriately utilized in\nthe compelled subsidy context, where who is speaking is determinative, and if it is the government,\nconsistent with its broad taxing authority, that speech is immune from First Amendment challenge.\nJohanns, 125 S. Ct. at 2068 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Government argues here that the beef\nadvertising is its own speech, exempting it from the First Amendment bar against  extracting special\nsubsidies from those unwilling to underwrite an objectionable message.”).11 Thus, if the plaintiffs\nhere, who presumably disagree with the “Choose Life” message, were compelled to subsidize the\nproduction12and distribution of “Choose Life” license plates, then Johanns would be on all fours with\nthis case.     We face an entirely different situation, however, and therefore Johanns is not\ndeterminative.\n         C.        The “government speech” doctrine does not permit viewpoint discrimination when\n                   the government encourages a diversity of views from private speakers.\n        The Supreme Court’s precursor cases to Johanns, Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173 (1991) and\nLegal Services Corp., are instructive, as well as the Court’s viewpoint discrimination cases. The\nmajority briefly considers Rust, but misinterprets its holding and improperly applies it to this case.\nIn Rust, Congress established Title X of the Public Health Service Act, “which provides federal\nfunding for family planning services.” Id. at 178. The Act authorizes the Secretary of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services to “make grants to and enter into contracts with public\nor nonprofit private entities to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning\nprojects which shall offer a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and\nservices.” Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C § 300(a)). Thus, in Rust, Congress established a federal program\n\n\n\n         11\n             Justice Souter noted that while the government speech doctrine is in its early stages of development, two\npoints are clear: “The first point of certainty is the need to recognize the legitimacy of government’s power to speak\ndespite objections by dissenters whose taxes or other exactions necessarily go in some measure to putting the offensive\nmessage forward to be heard.” Id. at 2070 (Souter, J., dissenting); id. (discussing government’s need to avoid “heckler’s\nveto of any forced contribution”). “The second fixed point of government-speech doctrine is that the First Amendment\ninterest in avoiding forced subsidies is served, though not necessarily satisfied, by the political process as a check on\nwhat government chooses to say.” Id. at 2070-71 (Souter, J., dissenting); id. at 2071 (discussing “[t]he adequacy of the\ndemocratic process to render subsidization of government speech tolerable”). Johanns is very clearly about targeted\nassessments and forcing those who disagree with a particular message to fund it.\n         12\n            The majority is mistaken therefore, in reading Johanns as a watershed First Amendment case. It may be a\nwatershed compelled subsidy case, but it is not revolutionary and does not transform all First Amendment doctrine. The\nJohanns dissent is instructive on this point. The contention was not over whether the government can ever compel a\nsubsidy for its own message — it can — but over the concept of transparency. That is, when the government speaks,\nmust it identify itself clearly as the speaker? Id. at 2069 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“The error is not that government speech\ncan never justify compelling a subsidy, but that a compelled subsidy should not be justifiable by speech unless the\ngovernment must put that speech forward as its own.”); id. at 2072 (asserting that transparency requires knowing whether\n“Uncle Sam is the man talking behind the curtain”); id. at 2073 (“It means nothing that Government officials control the\nmessage if that fact is never required to be made apparent to those who get the message, let alone if it is affirmatively\nconcealed from them.”).\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.         Page 16\n\n\nwhich allowed the Secretary to provide grants to family planning projects that complied with the\nterms of the grants.\n        The Court rejected the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim stating that “[t]he Government can,\nwithout violating the Constitution, selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it\nbelieves to be in the public interest, without at the same time funding an alternative program which\nseeks to deal with the problem in another way.” Id. at 193; id. (noting that the government “has\nmerely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other”). Thus, restrictions imposed upon\nfederal grants, are permissible in certain circumstances when simply “designed to ensure that the\nlimits of the federal program are observed.” Id.; but see Legal Services Corp., 531 U.S. 533. The\nCourt characterized the case, not as one where the government seeks to suppress an idea, but rather\na “prohibition on a project grantee or its employees from engaging in activities outside of the\nproject’s scope.” Rust, 500 U.S. at 194. Thus, “when the Government appropriates public funds\nto establish a program it is entitled to define the limits of that program.” Id.\n        The Court focused on the fact that the program at issue involved a federal subsidy. Id. at 199\nn.5 (“First, Title X subsidies are just that, subsidies.”). Consequently, the complaining parties in\nRust could simply have declined to accept federal assistance. But, by voluntarily accepting federal\nmonies, “a recipient voluntarily consents to any restrictions placed on any matching funds or grant-\nrelated income.” Id.\n         Contrary to the majority’s insinuation here, the holding of Rust is not limitless and the\nSupreme Court itself explicitly stated as much. The Court stated that its holding was “not to suggest\nthat funding by the Government, even when coupled with the freedom of the fund recipients to speak\noutside the scope of the Government-funded project, is invariably sufficient to justify Government\ncontrol over the content of expression.” Id. at 199. Accordingly, the Court “has recognized that the\nexistence of a Government ‘subsidy,’ in the form of Government-owned property, does not justify\nthe restriction of speech in areas that have ‘been traditionally open to the public for expressive\nactivity.’” Id. at 199-200 (quoting United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 726 (1990) (additional\ncitations omitted)). It proves too much to suggest, as the majority does, that any government\ninvolvement in speech turns that speech into government speech immune from First Amendment\nrestrictions. Thus, Tennessee’s license plate program falls not within the broader holding of Rust,\nbut within the Court’s caveat that the government, despite some involvement and despite providing\na subsidy of sorts (here, providing the license plates for the messages), may not restrict speech in\nareas it has designed to facilitate private speech.\n         The Court later resolved a similar question in Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, 531 U.S.\n533 (2001), where it addressed the Legal Services Corporation Act. The Act established the Legal\nServices Corporation whose “mission is to distribute funds appropriated by Congress to eligible\nlocal grantee organizations ‘for the purpose of providing financial support for legal assistance in\nnoncriminal proceedings or matters to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance.’” Id.\nat 536 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2996b(a)). The grants provided contained a restriction that prohibited\n“legal representation funded by recipients of LSC moneys if the representation involves an effort\nto amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare law.” Id. at 536-37. The plaintiffs challenged the\nrestriction, arguing that it constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination in violation of the\nFirst Amendment. The United States relied upon Rust v. Sullivan.\n        The Court noted that in Rust, it “did not place explicit reliance on the rationale that the\ncounseling activities of the doctors under Title X amounted to governmental speech” but “when\ninterpreting the holding in later cases, however, [the Court] ha[s] explained Rust on this\nunderstanding.” Id. at 541. The Court acknowledged that viewpoint based funding decisions can\nbe sustained where “the government is itself the speaker” or, “like Rust” where the government\n“used private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its own program.” Id. (citations\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.           Page 17\n\n\nand quotations omitted). The majority here latches onto the idea that Tennessee is using private\nspeakers to disseminate its Choose Life message — that is, the license plate program is “like Rust.”\nAs I have discussed above, however, Rust included a caveat that the majority fails to acknowledge.\nBecause of that failure, the majority does not properly characterize the specialty license plate\nprogram, and it does not properly consider whether the specialty license plate forum has been\ntraditionally open to the public for expressive activity. Rust, 500 U.S. at 199-200.\n         As the Supreme Court held, contrary to the majority’s belief here, “[n]either the latitude for\ngovernment speech nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private speech in every instance,\nhowever. As we have pointed out, ‘[i]t does not follow . . . that viewpoint-based restrictions are\nproper when the [government] does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors\nbut instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.’” Id. at 542\n(quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834). Distinguishing Legal Services Corp. from Rust, the Court\nstated that “the salient point is that, like the program in Rosenberger, the LSC program was designed\nto facilitate private speech, not to promote a governmental message.” Id. So too, the salient point\nhere is that the license plate program was designed to facilitate private speech and to encourage a\ndiversity of viewpoints from private speakers, not to promote a governmental message. “The state\nwould argue that its viewpoint discrimination is permissible, because its license plates constitute\npure government speech. But the speech here only becomes speech by virtue of a citizen’s choice.”\nPlanned Parenthood of South Carolina v. Rose, 373 F.3d 580 (4th Cir. 2004) (Wilkinson, J.,\nconcurring in the denial of rehearing en banc); see also Women's Emergency Network v. Bush, 323\nF.3d 937, 945 n.9 (11th Cir. 2003) (“Furthermore, the program is structured to benefit the\norganizations that apply for and sponsor the plates, not the State itself. We fail to divine sufficient\ngovernment attachment to the messages on Florida specialty license plates to permit a determination\nthat the messages represent government speech.”). The majority dodges this point by looking at the\nlicense plate program as if the Choose Life license plate were the only plate in the entire state of\nTennessee. That way, the majority characterizes the Choose Life plate as an isolated instance of a\ngovernment message disseminated by private volunteers without considering the program as a\nwhole. If we think of each individual license plate in a vacuum, each one can be reasonably\ncharacterized as a government message. But, in order to properly characterize the specialty license\nplate program for First Amendment purposes, we cannot view each license plate in isolation. I\nsuggest that when opening one’s eyes to the license plate program as a whole, it is evident that the\ngovernment has created a program to encourage a diversity of views and messages from private\nspeakers.\n                                                  II.\n        With the preceding First Amendment doctrine issues in mind, I would hold that Tennessee\ncreated a forum to encourage a diversity of viewpoints from private speakers and therefore the\nConstitution requires viewpoint neutrality. In Rust, “the government did not create a program to\nencourage private speech but instead used private speakers to transmit specific information\npertaining to its own program.” Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 833 (describing Rust). This is not a Rust\ncase despite the majority framing it as such. See also Sons of Confederate Veterans, 305 F.3d at 246\n(Luttig, J., respecting the denial of rehearing en banc) (“When a special license plate is purchased,\nit is really the private citizen who engages the government to publish his message, not the\ngovernment who engages the private individual to publish its message, as in cases like Rust v.\nSullivan[] and Wooley v. Maynard, for example.”).\n         The specialty license plate program itself has been open and available to a wide-range of\nprivate speakers to promote their own messages. The government’s participation in the process by\nproviding the actual license plate “in the form of Government-owned property, does not justify the\nrestriction of speech in areas that have been traditionally open to the public for expressive activity.”\nLegal Services Corp., 533 U.S. at 199-200 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.           Page 18\n\n\nMoreover, the government speech rationale does not apply whenever the government somehow has\nits hands or its money involved. “It does not follow . . . that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper\nwhen the [government] does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but\ninstead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.” Id. at 542 (quoting\nRosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834); see also Sons of Confederate Veterans, 305 F.3d at 246 (Luttig, J.,\nrespecting the denial of rehearing en banc) (“No one, upon careful consideration, would contend\nthat, simply because the government owns and controls the forum, all speech that takes place in that\nforum is necessarily and exclusively government speech. Such would mean that even speech by\nprivate individuals in traditional public fora is government speech, which is obviously not the\ncase.”).\n         Finally, I also cannot subscribe to my colleagues’ melodramatic doomsday predictions about\nwhat would occur should we hold that the Constitution requires that Tennessee’s specialty license\nplate program be viewpoint neutral. The majority claims that viewpoint neutrality will require the\nstate to issue Ku Klux Klan and American Nazi Party specialty license plates. The simple answer\nin response to this suggestion is: Well of course that’s true if viewpoint neutrality means anything.\nThat is the same reason that Tennessee cannot prevent the KKK or Nazi Party from getting parade\nlicenses on the same terms as other groups and the same reason that Tennessee cannot prevent these\ngroups from espousing their views in the town squares.\n         Additionally, what my colleagues seem to miss, is the fact that Tennessee already authorizes\na Sons of Confederate Veterans license plate bearing the emblem of the Confederate Flag. To some,\nthe Confederate flag is a symbol of pride in one’s heritage. See Sons of Confederate Veterans, 305\nF.3d at 242 (Wilkinson, C.J., concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc) (noting that some people\n“view the Confederate flag as symbolically celebrating their line of descent”). To many others,\nhowever, the Confederate flag is a symbol that is just as offensive as the examples my colleagues\nput forth. See Storey v. Burns Int’l Security Services, 390 F.3d 760, 763 n.5 (3d Cir. 2004) (“One\nof the Confederacy’s key beliefs, as its Constitution readily asserted, was the interminable white\nman’s right to own black slaves. The battle flag of the Confederacy, then, [can be interpreted as]\nan exclusionary message that stigmatizes blacks as outsiders of the political community.”) (quoting\nAlexander Tsesis, The Problem of Confederate Symbols: A Thirteenth Amendment Approach, 75\nTemp. L. Rev. 539, 557 (2002) (footnotes omitted)); see also Dixon v. Coburg Dairy, Inc., 369 F.3d\n811, 822-24 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (Gregory, J., concurring) (“Moreover, common sense suggests\nthat such problems are not readily resolved merely because symbols such as a Confederate flag may\nbe accompanied with slogans such as ‘heritage not hate,’ because a symbol’s significance often lies\n‘in the eye of the beholder.’ [T]o its supporters at the time of its creation as well as some proponents\ntoday . . . the Confederate flag undeniably represented, and represents, support for slavery, . . . and\nopposition to the Republic.”). The majority’s invocation of KKK and Nazi Party license plates is\na red herring.\n        Moreover, Tennessee can constitutionally maintain viewpoint neutral regulations, such as\nthe one already in place requiring at least 1,000 paid specialty plate orders before a plate is issued.\nSee Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 106-07 (discussing the difference between subject matter\nregulations and viewpoint discrimination). If the KKK and Nazi Party are able to pull together\n1,000 proud, dues-paying members, who wish to display such license plates on their cars, however,\nthey are entitled to do so the same as the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Penn State Alumni, antique\nafficionados, and members of pro-life and pro-choice organizations. There is also no evidence that\nthe doomsday scenario the majority predicts has occurred in the Fourth Circuit. The government\nhas not ceased to function. The state governments are not inundated with frivolous license plate\nproposals. The roads are not overcrowded with KKK license plates and license plates advocating\nreckless pet breeding.\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.         Page 19\n\n\n       In raising such examples as my colleagues do here, they seem to forget about the core\npurpose of the First Amendment. “[T]he First Amendment was not written for the vast majority of\n[Tennesseans]. It belongs to a single minority of one.” Sons of Confederate Veterans, 305 F.3d at\n242 (Wilkinson, C.J., concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc). That currently disfavored\nmessages are entitled to First Amendment protection should come as a shock to no one.

In this case we are required to decide the constitutionality of\nTennessee’s statute making available the purchase of automobile license plates with a “Choose\nLife” inscription, but not making available the purchase of automobile license plates with a\n“pro-choice” or pro-abortion rights message. See TENN. CODE ANN. § 55-4-306. Although this\nexercise of government one-sidedness with respect to a very contentious political issue may be\nill-advised, we are unable to conclude that the Tennessee statute contravenes the First Amendment.\nGovernment can express public policy views by enlisting private volunteers to disseminate its\nmessage, and there is no principle under which the First Amendment can be read to prohibit\ngovernment from doing so because the views are particularly controversial or politically divisive.\nWe accordingly reverse the judgment of the district court invalidating the statute on First\nAmendment grounds.\n                                                  I.\n        Tennessee statutory law authorizes the sale of premium-priced license plates bearing special\nlogotypes to raise revenue for specific “departments, agencies, charities, programs and other\nactivities impacting Tennessee.” TENN. CODE ANN. § 55-4-201(j). The statute authorizing issuance\nof these license plates earmarks half of their respective profits for named non-profit groups\ncommitted to advancing the causes publicized on the plates. Id. § 55-4-215 to -217.\n       The State of Tennessee takes the other half of the profits. See id. § 55-4-215(a)(2)-(3). Forty\npercent (of the total profits) goes to the Tennessee arts commission, while the remaining 10 percent\ngoes to the state’s highway fund. Id. Tennessee will not issue a new specialty license plate until\ncustomers place at least one thousand advance orders. See id. § 55-4-201(h)(1).\n        The Tennessee legislature has determined the price of specialty plates by statute. In general,\nthey cost the same as a non-specialty plate plus a $35.00 fee (if the government issues the plate on\nor after September 1, 2002, as in this case). See id. § 55-4-203(d).\n        In 2003, the Tennessee legislature passed a law (hereinafter “the Act”) authorizing issuance\nof a specialty license plate with a “Choose Life” logotype “designed in consultation with a\nrepresentative of New Life Resources.” See id. § 55-4-306(b). Half of the profits go to New Life\nResources, Inc. (New Life). See id. § 55-4-306(c)-(d). New Life’s half “shall be used exclusively\nfor counseling and financial assistance, including food, clothing, and medical assistance for pregnant\nwomen in Tennessee.” Id. § 55-4-306(c). The Act strictly regulates the precise activities that these\nprofits shall fund. See id. § 55-4-306(d). It also provides a comprehensive list of dozens of groups\nthat must share in a portion of these profits. See id. It is undisputed that during legislative\nconsideration of the Act, Planned Parenthood of Middle and East Tennessee “lobbied for an\namendment authorizing a ‘Pro-Choice’ specialty license plate . . . , but the measure was defeated.”\nJA 231.\n\fNo. 04-6393                Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                         Page 3\n\n\n         The plaintiffs in this action, the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee and others,\nfiled a civil action in federal district court challenging the Act as facially unconstitutional, naming\nthe Governor of Tennessee as defendant. New Life intervened as a defendant. The district court\ngranted summary judgment to the plaintiffs, enjoining enforcement of the Act. The district court\nheld that the authorization of the “Choose Life” license plate was not purely government speech.\nRelying largely upon Fourth Circuit precedent, the district court held that “both the State and the\nindividual vehicle owner are speaking”—a “mixture” of government and private speech. JA 33-34\n(citing Planned Parenthood of S.C., Inc. v. Rose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785480\"><a href=\"/opinion/785480/planned-parenthood-of-south-carolina-incorporated-renee-carter-v-b-boykin/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 793-94 (4th Cir. 2004); Sons of\nConfederate Veterans, Inc. v.

Reasoning that providing for such “mixed” speech is not constitutional if doing so is\ndiscriminatory as to viewpoint, the district court found that the statute was clearly discriminatory\nas to viewpoint and enjoined enforcement of the Act. The district court expressly refrained,\nhowever, from reaching the question of whether the entire specialty license plate program was\nunconstitutional.\n        New Life appeals. Although the Tennessee state defendants have not appealed, they have\nfiled a brief urging this court not to strike down Tennessee’s specialty license plate scheme in its\nentirety.\n                                                           II.\n        First, the district court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction in this case by the Tax\nInjunction Act (TIA), 28 U.S.C. § 1341, as argued by New Life. New Life claims that the extra cost\nfor a “Choose Life” specialty license plate constitutes a tax that may not, under the TIA, be enjoined\nby a federal district court if a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in Tennessee courts.\n Even making the somewhat artificial assumption that it is really the payments that are being\nchallenged in this case,1 the payments are most closely analogous to payments for simple purchases\nfrom the government. Ordinary purchase payments are not taxes under the TIA, and neither is the\nextra payment for a specialty license plate. It follows that the TIA did not deprive the district court\nof subject matter jurisdiction in this case.\n      This conclusion is supported by the longstanding distinction drawn in various legal contexts\nbetween taxes and ordinary debts. The Supreme Court for instance explained in New Jersey v.\nAnderson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"96546\"><a href=\"/opinion/96546/new-jersey-v-anderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">203</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">483</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 492 (1906):\n         Generally speaking, a tax is a pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property for\n         the purpose of supporting the Government. We think this exaction is of that\n         character. It is required to be paid by the corporation after organization in invitum.[2]\n         The amount is fixed by the statute, to be paid on the outstanding capital stock of the\n         corporation each year, and capable of being enforced by action against the will of the\n         taxpayer. As was said by Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the court in Meriwether v.\n         Garrett, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">472</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513:\n\n         1\n            Compare Hibbs v. Winn, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136987\"><a href=\"/opinion/136987/hibbs-v-winn/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004). In Hibbs, the Supreme Court held that the TIA did not bar an\nEstablishment Clause challenge to a state income-tax credit for payments to certain organizations that give tuition grants\nto students attending religious schools. The Court explained that “in enacting the TIA, Congress trained its attention\non taxpayers who sought to avoid paying their tax bill by pursuing a challenge route other than the one specified by the\ntaxing authority.” Hibbs, 542 U.S. at 104-05. The Court also noted that cases applying the TIA generally “involved\nplaintiffs who mounted federal litigation to avoid paying state taxes (or to gain a refund of such taxes).” Id. at 106.\nPlaintiffs in this case are of course not seeking to avoid paying for a “Choose Life” license plate, and it is therefore at\nleast questionable whether the TIA would apply even if the payment for the license plates were a “tax.” We need not\nreach the issue, however, because of our determination that no tax is involved here.\n         2\n             “In invitum” means “[a]gainst an unwilling person.” BLACK’S LAW DICTIONARY 787 (7th ed. 1999).\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am.

The consent of the taxpayer is not necessary to their\n               enforcement. They operate in invitum. Nor is their nature affected by\n               the fact that in some States—and we believe in Tennessee—an action\n               of debt may be instituted for their recovery.

The Fifth Circuit\nexplained,\n       The State contends that the leases are in fact taxes, and thus the federal courts are\n       barred by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341, from entertaining a challenge\n       to the State’s actions to collect on the leases. This contention is without merit. The\n       lease obligations are a creature of contract, not a mandatory obligation imposed by\n       the state as taxes are.\nLipscomb v. Columbus Mun. Separate Sch. Dist., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">269</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">494</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 500 n.13 (5th Cir. 2001). The\nanalysis would apply a fortiori to ordinary purchases, like the purchase of government bonds, or the\npurchase of a souvenir at a state park gift store. Such purchase payments can hardly be termed\n“taxes” as opposed to ordinary payments on voluntary contracts. This conclusion follows,\nmoreover, regardless of what the government does with the sales income.\n        In this case, Tennessee’s sale of specialty plates creates contractual debts to pay but imposes\nno tax. Instead of using its sovereign power to coerce sales, Tennessee induces willing purchases\nas would any ordinary market participant. The government confers all the same driving privileges\non people who forgo specialty plates to buy standard-issue plates. Drivers’ only motive for buying\nsuch plates, therefore, must rest with the attractiveness of the “Choose Life” message as Tennessee\nhas marketed it, not a desire to obey Tennessee’s will. Under Anderson and Lipscomb, these sales\nconstitute regular contractual payments, not taxes.\n        We recognize that there is some case law to the effect that cases like this one are precluded\nby the Tax Injunction Act.

Stalder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"37866\"><a href=\"/opinion/37866/henderson-v-stalder/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 354-60 (5th Cir. 2005); NARAL\nPro-Choice Ohio v.

These cases proceed on the questionable assumption that the applicable test is the\none for differentiating between a regulatory fee and a tax. See generally Hedgepeth v. Tenn., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769068\"><a href=\"/opinion/769068/andrew-hedgepeth-celia-burson-david-mccleary-and-gaynell-metts-on-behalf/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">608</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (6th Cir. 2000). This test was created to answer a different question: whether a regulatory\nfee, often directed to a segregated fund for a special use related to the basis for imposing the fee, is\nor is not a tax for TIA purposes. See generally San Juan Cellular Tel. Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm’n\nof P.R., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585778\"><a href=\"/opinion/585778/san-juan-cellular-telephone-company-etc-v-public-service-commission-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">683</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 1992). The classic non-tax regulatory fee\n       is imposed by an agency upon those subject to its regulation. It may serve regulatory\n       purposes directly by, for example, deliberately discouraging particular conduct by\n       making it more expensive. Or, it may serve such purposes indirectly by, for\n       example, raising money placed in a special fund to help defray the agency's\n       regulation-related expenses.\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am.

In contrast, a purchase price cannot be said to be\n“imposed by an agency upon those subject to its regulation.” Instead it is merely a contract price.\nThe test for determining which compelled exactions are taxes and which are fees cannot logically\nbe used to determine whether a payment is a compelled exaction in the first place. Under the\nSupreme Court’s basic definition of a tax, logically applied in Lipscomb, the TIA does not preclude\nfederal jurisdiction over the plaintiffs’ claims in this case.\n          Eight judges of the Fifth Circuit accordingly dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc\nin Henderson. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792924\"><a href=\"/opinion/792924/russell-j-henderson-doreen-keeler-planned-parenthood-of-louisiana-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">434</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">352</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (5th Cir. 2005) (Davis, J. dissenting). In an opinion with which we are\nin substantial agreement, the dissent acknowledged the accepted test for distinguishing between a\nregulatory fee and a tax, but explained that “this does not mean that the extra charge for a specialty\nplate must be one or the other.” Id. at 355. It does not follow, in other words, that if “the charge is\nnot a regulatory fee . . . it must be a tax.” Id. Relying in part on the Ninth Circuit’s reasoning in\nBidart Brothers v. Calif. Apple Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"710937\"><a href=\"/opinion/710937/bidart-brothers-a-california-corporation-v-the-california-apple/\"><span class=\"volume\">73</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">925</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (9th Cir. 1996), the Fifth Circuit dissent\nreasoned that, “the relevant question is whether this charge is a tax and if the answer to this question\nis no, the TIA does not apply regardless of whether the charge is characterized as a regulatory fee,\na charitable donation or something else.” Henderson, 434 F.3d at 355. Thus even though the Fifth\nCircuit dissent found the charge for the Louisiana “Choose Life” plate not to be a regulatory fee, the\ncharge was not a tax either, in part because “the charge is not ‘imposed’ by the legislature; because\nit is entirely optional and voluntary on the part of Louisiana citizens electing to pay the extra charge\nfor a specialty plate.” Id. at 356.\n                                                  III.\n        On the merits we are faced with a purely legal issue: whether a government-crafted message\ndisseminated by private volunteers creates a “forum” for speech that must be viewpoint neutral.

The “Choose Life” Specialty License Plate Bears a Government-Crafted Message\n        “Choose Life,” as it is to appear on the face of Tennessee specialty license plates, is a\ngovernment-crafted message. See Johanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142895\"><a href=\"/opinion/142895/johanns-v-livestock-marketing-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2055</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2005).\nJohanns stands for the proposition that when the government determines an overarching message\nand retains power to approve every word disseminated at its behest, the message must be attributed\nto the government for First Amendment purposes. See id. at 2062-66. In this case, Johanns\nrequires the court to conclude that “Choose Life” is Tennessee’s message because the Act\ndetermines the overarching message and Tennessee approves every word on such plates.\n        In Johanns, the Supreme Court held that federal government promotional campaigns to\nencourage beef consumption constituted government speech because the “message of the\npromotional campaigns is effectively controlled by the Federal Government itself.” Id. at 2062. In\nthese campaigns, however, the federal government did not explicitly credit itself as the speaker. See\nid. at 2059 (messages bore the attribution, “Funded by America’s Beef Producers”).\n        More specifically, the “message set out in the beef promotions” counted as government\nspeech because “from beginning to end [it is] the message established by the Federal Government.”\nId. at 2062. Congress “directed the implementation of a coordinated program of promotion” that\nincludes paid advertising to advance the “image and desirability of beef and beef products.” Id. at\n2062-63 (internal quotation marks omitted). Congress and the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture\nenunciated “the overarching message and some of its elements,” while leaving the “remaining\ndetails to an entity whose members are answerable to the Secretary.” Id. at 2063. Also, the\n“Secretary exercises final approval authority over every word used in every promotional campaign.”\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.             Page 6\n\n\nId. The Supreme Court concluded that when “the government sets the overall message to be\ncommunicated and approves every word that is disseminated,” it is government speech. Id.\n        Johanns supports classifying “Choose Life” on specialty license plates as the State’s own\nmessage. The Tennessee legislature chose the “Choose Life” plate’s overarching message and\napproved every word to be disseminated. Tennessee set the overall message and the specific\nmessage when it spelled out in the statute that these plates would bear the words “Choose Life.”\nTENN. CODE ANN. § 55-4-306. Tennessee, like the Secretary of Agriculture in Johanns, leaves some\nof the “remaining details to an entity whose members are answerable” to the State government.\nTennessee delegates partial responsibility for the design of the plate to New Life, but retains a veto\nover its design. See id. § 55-4-306(b). The “Choose Life” plate must be issued in a design\nconfiguration distinctive to its category and determined by the commissioner. Id. § 55-4-202(b)(2).\nThus, Tennessee’s statutory law, and its power to withdraw authorization for any license plate, gives\nthe State the right to wield “final approval authority over every word used” on the “Choose Life”\nplate. As in Johanns, here Tennessee “sets the overall message to be communicated and approves\nevery word that is disseminated” on the “Choose Life” plate. It is Tennessee’s own message.\n        Plaintiffs argue that “Choose Life” on specialty plates should be treated not as Tennessee’s\nown message but as “mixed” speech subject to a viewpoint-neutrality requirement. Plaintiffs point\nto the following undisputed facts to support their view: (1) Tennessee produces over one hundred\nspecialty plates in support of diverse groups, ideologies, activities, and colleges; (2) a private anti-\nabortion group, New Life, collaborates with the State to produce the “Choose Life” plate; and (3)\nvehicles are associated with their owners, creating the impression that a “Choose Life” license plate\nattached to a vehicle represents the vehicle owner’s viewpoint. These facts are however consistent\nwith the determination that “Choose Life” on a Tennessee specialty plate is a government-crafted\nmessage.\n         First, there is nothing implausible about the notion that Tennessee would use its license plate\nprogram to convey messages regarding over one hundred groups, ideologies, activities, and colleges.\nGovernment in this age is large and involved in practically every aspect of life. At least where\nTennessee does not blatantly contradict itself in the messages it sends by approving such plates,\nthere is no reason to doubt that a group’s ability to secure a specialty plate amounts to state approval.\nIt is noteworthy that Tennessee has produced plates for respectable institutions such as Penn State\nUniversity but has issued no plates for groups of wide disrepute such as the Ku Klux Klan or the\nAmerican Nazi Party. Plaintiffs’ position implies that Tennessee must provide specialty plates for\nthese hate groups in order for it constitutionally to provide specialty plates supporting any\ninstitution. Such an argument falls of its own weight.\n        Second, as Johanns makes clear, the participation of New Life in designing the “Choose\nLife” logotype has little or no relevance to whether a plate expresses a government message. See\n125 S. Ct. at 2062-63. In Johanns the Supreme Court upheld the beef marketing scheme as\ngovernment speech even though the development of details was left to an entity “answerable” to the\nSecretary of Agriculture. Id. So long as Tennessee sets the overall message and approves its details,\nthe message must be attributed to Tennessee for First Amendment purposes. See id.\n        Third, Johanns also says that a government-crafted message is government speech even if\nthe government does not explicitly credit itself as the speaker. Many of the promotional messages\nin Johanns bore the attribution “Funded by America’s Beef Producers.” Id. at 2059. The Supreme\nCourt explained that the tagline, “standing alone, is not sufficiently specific to convince a reasonable\nfactfinder that any particular beef producer, or all beef producers, would be tarred with the content\nof each trademarked ad.” Id. at 2065-66. This was true even though the message was presumably\nconveyed in private media containing mostly privately-sponsored advertising. In contrast, the\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.           Page 7\n\n\nmedium in this case, a government-issued license plate that every reasonable person knows to be\ngovernment-issued, a fortiori conveys a government message.\n       B.      Dissemination of a Government-Crafted Message by Private Volunteers Does Not\n               Create a “Forum” for Speech Requiring Viewpoint Neutrality\n         Plaintiffs’ most intuitively inviting argument—that the government must be viewpoint\nneutral when it relies on like-minded volunteers to disseminate its message—cannot in the end\ninvalidate the Act. Plaintiffs point to the following facts to support this aspect of their argument:\n(a) the government must receive one thousand advance customer orders for the “Choose Life” plate\nor Tennessee will not manufacture it; (b) the “Choose Life” message is communicated by private\ncitizens’ affirmatively purchasing the plates and attaching them to their privately-owned vehicles;\n(c) the Tennessee government devotes no funds to disseminating the “Choose Life” message, but\nrather raises money by selling these plates to customers who wish to have “Choose Life” plates on\ntheir cars. While it is true that such voluntary dissemination itself qualifies as expressive conduct,\nthe government’s reliance on private volunteers to express its policies does not create a “forum” for\nspeech requiring viewpoint neutrality.\n         This conclusion is supported by negative inference from the one Supreme Court case dealing\nwith license plate speech. In Wooley v. Maynard, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109638\"><a href=\"/opinion/109638/wooley-v-maynard/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">705</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1977), New Hampshire embossed\nits state motto, “Live Free or Die,” on standard-issue license plates in the same way that Tennessee\nwould stamp “Choose Life” on specialty plates. See id. at 707. The Wooley Court characterized\n“Live Free or Die” as “the State’s ideological message,” id. at 715, and the State’s “official view,”\nid. at 717. The Supreme Court held that New Hampshire could not constitutionally prosecute\nvehicle owners for covering up the motto on their license plates, because by doing so the State\nwould be unconstitutionally forcing automobile owners to adhere to an ideological point of view\nthey disagreed with. Nowhere did the Court suggest that the State’s message could not be so\ndisseminated by those who did not object to the State’s motto, or even hint that the State could not\nput the message on state-issued license plates. “Choose Life” is Tennessee’s public message, just\nas “Live Free or Die” communicated New Hampshire’s individualist values and state pride. The evil\nin Wooley was that the automobile owners were compelled to disseminate the message; here\nautomobile owners are not only not compelled, they have to pay extra to disseminate the message.\n        In general, the government does not create a “forum” for expression when it seeks to have\nprivate entities disseminate its message. In Johanns, for instance, the federal government paid for\nthe “Beef. It’s What’s for Dinner” message and other promotional messages. 125 S.Ct. at 2059.\nAlthough these involved “print and television messages,” id. at 2059, presumably published or\nbroadcasted by hired private entities, the Court classified this and the rest of the beef promotions as\ngovernment speech for First Amendment purposes. See id. at 2058, 2062-66. Likewise, in Rust v.\nSullivan, the federal government allocated Title X funds to doctors for family planning counseling\nbut forbade such doctors from discussing abortion with the program’s patients. </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112593\"><a href=\"/opinion/112593/rust-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 178-\n83 (1991). In Rust, the Court recognized that when “the government disburses public funds to\nprivate entities to convey a governmental message, it may take legitimate and appropriate steps to\nensure that its message is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee.” Rosenberger v. Rector &\nVisitors of the Univ. of Va., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117967\"><a href=\"/opinion/117967/rosenberger-v-rector-and-visitors-of-univ-of-va/\"><span class=\"volume\">515</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">819</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 833 (1995) (interpreting Rust). If in this case Tennessee\ndrivers were paid by the government to display “Choose Life” plates, the Act would unquestionably\nbe constitutional.\n        In this case, however, the carriers of Tennessee’s message are unpaid. They are volunteers.\nRather then receiving government money, they pay out of their own pockets for the privilege of\nputting the government-crafted message on their private property. Plaintiffs argue that this fact\ndemonstrates that “Choose Life” is not purely the government’s message but also the speech of the\ncustomers who purchase and display these plates—thus creating a “forum” for speech. While it is\n\fNo. 04-6393                Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                    Page 8\n\n\ntrue that volunteers’ display of “Choose Life” plates expresses agreement with Tennessee, that fact\ndoes not mean that a First Amendment “forum” for speech has been created.\n        The doctors in Rust disagreed with the government’s anti-abortion policy. But if they had\nbeen true believers in the policy and had volunteered to work in the program free of charge, the\nspeech restrictions in Rust would still have expressed the government’s anti-abortion\nviewpoint—and therefore qualified for government speech treatment. Similarly, the publications\nand television stations in Johanns that published or broadcasted beef advertisements would have\nconveyed a government-crafted message even if they had done so for free. There is nothing in the\nSupreme Court’s decisions in Rust or Johanns that implies that the government has less right to\ncontrol expressions of its policies when it relies on unpaid private people. No constitutionally\nsignificant distinction exists between volunteer disseminators and paid disseminators.\n        Plaintiffs’ view that volunteer dissemination of a government-crafted message creates a\n“forum,” if accepted, would force the government to produce messages that fight against its policies,\nor render unconstitutional a large swath of government actions that nearly everyone would consider\ndesirable and legitimate. Government can certainly speak out on public issues supported by a broad\nconsensus, even though individuals have a First Amendment right not to express agreement. For\ninstance, government can distribute pins  that say “Register and Vote,” issue postage stamps during\nWorld War II that say “Win the War,”3 and sell license plates that say “Spay or Neuter your Pets.”4\nCitizens clearly have the First Amendment right to oppose such widely-accepted views, but that\nright cannot conceivably require the government to distribute “Don’t Vote” pins, to issue postage\nstamps in 1942 that say “Stop the War,” or to sell license plates that say “Spaying or Neutering your\nPet is Cruel.”\n       We cannot affirm the district court in this case without either (1) effectively invalidating all\nsuch hitherto-accepted forms of privately disseminated government speech, or (2) distinguishing\nthese examples from the “Choose Life” specialty license plates.\n        Neither the district court nor the plaintiffs on appeal attempt to articulate a basis for\ndistinguishing these examples. Government-printed pamphlets or pins saying “Register and Vote”\nor “Buy U.S. Bonds” are clearly government-crafted messages distributed by private individuals\nwho have a First Amendment right not to disseminate them if they don’t want to. Postage stamps\nsaying “Win the War” or “Support Our Troops” are clearly government-crafted messages\ndisseminated by private individuals who, under Wooley, also presumably have a First Amendment\nnot to buy or use them if they don’t want to. And license plates saying for instance “Spay or Neuter\nyour Pets” are even more obviously indistinguishable from the license plates at issue in this case.\nIndeed, the State of Tennessee in this appeal, not advocating reversal of the district court’s\ninjunction but urging us not to invalidate the entire specialty license plate program, offers no tenable\nbasis for drawing a distinction between the dozens of government messages available on Tennessee\nplates and the “Choose Life” message.\n\n\n         3\n           See Scott Catalogue No. 905 (1942). The example is hardly unusual, as United States postage stamps have\ncarried a variety of government-crafted advocacy messages over the years. Examples include “Give Me Liberty or Give\nMe Death” (Scott No. 1144 (1961)), “Register and Vote” (Scott No. 1394 (1968)), “Giving Blood Saves Lives” (Scott\nNo. 1425 (1971)), “Organ and Tissue Donation: Share Your Life . . .” (Scott No. 3227 (1998)), and “Breast Cancer, Fund\nthe Fight, Find a Cure” (Scott No. B1 (1998)). See also Scott No. 1129 (“World Peace Through World Trade”), No.\n1142 (“And this be our Motto, in God is our Trust”), No. 1320 (“We appreciate our Servicemen”), No. 1343 (“Law and\nOrder”), No. 1438 (“Prevent Drug Abuse”), No. 1455 (“Family Planning”), No. 1802 (“Honoring Vietnam Veterans”),\nNo. 1831 (“Organized Labor Proud and Free”), No. 1927 (“Alcoholism You Can Beat It!”), No. 2102 (“Take a Bite out\nof Crime”).\n         4\n             See KY. REV. STAT. ANN. § 186.162(2)(y) (2005).\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.           Page 9\n\n\n        Of course the unstated distinction is that the “Choose Life” message is highly controversial.\nWith respect to the “Choose Life” message, much more than in the above examples, there are large\nnumbers of participants in the public discourse with an opposing view. Such a distinction, however,\nis entirely indefensible as a matter of First Amendment law, however much it might properly\nmotivate the Tennessee legislature as a matter of policy. Such a distinction would fly in the face of\nthe fundamental free speech principle that views expressed by substantial numbers are treated no\ndifferently by the First Amendment than extreme or way-out-of-the-mainstream views. Government\nspeech disseminated by private volunteers, in other words, cannot have its constitutionality under\nthe First Amendment depend on the small number of objectors to the government’s message, or the\nextreme nature of their views.\n        In the absence of a tenable distinction, invalidating the Act in this case would effectively\ninvalidate not only all those government specialty license plate provisions that involve a message\nthat anyone might disagree with, but also effectively invalidate all manner of other long-accepted\npractices in the form of government-crafted messages disseminated by private volunteers. We are\nnot provided with a sound legal basis for making such a leap.\n        We recognize that the Fourth Circuit has invalidated a nearly identical specialty license plate\nlaw in South Carolina. See Planned Parenthood of S.C., Inc., v. Rose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785480\"><a href=\"/opinion/785480/planned-parenthood-of-south-carolina-incorporated-renee-carter-v-b-boykin/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2004).\nIn Rose Judge Michael enunciated a rationale that neither of the other two panel judges joined,\nalthough both concurred in the judgment. See id. at 800 (Luttig, J., concurring in the judgment); id.\nat 801 (Gregory, J., concurring in the judgment). The reasoning of the Fourth Circuit judges is not\npersuasive, primarily for two reasons.\n        First, the Fourth Circuit opinions in Rose are in tension with the intervening case of Johanns.\nJohanns sets forth an authoritative test for determining when speech may be attributed to the\ngovernment for First Amendment purposes. Rose relied instead on a pre-Johanns four-factor test\nof the Fourth Circuit’s own devising that led to an “indeterminate result” on the crucial issue of\nwhether “Choose Life” specialty plates express a government message. Id. at 793. The Johanns\nstandard, by contrast, classifies the “Choose Life” message as government speech.\n       Second, none of the separate Fourth Circuit opinions explains how that court would treat\nsuch unexceptional examples of government-provided, privately disseminated speech as those\ndescribed above. Without an articulated basis for distinguishing such examples, following the\nFourth Circuit’s lead in this case would invalidate wide swaths of previously accepted exercises of\ngovernment speech. With no Supreme Court case requiring us to take such a step, we decline to do\nso.\n                                                 IV.\n     For the foregoing reasons, the district court’s order enjoining enforcement of the Act is\nREVERSED and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\fNo. 04-6393                Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.

MARTIN, JR., Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting in part. I concur\nin the Court’s holding that the district court was not deprived of subject matter jurisdiction in this\ncase by the Tax Injunction Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1341. With respect to the merits of the case, I would\nhold that Tennessee has unconstitutionally discriminated on the basis 1of viewpoint and would affirm\nthe district court’s decision enjoining the Choose Life license plate.\n         I believe that there are two major flaws with the majority’s analysis in this case. First, the\nmajority fails to properly characterize the specialty license plate program. It seems apparent to me\nthat the state created the specialty license plate program to facilitate private speech (notwithstanding\nthe government speech aspects inherent in the issuance of a license plate), and not to promote a\ngovernmental message. This fact, even conceding that there must necessarily be some governmental2\nspeech involved in the issuance of license plates, requires that the government be viewpoint neutral.\nSecond, the majority errs by applying First Amendment compelled speech/subsidy doctrine to a case\nwhere, as the majority admits with respect to its analysis of the Tax Injunction Act, nothing is\ncompelled. Because we are not dealing with compelled speech or compelled subsidies, I do not\nbelieve that the so-called government speech inquiry is wholly determinative of whether the First\nAmendment has been violated. Although the government may generally speak and control its own\nmessage, it may not suppress contrary messages because        of their viewpoint in a forum designed to\nencourage a diversity of views from private speakers.3\n\n\n\n\n         1\n           Perhaps of some interest, when this opinion is filed, at least three circuits (4th, 5th, and 6th) will have spoken\non the issue, reaching at least three different conclusions, via at least sixteen separate opinions. Additionally, on March\n6, 2006, in a non-precedential opinion, the Second Circuit addressed a near identical lawsuit — albeit in a different\nprocedural posture — with the parties in reversed positions. See Children First Foundation, Inc. v. Martinez, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span>\n<span class=\"page\">544502</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2d Cir. March 6, 2006) (unpublished). The Children First Foundation sued the state of New York when it\ndenied the foundation’s application for a Choose Life license plate. According to the foundation, the state committed\nunconstitutional viewpoint discrimination when it denied the application “based on their disagreement with [the] life-\naffirming viewpoint expressed by the plate.” Id. at *1. The district court denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss based\non qualified immunity and the Second Circuit affirmed. The court noted that the state attempted to justify its decision\nbased on the “government speech doctrine,” but held that “custom license plates involve, at a minimum, some private\nspeech” and that “it would not have been reasonable for defendants to conclude this doctrine permitted viewpoint\ndiscrimination in this case.” Id.\n         2\n            See Planned Parenthood of South Carolina, Inc. v. Rose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785480\"><a href=\"/opinion/785480/planned-parenthood-of-south-carolina-incorporated-renee-carter-v-b-boykin/\"><span class=\"volume\">361</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">786</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2004). The Fourth Circuit\nhas held that specialty license plates embody a mixture of government speech and private speech. Id. at 793 (Opinion\nof Michael, J.) (“[T]he Choose Life plate embodies a mixture of private and government speech.”); id. at 800 (Luttig,\nJ., concurring in the judgment) (“[V]anity license plates are quintessential examples of such hybrid speech.”). I agree\nthat this is an adequate characterization of the nature of the specialty license plate. And, I agree that when faced with\nsuch a program, the government must remain viewpoint neutral. I find it more informative, however, to look beyond\nthe specific “Choose Life” plate at issue and examine the purpose of the entire license plate forum. I would not limit\nmy analysis to the inquiry — as the majority here does — of whether the Choose Life license plate alone is government\nor private speech. I believe that the majority errs in labeling the license plate as pure government speech and I also\nbelieve that it errs in not taking into account the nature of the license plate forum.\n         3\n            It also bears mentioning that the State of Tennessee is not even a party to this appeal. The state acquiesced\nin the district court’s decision and has appeared solely in response to the intervenors to request that we not strike down\nthe entire license plate program. The party advocating the Choose Life license plate is a private organization.\n\fNo. 04-6393               Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                       Page 11\n\n\n                                                           I.\n         A.       Tennessee’s speciality license plate program is a forum designed to encourage\n                  private speech, not a government program established to promote a governmental\n                  message.\n        The majority focuses on the Choose Life license plate without considering the license plate\nprogram as a whole and frames the question as “whether a government-crafted message\ndisseminated by private volunteers creates a ‘forum’ for speech that must be viewpoint neutral.”\nThis is itself a loaded question. First, it puts the cart before the horse by already deciding that the\nmessage is purely a governmental message. Second, by so phrasing, there is no doubt that the\nanswer is “no.” When the government crafts a message and disseminates it, the simple act of the\ngovernment speaking does not create a forum that invites competing          viewpoints. Although the\nmajority answers this question, it is not determinative of the case.4 Putting aside the question as to\nwhether specialty license plates represent “a government-crafted message” — and I do not believe\nthat they do — the proper question is not whether when the government speaks must it always allow\nothers to speak, but whether a forum exists in which speech is occurring, and if so, whether the\ngovernment may suppress a disfavored message based on its viewpoint.\n        Thus, I would start by determining the overall purpose of the speciality license plate\nprogram. When this is done, viewing the license plate program as a whole, and taking account of\nthe fact that the government engages in speech by providing the actual license plates, it becomes\nclear that the speciality license plate “program was designed to facilitate private speech, not to\npromote a governmental message.” Legal Services Corp. v.

This conclusion, in\ncontrast to the majority’s, would require Tennessee’s license plate program to be viewpoint neutral.\n        Tennessee requires all motor vehicles to have a license plate. Motorists can choose from\nordinary license plates created by the Tennessee government or they can pay extra for personalized\nand specialty license plates. There are several standard Tennessee plates and there are\napproximately 150 specialty plates. As the majority notes, the specialty plates are created in\nconsultation with private organizations and half of the profits may be devoted to the private non-\nprofit organizations sponsoring the plates.\n        In my opinion, the fact that the state has permitted approximately 150 private organizations\nto create specialty license plates and the manner in which the state operates its license plate program\ndemonstrates that the forum was created to facilitate private speech.

That is, did the Tennessee government decide to establish a program promoting Penn State\nAlumni Pride and seek out private volunteers to transmit this message to the public at large? Did the Tennessee\ngovernment decide to establish a program promoting the University of Florida (the University of Tennessee’s arch-rival\nin football, see Gator Hater, http://www.gator-haters.com/Tennessee/index_TN.shtml (last visited March 10, 2006) (a\nwebsite run by University of Tennessee fans dedicated to their rivalry with the University of Florida, including news,\njokes, and recipes for cooking alligator meat)), and does the State seek out private volunteers to promote the University\nof Florida to its citizens? It is a nice academic exercise to hypothesize that the license plate program is a governmental\nprogram to disseminate through private volunteers all of the state’s various messages, but it seems to me to be a\nconclusion that only judges banished to our ivory towers and shut off from the real world could reach.

First, the State’s own application for\na “personalized,” “specialty,” or “special” license plate advertises, “SHOW YOUR SCHOOL\nSPIRIT” (emphasis added) and “SUPPORT YOUR CAUSE AND COMMUNITY.” (emphasis\nadded). It does not say, “SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT’S MESSAGE.” Additionally, a June\n22, 2005 press release from the Governor’s office informs that the state “currently issues nearly 150\ndifferent license plates to reflect drivers’ special interests, 7such as schools, wildlife preservation,\nparks, the arts and children’s hospitals.” (emphasis added).\n\n         5\n          The plates include for “Clubs/Groups”: Alpha Kappa Alpha, Alpha Phi Alpha, Delta Sigma Theta, Ducks\nUnlimited, Fraternal Order of Police, Int’l Assoc. of Firefighters, Kappa Alpha Psi, Mothers Against Drunk Driving,\nMasons, Omega Psi Phi, Phi Beta Sigma, Tennessee Police Benevolent Association, and Zeta Phi Beta.

Would that be enough to demonstrate that the state\nis encouraging private speech?\n         7\n          It is also curious that the government, if it wished to speak and promote a message, would first require at least\n1,000 individuals to pay the government before it agreed to disseminate the message.

Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                        Page 13\n\n\n        I would contrast specialty plates with Tennessee’s own plates where it does intend to convey\na governmental message. For example, a new Tennessee plate issued in January 2006 was issued\nbecause “[Governor] Bredesen felt strongly [that the plate] should reflect the natural beauty of the\nstate.” Press Release, available at http://tennessee.gov/safety/newsreleases/newplate.htm (last\nvisited March 10, 2006). Bredesen stated that he wanted “this new plate to reflect the magnificence\nof our state, as well as to serve as a symbol of the pride Tennesseans feel to live on such a beautiful\nland.” That same press release notes that “[t]he Tennessee Department of Safety issues\napproximately 5.4 million passenger auto plates each year . . . . In addition, the state currently issues\nnearly 150 different license plates to reflect drivers’ special interests, such as schools, wildlife\npreservation, parks, the arts and children’s hospitals.” Id.\n        Although there may be nothing “implausible” about a government establishing a license plate\nprogram in order to promote purely governmental messages, I believe the majority ignores the\nreality of the situation here — Tennessee is not promoting its own messages, but rather has\n“expend[ed] funds [or provided governmental property in the form of the license plate itself] to\nencourage a diversity of views from private   speakers.” Legal Services Corp., 531 U.S. at 542\n(quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834).8 In this case, “[a] page of history is worth a volume of\nlogic.” N.Y.

The majority errs by applying the compelled speech/subsidy doctrine in a case where\n                  nothing is compelled.\n       Aside from having mischaracterized the purpose of the specialty license plate program, the\nmajority also applies the wrong First Amendment doctrine. For purposes of the Tax Injunction Act\ninquiry, the majority properly concludes that the payments for specialty license plates are voluntary\nand not compelled. Nevertheless, when it turns to the merits of the First Amendment inquiry, the\nmajority ironically treats this case as if it were a compelled speech or compelled subsidy case. I part\nways with the majority because it I do not agree that Johanns v. Livestock Mktg. Ass’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"142895\"><a href=\"/opinion/142895/johanns-v-livestock-marketing-assn/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The majority\napparently takes Johanns to mean that the sleeping doctrine of “government speech” has been\nawakened and now controls all First Amendment analysis. I disagree.\n        Johanns is a case that addresses compelled subsidies — that is, the government forced\nsomeone to give it money to pay for speech. In Johanns, the Supreme Court described the “two\ncategories of [compelled speech] cases.” Id. at 2060. The first category is true compelled speech\ncases — i.e., cases where “an individual is obliged personally to express a message he disagrees\nwith, imposed by the government.” Id. In this category, the Court has taken a strong stand and\ninvalidated “outright compulsion.” Id.; see West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"103870\"><a href=\"/opinion/103870/west-virginia-bd-of-ed-v-barnette/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n\ncollection of a designated amount of money from private persons before its ‘speech’ is triggered.”). In fact, in this case,\nTennessee does not expend any funds of its own. The entire license plate is funded by the private purchasers. All that\nTennessee provides is the medium — the actual metal license plate — for the groups to design and display their\nmessages. And in providing this medium, the government has created a means by which favored groups can promote\ntheir messages and raise funds, but the government has prevented a disfavored group from having the same access to\nthe forum. Contrary to the majority’s suggestion, however, adopting this approach does not mean that the state has to\nauthorize a plate for every individual or group that requests one. The state may adopt reasonable and viewpoint neutral\nregulations to administer the license plate program in a manner consistent with the program’s objectives.\n         8\n           Although I would not necessarily find the following points controlling, there is also additional support for my\nconclusion that the messages are not governmental in nature. Many of the messages are not germane to governance (for\nexample, the plates promoting antiques, numerous out-of-state universities, Ducks Unlimited, and various others). The\nFellowship of Christian Athletes may beg other First Amendment questions if it is promoted by the government. I would\nalso question whether Tennessee wishes to promote the Sons of Confederate Veterans plate, bearing the Confederate\nFlag as its design. I find it telling that in this appeal, the state did not claim to be “promoting” these messages.\n\fNo. 04-6393               Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v.

The second category of cases is compelled subsidy cases — that is,\ncases “in which an individual is required by the government to subsidize a message he disagrees\nwith.” Johanns, 125 S. Ct. at 2060. There are two subcategories to the compelled subsidy cases:\n(a) compelled subsidies to support a private entity’s political message, see Keller v. State Bar of\nCal., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112443\"><a href=\"/opinion/112443/keller-v-state-bar-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1990); Abood v.

It is in this subcategory — compelled subsidies to\nsupport the government’s message — that Johanns fits.9 Thus, in compelled subsidy cases, the\ndeterminative issue is whether the speech is the government’s (which is immune from First\nAmendment challenge) or a private entity’s speech, which is unconstitutional, see Keller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112291\"><a href=\"/opinion/112291/pennsylvania-v-union-gas-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">491</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Abood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109661\"><a href=\"/opinion/109661/abood-v-detroit-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">.\n        The reason is simple when one thinks of what the First Amendment harm is in each situation.\nWhen there is a compelled subsidy, the harm is being forced to give the government money to pay\nfor someone else’s message. When that message is another private message (despite tangential\ngovernment involvement), the First Amendment is violated. See Keller, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112443\"><a href=\"/opinion/112443/keller-v-state-bar-of-cal/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; Abood, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109661\"><a href=\"/opinion/109661/abood-v-detroit-bd-of-ed/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">209</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">; see also 5 The Founders’ Constitution, § 37, A Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom,\np. 77 (1987), codified in 1786 at Va. Code Ann. § 57-1 (Lexis 2003) (where in 1779, Thomas\nJefferson wrote that “to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propogation of\nopinions which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical”). When the message is the government’s\nown, however, the harm is alleviated for First Amendment purposes. This is because, of course, the\ngovernment must be able to tax and spend in order to function. See Board of Regents of Univ. of\nWis. Sys. v. Southworth, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621017\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621017/board-of-regents-of-univ-of-wis-system-v-southworth/\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229 (2000) (“The government, as a general rule, may support\nvalid programs and policies by taxes or other exactions binding on protesting parties. Within this\nbroader principle it seems inevitable that funds raised by the government will be spent for speech\nand other expression to advocate and defend its own policies.”); see also Keller, 496 U.S. at 12-13\n(“If every citizen were to have a right to insist that no one paid by public funds express a view with\nwhich he disagreed, debate over issues of great concern to the public would be limited to those in\nthe private sector, and the process of government as we know it radically transformed.”). The First\nAmendment harm in this case, however, has nothing to do with being forced to speak or to subsidize\na message. Rather, the harm is being denied the opportunity to speak on the same terms as other\nprivate citizens within a government sponsored forum. In this situation, whether the particular\nChoose Life message is the government’s      own or private speech, the First Amendment harm is not\nalleviated for the persons denied access.10 Thus, the government speech doctrine, a la Johanns, is\nnot the determinative question in this case. The specialty license plate issue at hand does not involve\ncompelled speech. It does not involve a compelled subsidy for a private entity. And, it does not\ninvolve a compelled subsidy to support a government message.\n       The majority here, however, extrapolates the so-called government speech doctrine from the\ncompelled subsidy context of Johanns, and applies it, apparently, without limit, in all First\nAmendment cases. I disagree with this approach. First, if the majority’s analysis applied to\nBarnette, Wooley, Keller, and Abood, the outcomes of all of those cases certainly could have been\n\n         9\n           See also United States v.

When the majority answers “no” to the misleading question it poses, the proper First Amendment\nquestion is still not answered because there are another one-hundred fifty other private speakers in the broader license\nplate forum.\n\fNo. 04-6393                Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.                          Page 15\n\n\ndifferent. The majority here found several facts relevant to its decision. First, the government\n“crafted” the message. The same could be said in the earlier cases. The Pledge of Allegiance is the\ngovernment’s message. New Hampshire’s government “crafted” its own motto. Based on the\nmajority’s broad interpretation of government involvement in speech, the fact that the government\ncompelled membership and dues payments in Keller and Abood, could be interpreted to fall within\nthe majority’s understanding of government speech. The government had ultimate control over all\nof these messages. In each of those cases, the facts the majority found relevant here would indicate\nthat the message was the government’s own. But, this was not the approach the Supreme Court\ntook, and I would not take it here either, because it ignores the First Amendment interests at issue.\n        The government speech doctrine, as it is used in Johanns, is more appropriately utilized in\nthe compelled subsidy context, where who is speaking is determinative, and if it is the government,\nconsistent with its broad taxing authority, that speech is immune from First Amendment challenge.\nJohanns, 125 S. Ct. at 2068 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“[T]he Government argues here that the beef\nadvertising is its own speech, exempting it from the First Amendment bar against  extracting special\nsubsidies from those unwilling to underwrite an objectionable message.”).11 Thus, if the plaintiffs\nhere, who presumably disagree with the “Choose Life” message, were compelled to subsidize the\nproduction12and distribution of “Choose Life” license plates, then Johanns would be on all fours with\nthis case.     We face an entirely different situation, however, and therefore Johanns is not\ndeterminative.\n         C.        The “government speech” doctrine does not permit viewpoint discrimination when\n                   the government encourages a diversity of views from private speakers.\n        The Supreme Court’s precursor cases to Johanns, Rust v. Sullivan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112593\"><a href=\"/opinion/112593/rust-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">173</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1991) and\nLegal Services Corp., are instructive, as well as the Court’s viewpoint discrimination cases. The\nmajority briefly considers Rust, but misinterprets its holding and improperly applies it to this case.\nIn Rust, Congress established Title X of the Public Health Service Act, “which provides federal\nfunding for family planning services.” Id. at 178. The Act authorizes the Secretary of the\nDepartment of Health and Human Services to “make grants to and enter into contracts with public\nor nonprofit private entities to assist in the establishment and operation of voluntary family planning\nprojects which shall offer a broad range of acceptable and effective family planning methods and\nservices.” Id. (quoting 42 U.S.C § 300(a)). Thus, in Rust, Congress established a federal program\n\n\n\n         11\n             Justice Souter noted that while the government speech doctrine is in its early stages of development, two\npoints are clear: “The first point of certainty is the need to recognize the legitimacy of government’s power to speak\ndespite objections by dissenters whose taxes or other exactions necessarily go in some measure to putting the offensive\nmessage forward to be heard.” Id. at 2070 (Souter, J., dissenting); id. (discussing government’s need to avoid “heckler’s\nveto of any forced contribution”). “The second fixed point of government-speech doctrine is that the First Amendment\ninterest in avoiding forced subsidies is served, though not necessarily satisfied, by the political process as a check on\nwhat government chooses to say.” Id. at 2070-71 (Souter, J., dissenting); id. at 2071 (discussing “[t]he adequacy of the\ndemocratic process to render subsidization of government speech tolerable”). Johanns is very clearly about targeted\nassessments and forcing those who disagree with a particular message to fund it.\n         12\n            The majority is mistaken therefore, in reading Johanns as a watershed First Amendment case. It may be a\nwatershed compelled subsidy case, but it is not revolutionary and does not transform all First Amendment doctrine. The\nJohanns dissent is instructive on this point. The contention was not over whether the government can ever compel a\nsubsidy for its own message — it can — but over the concept of transparency. That is, when the government speaks,\nmust it identify itself clearly as the speaker? Id. at 2069 (Souter, J., dissenting) (“The error is not that government speech\ncan never justify compelling a subsidy, but that a compelled subsidy should not be justifiable by speech unless the\ngovernment must put that speech forward as its own.”); id. at 2072 (asserting that transparency requires knowing whether\n“Uncle Sam is the man talking behind the curtain”); id. at 2073 (“It means nothing that Government officials control the\nmessage if that fact is never required to be made apparent to those who get the message, let alone if it is affirmatively\nconcealed from them.”).\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.         Page 16\n\n\nwhich allowed the Secretary to provide grants to family planning projects that complied with the\nterms of the grants.\n        The Court rejected the plaintiffs’ First Amendment claim stating that “[t]he Government can,\nwithout violating the Constitution, selectively fund a program to encourage certain activities it\nbelieves to be in the public interest, without at the same time funding an alternative program which\nseeks to deal with the problem in another way.” Id. at 193; id. (noting that the government “has\nmerely chosen to fund one activity to the exclusion of the other”). Thus, restrictions imposed upon\nfederal grants, are permissible in certain circumstances when simply “designed to ensure that the\nlimits of the federal program are observed.” Id.; but see Legal Services Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621077\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621077/legal-services-corp-v-velazquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">. The\nCourt characterized the case, not as one where the government seeks to suppress an idea, but rather\na “prohibition on a project grantee or its employees from engaging in activities outside of the\nproject’s scope.” Rust, 500 U.S. at 194. Thus, “when the Government appropriates public funds\nto establish a program it is entitled to define the limits of that program.” Id.\n        The Court focused on the fact that the program at issue involved a federal subsidy. Id. at 199\nn.5 (“First, Title X subsidies are just that, subsidies.”). Consequently, the complaining parties in\nRust could simply have declined to accept federal assistance. But, by voluntarily accepting federal\nmonies, “a recipient voluntarily consents to any restrictions placed on any matching funds or grant-\nrelated income.” Id.\n         Contrary to the majority’s insinuation here, the holding of Rust is not limitless and the\nSupreme Court itself explicitly stated as much. The Court stated that its holding was “not to suggest\nthat funding by the Government, even when coupled with the freedom of the fund recipients to speak\noutside the scope of the Government-funded project, is invariably sufficient to justify Government\ncontrol over the content of expression.” Id. at 199. Accordingly, the Court “has recognized that the\nexistence of a Government ‘subsidy,’ in the form of Government-owned property, does not justify\nthe restriction of speech in areas that have ‘been traditionally open to the public for expressive\nactivity.’” Id. at 199-200 (quoting United States v. Kokinda, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112486\"><a href=\"/opinion/112486/united-states-v-kokinda/\"><span class=\"volume\">497</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">720</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 726 (1990) (additional\ncitations omitted)). It proves too much to suggest, as the majority does, that any government\ninvolvement in speech turns that speech into government speech immune from First Amendment\nrestrictions. Thus, Tennessee’s license plate program falls not within the broader holding of Rust,\nbut within the Court’s caveat that the government, despite some involvement and despite providing\na subsidy of sorts (here, providing the license plates for the messages), may not restrict speech in\nareas it has designed to facilitate private speech.\n         The Court later resolved a similar question in Legal Services Corp. v. Velazquez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2621077\"><a href=\"/opinion/2621077/legal-services-corp-v-velazquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n<span class=\"page\">533</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001), where it addressed the Legal Services Corporation Act. The Act established the Legal\nServices Corporation whose “mission is to distribute funds appropriated by Congress to eligible\nlocal grantee organizations ‘for the purpose of providing financial support for legal assistance in\nnoncriminal proceedings or matters to persons financially unable to afford legal assistance.’” Id.\nat 536 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 2996b(a)). The grants provided contained a restriction that prohibited\n“legal representation funded by recipients of LSC moneys if the representation involves an effort\nto amend or otherwise challenge existing welfare law.” Id. at 536-37. The plaintiffs challenged the\nrestriction, arguing that it constituted impermissible viewpoint discrimination in violation of the\nFirst Amendment. The United States relied upon Rust v. Sullivan.\n        The Court noted that in Rust, it “did not place explicit reliance on the rationale that the\ncounseling activities of the doctors under Title X amounted to governmental speech” but “when\ninterpreting the holding in later cases, however, [the Court] ha[s] explained Rust on this\nunderstanding.” Id. at 541. The Court acknowledged that viewpoint based funding decisions can\nbe sustained where “the government is itself the speaker” or, “like Rust” where the government\n“used private speakers to transmit specific information pertaining to its own program.” Id. (citations\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.           Page 17\n\n\nand quotations omitted). The majority here latches onto the idea that Tennessee is using private\nspeakers to disseminate its Choose Life message — that is, the license plate program is “like Rust.”\nAs I have discussed above, however, Rust included a caveat that the majority fails to acknowledge.\nBecause of that failure, the majority does not properly characterize the specialty license plate\nprogram, and it does not properly consider whether the specialty license plate forum has been\ntraditionally open to the public for expressive activity. Rust, 500 U.S. at 199-200.\n         As the Supreme Court held, contrary to the majority’s belief here, “[n]either the latitude for\ngovernment speech nor its rationale applies to subsidies for private speech in every instance,\nhowever. As we have pointed out, ‘[i]t does not follow . . . that viewpoint-based restrictions are\nproper when the [government] does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors\nbut instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.’” Id. at 542\n(quoting Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834). Distinguishing Legal Services Corp. from Rust, the Court\nstated that “the salient point is that, like the program in Rosenberger, the LSC program was designed\nto facilitate private speech, not to promote a governmental message.” Id. So too, the salient point\nhere is that the license plate program was designed to facilitate private speech and to encourage a\ndiversity of viewpoints from private speakers, not to promote a governmental message. “The state\nwould argue that its viewpoint discrimination is permissible, because its license plates constitute\npure government speech. But the speech here only becomes speech by virtue of a citizen’s choice.”\nPlanned Parenthood of South Carolina v. Rose, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786724\"><a href=\"/opinion/786724/planned-parenthood-of-south-carolina-incorporated-renee-carter-v-b-boykin/\"><span class=\"volume\">373</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (4th Cir. 2004) (Wilkinson, J.,\nconcurring in the denial of rehearing en banc); see also Women's Emergency Network v. Bush, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781345\"><a href=\"/opinion/781345/womens-emergency-network-joshua-becker-v-jeb-bush-governor-in-his/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">937</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 945 n.9 (11th Cir. 2003) (“Furthermore, the program is structured to benefit the\norganizations that apply for and sponsor the plates, not the State itself. We fail to divine sufficient\ngovernment attachment to the messages on Florida specialty license plates to permit a determination\nthat the messages represent government speech.”). The majority dodges this point by looking at the\nlicense plate program as if the Choose Life license plate were the only plate in the entire state of\nTennessee. That way, the majority characterizes the Choose Life plate as an isolated instance of a\ngovernment message disseminated by private volunteers without considering the program as a\nwhole. If we think of each individual license plate in a vacuum, each one can be reasonably\ncharacterized as a government message. But, in order to properly characterize the specialty license\nplate program for First Amendment purposes, we cannot view each license plate in isolation. I\nsuggest that when opening one’s eyes to the license plate program as a whole, it is evident that the\ngovernment has created a program to encourage a diversity of views and messages from private\nspeakers.\n                                                  II.\n        With the preceding First Amendment doctrine issues in mind, I would hold that Tennessee\ncreated a forum to encourage a diversity of viewpoints from private speakers and therefore the\nConstitution requires viewpoint neutrality. In Rust, “the government did not create a program to\nencourage private speech but instead used private speakers to transmit specific information\npertaining to its own program.” Rosenberger, 515 U.S. at 833 (describing Rust). This is not a Rust\ncase despite the majority framing it as such. See also Sons of Confederate Veterans, 305 F.3d at 246\n(Luttig, J., respecting the denial of rehearing en banc) (“When a special license plate is purchased,\nit is really the private citizen who engages the government to publish his message, not the\ngovernment who engages the private individual to publish its message, as in cases like Rust v.\nSullivan[] and Wooley v. Maynard, for example.”).\n         The specialty license plate program itself has been open and available to a wide-range of\nprivate speakers to promote their own messages. The government’s participation in the process by\nproviding the actual license plate “in the form of Government-owned property, does not justify the\nrestriction of speech in areas that have been traditionally open to the public for expressive activity.”\nLegal Services Corp., 533 U.S. at 199-200 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.           Page 18\n\n\nMoreover, the government speech rationale does not apply whenever the government somehow has\nits hands or its money involved. “It does not follow . . . that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper\nwhen the [government] does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it favors but\ninstead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views from private speakers.” Id. at 542 (quoting\nRosenberger, 515 U.S. at 834); see also Sons of Confederate Veterans, 305 F.3d at 246 (Luttig, J.,\nrespecting the denial of rehearing en banc) (“No one, upon careful consideration, would contend\nthat, simply because the government owns and controls the forum, all speech that takes place in that\nforum is necessarily and exclusively government speech. Such would mean that even speech by\nprivate individuals in traditional public fora is government speech, which is obviously not the\ncase.”).\n         Finally, I also cannot subscribe to my colleagues’ melodramatic doomsday predictions about\nwhat would occur should we hold that the Constitution requires that Tennessee’s specialty license\nplate program be viewpoint neutral. The majority claims that viewpoint neutrality will require the\nstate to issue Ku Klux Klan and American Nazi Party specialty license plates. The simple answer\nin response to this suggestion is: Well of course that’s true if viewpoint neutrality means anything.\nThat is the same reason that Tennessee cannot prevent the KKK or Nazi Party from getting parade\nlicenses on the same terms as other groups and the same reason that Tennessee cannot prevent these\ngroups from espousing their views in the town squares.\n         Additionally, what my colleagues seem to miss, is the fact that Tennessee already authorizes\na Sons of Confederate Veterans license plate bearing the emblem of the Confederate Flag. To some,\nthe Confederate flag is a symbol of pride in one’s heritage. See Sons of Confederate Veterans, 305\nF.3d at 242 (Wilkinson, C.J., concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc) (noting that some people\n“view the Confederate flag as symbolically celebrating their line of descent”). To many others,\nhowever, the Confederate flag is a symbol that is just as offensive as the examples my colleagues\nput forth. See Storey v. Burns Int’l Security Services, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788494\"><a href=\"/opinion/788494/curtis-blaine-storey-v-burns-international-security-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">760</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 763 n.5 (3d Cir. 2004) (“One\nof the Confederacy’s key beliefs, as its Constitution readily asserted, was the interminable white\nman’s right to own black slaves. The battle flag of the Confederacy, then, [can be interpreted as]\nan exclusionary message that stigmatizes blacks as outsiders of the political community.”) (quoting\nAlexander Tsesis, The Problem of Confederate Symbols: A Thirteenth Amendment Approach, 75\nTemp. L. Rev. 539, 557 (2002) (footnotes omitted)); see also Dixon v. Coburg Dairy, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786359\"><a href=\"/opinion/786359/matthew-dixon-v-coburg-dairy-incorporated-equal-employment-advisory/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n<span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 822-24 (4th Cir. 2004) (en banc) (Gregory, J., concurring) (“Moreover, common sense suggests\nthat such problems are not readily resolved merely because symbols such as a Confederate flag may\nbe accompanied with slogans such as ‘heritage not hate,’ because a symbol’s significance often lies\n‘in the eye of the beholder.’ [T]o its supporters at the time of its creation as well as some proponents\ntoday . . . the Confederate flag undeniably represented, and represents, support for slavery, . . . and\nopposition to the Republic.”). The majority’s invocation of KKK and Nazi Party license plates is\na red herring.\n        Moreover, Tennessee can constitutionally maintain viewpoint neutral regulations, such as\nthe one already in place requiring at least 1,000 paid specialty plate orders before a plate is issued.\nSee Good News Club, 533 U.S. at 106-07 (discussing the difference between subject matter\nregulations and viewpoint discrimination). If the KKK and Nazi Party are able to pull together\n1,000 proud, dues-paying members, who wish to display such license plates on their cars, however,\nthey are entitled to do so the same as the Sons of Confederate Veterans, Penn State Alumni, antique\nafficionados, and members of pro-life and pro-choice organizations. There is also no evidence that\nthe doomsday scenario the majority predicts has occurred in the Fourth Circuit. The government\nhas not ceased to function. The state governments are not inundated with frivolous license plate\nproposals. The roads are not overcrowded with KKK license plates and license plates advocating\nreckless pet breeding.\n\fNo. 04-6393           Am. Civil Liberties Union of Tenn., et al. v. Bredesen, et al.         Page 19\n\n\n       In raising such examples as my colleagues do here, they seem to forget about the core\npurpose of the First Amendment. “[T]he First Amendment was not written for the vast majority of\n[Tennesseans]. It belongs to a single minority of one.” Sons of Confederate Veterans, 305 F.3d at\n242 (Wilkinson, C.J., concurring in the denial of rehearing en banc). That currently disfavored\nmessages are entitled to First Amendment protection should come as a shock to no one. In this case,\nthe Choose Life message could easily have been Pro-Choice and the positions of the parties\nreversed.
