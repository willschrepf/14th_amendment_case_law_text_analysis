For the\n\nreasons discussed below, the motions will be granted.\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\n        Deniece Jones (\"Mrs. Jones\"), Mary R. Johnson (\"Mrs. Johnson\"), and Antoine B. Jones,\n\nJr. (\"Jones Jr.\"), are the wife, mother-in-law, and son, respectively, of Antoine B. Jones, Sr.\n\n(\"Jones Sr.\"). Jones Sr. was one of several defendants in a criminal action brought in this court,\n\nand both the investigation of Jones Sr. 's activities and the prosecution of his criminal case are the\n\ncontext from which plaintiffs' claims arose:\n\n                  As alleged in the Indictment, from at least sometime in 2003 through October\n        24,2004, [Jones Sr.] and his co-conspirators acquired, repackaged, stored, processed,\n        sold, and redistributed large quantities of cocaine and cocaine base, in the District of\n        Columbia, the States of Maryland and Texas, the Republic of Mexico and elsewhere.\n        It is further alleged that Jones [Sr.] was the primary supplier of cocaine and cocaine\n        base to members of the organization in the District of Columbia and in the State of\n        Maryland.\n\n               As part of their investigation into the alleged conspiracy, law enforcement\n       agents utilized a number of investigative techniques, including surveillance,\n       informants, installation of an electronic tracking device on Jones [Sr.'s] vehicle,\n       search warrants issued to electronic communication service providers for text\n       messages to or from cellular telephones used by Jones [Sr.] and an alleged co-\n       conspirator, and a Title III wire intercept. The covert portion of the investigation\n       ended on October 24,2005, with searches pursuant to warrants and arrests. At that\n       time, drugs, drug paraphernalia, firearms, and significant quantities of cash were\n       seized from the homes of a number of the defendants, as well as from an alleged\n       \"safe house\" in Fort Washington, Maryland where 97 kilograms of cocaine, 3\n       kilograms of crack cocaine, and in excess of $800,000 was found.\n\nUnited States v. Jones, 451 F. Supp. 2d 71,73-74 (D.D.C. 2006), recons. denied, 511 F. SUpp. 2d\n\n74 (D.D.C. 2007). Jones Sr.'s first trial \"ended in his acquittal on seventeen counts of using a\n\ncommunication facility to facilitate a drug trafficking offense and a hung jury with respect to\n\nthirteen similar counts and one count of conspiracy to distribute or possess with intent to\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fdistribute a controlled substance.\" United States v. Jones, 511 F. Supp. 2d at 76. On retrial of\n\nthe remaining counts, Jones Sr. was found guilty on one court of conspiracy to distribute and\n\npossess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of\n\ncocaine base and was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. His appeal is pending before the\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n                               A. Deniece Jones, Civ. No. 07-1994\n\n       Mrs. Jones brings this civil rights action against the United States Department of Justice\n\n(\"DOJ\"), the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation (\"FBI\"), FBI Special Agents Stephanie Yanta\n\n(\"Yanta\"), Kellie O'Brien (\"O'Brien\") and Stephen Naugle (\"Naugle\"), Metropolitan Police\n\nDepartment Detectives Norma Horne (\"Horne\") and Steve Kirschner (\"Kirchner\"), and Assistant\n\nUnited States Attorneys Rachel Lieber (\"Lieber\") and John Geise (\"Geise\") under 42 U.S.c. §\n\n1983. CompI. at 1. She demands damages in the amount of $22,000,000. Id.\n\n       Mrs. Jones alleges that agents entered her house at 10870 Moore Street in Waldorf,\n\nMaryland, in the early morning hours of October 24, 2005 without a warrant, that agents\n\n\"snatched [her] and [her] family out of [their] beds, pointed guns at [their] heads and made [then]\n\nlay on the floor\" during the search. CompI. at 6. She states that the agents \"took over 40 boxes\n\nof ... personal, private, and business documents\" from the residence, id. at 7, and among these\n\nitems were records \"crucial to the continuance of [her] consulting business [and her] real estate\n\ninvestment business\" but wholly unrelated to the criminal investigation, id. at 4. She alleges that\n\nshe was \"severely handicapped in [her] ability to continue [her] business affairs\" without these\n\nrecords, and further alleges that her businesses were harmed because Special Agent Yanta \"used\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\finformation obtained through the wiretap to lie, harass, deceive, and interfere with [her]\n\nlegitimate business partners.\" Id. at 5.\n\n        According to Mrs. Jones, Lieber denied her \"the opportunity to visit with [her] husband ..\n\n. while he was being detained at the [D.C.] Jail,\" and also deprived her of opportunities to\n\ncommunicate with Jones Sr. by other means. CompI. at 4. This situation apparently arises from\n\nLieber's December 22,2005 request to the Warden of the D.C. Jail that Jones Sr. \"be placed in\n\nprotective custody, based on growing concerns that Jones [Sr.]\" was misusing his telephone\n\nprivileges in a way that undermined \"the safety of various individuals, and the integrity of the\n\ninvestigation\" of his criminal activities. Mem. ofP. & A. in Support of Fed. Defs.' Mot. to\n\nDismiss (\"Fed. Defs.' Mot.\"), Ex. C (December 22, 2005 Memorandum) at 1.\n\n        Mrs. Jones further alleges that Detective Kirchner and FBI agents are responsible for the\n\nplacement of a \"GPS tracking device on [her] personal auto,\" a Jeep Cherokee, \"in violation of a\n\nCourt Order\" issued in Jones Sr. 's criminal case. CompI. at 3; see id. at 5. She asserts that the\n\nagents installed the device after the order had expired. Id. at 9. In addition, she contended that\n\nAUSA Geise presented \"tainted GPS data\" at trial. Id. at 3.\n\n                                 B. Mary R. Johnson, Civ. No. 07-1995\n\n        Mrs. Johnson brings this action against the DOJ, the FBI, Yanta, Lieber and Geise under\n\n42 U.S.c. § 1983. CompI. at 1. She demands damages of$I,OOO,OOO for alleged violations of\n\nher constitutional rights. Id.\n\n        Mrs. Johnson rented the house at 12221 Brandywine Road in Brandywine, Maryland\n\nfrom her daughter and son-in-law, Jones Sr., and lived there with another daughter and two\n\ngrandchildren. CompI. at 3. On October 24,2005, Mrs. Johnson \"was awakened by the sound of\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fFBI agents and DC MPD detectives banging on [the] front door.\" Id. According to Mrs.\n\nJohnson, the agents \"were yelling threats,\" pointed shotguns at her, \"stormed the house and held\n\n[her], [her] daughter and two grandchildren (ages 10 and 11) at gunpoint.\" Id. The agents \"were\n\nlooking for [her] son-in-law (Antoine Jones, Sr.),\" id., who, according to Mrs. Johnson, neither\n\nresided at nor visited the Brandywine Road house, id. at 5. The agents \"proceeded to search the\n\nhouse and continued to hold [the occupants] at gunpoint,\" an event Mrs. Johnson described as a\n\nstressful ordeal for the household. Id. Since the events of October 24, 2005 and the subsequent\n\ndecline of Mrs. Jones' businesses, Mrs. Johnson has been supporting Mrs. Jones financially on\n\nher retirement income. Id. at 4.\n\n                            C. Antoine B. Jones, Jr., Civ. No. 07-1996\n\n        Jones Jr. brings this civil rights action against the United States Department of Justice,\n\nthe FBI, FBI Special Agents Yanta, O'Brien and Naugle, and against Assistant United States\n\nAttorneys Lieber and Geise under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and demands damages in the amount of\n\n$2,000,000. CompI. at 1.\n\n        Jones, Jr., formerly a student at Coppin State University in Baltimore, Maryland, states\n\nthat he resided at the Moore Street residence and was among the occupants awakened in the early\n\nmorning hours of October 24, 2005 and held at gunpoint while the search warrant was executed.\n\nCompI. at 4-5. He, too, alleges that the agents failed to present a warrant, that defendants seized\n\nitems unrelated to the criminal investigation and failed to return them upon request, thus\n\nhampering the continued operation of the family'S real estate and consulting businesses. Id. at 4.\n\nFurther, Jones Jr. alleges that Yanta unlawfully monitored his telephone calls, including\n\nconversations with his father, id. at 6-7, and that Lieber denied him an opportunity to visit or\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fotherwise contact his father while he was detained at the D.C. Jail, id. at 3. As a result of\n\ndefendants' action, Jones Jr. allegedly has experienced mental anguish and has dropped out of\n\nschool due to his inability to focus on his education. Id. at 3. Although Jones Jr. does not name\n\nHome as a defendant in his action, he faults her for misrepresenting his parents' ownership of\n\nreal estate, including an \"uninhabitable shell\" in Baltimore that was to be rehabilitated and made\n\navailable to him as \"a place close to school to live.\" Id. at 6. He alleges that the \"negative\n\npublicity surrounding this investigation\" prompted the contractor working on the Baltimore\n\nhouse to abandon the project. Id. Lastly, Jones Jr. challenges the validity of the search warrant\n\nfor text messages and the wiretap, and accuses Yanta of \"illegally eavesdropp[ing] on [his]\n\npersonal, business and private conversations with [his] father.\" Id. at 7.\n\n                                           D. All Plaintiffs\n\n        Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Johnson and Jones Jr. allege that the individual defendants have violated\n\nrules of professional conduct, have perjured themselves before the court, Grand Jury, or trial jury,\n\nand, with respect to AUSAs Lieber and Geise, have committed prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nSpecifically, plaintiffs claim that defendants failed to disclose evidence favorable to Jones Sr.'s\n\ndefense in violation of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and failed to tum over discovery\n\nmaterials from the items seized from the Moore Street residence. In addition, plaintiffs allege\n\nthat Yanta obtained the wiretap authorization and search warrants for text messages and for the\n\nMoore Street and Brandywine Road residences by deceiving the court with perjured testimony\n\nand erroneous information. All the plaintiffs allege that Detective Home falsely represented that\n\nthe Joneses owned six houses, apparently in an effort to create a negative perception of the\n\nplaintiffs. In addition, all the plaintiffs assert, vaguely, that Jones Sr. was wrongfully arrested,\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fand, as a result, they have suffered loss of consortium, that they were slandered, and that they\n\nhave experienced depression and stress.\n\n                                           DISCUSSION'\n\n                                 A. Dismissal Under Rule 12(b)(6)\n\n        The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure require that a complaint contain '''a short and plain\n\nstatement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief,' in order to 'give the\n\ndefendant fair notice of what the ... claim is and the grounds upon which it rests. '\" Bell Atl.\n\nCorp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, _, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1964 (2007) (quoting Conley v. Gibson,\n\n355 U.S. 41, 47 (1957)). A motion under Rule 12(b)(6) does not test a plaintiffs likelihood of\n\nsuccess on the merits; rather, it tests whether a plaintiff properly has stated a claim. See Scheuer\n\nv. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236 (1974). A court considering such a motion presumes the factual\n\nallegations of the complaint to be true and construes them liberally in the plaintiffs favor. See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Phillip Morris, Inc., 116 F. Supp. 2d 131, 135 (D.D.C. 2001). Although\n\n\"detailed factual allegations\" are not required to withstand a Rule 12(b)( 6) motion, a plaintiff\n\nmust offer \"more than labels and conclusions\" to provide \"grounds\" of \"entitle [ment] to relief.\"\n\nBell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S.Ct. at 1964-65. Thus, the complaint's \"[fJactual allegations\n\nmust be enough to raise a right to relief above the speculative level, on the assumption that all the\n\nallegations in the complaint are true (even if doubtful in fact).\" Id. at 1965 (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                F or purposes of this Memorandum Opinion, the court presumes, but does not\ndecide, that service of process on Yanta, Naugle, O'Brien, Lieber, Geise, Horne and Kirchner has\nbeen effected in both their official and individual capacities.\n\n                                                  7\n\f                                 B. Claims Under 42 Us.c. § 1983\n\n        The court notes at the outset that plaintiffs fail to state a claim against the DOJ, the FBI,\n\nYanta, O'Brien, Naugle, Lieber and Geise under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Section 1983 applies to state\n\nactors, not to federal agencies or employees. See, e.g., Williams v. United States of Am., 396\n\nF.3d 412, 415 (D.C. Cir. 2005).\n\n        These plaintiffs are proceeding pro se, and their complaints are entitled to a liberal\n\nconstruction. See Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 520 (1972). Accordingly, the court presumes\n\nthat plaintiffs also bring this action against Yanta, O'Brien, Naugle, Lieber and Geise in their\n\nindividual capacities under Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics,\n\n403 U.S. 388 (1971). \"A Bivens action is the federal analog to suits brought against state\n\nofficials under ... 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\" Marshall v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 518 F. Supp. 2d 190,\n\n193 (D.D.C. 2007) (citing Hartman v. Moore, 547 U.S. 250, 254 n.2 (2006) (internal citation\n\nomitted)). Under Bivens, a plaintiff has \"an implied private action for damages against federal\n\nofficers alleged to have violated [his] constitutional rights.\" Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534\n\nU.S. 61, 66 (2001).\n\n                                             C. Standing\n\n        Defendants argue that plaintiffs lack standing to bring \"any claims related to ... Jones\n\n[Sr.' s] trial. \" Fed. Defs.' Mot. at 16. The court concurs.\n\n       Article III of the Constitution limits the jurisdiction of federal courts to cases or\n\ncontroversies. U.S. CONST. art. III, § 2, cl. 1. \"The requisite elements of Article III standing are\n\nwell established: [a] plaintiff must allege personal injury fairly traceable to the defendant's\n\nallegedly unlawful conduct and likely to be redressed by the requested relief.\" Hein v. Freedom\n\n\n                                                   8\n\ffrom Religion Found., Inc., 551U.S. 587, _,127 S.Ct. 2553, 2562 (2007) (internal quotation\n\nand citation omitted). The injury plaintiffs allege \"must affect [them] in a personal and\n\nindividual way.\" Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 n.1 (1992). \"The focus is on\n\nthe qualifications and the status of the party seeking to bring his complaint before a federal court\n\nand not on the issues he wishes to have resolved.\" McKinney v. United States Dep't of the\n\nTreasury, 799 F.2d 1544, 1549 (Fed. Cir. 1986) (citing Simon v. Eastern Kentucky Welfare\n\nRights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 28 (1976)).\n\n       \"Plaintiffs were not targets, nor defendants, nor suspects, nor conspirators, nor\n\nparticipants; neither were they arrested for any involvement in any illegal or criminal activities.\"\n\nPIs.' Opp'n to Defs.' Mot. to Dismiss Compl. [#31] at 1. Plaintiffs, then, have suffered no injury\n\nin fact arising from any of the alleged constitutional violations attributed to these defendants.\n\nPlaintiffs were not defendants to the criminal action, and, therefore, the prosecutors' alleged\n\nmisconduct, failure to disclose information under Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal\n\nProcedure or to disclose Brady material, has caused them no harm. Nor have the plaintiffs\n\nsustained any injury arising from the FBI Special Agents' actions with respect to the search\n\nwarrants or wiretaps. Only Jones Sr. has standing to raise such claims, and, thus far, he has met\n\nwith no success. See Jones v. Lieber, 579 F. Supp. 2d 175, 181 (D.D.C. 2008) (dismissing\n\nBivens action against Lieber arising from his placement in administrative segregation because\n\nLieber enjoys qualified immunity from suit); Jones v.

Supp. 2d at 85-88 (denying Jones Sr.'s motion to\n\nsuppress evidence seized from Moore Street residence and denying in part motion to suppress\n\nevidence obtained from mobile tracking device).\n\n                                             D. Immunity\n\n                                        1. Sovereign Immunity\n\n        The federal defendants move to dismiss plaintiffs' claims against the DOJ, the FBI, and\n\nagainst Yanta, Naugle and O'Brien, Lieber and Geise in their official capacities on the ground\n\nthat the claims are barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Fed. Defs.' Mot. at 12-13.\n\n\"Official capacity suits ... generally represent only another way of pleading an action against an\n\nentity of which an officer is an agent,\" such that \"an official capacity suit is, in all respects other\n\nthan name, to be treated as a suit against the entity.\" Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159,165-66\n\n(1985). Accordingly, the court treats plaintiffs' claims as if they were brought against the United\n\nStates directly.\n\n        \"It is axiomatic that the United States may not be sued without its consent and that the\n\nexistence of consent is a prerequisite for jurisdiction.\" United States v. Mitchell, 463 U.S. 206,\n\n212 (1983). Such consent may not be implied, but must be \"unequivocally expressed.\" United\n\n\n                                                  10\n\fStates v. Nordic Village, Inc., 503 U.S. 30, 33-34 (1992). The United States has not waived its\n\nsovereign immunity for constitutional tort claims, see Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Meyer, 510 U.S.\n\n471,477 (1994) (stating that sovereign immunity precludes damage claims against the United\n\nStates government for constitutional violations brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act), and\n\nsovereign immunity extends to governmental agencies such as the DOJ and to their employees\n\nwhere such employees are sued in their official capacities, see id. at 483-86. \"Sovereign\n\nimmunity is jurisdictional in nature,\" id. at 475, and absent a waiver of sovereign immunity, the\n\ncourt lacks subject matter jurisdiction to entertain plaintiffs claims for money damages against\n\nthe DOJ, the FBI or against these federal government officials sued in their official capacities.\n\nSee id.; Clark v. Library a/Congress, 750 F.2d 89,101-02 (D.C. Cir. 1984); Meyer v. Reno, 911\n\nF. Supp. 11, 18 (D.D.C. 1996).\n\n                                    2. Prosecutorial Immunity\n\n       Liber and Geise argue that they are absolutely immune from suit under the doctrine of\n\nprosecutorial immunity. Fed. Defs.' Mot. at 17-19.\n\n       \"[I]n initiating a prosecution and in presenting the State's case, the prosecutor is immune\n\nfrom a civil suit under [42 U.S.C. § 1983].\" Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 431 (1976). The\n\nSupreme Court instructs that \"whether to present a case to a grand jury, whether to file an\n\ninformation, whether and when to prosecute, whether to dismiss an indictment against particular\n\ndefendants, which witnesses to call, and what other evidence to present\" are advocatory decisions\n\nprotected by immunity. Id. at 431 n.33; see Kalina v. Fletcher, 522 U.S. 118, 129 (1997)\n\n(concluding that a deputy prosecuting attorney's \"activities in connection with the preparation\n\nand filing of two of the three charging documents - the information and the motion for an arrest\n\n\n                                                11\n\fwarrant - are protected by absolute immunity,\" even if these documents contained inaccurate\n\nfactual statements); Burns v. Reed, 500 U.S. 478,492 (1991) (dismissing Sec. 1983 action\n\nagainst state prosecutor because his \"appearance in court in support of an application for a search\n\nwarrant and the presentation of evidence at that hearing are protected by absolute immunity\");\n\nPorter v. White, 483 F.3d 1294, 1305 n.8 (1Ith Cir. 2007) (\"Injury flowing from a procedural due\n\nprocess violation ... that results from a prosecutor's failure to comply with the Brady rule cannot\n\nbe redressed by a civil damages action against the prosecutor under [Sec.] 1983 because the\n\nprosecutor is immune from such liability.\" ), reh 'g denied, 254 Fed. Appx. 803 (11 th Cir. 2007),\n\ncert. denied, _ U.S. _, 128 S.Ct. 1259 (2008). \"The law of immunity in a Bivens claim against\n\na federal official mirrors that in a [S]ection 1983 claim against a state official.\" Moore v. Valder,\n\n65 F.3d 189, 192 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 820 (1996).\n\n        Lieber and Geise are \"insulate[d] ... from liability for [their] unquestionably advocatory\n\ndecision to prosecute\" Jones Sr., and their prosecutorial immunity \"also protects [them] from\n\nliability for allegedly concealing exculpatory evidence from the grand jury and for allegedly\n\nmanipulating evidence before the grand jury.\" Moore, 65 F .3d at 194. Similarly, their alleged\n\nfailure to disclose Brady material is advocatory conduct protected by absolute prosecutorial\n\nimmunity. Id.; see Carter v. Burch, 34 F.3d 257,262 (4th Cir. 1994) (holding that absolute\n\nimmunity protects a prosecutor from liability for failing to give defense counsel materially\n\nexculpatory evidence), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1150 (1995).\n\n       Assuming without deciding that plaintiffs have standing to pursue claims against AUSAs\n\nLieber and Geise for their alleged acts of misconduct in the course of the criminal proceedings\n\nagainst Jones Sr., their complaints fail to state claims upon which relief can be granted.\n\n\n                                                 12\n\f                                        3. Qualified Immunity\n\n        \"[G]overnment officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from\n\nliability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or\n\nconstitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald,\n\n457 U.S. 800, 818 (1982). Qualified immunity shield public officials \"from undue interference\n\nwith their duties and from potentially disabling threats of liability,\" id. at 806, and is designed to\n\ndispose of \"insubstantial lawsuits\" on a motion to dismiss, before the point at which the\n\ndefendant is required to engage in substantial litigation, id. at 808. Qualified immunity is \"an\n\nentitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens oflitigation.\" Mitchell v. Forsyth,472\n\nU.S. 511, 526 (1985). The privilege is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to\n\nliability; and ... is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\" Id.\n\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court \"repeatedly [has] stressed the importance of resolving immunity\n\nquestions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.\" Hunter v. Bryant, 502 U.S. 224, 227 (1991)\n\n(per curiam).\n\n        By definition, qualified immunity is not absolute. However, \"[ a] plaintiff who seeks\n\ndamages for violation of constitutional or statutory rights may overcome the defendant official's\n\nqualified immunity only by showing that those rights were clearly established at the time of the\n\nconduct at issue.\" Davis v. Scherer, 468 U.S. 183, 197 (1984). The court considers, \"then, this\n\nthreshold question: Taken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts\n\nalleged show [that] the [defendant's] conduct violated a constitutional right?\" Saucier v. Katz,\n\n533 U.S. 194,201. If the facts alleged do not show a constitutional violation, the inquiry ends.\n\nJd. at 207.\n\n\n                                                   13\n\f                                              a. Lieber\n\n        \"[W]hen a prosecutor performs duties which are not intimately associated with the\n\njudicial process, only qualified immunity is granted.\" Carter, 34 F.3d at 262. With respect to\n\nLieber's involvement in Jones Sr.'s placement in administrative segregation, this court already\n\nhas determined that Lieber is protected by qualified immunity, Jones v. Leiber, 579 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 181, and there is no need to revisit the matter in the context of this case. Neither Mrs. Jones,\n\nJones Jr. nor Jones Sr. has a constitutionally protected right to visitation, and Lieber's alleged\n\ninvolvement with Jones Sr. 's placement in segregation is not actionable. See Kentucky Dep 't of\n\nCarr. v. Thompson, 490 U.S. 454, 165 (1989) (concluding that prison regulations allowing\n\nofficials to exclude certain visitors without a hearing \"do not establish a liberty interest entitled\n\nto the protections of the Due Process Clause\"); Block v. Rutherford, 468 U.S. 576, 588 (1984)\n\n(concluding that a \"blanket prohibition [on contact visits with family members and friends] is an\n\nentirely reasonable, nonpunitive response to the legitimate security concerns\" of the Los Angeles\n\nCounty Central Jail).\n\n                                   b. Yanta, O'Brien and Naugle\n\n       Defendants argue that qualified immunity protects FBI Special Agents Yanta, O'Brien\n\nand Naugle from suit on the ground that plaintiff cannot show that their constitutional rights were\n\nviolated. Fed. Defs.' Mot. at 12-15.\n\n       Generally, plaintiffs' claims against Yanta, O'Brien and Naugle arise from their having\n\nobtained and executed search warrants for the Moore Street and Brandywine Road houses,\n\nobtained authorization to monitor telephone calls and text messages, and installed a GPS tracking\n\ndevice on the Joneses' Jeep Cherokee, presumably in violation of their Fourth Amendment\n\n\n                                                  14\n\frights. The Fourth Amendment states that \"no Warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause,\n\nsupported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the\n\npersons or things to be seized.\" U.S. CONST. amend. IV.\n\n        The court already has determined that \"Y anta' s supporting affidavits [were] sufficient to\n\nestablish probable cause for the text message warrants.\" Jones, 451 F. Supp. 2d at 77. Her \"29-\n\npage August 10th Affidavit, which served as the foundation upon which subsequent affidavits\n\nsubmitted in support of wiretap and search warrant applications were based, reference [d]\n\ninformation provided by three confidential sources who had first-hand knowledge of [Jones Sr.'s]\n\nillicit activity\" and \"describe[ d] at length the results of surveillance, searches, debriefings, review\n\nof electronic data, and other investigative techniques.\" Id. Accordingly, the court concluded that\n\n\"the affidavit clearly establishe[ d] probable cause to believe that Jones [Sr.] operated a\n\nconspiracy to distribute narcotics.\" Id. Further, the court found that Yanta's two subsequent\n\naffidavits in support of the government's application for a wiretap \"satisfie[ d] the applicable\n\nprobable cause requirements,\" id. at 81, and summarily rejected an argument that the government\n\nfailed to \"minimize\" intercepted conversations to protect matters \"pertaining to [the targets']\n\njoint business ventures as well as social or other matters unrelated to a drug conspiracy,\" id. at\n\n83.\n\n       With respect to the search of the Joneses' Moore Street house, the court has determined\n\nthat \"[t]he warrant application was supported by a 47-page affidavit sworn to by [FBI] Special\n\nAgent Yanta,\" id. at 85, and that it \"clearly establishe[d] probable cause to search,\" id. at 86.\n\nFurther, because the court rejected Jones Sr.'s argument that the warrant was rendered invalid by\n\nthe investigating agents' alleged failure to present him, Mrs. Jones or Jones Jr. with \"a copy of\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fthe warrant with attachment to inform them of the scope of the warrant,\" and their alleged failure\n\nto leave a copy of the warrant on the premises. Id. Mrs. Jones' signature was \"affixed to each\n\npage of a five-page receipt for goods taken during the search,\" and \"[t]herefore, at the very least,\n\nJones was provided with a copy of the warrant and a receipt at the conclusion of the search.\" Id.;\n\nsee Fed. Defs.' Mot., Ex. B (Search Warrant and Receipt for Property Seized).\n\n        The government placed \"an electronic device - a Global Positioning System (\"GPS\") -\n\n.. on [Jones Sr.'s] Jeep Cherokee\" pursuant to a court Order. Jones, 451 F. Supp. 2d at 87. In\n\nthe course of the search of the Moore Street residence, agents found the Jeep Cherokee parked in\n\nthe garage. Id. The court recognized that the affidavit supporting the original search warrant\n\n\"specifically noted the Jeep Cherokee as having been observed parked at the Moore Street\n\naddress\" and that Jones Sr. had been observed driving the Jeep. Id. The court found that the\n\nsearch of the Jeep was authorized by the original search warrant and that data obtained from the\n\nGPS device while the vehicle was in public spaces was admissible at Jones Sr.'s trial. Id. at 88.\n\nOnly \"the data obtained from the GPS device when the Jeep Cherokee was parked in the garage\n\nadjoining the Moore Street property [was] suppressed.\" Id.\n\n        Based on the court's prior evidentiary rulings in the course of Jones Sr.' s criminal\n\nproceedings, Yanta, O'Brien and Naugle did not violate plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nAbsent factual allegations to withstand these defendants' assertion of qualified immunity,\n\nplaintiffs' claims must fail.\n\n                                      c. Kirchner and Horne\n\n        The court presumes that Kirchner's argument for dismissal of plaintiffs' complaints is a\n\ntruncated argument asserting qualified immunity. Relying wholly on the court's ruling on Jones\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fSr. 's motion to suppress evidence obtained from the GPS device on the Jeep Cherokee, see\n\nJones, 451 F. Supp. 2d at 87-88, Kirchner argues that his actions did not violate plaintiffs'\n\nconstitutional rights. See Mem. of P. & A. in Support of Def. Steve Kirchner's Mot. to Dismiss\n\nPI. 's CompI. at 3-4. Specifically, he argues that \"the government is not required to obtain a\n\nsearch warrant to install a GPS or similar device on a vehicle to monitor it in public, id. at 4, and,\n\ntherefore, \"placement of the device did not violate [Mrs. Jones'] Fourth Amendment or any other\n\nconstitutional rights.\" Id. The court concurs. Kirchner cannot be held liable unless he has\n\nviolated a \"clearly established ... constitutional right[] of which a reasonable person would have\n\nknown,\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 818, and the court's prior conclusion that installation\n\nof the device is justified, as was the use of data obtained from the GPS device while Jeep\n\nCherokee was in public space, precludes plaintiffs' civil rights claims.\n\n        Insofar as plaintiffs allege that Kirchner and Home testified falsely, the court concludes\n\nthat they are absolutely immune from suit. See Briscoe v. LaHue, 460 U.S. 325, 345-46 (1983)\n\n(holding that 42 U.S.C. § 1983 does not authorize a convicted person to assert a claim for\n\ndamages against a police officer for giving perjured testimony at his criminal trial on the ground\n\nthat absolute immunity protects any witness from civil liability based on his testimony in a\n\njudicial proceeding); Rogers v. Johnson-Norman, 466 F. Supp. 2d 162, 175 (2006) (dismissing\n\nclaim against defendant who allegedly presented false petition for a civil protection order and\n\ngave perjured testimony at a criminal trial in the Superior Court on the ground that witness'\n\ntestimony is absolutely privileged).\n\n\n\n\n                                                 17\n\f                                            CONCLUSION\n\n        Notwithstanding plaintiffs' efforts to distance themselves and their claims from Jones\n\nSr.' s criminal trial and his civil cases filed in this court, plaintiffs lack standing to bring any\n\nclaims arising from the investigation of Jones Sr. 's criminal activities or from the criminal\n\nproceedings against him. The court further concludes that the doctrine of sovereign immunity\n\nbars their claims against the DOJ and the FBI, and their claims against Yanta, O'Brien, Naugle,\n\nLeiber, and Geise in their individual capacities. Because the facts plaintiffs allege do not\n\nestablish a constitutional violation with respect to the search warrants or wiretaps, they cannot\n\novercome the qualified immunity which protects Yanta, O'Brien, Naugle, Leiber, Kirshner and\n\nMoore from civil liability. Accordingly, the court grants defendants' motions to dismiss and\n\ndismisses this action in its entirety. An Order accompanies this Memorandum Opinion.\n\n\n\n\nDATE:\n\n\n\n\n                                                   18\n\f",

For the\n\nreasons discussed below, the motions will be granted.\n\n                                          BACKGROUND\n\n        Deniece Jones (\"Mrs. Jones\"), Mary R. Johnson (\"Mrs. Johnson\"), and Antoine B. Jones,\n\nJr. (\"Jones Jr.\"), are the wife, mother-in-law, and son, respectively, of Antoine B. Jones, Sr.\n\n(\"Jones Sr.\"). Jones Sr. was one of several defendants in a criminal action brought in this court,\n\nand both the investigation of Jones Sr. 's activities and the prosecution of his criminal case are the\n\ncontext from which plaintiffs' claims arose:\n\n                  As alleged in the Indictment, from at least sometime in 2003 through October\n        24,2004, [Jones Sr.] and his co-conspirators acquired, repackaged, stored, processed,\n        sold, and redistributed large quantities of cocaine and cocaine base, in the District of\n        Columbia, the States of Maryland and Texas, the Republic of Mexico and elsewhere.\n        It is further alleged that Jones [Sr.] was the primary supplier of cocaine and cocaine\n        base to members of the organization in the District of Columbia and in the State of\n        Maryland.\n\n               As part of their investigation into the alleged conspiracy, law enforcement\n       agents utilized a number of investigative techniques, including surveillance,\n       informants, installation of an electronic tracking device on Jones [Sr.'s] vehicle,\n       search warrants issued to electronic communication service providers for text\n       messages to or from cellular telephones used by Jones [Sr.] and an alleged co-\n       conspirator, and a Title III wire intercept. The covert portion of the investigation\n       ended on October 24,2005, with searches pursuant to warrants and arrests. At that\n       time, drugs, drug paraphernalia, firearms, and significant quantities of cash were\n       seized from the homes of a number of the defendants, as well as from an alleged\n       \"safe house\" in Fort Washington, Maryland where 97 kilograms of cocaine, 3\n       kilograms of crack cocaine, and in excess of $800,000 was found.\n\nUnited States v. Jones, 451 F. Supp. 2d 71,73-74 (D.D.C. 2006), recons. denied, 511 F. SUpp. 2d\n\n74 (D.D.C. 2007). Jones Sr.'s first trial \"ended in his acquittal on seventeen counts of using a\n\ncommunication facility to facilitate a drug trafficking offense and a hung jury with respect to\n\nthirteen similar counts and one count of conspiracy to distribute or possess with intent to\n\n\n                                                  2\n\fdistribute a controlled substance.\" United States v. Jones, 511 F. Supp. 2d at 76. On retrial of\n\nthe remaining counts, Jones Sr. was found guilty on one court of conspiracy to distribute and\n\npossess with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine and 50 grams or more of\n\ncocaine base and was sentenced to a term of life imprisonment. His appeal is pending before the\n\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\n\n                               A. Deniece Jones, Civ. No. 07-1994\n\n       Mrs. Jones brings this civil rights action against the United States Department of Justice\n\n(\"DOJ\"), the Federal Bureau oflnvestigation (\"FBI\"), FBI Special Agents Stephanie Yanta\n\n(\"Yanta\"), Kellie O'Brien (\"O'Brien\") and Stephen Naugle (\"Naugle\"), Metropolitan Police\n\nDepartment Detectives Norma Horne (\"Horne\") and Steve Kirschner (\"Kirchner\"), and Assistant\n\nUnited States Attorneys Rachel Lieber (\"Lieber\") and John Geise (\"Geise\") under 42 U.S.c. §\n\n1983. CompI. at 1. She demands damages in the amount of $22,000,000. Id.\n\n       Mrs. Jones alleges that agents entered her house at 10870 Moore Street in Waldorf,\n\nMaryland, in the early morning hours of October 24, 2005 without a warrant, that agents\n\n\"snatched [her] and [her] family out of [their] beds, pointed guns at [their] heads and made [then]\n\nlay on the floor\" during the search. CompI. at 6. She states that the agents \"took over 40 boxes\n\nof ... personal, private, and business documents\" from the residence, id. at 7, and among these\n\nitems were records \"crucial to the continuance of [her] consulting business [and her] real estate\n\ninvestment business\" but wholly unrelated to the criminal investigation, id. at 4. She alleges that\n\nshe was \"severely handicapped in [her] ability to continue [her] business affairs\" without these\n\nrecords, and further alleges that her businesses were harmed because Special Agent Yanta \"used\n\n\n\n\n                                                 3\n\finformation obtained through the wiretap to lie, harass, deceive, and interfere with [her]\n\nlegitimate business partners.\" Id. at 5.\n\n        According to Mrs. Jones, Lieber denied her \"the opportunity to visit with [her] husband ..\n\n. while he was being detained at the [D.C.] Jail,\" and also deprived her of opportunities to\n\ncommunicate with Jones Sr. by other means. CompI. at 4. This situation apparently arises from\n\nLieber's December 22,2005 request to the Warden of the D.C. Jail that Jones Sr. \"be placed in\n\nprotective custody, based on growing concerns that Jones [Sr.]\" was misusing his telephone\n\nprivileges in a way that undermined \"the safety of various individuals, and the integrity of the\n\ninvestigation\" of his criminal activities.

CompI. at 3; see id. at 5. She asserts that the\n\nagents installed the device after the order had expired. Id. at 9. In addition, she contended that\n\nAUSA Geise presented \"tainted GPS data\" at trial. Id. at 3.\n\n                                 B. Mary R. Johnson, Civ.

She demands damages of$I,OOO,OOO for alleged violations of\n\nher constitutional rights. Id.\n\n        Mrs. Johnson rented the house at 12221 Brandywine Road in Brandywine, Maryland\n\nfrom her daughter and son-in-law, Jones Sr., and lived there with another daughter and two\n\ngrandchildren. CompI. at 3. On October 24,2005, Mrs. Johnson \"was awakened by the sound of\n\n\n                                                  4\n\fFBI agents and DC MPD detectives banging on [the] front door.\" Id. According to Mrs.\n\nJohnson, the agents \"were yelling threats,\" pointed shotguns at her, \"stormed the house and held\n\n[her], [her] daughter and two grandchildren (ages 10 and 11) at gunpoint.\" Id. The agents \"were\n\nlooking for [her] son-in-law (Antoine Jones, Sr.),\" id., who, according to Mrs. Johnson, neither\n\nresided at nor visited the Brandywine Road house, id. at 5. The agents \"proceeded to search the\n\nhouse and continued to hold [the occupants] at gunpoint,\" an event Mrs. Johnson described as a\n\nstressful ordeal for the household. Id. Since the events of October 24, 2005 and the subsequent\n\ndecline of Mrs. Jones' businesses, Mrs. Johnson has been supporting Mrs. Jones financially on\n\nher retirement income. Id. at 4.\n\n                            C. Antoine B. Jones, Jr., Civ.

CompI. at 1.\n\n        Jones, Jr., formerly a student at Coppin State University in Baltimore, Maryland, states\n\nthat he resided at the Moore Street residence and was among the occupants awakened in the early\n\nmorning hours of October 24, 2005 and held at gunpoint while the search warrant was executed.\n\nCompI. at 4-5. He, too, alleges that the agents failed to present a warrant, that defendants seized\n\nitems unrelated to the criminal investigation and failed to return them upon request, thus\n\nhampering the continued operation of the family'S real estate and consulting businesses. Id. at 4.\n\nFurther, Jones Jr. alleges that Yanta unlawfully monitored his telephone calls, including\n\nconversations with his father, id. at 6-7, and that Lieber denied him an opportunity to visit or\n\n\n                                                 5\n\fotherwise contact his father while he was detained at the D.C. Jail, id. at 3. As a result of\n\ndefendants' action, Jones Jr. allegedly has experienced mental anguish and has dropped out of\n\nschool due to his inability to focus on his education. Id. at 3. Although Jones Jr. does not name\n\nHome as a defendant in his action, he faults her for misrepresenting his parents' ownership of\n\nreal estate, including an \"uninhabitable shell\" in Baltimore that was to be rehabilitated and made\n\navailable to him as \"a place close to school to live.\" Id. at 6. He alleges that the \"negative\n\npublicity surrounding this investigation\" prompted the contractor working on the Baltimore\n\nhouse to abandon the project. Id. Lastly, Jones Jr. challenges the validity of the search warrant\n\nfor text messages and the wiretap, and accuses Yanta of \"illegally eavesdropp[ing] on [his]\n\npersonal, business and private conversations with [his] father.\" Id. at 7.\n\n                                           D. All Plaintiffs\n\n        Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Johnson and Jones Jr. allege that the individual defendants have violated\n\nrules of professional conduct, have perjured themselves before the court, Grand Jury, or trial jury,\n\nand, with respect to AUSAs Lieber and Geise, have committed prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nSpecifically, plaintiffs claim that defendants failed to disclose evidence favorable to Jones Sr.'s\n\ndefense in violation of Brady v.

In addition, plaintiffs allege\n\nthat Yanta obtained the wiretap authorization and search warrants for text messages and for the\n\nMoore Street and Brandywine Road residences by deceiving the court with perjured testimony\n\nand erroneous information. All the plaintiffs allege that Detective Home falsely represented that\n\nthe Joneses owned six houses, apparently in an effort to create a negative perception of the\n\nplaintiffs. In addition, all the plaintiffs assert, vaguely, that Jones Sr. was wrongfully arrested,\n\n\n                                                   6\n\fand, as a result, they have suffered loss of consortium, that they were slandered, and that they\n\nhave experienced depression and stress.\n\n                                           DISCUSSION'\n\n                                 A.

Qualified immunity is \"an\n\nentitlement not to stand trial or face the other burdens oflitigation.\" Mitchell v. Forsyth,472\n\nU.S. 511, 526 (1985). The privilege is \"an immunity from suit rather than a mere defense to\n\nliability; and ... is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial.\" Id.\n\nAccordingly, the Supreme Court \"repeatedly [has] stressed the importance of resolving immunity\n\nquestions at the earliest possible stage in litigation.\" Hunter v.

Yanta, O'Brien and Naugle\n\n       Defendants argue that qualified immunity protects FBI Special Agents Yanta, O'Brien\n\nand Naugle from suit on the ground that plaintiff cannot show that their constitutional rights were\n\nviolated. Fed. Defs.' Mot. at 12-15.\n\n       Generally, plaintiffs' claims against Yanta, O'Brien and Naugle arise from their having\n\nobtained and executed search warrants for the Moore Street and Brandywine Road houses,\n\nobtained authorization to monitor telephone calls and text messages, and installed a GPS tracking\n\ndevice on the Joneses' Jeep Cherokee, presumably in violation of their Fourth Amendment\n\n\n                                                  14\n\frights. The Fourth Amendment states that \"no Warrant shall issue, but upon probable cause,\n\nsupported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the\n\npersons or things to be seized.\" U.S. CONST. amend. IV.\n\n        The court already has determined that \"Y anta' s supporting affidavits [were] sufficient to\n\nestablish probable cause for the text message warrants.\" Jones, 451 F. Supp. 2d at 77. Her \"29-\n\npage August 10th Affidavit, which served as the foundation upon which subsequent affidavits\n\nsubmitted in support of wiretap and search warrant applications were based, reference [d]\n\ninformation provided by three confidential sources who had first-hand knowledge of [Jones Sr.'s]\n\nillicit activity\" and \"describe[ d] at length the results of surveillance, searches, debriefings, review\n\nof electronic data, and other investigative techniques.\" Id. Accordingly, the court concluded that\n\n\"the affidavit clearly establishe[ d] probable cause to believe that Jones [Sr.] operated a\n\nconspiracy to distribute narcotics.\" Id. Further, the court found that Yanta's two subsequent\n\naffidavits in support of the government's application for a wiretap \"satisfie[ d] the applicable\n\nprobable cause requirements,\" id. at 81, and summarily rejected an argument that the government\n\nfailed to \"minimize\" intercepted conversations to protect matters \"pertaining to [the targets']\n\njoint business ventures as well as social or other matters unrelated to a drug conspiracy,\" id. at\n\n83.\n\n       With respect to the search of the Joneses' Moore Street house, the court has determined\n\nthat \"[t]he warrant application was supported by a 47-page affidavit sworn to by [FBI] Special\n\nAgent Yanta,\" id. at 85, and that it \"clearly establishe[d] probable cause to search,\" id. at 86.\n\nFurther, because the court rejected Jones Sr.'s argument that the warrant was rendered invalid by\n\nthe investigating agents' alleged failure to present him, Mrs. Jones or Jones Jr. with \"a copy of\n\n\n                                                  15\n\fthe warrant with attachment to inform them of the scope of the warrant,\" and their alleged failure\n\nto leave a copy of the warrant on the premises. Id. Mrs. Jones' signature was \"affixed to each\n\npage of a five-page receipt for goods taken during the search,\" and \"[t]herefore, at the very least,\n\nJones was provided with a copy of the warrant and a receipt at the conclusion of the search.\" Id.;\n\nsee Fed. Defs.' Mot., Ex. B (Search Warrant and Receipt for Property Seized).\n\n        The government placed \"an electronic device - a Global Positioning System (\"GPS\") -\n\n.. on [Jones Sr.'s] Jeep Cherokee\" pursuant to a court Order. Jones, 451 F. Supp. 2d at 87. In\n\nthe course of the search of the Moore Street residence, agents found the Jeep Cherokee parked in\n\nthe garage. Id. The court recognized that the affidavit supporting the original search warrant\n\n\"specifically noted the Jeep Cherokee as having been observed parked at the Moore Street\n\naddress\" and that Jones Sr. had been observed driving the Jeep. Id. The court found that the\n\nsearch of the Jeep was authorized by the original search warrant and that data obtained from the\n\nGPS device while the vehicle was in public spaces was admissible at Jones Sr.'s trial. Id. at 88.\n\nOnly \"the data obtained from the GPS device when the Jeep Cherokee was parked in the garage\n\nadjoining the Moore Street property [was] suppressed.\" Id.\n\n        Based on the court's prior evidentiary rulings in the course of Jones Sr.' s criminal\n\nproceedings, Yanta, O'Brien and Naugle did not violate plaintiffs' Fourth Amendment rights.\n\nAbsent factual allegations to withstand these defendants' assertion of qualified immunity,\n\nplaintiffs' claims must fail.\n\n                                      c. Kirchner and Horne\n\n        The court presumes that Kirchner's argument for dismissal of plaintiffs' complaints is a\n\ntruncated argument asserting qualified immunity. Relying wholly on the court's ruling on Jones\n\n\n                                                 16\n\fSr. 's motion to suppress evidence obtained from the GPS device on the Jeep Cherokee, see\n\nJones, 451 F. Supp. 2d at 87-88, Kirchner argues that his actions did not violate plaintiffs'\n\nconstitutional rights. See Mem. of P. & A. in Support of Def. Steve Kirchner's Mot. to Dismiss\n\nPI. 's CompI. at 3-4. Specifically, he argues that \"the government is not required to obtain a\n\nsearch warrant to install a GPS or similar device on a vehicle to monitor it in public, id. at 4, and,\n\ntherefore, \"placement of the device did not violate [Mrs. Jones'] Fourth Amendment or any other\n\nconstitutional rights.\" Id. The court concurs. Kirchner cannot be held liable unless he has\n\nviolated a \"clearly established ... constitutional right[] of which a reasonable person would have\n\nknown,\" Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 818, and the court's prior conclusion that installation\n\nof the device is justified, as was the use of data obtained from the GPS device while Jeep\n\nCherokee was in public space, precludes plaintiffs' civil rights claims.\n\n        Insofar as plaintiffs allege that Kirchner and Home testified falsely, the court concludes\n\nthat they are absolutely immune from suit.

The court further concludes that the doctrine of sovereign immunity\n\nbars their claims against the DOJ and the FBI, and their claims against Yanta, O'Brien, Naugle,\n\nLeiber, and Geise in their individual capacities. Because the facts plaintiffs allege do not\n\nestablish a constitutional violation with respect to the search warrants or wiretaps, they cannot\n\novercome the qualified immunity which protects Yanta, O'Brien, Naugle, Leiber, Kirshner and\n\nMoore from civil liability. Accordingly, the court grants defendants' motions to dismiss and\n\ndismisses this action in its entirety.
