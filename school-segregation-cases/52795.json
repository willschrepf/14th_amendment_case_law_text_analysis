Carney, District Judge, Presiding\n\n                     Argued and submitted November 8, 2013\n                              Pasadena, California\n\nBefore: FISHER and CLIFTON, Circuit Judges, and SINGLETON, Senior\nDistrict Judge.**\n\n      Plaintiffs Jo.R. and his parents appeal the district court’s attorney fee award,\n\nmade pursuant to 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(B) of the Individuals with Disabilities\n\n\n      *      This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not\nprecedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.\n\n      **     The Honorable James K. Singleton, Senior United States District\nJudge for the District of Alaska, sitting by designation.\n\fEducation Act (“IDEA”), 20 U.S.C. §§ 1400-1482. Plaintiffs contend that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion in awarding them attorney fees in the amount of\n\n$51,440.63, which is substantially less than the $398,747.50 that they requested.\n\nWe have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, and we affirm in part, reverse in part\n\nand remand.\n\n                                          I.\n\n      The district court calculated the lodestar amount to be $205,762.50,\n\napproximately 51 percent of plaintiffs’ fee request. The district court found that\n\nmany of the hours requested for particular tasks were excessive and unnecessary in\n\nlight of the experience of the lawyer requesting the fees. Plaintiffs challenge each\n\nreduction in this appeal. While reasonable judges might differ regarding the\n\nappropriateness of many of these reductions, we conclude that all but three fall\n\nwithin the district court’s broad discretion. See 20 U.S.C. § 1415(i)(3)(F)(iii).\n\n                                          A.\n\n      The district court abused its discretion by reducing hours claimed by lead\n\nattorney Maureen Graves for reviewing and researching the Language! curriculum\n\nfrom 57.8 hours to 10.8 hours. The district court based this reduction on its finding\n\nthat a lawyer of lead counsel’s experience should have been able to do the work in\n\nless time, presumably because she should have been familiar with the curriculum\n\n\n                                          2\n\ffrom her practice. The court did not find that the work was not done; rather,\n\ncounsel was penalized for inefficiency. We have cautioned district courts that\n\n“[b]y and large, the court should defer to the winning lawyer’s professional\n\njudgment as to how much time he was required to spend on the case; after all, he\n\nwon, and might not have, had he been more of a slacker.” Moreno v. City of\n\nSacramento, 534 F.3d 1106, 1112 (9th Cir. 2008). Particularly because most of the\n\nadministrative hearing focused on the Language! curriculum, the district court\n\nabused its discretion by reducing the hours spent reviewing that curriculum.\n\n                                         B.\n\n      The district court abused its discretion by entirely denying fees claimed for\n\ntime spent preparing plaintiffs’ closing brief. Plaintiffs asked for 60.9 hours. The\n\nALJ criticized plaintiffs’ counsel for attempting to avoid the page limitation the\n\nALJ had imposed by using extensive single-spaced footnotes on most of the pages;\n\nhowever, the ALJ did not strike the brief or impose any penalty beyond a\n\nreprimand. The district court found plaintiffs’ requested hours excessive because\n\nof this reprimand, explaining that “no reimbursable time [was] warranted” due to\n\nthe brief’s purported “impropriety.” It was the ALJ and not the court who\n\nreviewed the brief, however, and the ALJ apparently found it sufficiently\n\npersuasive to rule in plaintiffs’ favor on some issues, despite any excessive\n\n\n                                          3\n\ffootnoting. The court gave no other justification for finding the requested hours\n\nexcessive, and even if it had, the appropriate remedy would have been to reduce\n\nthe hours to a reasonable number, not to zero. We therefore conclude that the\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by declining to award fees as a sanction for\n\nsubmitting a brief with excessive footnotes to the ALJ.\n\n                                          C.\n\n      Plaintiffs requested 19.3 hours for reviewing and annotating transcripts. The\n\ndistrict court abused its discretion by eliminating these hours. In deciding that it\n\nwas “unclear whether these transcripts relate to the hearing or are somehow\n\nconnected to [lead counsel]’s work in this case,” the court ignored or overlooked\n\ncounsel’s explanation that she reviewed the transcripts of the administrative\n\nhearing to prepare for appeal proceedings because, in her experience, such\n\ntranscripts are often materially inaccurate. Moreover, the amount of time counsel\n\nspent on this task was not excessive because the proceedings before the ALJ\n\ninvolved technical testimony from many witnesses during an 11-day hearing\n\nspread over a great deal of time. See Moreno, 534 F.3d at 1112.\n\n      All of the hours identified in sections I(A)-(C), supra, involved the work of\n\nlead counsel. The district court fixed her market rate at $500 per hour. The\n\nimproperly reduced 127.2 hours at $500 per hour yields $63,600, which, when\n\n\n                                           4\n\frestored to the lodestar calculated by the district court, adds up to a revised lodestar\n\nof $269,362.50.\n\n                                          II.\n\n      The district court abused its discretion by reducing the lodestar by 75\n\npercent to reflect limited success. This case involved a number of issues\n\nconcerning the education Jo.R. was receiving from a single defendant school\n\ndistrict. All of the issues involved Jo.R.’s treatment plan. Assuming, without\n\ndeciding, that each of the issues was a separate claim, plaintiffs substantially\n\nprevailed on 2 of their 19 claims. The district court concluded that “[p]laintiffs\n\nachieved a modest amount of success in comparison to the scope of their claims”\n\nbecause “[p]laintiffs sought relief on nineteen different issues and failed explicitly\n\non seventeen.”\n\n      That conclusion, however, ignored the ALJ’s statement that the “focal point”\n\nof the entire case was Jo.R.’s language curriculum, an issue upon which plaintiffs\n\nsubstantially prevailed. The ALJ further noted that plaintiffs introduced little\n\nevidence on many of the other issues. Therefore, although plaintiffs’ counsel did\n\nnot segregate hours by issue, the record does not support a finding that 75 percent\n\nof the time counsel spent on this case was devoted exclusively to issues that were\n\nrejected. See Odima v. Westin Tucson Hotel, 53 F.3d 1484, 1499 (9th Cir. 1995).\n\n\n                                           5\n\f      It is clear that the district court was convinced that the lodestar in this case\n\nshould be reduced but was unable to give justifications beyond those we have\n\nnoted that are not permissible under this court’s precedent. A district court\n\nconvinced that the number of hours claimed were excessive or that the lodestar\n\ngenerated an excessive award may impose a “haircut” of no more than 10 percent\n\nwithout further explanation. See Gonzalez v. City of Maywood, 729 F.3d 1196,\n\n1203 (9th Cir. 2013). We therefore adjust the revised lodestar by deducting 10\n\npercent, or $26,936.25.\n\n      The judgment of the district court is affirmed in part and reversed in part.\n\nWe remand with instructions to award plaintiffs $242,426.25 in attorney fees and\n\nto determine an appropriate fee award to plaintiffs for hours spent on this appeal.\n\nPlaintiffs may recover their costs on appeal. See Fed. R. App. P. 39(a)(4).\n\n      AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.\n\n\n\n\n                                           6\n\f",
